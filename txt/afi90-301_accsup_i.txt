                                          Chapter 1

       THE INSPECTOR GENERAL COMPLAINTS RESOLUTION PROGRAM

Section 1A—The Air Force Inspector General System

1.1. Overview. This chapter covers the background, authority, and purpose of the IG system. It
defines the roles and responsibilities of IGs and other offices and agencies involved in the IG
process. It also covers the organization of the IG system throughout the Air Force, Air Force
Reserve, and Air National Guard.
1.2. The IG System. The IG system used throughout the total force is based on the concept that
IGs serve as an extension of their commander by acting as his/her eyes and ears to be alert to
issues affecting the organization. IGs primarily serve their commanders and their assigned
organizations both by executing the complaint resolution process and by proactively training all
members of the organization about IG processes and fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) issues. A
successful complaint resolution program is designed to enhance the organization‘s discipline,
readiness, and warfighting capability. IGs use fact-finding methodologies to seek out systemic
issues affecting the organization.
   1.2.1. The effectiveness of the IG system requires the mutual cooperation of all Air Force
   IGs.
   1.2.2. IGs assist Airmen of all ranks, family members, civilian employees, retirees, and other
   civilians. These individuals represent the IG‘s constituency, and IGs bolster the chain of
   command by performing a problem-solving mission in support of this constituency.
   1.2.3. All IGs must maintain a clear distinction between being an extension of the
   commander and their duty to serve as fair, impartial, and objective fact-finders and problem
   solvers. They must be sufficiently independent so those complainants requesting IG help
   will continue to do so, even when they feel the commander may be the problem.
   Commanders must support this clear distinction for their IGs to be effective.
   1.2.4. The IG system support process includes operational planning, training, administration,
   personnel, and resource management. These processes facilitate the execution of complaint
   resolution processes to all Air Force leaders.
   1.2.5. Operational readiness is integrated into all phases of the IG system. IGs provide
   complaint resolution services at all times.
1.3. Relationships Within the IG System. IGs may request and are expected to provide
support to other IGs within the total force IG system. The IG system is not a stovepipe system
because IGs work for their respective commanders. All IGs who work matters under the
Complaint Resolution Program (CRP) must adhere to IG policies. SAF/IG maintains the
integrity of the IG system through policy, training, and oversight.

Section 1E—The Installation IG Program

1.20. Installation IG Program Background.
      1.20.1. The concept of appointing a separate, full-time installation IG was implemented to
      remove any perceived conflict of interest, lack of independence, or apprehension by Air

      Authorization Act.
      1.20.2. To sustain a trustworthy relationship with Air Force personnel, the installation IG
      must be independent (see paragraphs 1.2.3 and 1.27.3). Air Force personnel must be free
      from any form of retribution, retaliation, or reprisal for communicating with the installation
      IG.

      FWA Programs. Any activities that may diminish the effectiveness of IGs in the
      performance of their complaints resolution and FWA responsibilities are not acceptable.
      1.24.2. The IG position will not be combined with another position in the organization. See
      AFI 90-201 for guidance on inspection related duties. Inspection related responsibilities and
      duties defined in AFI 90-201 are not considered additional duties for the IG and staff.
      1.24.3. IGs must not be constrained by additional duties that detract from their primary
      responsibilities. Therefore, IGs and IG staff members must not be:
         1.24.3.1. Assigned any duties (such as Director of Staff) that subsequently disqualify
         them from conducting an unbiased analysis of complaints against functions or activities
         of the wing or installation to which they are assigned or organizations for which they
         have IG functional responsibility.
         1.24.3.2. Appointed as an IO to conduct a CDI. (NOTE: Air Force Reserve and Air
         National Guard IGs may be appointed to conduct CDIs at installations other than their
         own.)

these key terms.
1.26. How the IG System Helps the Commander.
      1.26.1. Complaints help commanders discover and correct problems affecting the
      productivity and morale of assigned personnel. Resolving the underlying cause of a
      complaint may prevent more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as reduced
      performance, accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of resources.
      1.26.2. Even though allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or investigation
      findings may reveal systemic, morale, or other problems impeding efficiency and mission
      effectiveness.
1.27. Roles of the IG in Relation to the Commander.
      1.27.1. The roles of the IG are to:
         1.27.1.1. Be the ―eyes and ears‖ of the commander; be alert for and inform the
         commander of matters indicative of systemic, morale, or other problems impeding
         efficiency and mission effectiveness.

       1.27.1.2. Keep the commander informed of potential areas of concern as reflected by
       trends based on analysis of complaint data.
       1.27.1.3. Function as the ombudsman, fact-finder, and honest broker in the resolution of
       complaints.
       1.27.1.4. Educate and train commanders and members of the base populace on their
       rights and responsibilities in regard to the Air Force IG system. See paragraph 1.36.2.4

       1.27.1.5. Assist commanders in preventing, detecting, and correcting fraud, waste, abuse,
       and gross mismanagement.
   1.27.2. To fulfill these roles, the IG must be an integral member of the commander‘s staff
   and have unimpeded access to the commander. Commanders must ensure their IG‘s
   authority, duties, and responsibilities are clearly delineated.
   1.27.3. The independence of the IG must be firmly established and supported to overcome
   any perceived lack of autonomy that would discourage potential complainants and preclude
   disclosures of wrongdoing from being brought to the attention of the IG. IG offices should
   be located in areas that foster open and unfettered access to everyone and which are not in
   proximity to the commander's office.
1.28. Commander Support of the IG System. To support the IG system, commanders should
ensure their IGs have the resources necessary to intake, process, maintain, and protect material

      gather, analyze, and record relevant information about matters of primary interest to
      command authorities.
      1.30.2. Commanders should:
         1.30.2.1. Consult with the staff judge advocate (SJA) before initiating a CDI.

         for commander-directed investigative reports unless the allegations pertain to senior
         officials. Refer to Chapter 4.
         1.30.4.2. The commander must ensure all information subject to the Privacy Act and
         references to third-party information are protected.
      1.30.5. Commander‘s reporting requirements for CDIs:
         1.30.5.1. Report to SAF/IGS, through the applicable MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA,

                                             Chapter 2

                                  FILING AN IG COMPLAINT

Section 2A—Filing a Complaint

2.1. Policy for Filing an IG Complaint.
      2.1.1. Air Force military and civilian employees (appropriated and non-appropriated fund)
      have a duty to promptly report FWA or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy,
      procedures, instructions, or regulations; an injustice; abuse of authority, inappropriate
      conduct, or misconduct (as defined by this instruction); and a deficiency or like condition,
      through appropriate supervisory channels, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through
      an established grievance channel. FWA complaints may also be reported to the AFAA,
      AFOSI, Security Forces, or other proper authority. All military and civilian employees must
      promptly advise the AFOSI of suspected criminal misconduct or fraud.
      2.1.2. Complainants should attempt to resolve complaints at the lowest possible level
      (appropriate for the circumstances) using supervisory channels before addressing them to
      higher-level command channels or the IG.
      2.1.3. When complaints are addressed to a higher level (the President, Congress, IG DoD,
      CSAF, SAF/IG, etc.), the IG office tasked with the complaint will determine the appropriate
      level or organization for redress of the complaint. The complaint may be referred back to the
      complainant‘s local IG for resolution.
      2.1.4. When complainants send the same or a similar complaint to several levels of the
      government, the highest level with which the complainant corresponds will reply, unless
      determined otherwise by the higher level office or other directives. If it is decided that a
      lower level will respond, the IG must inform the complainant they will not receive separate
      replies from various levels of the government and inform the complainant which level will
      provide the response.
2.2. Approval of Official Travel to Submit Complaints.
      2.2.1. Complainants normally do not travel at government expense to present a complaint
      unless authorized. If authorized, funding will come from the complainant‘s unit. Such travel
      may only be funded IAW the Joint Travel Regulation.
      2.2.2. Requests to travel to meet with SAF/IG personnel must be approved by SAF/IGS or
      SAF/IGQ prior to unit approval of the TDY request.
2.3. Complaints Not Appropriate for the IG System.
      2.3.1. The IG CRP should not be used for matters normally addressed through other
      established grievance or appeal channels, unless there is evidence those channels misha ndled
      the matter or process.
         2.3.1.1. If a policy directive or instruction provides a specific means of redress or appeal
         of a grievance, complainants must exhaust those procedures before filing an IG
         complaint.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 45


       2.3.1.2. Complainants must provide relevant evidence that the process was mishandled
       or handled prejudicially before the IG will process a complaint of mishandling. Mere
       dissatisfaction or disagreement with the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance
       or appeal process is not a sufficient basis to warrant an IG investigation.
   2.3.2. Table 3.6 outlines agencies with established programs for the redress of various
   complaints. The table is not all-inclusive. Matters without specific grievance channels or not
   mentioned in Table 3.6 may generally be referred back to the chain of command.

Section 2B—Complainant’s Rights and Responsibilities

2.4. Complainant’s Rights. Complainants have the right to:
   2.4.1. File an IG complaint at any level without going through their supervisory channel.
   2.4.2. File a complaint with an IG without fear of reprisal.
   2.4.3. Request withdrawal of their IG complaint in writing; however, IGs may still examine
   the issues at their discretion and treat it as a third-party complaint.
   2.4.4. Request the next higher-level IG review their complaint within 90 days of receiving
   the IG response. However, simply disagreeing with the action taken will not justify
   additional IG review. The request for review must:
       2.4.4.1. Be in writing and give specific reasons why the complainant believes the
       original IG complaint resolution was not valid or adequate.
       2.4.4.2. Provide additional information to justify a higher-level review on previously
       considered issues.
   2.4.5. Submit complaints anonymously.
   2.4.6. Submit a complaint if they reasonably believe inappropriate conduct has occurred, or a
   wrong or violation of law, policy, procedure, instruction, or regulation has been committed,
   even if the complainant is not the wronged party or was not affected by the alleged violation.
   Individuals may also submit a complaint on behalf of another individual. Those who do so
   are known as third-party complainants.
       2.4.6.1. Third-party complainants are not entitled to a response regarding the substance
       of alleged wrongs not directly affecting them. Third-party complainants are only entitled
       to have receipt of their complaint acknowledged.
       2.4.6.2. Third-party complainants are not entitled to personal information or other
       information not releasable to the public under the FOIA/Privacy Act (PA). To release
       personal information concerning a first-party individual (complainant, subject), a written
       and signed consent to release private information must be acquired from the affected
       individual. If the individual does not give their consent to release first-party information
       to a third party, IGs must inform the requestor that personal privacy information will not
       be released. See Chapter 14 for additional release information.
   2.4.7. Request whistleblower protection under 10 USC 1034 if they believe the y have been
   reprised against for making or planning to make a protected communication. Refer to
   Chapter 6 for more specific information regarding reprisal complaints.
 46                                                        AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      2.4.8. File complaints with allegations that have been previously investigated and reviewed
      by a higher-level IG office. If the current complaint does not provide new information or
      evidence that justifies further investigation, it will be dismissed.
      2.4.9. Address their complaints to the installation IG if their unit does not have an appointed
      IG.
2.5. Complainant’s Responsibilities.
      2.5.1. Under normal circumstances, complainants must submit IG complaints within 60 days
      of learning of the alleged wrong. Normally, complainants will prepare, sign, and submit to
      an IG an AF IMT 102 to ensure awareness of the Privacy Act and their responsibilities.
      Complainants making verbal or telephonic complaints should normally return a completed
      AF IMT 102 to an IG within 5 calendar days. Complaints not submitted on an AF IMT 102
      should be drafted following the same format outlined in Table 2.1, steps 3,4 and 5.
      2.5.2. Time limit: Complainants must submit IG complaints in a timely manner in order for
      the IG to resolve them effectively. An IG is not required to look into a complaint if the
      complainant has failed to present the matter to an IG within 60 days of learning of the alleged
      wrong. IG complaints not reported within 60 days may seriously impede the gathering of
      evidence and testimony. The IG may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature of the alleged
      wrong and the passage of time, there is reasonable probability insufficient information can be
      gathered to make a determination, and/or no special Air Force interests exist to justify
      investigating the matter. See paragraph 3.26 and Table 3.12.
         2.5.2.1. IGs may accept and refer complaints that exceed the above time requirements if
         the complaint is of special Air Force interest or the complainant is able to demonstrate
         that he/she was unable to meet the time standards due to unforeseen or extraordinary
         circumstance, and such circumstance justifies the delay.
      2.5.3. Cooperation. Complainants must cooperate with IGs and IOs by providing factual and
      relevant information regarding the issues and/or allegations (unless exercising Article 31,
      UCMJ, or Fifth Amendment rights). If complainants do not cooperate, the IG may dismiss
      the complaint if the lack of information leaves the IG unable to conduct a thorough complaint
      analysis.
         2.5.3.1. Complainants will normally be allowed at least 5 calendar days to provide
         requested information prior to the IG dismissing their complaint. If a complaint is
         dismissed, and complainant later files the same complaint issues, the complaint will be
         accepted as a new complaint (i.e., with a new ACTS number).
      2.5.4. Truthfulness. Complainants providing information to the Air Force IG system must
      understand they are submitting official statements within official Air Force channels.
      Therefore, they remain subject to punitive action (or adverse administrative action) for
      knowingly making false statements and for submitting other unlawful communications.
      Additionally, unless other protected by law, any information complainants provide to the IG
      is subject to release during or after the IG inquiry.
2.6. Removing Complaints from the IG System.
      2.6.1. Commanders have no authority to take a complaint submitted to an IG for disposition
      and resolve it through a commander-directed inquiry or investigation.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               47


   2.6.2. Complainants may elect to withdraw a complaint, in writing, from IG channels and
   then submit it to supervisory channels for resolution. However, IGs may elect to address the
   complaint if the allegations identify a recognizable wrong or a violation of law, policy,
   procedure, or regulation. EXCEPTION: Allegations of reprisal, restriction, or IMHE
   referral must be resolved within IG channels.
   2.6.3. IGs will generally refer complaints that belong in another Air Force investigative or
   grievance channel. See paragraph 3.16 and Table 3.6 for assistance in determining if a
   complaint belongs in other channels.
   2.6.3. (ACC) The IG may assist the complainant in resolving issues when there is no
   evidence or assertion of wrongdoing to allow the complainant to refocus on the assigned
   mission.
      2.6.3.1. Inform the complainant of the alternatives and advise the complainant it would
      be appropriate to submit their complaint in that channel.
      2.6.3.2. IGs may refer a complaint (e.g., AF IMT 102, written/typed complaint, etc.)
      even if the complainant disagrees with the referral. Such referrals may include, but are
      not limited to: allegations of crimes, notice of danger to people and/or property,
      personnel matters, and problems with potential impact on national defense.
2.7. Requests to Delay Command Action.
   2.7.1. IGs cannot delay command and personnel actions regarding a complainant based on
   the filing of an IG complaint or the initiation of an IG investigation. Filing an IG complaint
   will not delay or prevent completion of command actions such as reassignment, retirement,
   discharge, nonjudicial punishment, etc., unless deemed necessary by appropriate
   commanders.
   2.7.2. IGs do not have the authority to place individuals on administrative hold or delay a
   command or personnel action. The authority to place an individual on administrative hold or
   to delay command action rests only with commanders and the respective personnel center.
   Therefore, complainants must submit such requests through their respective commander or
   servicing personnel office.

Section 2C—How to File an IG Complaint

2.8. Procedures for Filing an IG Complaint.
   2.8.1. Complainants may file complaints anonymously through an IG FWA Hotline, the
   Defense Hotline, or directly with an IG.
   2.8.2. Complainants should follow the steps in Table 2.1 and complete an AF IMT 102, IG
   Personal and Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaint Registration, prior to filing a complaint
   with the IG office.
   2.8.3. Complaints not submitted on an AF IMT 102 should be drafted following the same
   format outlined in Table 2.1, steps 3, 4 and 5. Complaints not submitted in the outlined
   format may cause a delay in the processing of the complaint and the determination of IG
   action.
 48                                                   AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


Table 2.1. How to File a Complaint.
 Step Action
 1    If unable to resolve the complaint in supervisory channels, review Table 3.6 to
      determine if the complaint should be filed with the IG. Complainants should file a
      complaint if they reasonably believe inappropriate conduct has occurred or a violation
      of law, policy, procedure, instruction, or regulation has been committed.
 2    Complete the personnel data information on an AF IMT 102 (typed or printed
      legibly), the preferred format for submitting complaints so it may easily be
      reproduced.
 3    Briefly outline the facts and relevant background information related to the issue or
      complaint on the AF IMT 102 in chronological order.
 4    List the allegations of wrongdoing BRIEFLY, in general terms, and provide
      supporting narrative detail including chronology and documents later when
      interviewed. Allegations should be written as bullets and should answer:
      1. What violation was committed?
      2. What law, regulation, procedure, or policy was violated?
      3. When did the violation occur?
      4. Who committed the violation?
 5    If more than 60 days have elapsed since the alleged conduct occurred, the complaint
      should also include:
      1. The date the complainant first became aware of the conduct.
      2. How the complainant became aware of the conduct.
      3. Why the complainant delayed filing the complaint.
 6    Submit the completed AF IMT 102 to any Air Force IG and set up a follow-on
      meeting to discuss the complaint.
 7    If an IG is named in the complaint, contact the next higher-level IG.

                              MANAGING IG COMPLAINTS

Section 3A—Introduction to the Complaints Resolution Process

3.1. Overview. This chapter instructs IGs at every organizational level how to manage and
process IG complaints and discusses the complaint lifecycle from receipt through resolution.
The Air Force endorses a proactive oversight and follow-up system that achieves the high
program standards described in the President‘s Council on Integrity and Efficiency, Quality
Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General.
3.2. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: allegation, complainant,
complaint, complaint analysis, complaint resolution process (CRP), confidentiality, contact,
referral completion report (RCR), self-investigation, thoroughness, and timeliness. Refer to
Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms.
3.3. Protection of Information. A key goal of the Inspector General CRP is to facilitate a
complaints resolution environment that promotes confidence in Air Force leadership. Assurance
that an individual's privacy will be safeguarded to the maximum extent practicable encourages
voluntary cooperation and promotes a climate of openness in identifying issues requiring
leadership intervention. Specifically, the IG has the responsibility to safeguard the personal
identity and complaints of individuals seeking assistance or participating in an IG process, such
as an investigation. While this does not mean communications made to an IG are privileged or
confidential, it does mean disclosure of those communications (and the identity of the
communicant) should be strictly limited to an official, need-to-know basis. This information
should not be disclosed unless required by law or regulation, when necessary to take adverse
action against a subject, or with the approval of The Inspector General (SAF/IG), or IAW
paragraph 3.3.2. See Chapter 14 for guidance on the Air Force IG Records Release Program.
Persons who request anonymity or who express a concern about confidentiality must be
informed of this policy. All personnel reviewing or processing IG information shall be briefed
on this policy. All IGs and staff members are obligated to protect IG information when their
tenure of service as an IG is completed. The following guidance applies to all personnel at all
organizational levels:
   3.3.1. IG personnel must protect the identity of all complainants as described in paragraph
   3.3. At the time the IG receives a complaint, they will advise the complainant:
       3.3.1.1. If a complaint is more appropriate for other channels, the IG will refer the
       complaint.
           3.3.1.1.1. Even if the complainant disagrees with referring the complaint, the
           complaint may still be referred for action.
              3.3.1.1.1.1. The referral may require release of the complainant‘s identity so the
              referral agency can effectively work to resolve the issue.
   3.3.2. IGs/IOs should not divulge a complainant's name to a subject or to any witness, or
   permit a witness to read the complaint without the appointing authority's written permission
   (reference paragraph 3.40.8).
 50                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


         3.3.2.1. IOs will advise witnesses in an investigation of the general nature of the
         allegations under investigation. To the maximum extent possible, the IO should protect
         the identifying information of complainants, subjects, and suspects.
         3.3.2.2. IOs will advise subjects or suspects of the allegation(s) under investigation. The
         IO will read the allegations verbatim to the subject/suspect.
      3.3.3. Complainants and witnesses must be made aware that any information they divulge to
      the IG or IO, with the exception of their name, may be usaed during follow-on interviews
      with other witnesses.
3.4. Policy on Managing IG Complaints.
      3.4.1. IG complaints will be managed in a manner that facilitates efficient and effective
      mission accomplishment. IG complaints will be reported and resolved with due diligence
      and in a timely manner. IGs at all organizational levels must document all complaints and
      adhere to the process timeline outlined in Table 3.1. Complaints within the purview of the
      IG CRP should be addressed at the lowest appropriate level, including high-level complaints
      (e.g., those sent to the President, Congress, DoD, SECAF, SAF/IG).
         3.4.1.1. This ensures the higher-level IGs remain unbiased and are available to review
         any rebuttals or appeals of the lower-level investigations or actions.
      3.4.2. IGs should resolve complaints at the lowest possible level, but may elevate complaints
      when appropriate. IGs must elevate complaints when self-investigation or the perception of
      self-investigation is an issue.
      3.4.3. Complaints against senior officials will be processed IAW Chapter 4.
      3.4.4. Complaints against colonels (or civilian equivalents) will be processed IAW Chapter
      5.
3.5. The Complaint Resolution Process. To assist IGs in managing complaints, the following
table describes actions required to resolve a complaint from receipt through investigation to
closure. The process contains 14 steps and is divided into 3 phases: complaint analysis,
investigation, and quality review. The goal is for 95 percent of all cases to be resolved according
to the guidelines described in Table 3.1. For example, the goal for completing dismissal cases is
29 days (contact, 5 days; conduct complaint analysis, 20 days; close case, 4 days). For Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve IGs: To meet the goal to resolve all case matters
promptly, Phase 1 actions need to be completed no later than the end of the next Unit Training
Assembly (UTA) after receipt of the complaint. Timelines for congressional inquiries are
different than listed here. See Chapter 9 for more information.
3.5. (ACC)The Complaint Resolution Process. The ACC goal is to complete the investigation
within 90 calendar days, up to and including the MAJCOM level review (Phase 3, Step 13,
CRP). The investigating officer (IO) must update ACTS at least every 30 workdays during the
investigation to track and identify problem areas in the investigation process. The note will
outline how the investigation is progressing and the reason(s) it is exceeding the timelines (if
applicable).

Table 3.6. Note 2: The IG may assist the complainant by conducting research and contacting
the appropriate agency to solve the issue and allow the complainant to refocus on the assigned

mission.
Table 3.11. Step 3. Do not refer the complaint directly to the commander of the subject when
he/she is assigned to an installation/organization different than the IG receiving the complaint.
Transfer the complaint, along with the analysis to the IG at the same level and command as the
subject or where the alleged wrongs occurred. That IG will refer the complaint to the
appropriate commander.

Section 3B—Step 1: Contact (< 5 Days)

3.6. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: complaint, complaint clarification,
contact, and senior official. Refer to Attachme nt 1 for the definition of these key terms.
3.7. Policy on Receiving Complaints. Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve
IGs receive and process complaints from any source (including anonymous), via any medium,
regarding operations, organizations, functions, and personnel. IGs can accept telephonic and
verbal complaints, but every attempt should be made to obtain a written complaint. For
telephonic and verbal complaints, IGs should obtain adequate information for clarification and
follow-up actions. "IGs will enter all contact/complaint data into ACTS within 5 calendar days
of initial contact (or by the conclusion of the next UTA for the ARC). Reporting procedures in
paragraphs 3.55 and 3.56 of this instruction must be followed until the case is closed.
 52                                                     AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


3.8. Complaint Clarification Procedures. If upon initial receipt of the complaint the IG
identifies the need for more information from the complainant, the IG will conduct a complaint
clarification using the procedures in Table 3.2. Fully document the contact in ACTS.

Table 3.2. How to Conduct a Complaint Clarification.
 Step    Action
 1       Find a private location if the complaint is made in person.
 2       If the complainant has not yet done so, ask them to complete the complainant portion
         of an AF IMT 102.
 3       Find out if the complaint was previously filed with another agency or individual.
 4       If the complainant has not talked to their supervisory channel, find out why. Unless
         circumstances warrant otherwise, encourage the complainant to attempt resolution in
         supervisory channels first. Explain why this is the preferred approach (faster
         resolution, commanders have the authority to remedy the situation, etc.). Explain if
         the matter is clearly a commander issue and not an IG issue, the complaint should be
         referred to supervisory channels regardless of the desires of the complainant (refer to
         paragraph 3.3.1.1).
 5       Determine if the individual has sought assistance from an appropriate support agency
         (for example military personnel section, finance, or equal opportunity office).
         Advise them to go to that agency if they have not.
 6       If it has been more than 60 days since the complainant learned of the alleged wrong,
         inform them the complaint may be dismissed. Explain that complaints are reviewed
         for dismissal on a case-by-case basis and the length of time since the alleged event
         can seriously impede the effectiveness of an investigation. Ask the complainant why
         they delayed filing the complaint and if there were compelling circumstances.
 7       Ask the complainant to clarify his/her allegations and provide a chronology, as
         necessary. Generally, a statement of fact must identify the nature and substance of
         the alleged wrong with sufficient detail and facts to enable the IG to ascertain what
         potential violations may have been committed. The complainant should also identify
         the source (for example, the documents or names of witnesses who can corroborate
         the allegations); the date; and the act or condition that occurred or existed at that
         date. If the complainant alleges reprisal or restriction, explain the whistleblower
         protection afforded by 10 USC 1034.
 8       Advise the complainant any records or documents he/she provides to the IG become
         part of an IG record and are not returnable.
 9       Ask the complainant what remedy is being sought.
 10      Explain the steps involved in processing an IG complaint and/or conducting an
         investigation.
 11      Inform the complainant when you expect to get back to him/her (nor mally this will
         be an interim reply).
3.9. Administrative Procedures for Processing Complaints. IGs will log all contacts in
ACTS and follow the administrative procedures in Table 3.3 to process complaints made to their
office.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                   53


Table 3.3. Processing Complaints.
 Step Action
 1    Log complaint into the ACTS database (NOTE: ACTS Case Notes should contain a
      complete description of the facts, sequence of IG actions taken, record of
      persons/organizations contacted, and date contact was made.)
 2    Mark documents ―COMPLAINANT PROVIDED‖ on each page. Scan and load as an
      attachment to the ACTS case file and put a check mark in the ―complainant provided‖
      box.
 3    Contact complainant in writing, by telephone, or in person within 5 duty days to
      acknowledge receipt (unless received directly from complainant). Provide an interim
      response to the complainant 60 days after receipt of the complaint and every 60 days
      (For ANG/Air Force Reserve: every other UTA weekend) thereafter until a final
      response is provided. Log the interim response in ACTS on the Suspenses Tab and add
      a case note.

Section 3C—Step 2: Analysis (< 20 Days) Conducting a Complaint

3.10. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: appointing authority, assist,
complaint analysis, criminal offense, dismiss, frivolous allegation, investigating officer (IO),
investigation, referral, and transfer. Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key
terms.
3.11. Policy for Complaint Analysis. In each case, IGs at every organizational level will
conduct a thorough complaint analysis to determine the appropriate complaint resolution
strategy. A complaint analysis is always required and results in: assistance, dismissal,
investigation, referral or transfer of the complaint. Complaints containing multiple assertions
may require multiple resolution strategies, i.e., referral, dismissal and/or investigation. For every
contact, document the rationale for the selected resolution strategy in ACTS (see template at
Attachment 2).
   3.11.1. When contacts have different resolution strategies (i.e. assist, referral, and dismissal),
   it may be appropriate to create an additional ACTS entry for each resolution strategy.
   3.11.2. When transferring portions of contacts/complainants to different MAJCOMs, it may
   be appropriate to create an additional ACTS entry for the transfer.
3.12. Conducting a Complaint Analysis. A complaint analysis is a preliminary review of
assertions and evidence to determine the potential validity and relevance of the issues to the Air
Force and to determine what action, if any, is necessary within IG, supervisory, or other
channels.
   3.12.1. A properly framed allegation is a factual proposition to be proved or disproved
   during an investigation, and which if true, would constitute wrongdoing. If an allegation
   cannot be properly framed, then an investigation is inappropriate. Framed allegations must
   contain the following:
       3.12.1.1. When did the alleged violation occur?
       3.12.1.2. Who committed the alleged violation?
 54                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


         3.12.1.3. What violation was committed?
         3.12.1.4. What law, regulation, procedure, standard, or policy was violated?
         3.12.1.5. A properly framed allegation is constructed as follows:
When (on or about 10 January 2004), Who (Major John A. Smith, XX Sq/CC) did what (gave a
referral EPR to SrA William Tell), in violation of what standard (in reprisal for a protected
communication in violation of 10 USC 1034).
      3.12.2. Do not combine allegations to simplify the process. If the complainant asserts
      multiple violations on different occasions, make each of these a separate allegation. The
      same rule applies when the complaint contains multiple subjects, occurrences, or standards.
      3.12.3. Refer to paragraph 6.6 when conducting a complaint analysis into allegations of
      reprisal.
3.13. Complaint Analysis Procedures. Use the complaint analysis procedures in Table 3.4 to
determine appropriate complaint resolution strategy.

Table 3.4. How to Conduct a Complaint Analysis.
 Step Action
 1        Determine if the issues fall under the category of Special Interest Complaints in Table
          3.5. If allegation meets the criteria for a Special Interest Complaint, follow the
          directions in Table 3.5. If the allegation does not meet the criteria, return to this
          table.
 2        Determine if the complaint is appropriate for IG channels. See Table 3.6.
 3        If issues are appropriate for IG action but should be addressed by another IG, see
          paragraph 3.19 and Table 3.7. If appropriate for transfer, follow the guidance in
          paragraph 3.20 and Table 3.8.
 4        If the allegation is not IG related and there is no allegation of a violation or
          wrongdoing, provide assistance as appropriate IAW paragraph 3.22 and Table 3.9.
          However, if the IG completing the case analysis determines the allegation warrants an
          inquiry by the referral agency, see step 5 of this table to refer the allegation.
 5        If allegation is not IG related and there is an allegation of a violation or wrongdoing,
          follow the guidance in paragraph 3.24 and Table 3.10. If referral is appropriate
          resolution strategy, follow the guidance in paragraph 3.25 and Table 3.11.
 6        Determine whether the issues are appropriate for dismissal. See Table 3.12. If
          appropriate for dismissal, follow the guidance in Table 3.13.
 7        Determine whether the issues asserted are appropriate for investigation. See
          paragraph 3.30.
 8        Document the rationale for the selected complaint resolution strategy. The complaint
          analysis documentation letter in Attachment 2 provides a template for documenting a
          non-reprisal complaint analysis. For reprisal complaint analysis cases, use
          Attachment 19 or 20.
 9        Document appropriate complaint information in ACTS, either by case note or as an
          attachment. See paragraph 3.14.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               55


3.14. Docume nting a Complaint Analysis. IGs and IG staff members at every organizational
level will document each complaint analysis and include the rationale for the selected complaint
resolution strategy.
   3.14.1. Document the complaint analysis using the complaint analysis documentation letter
   (Attachment 2) and attach the document to the ACTS case file. For complaints that are
   resolved through an assist, dismiss, transfer or referral, the IG can document the complaint
   analysis in an ACTS case note in place of the complaint analysis documentation letter. The
   case note must include the background, issues, analysis, and resolution path.
   3.14.2. If, during the initial complaint analysis, the IG determines the complaint should be
   handled by another IG office, the IG will document the rationale for the transfer in ACTS
   and transfer the complaint. The IG receiving the transfer will accomplish a detailed
   complaint analysis and the required documentation.
   3.14.3. If the complaint analysis recommends an IG investigation, the complaint analysis
   document must contain properly framed allegations.
   3.14.4. For a reprisal complaint analysis (RCA), use the format in Attachme nt 19 or 20.
   3.14.5. All complaint analyses for allegations of reprisal, restriction, and IMHE, and
   instances where the complaint analysis recommends investigation, will be reviewed by the
   appointing authority.
3.15. Processing Allegations of a Special Nature. Table 3.5 explains special processing
instructions when a complainant makes assertions against senior officials, colonels (or civilian
equivalent), IGs, or allegations of a special nature.
 56                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012

      include but not limited to
      homicide, sexual assault,
      use/possession/sale of drugs,
      theft, travel fraud, etc.)
3.16. Other Agencies and Grievance Channels. DoD and Air Force policy mandates the use
of specialized investigative agencies or procedures for certain types of complaints made against
non-senior officials. In these cases, complainants should be advised of the appropriate agency.
Table 3.6 assists IGs in determining if a complaint belongs in other channels.
3.17. Handling Air Force Civilian Complaints. The IG CRP does not cover matters
concerning employment conditions for civilian employees. These matters must be processed
under applicable civilian grievance, complaint, or appeal systems as stated in other directives.
Refer to Table 3.6 for procedures for handling civilian complaints.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                     57

Table 3.8. How to Transfer a Complaint.
 Step      Action
 1         Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be transferred to
           another IG. Do not make any notifications regarding reprisal, restriction, IMHE or
           colonels (or civilian equivalent). These notifications will be done by the receiving
           IG.
 2         Coordinate a complaint transfer with the appropriate IG explaining the rationale for
           transfer. If the transferring and receiving IGs do not agree whether a transfer is
           appropriate, elevate the case to the MAJCOM/IGQ office(s) for resolution. SAF/IGQ
           will act as the MAJCOM for ANG cases.
 3         Transfer case file to receiving IG office through the applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ,
           NAF, or DRU-IG. Transfers must be accomplished in ACTS.
 4         Notify the complainant of the transfer in writing and attach the response in ACTS.
 5         If the complainant expresses concern about bias at a lower-level, advise him/her of
           the right to appeal the lower-level IGs finding and the fact that the higher-level IG
           oversees the action of lower-level IG.
 6         Document the case in ACTS as a ―Transfer‖ and take other actions needed to ensure
           the ACTS record is transferred to the appropriate IG office. The IG office which
           resolves the issue will close the case in ACTS at the appropriate time.
3.21. Policy When Another Appeal or Grievance Channel Exists. When a member has a
complaint or appeal regarding adverse actions for which law and/or regulation provide a specific
means of redress or remedy, IGs will advise the complainant of those other redress or appeal
channels as provided for by the specific law or regulation. Mere dissatisfaction with the outcome
of an appeal is not sufficient basis for an IG inquiry.
      3.21.1. For complaints that are not appropriate for the IG CRP see Tables 3.9, 3.11, or 3.12.
      3.21.2. IGs will assist or refer complaints when they fall under the purview of another office
      or agency, or when they are covered by other directives with established grievance channels
      IAW paragraphs 3.22 and 3.24.
      3.21.3. If the member alleges the appeal process was improperly or prejudicially handled
      and has no other means of redress, the complainant may enter a complaint of mishandling
      under this instruction for IG complaint analysis.
      3.21.4. If the complainant makes an allegation that could be considered a criminal offense,
      the IG will consult with JA and law enforcement to determine whether the complaint should
      be referred or remain in IG channels.
3.22. Assisting a Complainant. IGs assist complainants in resolving personal problems when
there is no evidence or assertion of wrongdoing. To remedy a problem, IGs may make phone
calls, ask questions of functional experts, solicit helpful information from the appropriate
organization or agency, or put the complainant in contact with the person, organization, or
agency that can appropriately address their problem. The purpose of assistance is to quickly
resolve personal issues and allow the complainant to refocus on the assigned mission. Table 3.9
explains when and how to assist a complainant.

3.23. Procedures for Assisting a Complainant. Use the procedures in Table 3.9 to assist a
complainant.

Table 3.9. How to Assist a Complainant.
 Step Action
 1    Discuss concerns/issues with the complainant.
 2    Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint can be appropriately
      handled through assistance.
 3    Document the complaint analysis using the complaint analysis documentation letter
      (Attachment 2) and attach the document to the ACTS case file or document the
      analysis in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate information as referenced in
      Attachment 2).
 4    Advise the complainant their complaint is not an IG matter but the IG can assist them
      in resolving their concerns.
 5    Make phone calls or other contacts to provide the complainant with assistance needed.
 6    Ensure the complainant‘s concerns are being addressed by the appropriate
      authority/agency.
 7    Document the case in ACTS as an ―Assist,‖ record appropriate information, and close
      the case.
3.24. Referring a Complaint. When the complaint analysis discloses an organization or
agency outside the Air Force IG Complaints Resolution system can more appropriately handle a
complaint alleging a violation of instruction, policy, or procedure by a management official, IGs
will refer the complaint to the appropriate organization or agency following the procedures
described in Table 3.11 and paragraph 3.25. When referring complaints, IGs will include the
Referral Completion Report (RCR) template (see Attachment 28) with the complaint. The
organization receiving the referral will complete the RCR and return it to the IG within 30 days
of receipt along with a courtesy copy of their response to the complainant.
     3.24.1. Ensure RCRs include:
        3.24.1.1. Scope of the inquiry.
        3.24.1.2. Findings of the inquiry.
        3.24.1.3. Conclusions, recommendations and corrective actions.
     3.24.2. Attach completed RCRs in ACTS under ―Disposition/Resolution Documents‖.

3.25. Procedures for Referring a Complaint. Use the procedures in Table 3.11 to refer a
complaint, and Attachme nt 3 for a sample referral letter, but do not attach the IG‘s complaint
analysis.

Table 3.11. How to Refer a Complaint.
 Step Action
 1    Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be handled in other
      channels.
 2    Prepare a complaint analysis letter and supporting decision documents, then attach the
      documents to the ACTS case file. The complaint analysis documentation letter
      (attachment 2) provides the format for a non-reprisal complaint analysis. The analysis
      may also be documented in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate information as
      referenced in attachment 2).
 3    Notify the complainant of the intent to refer the complaint and request permission
      from the complainant to pass their name and contact information to the referral
      agency. If the complainant refuses permission, the IG will have to act as a conduit for
      questions from the referral agency and answers from the complainant. At no time
      should a complainant‘s identity be released to a referral agency without the
      complainant‘s permission. It is highly encouraged that this permission is received in
      writing (i.e. a letter or email).
 4    For all complaints, refer the complaint (e.g., AF IMT 102, written/typed complaint,
      etc.), in writing, to the appropriate agency, commander, or grievance channel using
      the Sample Referral Letter, attachment 3. DO NOT attach the Complaint Analysis.
      Redact portions of the complaint that do not directly apply to the referral action.
      Redact the complainant‘s identity if the complainant has not given permission for the
      release (see step 3 of this table). Include a copy of the RCR template, attachment 28.
      RCRs are not included when referring complaints to EO or OSI. Notify the
      complainant, in writing, of the referral.
 5    Direct the referral agency to provide you a copy of the finished RCR and a courtesy
      copy of the closure response to the complainant for your case file (Note 1). IGs will
      follow-up with the referral agency within 30 days if a closure response has not been
      received.
 6    Document the case in ACTS as ―Refer,‖ record appropriate information, and place the
      case in complete status. If there is an O-6 subject,
      ensure SAF/IGQ is notified IAW paragraph 5.6. Additionally, if there is an O-4 or
      O-5 subject, monitor/track the case until completion. Once complete, if the case
      results in a substantiated finding against an O-4 or O-5, ensure the investigative report
      and any command action is attached in ACTS. When a copy of the RCR is provided
      to the IG, close the case in ACTS. (Note 2) For referrals to EO or OSI, after
      confirming EO or OSI has accepted the case, make a case note and close the case.
Note 1. SAF/IGS will not normally send a closure response to the complainant on referred
matters.
Note 2. If the complainant notifies the referring IG that he/she did not receive a final response
from the referral agency, the IG should follow-up to ensure the referral agency received the
complaint and provided a response to the complainant.

3.26. Dismissing a Complaint. A complaint may be dismissed following a thorough complaint
analysis if there is no assertion or evidence of a standard being violated or when the complaint
falls under one of the rules in Table 3.12. Tables 3.12 and 3.13 help IGs determine when and
how to dismiss a complaint.

                                      reasonable probability that
                                      insufficient information
                                      can be gathered to make a

Note 1. The most important consideration before dismissing a complaint based on the time
requirement established in paragraph 2.5.1 is the potential to gather sufficient information to
determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged wrongdoing. With the passage of
time, it becomes increasingly difficult to gather relevant evidence, testimony, and information
for many reasons. For example, it may be difficult or impossible to collect relevant witness
testimony if the witnesses have moved, retired, or died. In addition, as time passes, witnesses‘
memories may fade and documents are destroyed when their retention periods expire. The IG
may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature of the alleged wrong and the passage of time, there
is reasonable probability insufficient information can be gathered to make a determination.
However, if it is possible to gather sufficient information, a further analysis may be warranted.
Note 2. See definition of frivolous allegation in Attachment 1.
3.27. How to Dismiss a Complaint. Follow the procedures in Table 3.13 to dismiss a
complaint.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                  67


Table 3.13. How to Dismiss a Complaint.
 Step Action
 1    Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be dismissed.
 2    Prepare a complaint analysis letter and supporting decision documents, then attach the
      documents to the ACTS case file The complaint analysis documentation letter
      (Attachment 2) provides the format for a non-reprisal complaint analysis. The
      analysis may also be documented in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate
      information as referenced in Attachment 2). For cases requiring a Reprisal
      Complaint Analysis, use Attachment 19 or 20 instead of Attachment 2 and follow
      guidance in Chapter 6. For a case that does not result in an investigation, the case
      file should only contain the applicable documents for the type of tasking.
 3    If the complaint analysis determined allegations against a colonel (or civilian
      equivalent) were obviously frivolous, then, IAW paragraph 5.4.1, the IG must notify
      the next higher-level IG for approval.
 4    For allegations of reprisal, restriction, and IMHE referral that do not include credible
      evidence of a violation of law, regulation, or policy, refer to Chapters 6, 7, and 8 as
      applicable.
 5    Notify the complainant in writing of the dismissal ensuring the rationale for the
      dismissal is clearly communicated. For allegations of reprisal, restriction, and IMHE
      referral, wait until IG DoD has agreed with the AF recommendation to dismiss prior
      to notifying the complainant.
 6    Advise the complainant of his/her right to appeal to the next higher-level IG and
      AFBCMR (or other appeal channels), if applicable.
 7    Document the case in ACTS as a ―Dismiss,‖ record appropriate information, and
      close the case.
3.28. Investigating a Complaint. Investigate a complaint when a properly framed allegation is
derived from the issues asserted or implied by the complainant and the IG determines the
substantive issues framed in an allegation are appropriate IG matters. Though allegations may
be successfully framed, not all matters are appropriate for the IG, nor are all matters relevant to
the Air Force. Most Air Force processes have embedded appeal procedures that provide
complainants with due process. Table 3.6 outlines matters that are not appropriate for the IG to
investigate. The complaint must be timely to ensure information is available to support the
investigative process. Refer to Table 3.14 when initiating an IG investigation.
3.29. Policy for Conducting Investigations. The decision to conduct an IG investigation will
only be made after completing a thorough complaint analysis of all issues presented.
   3.29.1. IG investigations are performed to address complaints by checking records,
   correspondence, reviewing applicable instructions, examining material evidence, and
   interviewing the complainant, subject(s), expert witnesses, and persons having direct
   knowledge of the matter. IAW paragraph 3.34, Policy for Appointing an Investigating
   Officer, all investigations require an appointment letter (see paragraph 3.35) from the
   appointing authority.
   3.29.1. (ACC) The decision to conduct an IG investigation is made by the appointing
   authority, however the HQ ACC/IG (or delegate) is the appointing authority for all
 68                                                     AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      investigations of reprisal, restriction or Improper Mental Health Evaluation within Air
      Combat Command. The NAF/USAFWC commander will act as the appointing authority if
      the subject of an investigation is a wing commander. The United States Air Force Central
      Command Commander (USAFCENT/CC) will appoint the IO for investigations conducted
      into complaints filed against subjects deployed to the USAFCENT Area of Responsibility
      (AOR). Transcription and other administrative costs will be funded by the wing or
      NAF/USAFWC, as appropriate, for which the investigation is being conducted. The
      Investigation Review Board (IRB) process outlined below will be followed when it is
      determined by an IG that an investigation may be warranted.
         3.29.1.1. (Added-ACC) Provide an electronic copy of the complaint with attachments,
         analysis and proposed framed allegations to HQ ACC/IGQ for review by the IRB. The
         IRB will review the documents to determine whether all allegations were captured,
         framed properly and make recommendations as to whether an investigation is warranted.
         Their recommendations will be forwarded to HQ ACC/IGQ for final determination as to
         whether an investigation is warranted.
         3.29.1.2. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/IGQ will provide recommended framed allegations
         to the ACC Staff Judge Advocate (HQ ACC/JA) for review if it is determined an
         investigation is warranted. HQ ACC/IGQ will notify the installation and NAF/USAFWC
         IG of the final decision. The installation IG, with the exception of USAFCENT IGs, will
         transfer the case, via ACTS, to HQ ACC/IGQ who will then manage the investigation to
         conclusion.
         3.29.1.3. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/IG will act as the appointing authority and appoint a
         NAF/USAFWC IG to conduct the investigation or appoint an IO at the MAJCOM level
         to conduct the investigation. If neither are available for tasking, HQ ACC/IG will
         appoint an IO at the unit level (preferably the assigned unit IG) to conduct the
         investigation. The USAFCENT/CC will appoint the IO for investigations conducted into
         complaints filed against subjects deployed to the USAFCENT AOR.
         3.29.1.4. (Added-ACC) Once the investigation is completed by the NAF IG or assigned
         IO, the report will undergo an initial legal review by the respective NAF Judge Advocate
         (JA). When found legally sufficient the report will forwarded to HQ ACC/IGQ for
         quality review and to HQ ACC/JA for legal review in cases containing allegations of
         IMHE, reprisal, or restriction, or against a Colonel, and any other cases where HQ
         ACC/IGQ determines a further legal review is needed. The report will be forwarded to
         higher headquarters if appropriate.
3.30. Procedures for Tasking an Investigation. Use the procedures in Table 3.14 to task an
investigation.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                    69


Table 3.14. How to Task an Investigation.
 Step Action
 1    Using a complaint analysis, determine if the complaint warrants an IG investigation.
 2    Prepare and forward a complaint analysis document and supporting decision
      documents to the appointing authority. The complaint analysis documentation letter
      (Attachment 2) provides the format for a non-reprisal complaint analysis. For cases
      requiring a reprisal complaint analysis, use Attachment 19 or 20 and follow the
      guidance in Chapter 6.
 3    The appointing authority reviews the complaint analysis and supporting material to
      determine whether an investigation is warranted.
 4    The appointing authority directs an investigation by appointing an IO in writing (see
      paragraph 3.35).
 5    Follow appropriate notification procedures per paragraphs 3.32 and/or 5.6.
 6    The IG places the case in ―Under Investigation‖ status using the ―Investigate‖ action
      in ACTS and continues to record appropriate information in ACTS until the case is
      closed.
3.31. Higher Headquarters Taskings.
   3.31.1. When complaints are addressed to a higher-level IG office, that office will decide if
   tasking to a lower-level IG is appropriate by determining whether:
       3.31.1.1. The complaint was previously addressed and merits a higher-level IG review.
       3.31.1.2. There is a need to avoid the appearance of self-investigation at a lower level.
       3.31.1.3. There is evidence the lower-level IG or command may be biased.
   3.31.2. Absent any of the circumstances described in paragraph 3.31.1, the higher-level IG
   may task the lower-level IG for complaint resolution and response to the complainant. This
   ensures the higher-level IG office remains unbiased and is available to review any rebuttals
   or appeals of the lower-level investigation.
3.32. Notification Requirements for Investigations on Lieutenant Colonels (or
Below). Table 3.15 describes the notification requirements when an IG investigation is started
against a lieutenant colonel (or below).

      witnesses, collect evidence, and examine/copy documents, files and other data relevant to the
      investigation.
      3.34.2. An appointment letter is necessary for all investigations, including those conducted
      by an IG or IG staff member.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 71


   3.34.3. An IO is the personal representative of the appointing authority. IOs must be
   impartial, unbiased, objective, thorough, and have the availability to complete the
   investigation.
   3.34.4. The IO must be a field grade officer, senior NCO, or Air Force civilian with a
   substantial breadth of experience, exceptional maturity, and demonstrated sound judgment.
       3.34.4.1. When no IO in the required grade is reasonably available for appointment, the
       appointing authority will request a waiver, in writing, from the MAJCOM/IG, Deputy IG,
       or MAJCOM/IGQ. MAJCOM/IG is the waiver authority for cases investigated at the
       MAJCOM level and below. SAF/IGQ will act as the MAJCOM for ANG waivers. The
       waiver request should describe the measures taken to locate an IO in the required grade
       prior to requesting the waiver. If approved, the MAJCOM/IG will document the waiver
       in writing. Refer to Attachme nt 10 to determine where to place the document in the case
       file.
   3.34.5. To support IO impartiality and independence, follow either of the two subsequent
   paragraphs:
       3.34.5.1. There must be at least one level of command between the IO and the
       complainant, and there must also be at least one level of command between the IO and
       person(s) who are the subject(s) of the allegation(s).
       3.34.5.2. The IO must be separated by organizational assignment from the complainant,
       and the IO must also be separated by organizational assignment from the person(s) who
       are the subject(s) of the allegation(s).
   3.34.6. If necessary, an IO may be verbally appointed; however, a written directive must
   follow within three working days.
   3.34.7. The investigation will be the IO‘s primary duty until the report is completed and
   approved by the appointing authority.
   3.34.8. Appointing authorities should not appoint an IO who is retiring, separating, expects
   reassignment, or expects deployment within 180 days.
3.35. How to Appoint an Investigating Officer. Attachme nt 5 shows a sample letter for
appointing an IO to conduct an investigation. If the IG assumes the role of the IO, he/she is also
required to be appointed and must receive an appointment letter from the appointing authority.
IGs who have been designated as the appointing authority cannot appoint themselves as an IO.
IGs may use the draft investigative plan (see Attachme nt 6 and paragraph 3.39.8) as the
―Directive to the IO‖ shown as Attachme nt 1 in the IO appointment letter (see Attachment 5 of
this instruction).
   3.35.1. The IO‘s appointment and responsibilities expire when the report of investigation
   (ROI) is approved by the appointing authority or after final higher headquarters approval,
   whichever is later (see Attachment 5).
3.36. Requirements for Investigation Preparation.
   3.36.1. IGs will train IOs before they begin an investigation by using this instruction, the Air
   Force Inspector General Investigating Officer Overview course, available at
   https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp and the SAF/IGQ Investigating Officer
 72                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      Guide (IO Guide). In addition, the IG will discuss the investigative requirements and answer
      questions.
      3.36.2. IOs must confer with their JA, preferably by meeting in person, before initiating the
      investigation. The JA will assist the IG in training the IO.
      3.36.3. IOs must review the allegations and supporting documentation as part of their
      investigative preparation. All appropriate regulations/directives should be identified and
      reviewed.
      3.36.4. Based on the review of the allegations, supporting documentation, and applicable
      directives, the IO may complete an investigation plan, which will be approved by the IG.
      See Attachment 6 for a sample investigation plan. This plan will assist the IO in completing
      progress reports and in keeping track of the dates he/she completes the planned actions.

Section 3F—Step 5: Fact Finding (< 21 Days)

3.37. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: authentication, evidence, hand-
off, interrogatories, investigation, preponderance of the evidence, proof analysis matrix,
statement, summarized testimony, suspect, subject, testimony, and witness. Refer to Attachme nt
1 for the definition of these key terms.
3.38. Policy on Investigating Complaints.
      3.38.1. All IG investigations are conducted IAW Chapter 3 and other applicable laws and
      regulations concerning the specific allegations.
      3.38.2. IG investigations are administrative in nature--they are fact finding rather than
      judicial proceedings. The standard of proof that applies is proof by a preponderance of the
      evidence.
3.39. IG Responsibilities. IGs are responsible for managing the investigative process. The IG
must assist the IO in solving investigative challenges while managing the investigation‘s quality
and schedule. It is the IG‘s responsibility to ensure the report of investigation is completed on
time and meets qualitative standards. Specifically, the IG:
      3.39.1. Must provide the IO an appointment letter describing the scope of investigation,
      authorizing the collection of evidence, and setting the suspense date for completion.
      3.39.2. Must provide the IO the complaint analysis, all complainant-provided materials, and
      the framed allegations. Additionally, the IG must enter all allegations addressed in the ROI in
      the subject tab of the ACTS case file.
      3.39.3. Must verify the IO has completed the Investigating Officer Overview Course (see
      paragraph 3.40.1) and train the IO using the SAF/IGQ IO Guide, and AFI 90-301.
      3.39.4. Must brief the IO on the Hand-off Policy.
      3.39.5. Must schedule appointments with key support staff including legal and technical
      advisors as necessary.
      3.39.6. Should provide the IO suitable workspace, computers, administrative support, and
      technical assistance.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               73


   3.39.7. Should review the proposed witness questions and associated rights advisement, if
   any.
   3.39.8. May prepare a draft investigative plan (Attachme nt 6) identifying key milestones,
   standards, witnesses, evidence, and administrative requirements.
   3.39.9. May prepare a preliminary proof analysis matrix facilitating evidence collection
   IAW the SAF/IGQ IO Guide.
   3.39.10. Has no authority to grant express promises of confidentiality to subjects, suspects,
   complainants, or witnesses.
3.40. Responsibilities of IOs. The IO:
   3.40.1. Must complete the Air Force Inspector General - Investigating Officer Overview
   Course, available at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp and provide the local IG
   a copy of the automated Certificate of Training prior to beginning investigative duties.
   3.40.2. Must advise the appointing authority immediately of any personal relationships or
   other factors that may affect his/her impartiality.
   3.40.3. Must advise the appointing authority if he/she is retiring, separating, expects
   reassignment, or expects deployment within 180 days.
   3.40.4. For ANG: Must agree to be put on continuous orders for 30 days initially to conduct
   the investigation. Must continue on orders if the investigation is not complete within 30
   days.
   3.40.5. Must begin the investigation without any preconceived notions. Never take sides
   with any party--be impartial, unbiased, and objective.
   3.40.6. Must investigate the complaint, not the complainant. Keep the investigation focused
   on the allegations in the complaint and not the person making them.
   3.40.7. Must interview the complainant first in order to re-clarify the allegations and obtain
   specific details to help with the investigation.
   3.40.8. Must protect information IAW paragraph 3.3 and by:
       3.40.8.1. Obtaining the appointing authority‘s written permission if they believe they
       must release the complainant‘s name to gain evidence or testimony.
       3.40.8.2. Reporting the results of the case only to the appointing authority and IG.
       3.40.8.3. Not commenting to any complainant, subject, or other witnesses regarding their
       opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations during or after completion of the
       investigation.
       3.40.8.4. Not providing copies of testimony to complainants, subjects, or witnesses. If a
       subject/witness requests case file information, refer them to the appropriate FOIA office.
   3.40.9. Has no authority to grant express promises of confidentiality to subjects, suspects,
   complainants, or witnesses.
   3.40.10. Should not take leave except in emergencies or be involved with activities that
   would interfere with the timely completion of the case.
 74                                                        AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      3.40.11. Should consult with the appointing authority and/or supporting IG, legal advisor,
      and read all applicable instructions and directives before beginning an investigation.
         3.40.11.1. Must consult in advance with legal advisor about the need for rights
         advisement when applicable.
      3.40.12. Should use the SAF/IGQ IO Guide for proper guidance on how to conduct an
      investigation.
      3.40.13. May complete an investigative plan identifying key milestones, standards,
      witnesses, evidence, and administrative requirements and obtain IG approval.
      3.40.14. May complete a proof analysis matrix facilitating evidence collection IAW the
      SAF/IGQ IO Guide.
      3.40.15. Must verify the status of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel
      (witnesses, subjects, suspects, complainants) at the time of the occurrence and at the time of
      any scheduled interviews. Consult with legal advisor if questions arise as to the status of the
      individual.
3.41. Gathering Evide nce. Evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove the
existence of a fact. Evidence comes in many forms. It can be written or oral, direct or
circumstantial, relevant or irrelevant, first-person or hearsay.
      3.41.1. Documentary Evidence. During the course of investigations IOs normally collect
      copies of documents, records, and other physical evidence to aid them in their duties.
      Assuming it is authentic, documentary evidence gives the investigator a snapshot in time.
         3.41.1.1. One way to further verify the authenticity of a document is to have it identified
         by its author, especially in the case of correspondence, personal notes, and computer
         records. This process is known as authentication and must be referenced in the final
         report if the document has been so verified.
      3.41.2. Computer Records. Data contained on computer hard drives, local area networks, e-
      mail systems, disks, etc., are considered to be documentary in nature but pose special
      challenges in accessing. Obtaining access to this information should be coordinated through
      the servicing legal office.
      3.41.3. Testimony. The other major form of evidence is presented by a witness in the form
      of testimony. Normally, the bulk of evidence during an investigation is collected in this
      format and will be discussed separately in this section.
      3.41.4. Hearsay. A statement or testimony given by a witness who relates not what he/she
      knows personally, but what others have said and is therefore dependent on the credibility of
      someone other than the witness. Although IOs may consider evidence obtained as hearsay,
      whenever possible, an IO should always try to talk to the actual witness who made the
      statement, especially if they are reasonably available and the statement is important.
3.42. Interviewing Witnesses. The bulk of evidence collected during IG investigations will
normally come from witness testimony. After properly framing the scope and purpose of the
investigation, the next most important aspect is the preparation of intelligent, well -planned
questions. Effective, cogent interviews can only be accomplished through thorough preparation.
      3.42.1. A witness‘ status will determine how they will be interviewed. For example:
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               75


     3.42.1.1. The complainant is a key witness who must be interviewed first to clarify
     allegations and focus the investigation.
     3.42.1.2. The subject is equally important since he/she is the one against whom the
     allegations have been made. The subject(s) must be interviewed. This person should be
     interviewed last and given an opportunity to respond to the specific allegations against
     him/her. Additionally, they should be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to
     significant adverse information that may come about subsequent to the subject‘s initial
     interview. If the subject is no longer associated with the Air Force, every attempt must
     be made to contact them to give them an opportunity to give their side of the story. This
     process is also important to the complainant as a substantiated allegation may enable the
     complainant to correct their AF record and become whole again.
     3.42.1.3. An expert witness is someone with special knowledge and expertise in a
     particular subject matter. They may be used as consultants for background information
     or as a regular witness during the investigation.
         3.42.1.3.1. Because of their special expertise, their testimony is normally given more
         weight than the testimony of non-experts in their area of specialty.
         3.42.1.3.2. IOs should not allow the testimony of an expert witness to control their
         final findings and recommendations. This remains the ultimate responsibility of t he
         IO.
     3.42.1.4. Character witnesses are people who can verify the reputation of a particular
     person for certain conduct or personality traits, i.e., honesty, violence, etc.
  3.42.2. Regardless of their status, all witnesses in investiga tions must be sworn. This puts
  witnesses on notice that the investigation is a serious matter and they are expected to testify
  truthfully. The IO must:
     3.42.2.1. For each witness who is neither a suspect nor a subject, tailor the witness
     interview format outlined in Attachment 7 as appropriate. Use the individually-tailored
     witness interview format for each witness interview. For each subject, tailor the subject
     interview format outlined in Attachme nt 8 as appropriate and use it for that subject‘s
     interview. For suspect interviews, use the suspect interview format in Attachme nt 9 and
     guidance in paragraph 3.45.
     3.42.2.2. Advise subjects/suspects they may submit additional relevant information for
     the IO‘s consideration within a reasonable time following their interview.
     3.42.2.3. Electronically record (audio only) all witness testimony to accurately capture
     what was said during the interview. Advise all witnesses they are not authorized to
     record the interview in any manner. All electronic recordings must be given to the IG
     together with the completed ROI.
     3.42.2.4. Transcribe verbatim (word-by-word) the complainant‘s, subject‘s, and key
     witnesses‘ testimony. At the discretion of the appointing authority, summarized
     testimony may be acceptable for all other nonessential witnesses.
     3.42.2.5. Sign all testimony to certify its validity. Add the following statement to the
     end of the testimony: ―I certify the above to be a true sworn (or affirmed) testimony
 76                                                        AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


         given to me on (date) at (place).‖ It is encouraged (not mandatory) that witnesses also
         sign summarized testimony, whenever the witness is reasonably available to do so.
      3.42.3. For witnesses outside the local area, an IO can either travel to meet and interview the
      witness, or interview the witness telephonically. If the witness is interviewed telephonically,
      the IO must make arrangements to verify the witness‘ identity. The appointed IO will (when
      possible) interview all subjects or suspects in person.
      3.42.4. If a witness‘ status changes during the course of an investigation to that of a subject
      or suspect, the witness must be re-interviewed (following the format outlined in Attachme nt
      8 or Attachment 9, as applicable) and given an opportunity to respond to the suspected
      misconduct or allegations in light of their new status.
         3.42.4.1. The appointing authority will determine whether additional issues will be
         investigated separately and, if necessary, expand the scope of the investigation. If the
         scope of investigation is expanded, an addendum to the appointment letter must be
         completed. The IO will take no further action until consulting with the appointing
         authority and the legal office.
         3.42.4.2. Conduct the proper read-in/rights advisement for a subject/suspect prior to the
         interview/re-interview. Refer to paragraph 3.45 for further rules regarding rights
         advisement. The read-in/rights advisement is mandatory. Consult with the servicing
         legal office prior to rights advisement.
      3.42.5. Witnesses who are military members or federal civilian employees may refuse to
      testify only if they believe they might incriminate themselves (refer to paragraph 3.45). If
      self-incrimination is not a concern, witnesses may be ordered/directed by their commander to
      testify. Further refusal may be the basis for disciplinary action.
3.43. Persons Present During an Interview. A typical interview will involve the IO, any
technical advisor (if necessary), and the witness. The introduction of any unauthorized party into
the process reduces the ability to preserve a reasonable level of confidentiality.
      3.43.1. Only a suspect has the right to have an attorney present during an interview;
      however, the attorney must not be allowed to answer any question for the interviewee.
      3.43.2. When witnesses are considered subjects, they may consult with an attorney, but may
      not have an attorney present during the interview.
      3.43.3. Union officials may have the right to be present during interviews per the provisions
      in paragraph 3.44 of this instruction.
3.44. Civilian Employees Represented by Unions. Civilian employees (including non-
appropriated fund employees) may have a right to union representation when interviewed as a
suspect, subject, or witness. This right applies if the employee‘s position meets the local
definition for inclusion in the collective bargaining unit. The employee's individual status as a
union member has no bearing on the right to representation. Additionally, the union has an
independent right to be present during formal discussions (sworn/recorded IG interviews are
formal interviews) involving bargaining unit members and the union must be notified whenever
formal interviews will take place.         Before interviewing witnesses, subjects, or suspects
represented by unions, consult with legal to determine what, if any, rights advisement is required
IAW any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                  77


   3.44.1. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created a right to union representation for
   federal civilian employees whose terms of employment are governed by a union contract.
   This right arises during interviews with a federal employee in connection with investigations
   if: (a) the employee reasonably believes disciplinary action may be taken against him or her
   as a result of the interview, and (b) the employee requests union representation. This right
   does not apply to management personnel.
   3.44.2. The Civil Service Reform Act does not require an IO to advise an employee of the
   right to union representation before an interview. The Act merely requires management to
   inform its employees annually of this right. IOs must notify the union whenever a member
   of the bargaining unit is going to be interviewed. A union representative has the right to be
   present at the interview regardless of the employee's wishes. The union determines who will
   represent the union during the interview, not the employee. IOs must exercise caution when
   interviewing federal civilian employees to ensure they are not violating the terms of labor
   contracts. IOs should contact the local Civilian Personnel Flight Labor Relations Specialist
   and legal office to clarify the specifications of the local bargaining agreement.
   3.44.3. The exercise of the right to union representation may not interfere with the
   investigation. Determinations regarding union representation should be coordinated in
   advance with the legal office and the Civilian Personnel Office Labor Relations Specialist.
   The representative may advise the employee, ask questions to clarify issues, and suggest
   other employees who may have knowledge of the facts at issue. However, he or she may not
   do so in a manner that interferes with the interview and may not testify for the employee.
   The IO has authority to terminate the interview if he or she determines the union
   representative is impeding or attempting to impede the investigation. Consult with legal on
   how to proceed after terminating the interview.
3.45. Policy Regarding Rights Advise ments. If during the course of an investigation the IO
discovers information leading him or her to believe matters of a criminal nature have occurred
and a witness or subject becomes a suspect, the IO must stop the interview, consult with the
appointing authority and legal office, and (if allowed to proceed) advise the suspects of their
rights. Attachment 9 provides a template format for a suspect interview and rights advisement
and must be read to the suspect verbatim. If after rights advisement, the suspect refuses to testify
or requests an attorney, then the interview must stop. Consult with the legal office before
attempting to re-interview the suspect.
   3.45.1. For active duty military suspects (and retired or separated military members subject
   to recall), advise them of their rights as specified under Article 31, UCMJ.
   3.45.2. In regards to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel, IOs need to verify
   the status of the suspect at the time of the occurrence and at the time of the scheduled
   interview. Consult with the legal office to determine what, if any, rights advisement is
   required.
   3.45.3. Civilian witnesses, even if suspected of a criminal offense, need not be advised of
   their Fifth Amendment rights when interviewed as part of an IG investigation. Under the
   law, such rights are only required in conjunction with custodial interrogations (i.e.,
   interrogations in which the interviewee is not free to leave at will) by law enforcement
   personnel. Interviews by an IG/IO under authority of this instruction do not meet that
   threshold requirement (i.e., IGs and IOs are not considered law enforcement personnel for
 78                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      Fifth Amendment purposes). The lack of a requirement to advise civilian witnesses of their
      Fifth Amendment rights does not preclude them from invoking such rights if circumstances
      warrant.
3.46. Policy Regarding Subject/Suspect/Witness Hand-offs. Air Force policy regarding
investigative interviews of active duty, Air Reserve Component members, and Department of Air
Force civilian employees requires special handling of certain interviewees:
      3.46.1. Air Force experience has found that subjects/suspects of an investigation may be at a
      greater risk of committing suicide. A primary concern is that being a subject/suspect of an
      investigation may result in stress and turmoil within an individual‘s life. The hand-off policy
      is intended to act as a safety net to those individuals who might be so emotionally distraught
      as to pose a danger to themselves or others.
         3.46.1.1. These hand-offs require person-to-person contact between the IO and the
         subject‘s/suspect‘s commander or designee, civilian leading an organization designated
         as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor. Hand-offs will
         require pre-coordination and advanced planning.
         3.46.1.2. Following initial interviews with Air Force personnel who are the
         subject/suspect of an investigation, IOs must refer such individuals to their commander or
         designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or
         designee, first sergeant, or supervisor. The command representative must be physically
         present immediately following the interview and receive the subject/suspect.
         3.46.1.3. Before providing the hand-off, the IO should advise the commander or
         designee that the individual is the subject or suspect of an IG investigation. The IO
         should also explain the reason for any concern he or she has about the individual‘s
         personal safety (e.g., individual was emotionally distraught, shocked, etc.).
             3.46.1.3.1. However, the IO may not disclose the identity of the complainant or the
             substance of testimony or other evidence obtained during the investigation.
             3.46.1.3.2. If time permits, the IO should coordinate with the IG before ha nding-off
             an individual or notifying the commander. However, an IO should not delay
             obtaining appropriate assistance for an individual whose emotional state demands
             immediate attention simply to obtain IG coordination.
         3.46.1.4. The hand-off must be documented at the end of the testimony. IOs may use
         the documentation at the end of the readout or include the following annotation: ―At the
         conclusion of the interview(s), the witness/subject(s)/suspect(s)was/were handed off by
         the IO to the commander (or commander's representative) IAW AFI 90-301, paragraph
         3.46.‖
      3.46.2. If any witness (or subject/suspect in subsequent interviews) appears to be emotional,
      distraught, or stunned during the process of any i nterview, they should not be allowed to
      depart alone, but should be released to their commander or designee, civilian leading an
      organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor,
      who will help ensure the individual receives the necessary support to safely handle his or her
      personal crisis (referred to as handing-off).
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                79


       3.46.2.1. In most instances, hand-offs will require pre-coordination and advanced
       planning.
       3.46.2.2. A hand-off is only required for witnesses if the IO determines the witness has
       been sufficiently disturbed by the interview to warrant person-to-person contact.
       3.46.2.3. The IO should also explain the reason for any concern he or she has about the
       individual‘s personal safety (e.g., individual was emotionally distraught, shocked, etc.).
           3.46.2.3.1. However, the IO may not disclose the identity of the complainant or the
           substance of testimony or other evidence obtained during the investigation.
       3.46.2.4. The hand-off must be documented at the end of the testimony. IOs may use the
       documentation at the end of the readout or include the following annotation: ―At the
       conclusion of the interview(s), the witness/subject(s) was/were handed off by the IO to
       the commander (or commander's representative) IAW AFI 90-301, paragraph 3.46.‖
   3.46.3. When subjects or witnesses invoke their Fifth Amendment or Article 31 rights during
   an interview, the commander or designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a
   unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor will be informed of this fact
   and instructed to avoid any questioning, interrogation, or discussions in the subject‘s
   presence of a nature likely to elicit statements or admissions regarding the alleged offenses.
   Document this in the Report of Investigation.
   3.46.4. If subjects are represented by an attorney for the matter under investigation, notify
   the attorney of the hand-off. Notify the servicing legal office of any suspect, subject, or
   witness represented by an attorney.
   3.46.5. When dealing with civilian witnesses, the IO must make a reasonable effort to hand-
   off the individual directly to their unit representative, commander or designee, civilian
   leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, or supervisor.

Section 3G—Step 6: Writing the Report (< 28 Days)

3.47. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: case file, completion, evidence,
fact, hotline completion report, legal review, legal sufficiency, not substantiated, preponderance
of the evidence, report of investigation (ROI), standards, substantiated, and technical review.
Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms.
3.48. Standard of Proof.
   3.48.1. The standard of proof applicable to IG investigations is proof by a preponderance of
   the evidence. This means that it is more likely than not the wrongdoing has occurred.
   3.48.2. IOs must be careful not to apply this standard too mechanically. Quality counts as
   much as quantity and an IO may choose to believe one witness rather than five others if the
   one is sufficiently credible and the five are not. In addition, there is no way to measure the
   weight of a document against the testimony of a witness other than by evaluating credibility
   as discussed in paragraph 3.49.2.
3.49. Analyzing the Evidence. Keeping in mind the standard being sought (preponderance of
the evidence), IOs will follow a four-step process when analyzing the evidence they collected.
 80                                                        AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      3.49.1. What are the allegations? Review the allegations framed prior to starting the
      investigation. Do they still make sense? The report must include properly framed
      allegations.
      3.49.2. What are the facts (what happened)? Facts are not conclusions, but rather
      information and data, from which the IO must draw logical conclusions. Facts are not
      always consistent and are often in dispute. The IO is responsible for determining what the
      facts were at a specific point in time. He or she evaluates the credibility of witness testimony
      considering factors such as demeanor, bias, motive to lie, knowledge, ability to observe,
      recency of observations, corroborating evidence, and prior inconsistent statements. The IO
      must analyze the available evidence and use the preponderance of the evidence standard to
      make the tough call and arrive at logical/concrete conclusions.
      3.49.3. What standards apply? What laws, regulations, policies, or other controlling
      standards were allegedly violated? Applicable standards should have been identified at the
      beginning when framing the allegations. The report should include a complete discussion of
      the standards in effect at the time of the alleged violation.
      3.49.4. Were the standards violated (was a rule, regulation, policy, or law broken)? To reach
      a conclusion, the IO must consider and discuss the credible evidence that supports or does
      not support whether the subject violated a particular standard. Utilizing the preponderance of
      the evidence standard, the IO concludes the allegation is or is not substantiated. IOs should
      consult their legal advisor when in doubt about whether a particular action violated Air Force
      standards. However, the final decision rests with the appointing authority during the final
      approval process.
3.50. Category of Findings. There are only two possible findings for each allegation:
      3.50.1. Substantiated: A substantiated finding results when a preponderance of the
      evidence supports the complainant‘s allegation of a wrong or violation of law, regulation,
      procedure, or Air Force policy or standard. The facts indicate a violation of standards
      occurred.
      3.50.2. Not Substantiated: A not substantiated finding results when a preponderance of the
      evidence supports the conclusion the alleged wrongdoing did not occ ur. The facts indicate
      no violation of standards occurred.
3.51. Policy Regarding Report Writing.
      3.51.1. All IG investigations (and their findings) must be documented with objectivity,
      thoroughness, and in a timely manner. The ROI must maintain an impartial and balanced
      tone and exclude any biases for or against the complainant, subject, or witnesses. An ROI
      must be a stand-alone document—all the essential facts, documents, portions of regulations,
      interviews, etc., must be included in the report so a reviewer can arrive at a determination
      without reference to information outside the report.
         3.51.1.1. The IO must sign the report.
         3.51.1.2. The appointing authority approves the report in writing.
         3.51.1.3. Address each of the framed allegations in the report. If the appointing authority
         determines an allegation should not be examined in the investigation, the IO must
         document the appointing authority‘s decision.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 81


   3.51.2. Recommendations are optional at the discretion of the appointing authority. If an IO
   is tasked to make recommendations, the recommendations are not binding.
       3.51.2.1. If requested, recommendations will be provided under separate cover and not as
       part of the ROI. Refer to Attachment 10 to determine where to place the document in
       the case file.
       3.51.2.2. If the appointing authority requests recommendations, they should be tied to the
       findings and stated as succinctly and objectively as possible. IOs will not recommend
       specific command or administrative actions.
   3.51.3. IGs will refer IOs to this instruction and the SAF/IGQ IO Guide for specific
   information and techniques on report writing.
   3.51.4. All IG investigative case files must comply with the standardized IG case file format
   described in paragraph 3.52 and 3.53, and Attachment 10.
3.52. Case File Format. A case file is a standardized compilation of documents relevant to an
IG complaint. The case file consists of three sections. Section I, the Administrative File, is
always used and contains documents such as the Complainant Notificatio n Letter, Progress
Reports, and recommendations if requested. The documents in Section I are solely used to
supervise and manage the complaint resolution. Section II, Report of Investigation, is the formal
investigative report prepared by the investigating officer. For example, this section contains the
findings, analysis, and conclusion. Section II is only used when the complaint resolution
strategy results in an investigation. Section II contains the bulk of the IOs work and is normally
releasable under FOIA. Section III, Support Documents, contains all the supporting evidence
associated with the Report of Investigation and additional Quality Control Checklists. The
witness testimony, chronology of events, and the appointment letter are maintained i n Section
III. All case file documents will be attached to the applicable ACTS electronic case file.
   3.52.1. Attachment 10 shows the case file format which matches the ACTS ―Attachments‖
   tab.
   3.52.2. Paper copies of the investigative case file must be organized according to
   Attachment 10 using the tabs applicable in each situation. Prepare a Table of Contents
   showing the contents of the case file. Unused tabs should be documented in the table of
   contents with the statement ―This tab not used.‖ There is no need to include the unused tabs
   in the actual case file.
   3.52.3. As a minimum, case files for cases resulting in investigation must contain the
   following documentation (indexed and inserted in Sections I, II, and III at the prescribed tab):
   the complaint; tasking memos (if any); ROI; legal review (if obtained); the testimony
   (transcribed or summarized, if taken); copy of response to complainant; copy of notification
   to the subject‘s commander; copy of commander‘s action (if applicable); and administrative
   documents including memos, progress reports, and complaint acknowledgment or interim
   memos to the complainant.
   3.52.4. For cases requiring DoD approval, a paper case file is required. Forward the entire
   paper case file to SAF/IGQ after appointing authority approval via the appropriate
   MAJCOM, NAF, FOA, and/or DRU as AF/JAA and DoD IG require SAF/IGQ to provide
 82                                                        AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      them with printed reports, properly tabbed and formatted. Since ACTS is the System of
      Record for storing IG records, IG offices should not maintain paper copies of records.
3.53. Report of Investigation (ROI) Format.
      3.53.1. The completed Report of Investigation is Section II of the case file. Section III of the
      finalized IG case file contains the documents supporting the results of the investigation in
      Section II. Attachme nts 11 and 12 show the proper ROI format.
      3.53.2. For specific guidance on how to write an ROI, IOs must use this instruction and the
      SAF/IGQ IO Guide.
3.54. Other Forms/Checklists.
      3.54.1. Reprisal Investigation Evaluation Form. Reprisal cases may have a Reprisal
      Investigation Evaluation Form completed when the case is finalized. For specific guidance
      on how to complete this form, see Attachme nt 23.
      3.54.2. Mental Health Referral Evaluation Form. For cases involving IMHE referrals, the
      IO may complete an MHE Referral Evaluation Form. For specific guidance on how to
      complete this form, see Attachme nt 24.
3.55. Requirement for Progress Reports (PR). PRs to the appointing authority and to higher-
level IGs are required for all cases when they are not finalized by the suspense date. The first PR
is due on or before the suspense date and on the first of every month thereafter until the
investigation is completed, or final reports are forwarded to SAF/IGQ. Higher-level IGs may
request additional PRs as necessary. Document the status of the case, changes since last PR and
the estimated completion date in a case note in ACTS.
3.55. (ACC)Requirement for Progress Reports (PR). The IG office with current control of
the Report of Investigation (ROI) will assume responsibility for providing progress reports and
placing notes in ACTS when they become due.
3.56. Requirement for Interim Responses (IR). IRs to complainants are required 60 days
after receipt of the complaint, and every 60 days thereafter until the final response is provided.
IGs should update the complainant on the status, not the substance, of the investigation. Attach
IRs in ACTS and document on the suspense tab. The IG office with current control of the IG
case makes IR to complainants. IRs are required until the case is forwarded to IG DoD.

Phase 3: Quality Review Phase

Section 3H—Step 7: IG Quality Review (< 7 Days)

3.57. Requirement for IG Quality Reviews. All investigations will receive a quality review
(QR) by the IG staff to ensure completeness, compliance with this instruction and other
appropriate directives, and objectivity.
3.57. (ACC)Requirement for IG Quality Reviews. The office conducting the investigation,
and higher headquarters IGs conducting quality reviews will prepare the ACC quality review
checklist and file it in Section III, Tab F of the case file when it is forwarded to higher
headquarters for review.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                  83


   3.57.1. If the IG QR detects deficiencies with the investigation or report, the IG should
   return the case to the IO to be reworked.
   3.57.2. If a case needs to be returned to the IO to be reworked due to deficiencies, the IG
   must explain the specific problems and rationale to the IO.
   3.57.3. If an IG disagrees with the IOs findings and conclusions, document the disagreement
   and proceed with the next step in the Complaint Resolution Process.

Section 3I—Step 8: Technical Review (< 5 Days)

3.58. When is a Technical Review Necessary?
   3.58.1. Sometimes an IO will be asked to evaluate information or interpret guidance in a
   technical field beyond his/her normal range of expertise. When this happens, the appointing
   authority should ask for a technical (expert) review of the applicable evidence, findings, and
   conclusions before the report is sent for a legal sufficiency review.
      3.58.1.1. The key question will be how important the technical information is to the
      overall conclusions in the report.
      3.58.1.2. A good faith effort will be made to retain complainant confidentiality. The
      Technical Advisor should only review the portion of the investigation required to provide
      the technical assistance and should be advised of the need to maintain confidentiality.
   3.58.2. A technical review must explain, in detail, whether the report is technically
   sufficient. If the report is found to be technically inaccurate or deficient, it will be returned
   to the IO to be reworked. In this case, the technical review must explain, in detail, the
   reasons why the report was deficient and the minimum requirements for sufficiency.

Section 3J—Step 9: Legal Review (< 14 Days)

3.59. Requirement for Legal Reviews.
   3.59.1. IGs will have all Reports of Investigations reviewed by a JA for legal sufficiency.
   The JA will provide written reviews before the appointing authority approves the report and
   its findings. IGs should ensure the local legal office staff is familiar with the SAF/IGQ JAG
   Guide to IG Investigations.
   3.59.2. A different JA should perform the legal review than the individual assigned to advise
   the IO.
   3.59.3. A thorough legal review is critical to the IG investigative process and IG-JA-CC
   relationships. The written review must reflect a thorough review of the case, to include
   references to evidence where applicable, and ample analysis to support (or refute) the IO‘s
   conclusions and findings. It follows that an independent legal review of all testimony and
   evidence is essential to complete this goal. Moreover, a thorough legal review is a stand-
   alone document, which means if the legal review becomes separated from the ROI, the reader
   would nevertheless be able to understand the who, what, where, how, and why of the
   investigation and legal analysis.
   3.59.4. At a minimum, a legal review must examine whether: (1) Each allegation has been
   addressed; (2) Allegations allege a violation of law, regulation, procedure, or policy; (3)
84                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


     The IO reasonably applied the preponderance of the evidence standard in arriving at findings;
     (4) Conclusions are supported by, and consistent with, the findings ; (5) The investigation
     complies with all applicable legal and administrative requirements; (6) Any errors or
     irregularities exist, and if so, their legal effects, if any.
        3.59.4.1. If the legal review states the case is not legally sufficient, it must include a
        detailed explanation of what the report is missing or lacking that makes it legally
        insufficient. The IG will return the case to the IO to be reworked IAW Section 3K. The
        IO must make the report legally sufficient.
        3.59.4.2. In cases in which the JA review simply disagrees with the IO‘s ultimate
        findings and conclusions, the rationale for that disagreement will be provided to the IO
        for consideration. If the IO, after considering the review, disagrees with the JA opinion,
        the IO will not be directed to change the disputed findings or conclusions. Instead, the
        ROI and legal review will be provided to the appointing authority for a final
        determination. In situations where the disputed findings pertain to an investigation of
        reprisal, restriction, or IMHE referral, the appointing authority will provide his
        determination but, IG DoD will be the final determination authority.
     3.59.5. If the appointing authority disagrees with the IO‘s findings and/or conclusions, the
     appointing authority must issue alternative findings and conclusions and document them in
     an addendum. In such case, the appointing authority‘s determination must include the
     rationale for his or her decision. Merely deferring to or referencing the legal review is
     insufficient. Rather, the appointing authority‘s determination must separately set out the
     basis for the determination through an analysis and issue new findings and/or conclusions.
     3.59.6. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and SAF/IGQ may adopt a lower-level legal review. All
     investigations require a minimum of one legal review. Additional reviews are optional but
     required if higher level quality review indicates the need for an additional legal review or if
     an addendum is accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis in
     the ROI. HHQ IGs may consult with HHQ JA on sufficiency of lower level legal review as
     part of their QR.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                  85

                                          approval is required. If the appointing authority
                                          disagrees with the IO, see paragraph 3.62.2
 2      Not legally sufficient            Report is returned to the IO to be reworked. The IO
                                          must make the report legally sufficient.
 3      Administratively sufficient       Appointing authority approves and sends final
                                          response to complainant, unless higher-level QR and
                                          approval is required. If the appointing authority
                                          disagrees with the IO, see paragraph 3.62.2
 4      Not administratively sufficient   Report is returned to the IO to be reworked if required.

Section 3K—Step 10: Reworking the Report (< 7 Days)

3.60. When Are Reports Returne d for Rework? If a report is found to be insufficient, then
the report will be returned to the IO for rework.
     3.60.1. The reason for the rework and the dates must be logged into ACTS.
     3.60.2. IG quality reviews, technical reviews, and/or legal reviews must provide reasons why
     the report was not sufficient and detail the minimum requirements for sufficiency.

Section 3L—Step 11: Closing the Case (< 5 Days)

3.61. Key Terms. This section uses the following key terms: appointing authority, case file,
closure, colonel (or civilian equivalent), completion, follow-up, lieutenant colonel (or below),
report of investigation, reprisal, restriction, senior official, third-party complainant, and third-
party complaint. Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms.
3.62. Appointing Authority Approval. Approval of an IG investigation rests with the
appointing authority, except for investigations of reprisal, restriction, or IMHE referral.
     3.62.1. The appointing authority will sign and approve the Report of Investigation (ROI) in
     writing.
     3.62.2. In cases where the appointing authority disagrees with the IO‘s findings and
     conclusions, the appointing authority will non-concur with the ROI in writing in an
     addendum to the ROI. Merely deferring to or referencing the legal review (if applicable) or
     findings and conclusion is insufficient. The appointing authority must clearly explain the
     reasons for the disagreement and the supporting rationale in the addendum. The IO‘s
     findings, legal review, and the appointing authority‘s addendum will be retained as part of
     the investigation case file and forwarded to the next higher-level IG for review via ACTS.
 86                                                       AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      3.62.3. Upon appointing authority approval of the ROI, the IG will place the case in
      completed status in ACTS.
3.63. Closure Require ments. Upon the appointing authority‘s approval of an investigation, all
notification procedures IAW the applicable notification matrix must be completed, unless
otherwise directed by a higher-level IG. Use Table 3.17 for investigations on lieutenant colonels
(or below), Table 4.2 for senior officials, and Table 5.1 for colonels (or civilian equivalent).
Refer to specific chapters for additional closure requirements on: investigations against senior
officials or colonels (or civilian equivalent); investigations regarding allegations of reprisal,
restriction, or IMHE referral; congressional taskings; MEO complaints; and DoD Hotline
complaints.
      3.63.1. Mandatory actions required to close a case are:
         3.63.1.1. ROI approved by appointing authority.
         3.63.1.2. Subject‘s commander notified of results.
         3.63.1.3. Complainant notified of results.
         3.63.1.4. Command action if appropriate.
      3.63.2. EXCEPTIONS:
         3.63.2.1. For closure requirements on reprisal cases, refer to paragraph 6.10.
         3.63.2.2. For closure requirements on restriction investigations, refer to paragraph 7.10.
         3.63.2.3. For closure requirements on IMHE investigations, refer to paragraph 8.9.
         3.63.2.4. For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of a
         congressional complaint, refer to paragraph 9.6.
         3.63.2.5. For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of
         an MEO complaint, refer to paragraph 10.5.
         3.63.2.6. For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of a
         DoD Hotline complaint, refer to paragraph 12.6.
      3.63.3. IGs at every level are required to update all completed actions in ACTS (refer to the
      ACTS User’s Manual) and are required to maintain an electronic case file in ACTS until its
      final disposition date. Leave case in completed status in ACTS until all required quality,
      legal, and higher-level reviews as well as required notifications and any command actions are
      complete, at which time the case will be closed in ACTS.
      3.63.4. Cases pending command/corrective action will be placed in follow-up on the
      suspense tab in ACTS until a copy of the action taken is received.
      3.63.5. Investigations involving allegations of reprisal, restriction, IMHE referral, or
      allegations against a colonel (or civilian equivalent), must be forwarded through the
      applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG to SAF/IGQ for quality review. Transfer the
      case in ACTS to the next appropriate level for review.
3.64. Notification Require ments for Case Closures.
      3.64.1. Table 3.17 describes the notification requirements upon completion of IG
      investigations when the subject is a lieutenant colonel (or below).
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                87


   3.64.2. The appointing authority must notify the subject‘s commander of the results of the
   investigation in writing. The commander must, in turn, notify the subject of the results of the
   investigation in writing. The notification letters must include a description of the specific
   allegations and related findings. The letters must not contain the names of the complainants,
   witnesses, or other subjects of the investiga tion. Refer to Attachme nt 14 for a sample
   results notification to the subject‘s commander with an endorsement for the commander‘s
   notification to the subject.
   3.64.3. The authority responsible for making release determinations will automatically
   provide the subject‘s commander with a copy of the relevant portions of an approved and
   substantiated report of investigation (without attachments) for determining appropriate
   command action. Recipients must comply with paragraph 14.7 of this instruction and all
   other applicable guidance in Chapter 14.
      3.64.3.1. In the case where there is an addendum that becomes part of the ROI, the
      originating appointing authority of the addendum is the authority responsible for making
      release determinations.
3.65. Responding to Complainants. Final response to the complainant is generally the final
step before case closure.
   3.65.1. Responses to complainants must be timely, thorough, and supported by the evidence.
   3.65.2. Responses to complainants should address all allegations as framed during the
   complaint analysis. The response does not necessarily have to address each individual
   question or allegation originally made by the complainant.
   3.65.3. Complainants will receive a response from the level that conducted the investigation,
   unless otherwise directed by higher-level IG. EXCEPTIONS:
      3.65.3.1. For reprisal, restriction, and IMHE referral cases, SAF/IGQ will provide a copy
      of IG DoD final approval of the investigation to the applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA,
      or DRU. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU to provide the
      final response to the complainant. See paragraph 6.10.2, 7.10.2, and 8.9 respectively
      for further information.

   writing, with the findings of the investigation. When responding to third-party complainants,
   refer to paragraph 3.65.7.
   3.65.5. Response to the complainant must inform the complainant they may request the next
   higher-level IG review if they are not satisfied with the complaint resolution and desire such
   a review, or the complainant may appeal to Air Force Board for Correction of Military
   Records (AFBCMR). Include complainant IG appeal rights in the final response
   memorandum to the complainant.
      3.65.5.1. It is the complainant‘s responsibility to request this review in writing to the
      next level IG within 90 days of receiving the response and to provide specific reasons
      why they believe the original complaint resolution was not valid or adequate.

         3.65.5.2. It is the complainant‘s responsibility to provide additional information that
         justifies a higher-level review on previously considered issues.
         3.65.5.3. Simply disagreeing with the findings or with the command action taken in
         response to the findings is not sufficient reason to justify a higher-level review or
         additional investigation.
      3.65.6. Ensure responses to complainants are consistent with FOIA and PA release
      guidelines in Chapter 14.
      3.65.7. Third-party complainants are only entitled to an acknowledgement that their
      complaint was received. They will not receive information regarding the resolution unless
      the affected party authorizes the release of information to that third-party via a Privacy Act
      release.

      to SAF/GCA and the exhibits thereto when requested.
4.6. SOUIFs on Brigadier Generals.
      4.6.1. A SOUIF is a written summary of adverse information about an officer,
      documentation of the command action, plus any comments from the subject officer regarding
      the written summary and documentation. A SOUIF is created for use during the general
      officer promotion/federal recognition process and exists solely for that purpose.
         4.6.1.1. SOUIFs on brigadier generals are based on adverse information not previously
         considered by the Senate pursuant to the officer‘s appointment to that grade.
      4.6.2. SAF/IGS acts as a central repository for all adverse information on senior officials
      and prepares the draft adverse information summaries (AIS) and documentation of command
      action for review by the SOUIF decision authority (SAF/GC).
      4.6.3. SAF/GC, acting for the SECAF, determi nes the content of the SOUIF and whether
      the SOUIF will be provided to a selection board.
         4.6.3.1. The subject officer will be given a copy of the draft AIS and documentation of
         the command action prepared for the selection board and will be afforded an opportunity
         to submit written comments to the selection board IAW 10 USC 615 (a)(6)(A).
             4.6.3.1.1. Attachments to officer‘s comments are discouraged. If provided, they
             must be limited to matters directly raised in the AIS and/or command action and not
             otherwise included in the Officer‘s Selection Record (OSR).
         4.6.3.2. The draft AIS, documentation and the officer‘s comments (if any) will be
         reviewed by AF/JAA and SAF/GCM before being forwarded to SAF/GC for final
         decision. (The officer will be advised if a substantial change to the AIS is necessitated by
         the comments.)
         4.6.3.3. If SAF/GC determines the AIS and documentation will be provided to the board,
         the subject officer‘s comments will accompany the AIS and documentation to form the
         approved SOUIF.
         4.6.3.4. AF/DPG provides a copy of the approved SOUIF to the subject‘s senior rater on
         or before the Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF) accountability date if possible.
         4.6.3.5. If an eligible officer is selected for promotion/federal recognition, the
         information contained in the SOUIF may also be considered during the nomination and
         confirmation process.
         4.6.3.6. Information provided to a selection board may not be provided to subsequent
         boards unless SAF/GC has made a new determination that the information will be
         forwarded to the board, and the individual is afforded another opportunity to comment.
         A decision not to provide a SOUIF to a selection board does not preclude a decision to
         provide it to a subsequent board.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                            97


     4.6.3.7. The subject officer will be notified of SAF/GC‘s final decision. If the SOUIF is
     established, the officer will be given a copy of the SOUIF provided to the selection
     board.
  4.6.4. Adverse information documented in the Officer‘s Selection Record, e.g., UCMJ
  action, administrative reprimand, admonishment or counseling, will not be included in a
  SOUIF.
  4.6.5. Adverse information not considered by a selection board will be presented to a
  promotion review board (PRB) before SECAF decides whether to support the officer for
  appointment to the next higher grade. (All SOUIF policies noted above apply to PRB
  SOUIFs.) A PRB SOUIF may also include a copy of the report of investigation.

       equivalent) are obviously frivolous, the IG will forward the final complaint analysis
       document to the next higher-level IG for approval. For guidance on documenting the
       complaint analysis, reference paragraphs 3.11 and 3.14, and Attachme nt 2. In addition
       to Attachme nt 2, use ACTS case notes to document the resolution strategy. The next
       higher-level IG will review the complaint analysis document. Upon higher-level IG
       approval, the IG will close the complaint in ACTS and dismiss it as frivolous.
       5.4.1.2. If the complaint analysis determines allegations against a colonel (or civilian
       equivalent) do not warrant an IG investigation, the IG will forward the final complaint
       analysis document to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.
       If the complaint analysis determines the allegations should be referred, follow procedures
       in Chapter 3 and paragraph 5.4.1.4.
       5.4.1.3. To avoid the appearance of self-investigation, complaints containing allegations
       against the IG‘s commander, the IG, or IG staff member must be transferred to the next
       higher-level IG. See paragraphs 1.8.1 and 3.34.5 for additional information on
       impartiality.
       5.4.1.4. If the complainant‘s allegations against a colonel (or civilian equivalent) do not
       involve IG issues, but are appropriate for command channels, refer the allegations to the
       appropriate commander. The IG referral memo should contain the notification and
       closure requirements outlined in paragraph 5.3 through 5.3.1.2 and 5.8.

       5.9.1.2. Commanders will, upon completion of a CDI, provide SAF/IGQ (through their
       local IG) with a copy of the required documents as listed in Table 5.3 rules 1 or 2 (as

    5.10.1. The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC) determines if a SOUIF is created.
       5.10.1.1. SAF/IGQ prepares adverse information summaries (AIS) from investigative
       and other files, or from disciplinary or administrative command actions.
       5.10.1.2. SOUIFs on colonels are based on adverse information which includes any
       substantiated adverse findings or conclusions from an officially documented investigation
       or inquiry, or other official records or reports, arising generally withi n the ten-year period
106                                                    AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      preceding the convening date of the selection board that will consider the officer for
      promotion to general officer grade.
      5.10.1.3. SOUIFs are created for use during the general officer promotion process and
      exist solely for that purpose.
  5.10.2. The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC), acting for the SECAF, determines
  whether the SOUIF will be provided to a selection board.
      5.10.2.1. Officers will be provided a copy of the draft AIS being considered for
      submission to the promotion board and will be afforded an opportunity to submit written
      comments on that information to SAF/GC IAW 10 USC 615 (a)(7)(A)(i) and (ii), and
      before SAF/GC makes a final determination.
      5.10.2.2. The draft AIS and the officer‘s comments (if any) will be reviewed by AF/JAA
      and SAF/GCM before being forwarded to SAF/GC for final decision.
      5.10.2.3. If SAF/GC approves the SOUIF, the SOUIF is then provided to AF/DPO.
      5.10.2.4. AF/DPO provides a copy of the approved SOUIF to the subject‘s senior rater

      information contained in the SOUIF may also be considered during the nomination and
      confirmation process.
      5.10.2.5. Information provided to a selection board may not be provided to subsequent
      boards unless SAF/GC has made a new determination that the information will be
      forwarded to the board, and the individual has again been afforded an opportunity to
      comment. Further, a decision not to provide a SOUIF to a promotion board does not
      preclude a decision to provide it to a subsequent board.
  5.10.3. A commander‘s decision regarding infor mation in an Unfavorable Information File
  (UIF) or Officer‘s Selection Record (OSR) maintained by the Air Force Personnel System is
  unrelated to SAF/GC‘s decision to place this information in a SOUIF.
      5.10.3.1. SAF/GC will not usually create a SOUIF if an official record of nonjudicial
      punishment or other adverse information is maintained in an officer's selection record
      (OSR), as required by AFI 36-2608.
  5.10.4. Adverse information not substantiated in time for review by a general officer
  selection or federal recognition board will be presented to a promotion review board before
  SECAF decides whether to support the officer for appointment to the next higher grade.

   6.3.3. Nothing in this instruction will dissuade commanders from taking timely and
   appropriate corrective actions for legitimate reasons, including violations of the UCMJ,
   violations of other criminal statutes, or other misconduct, whether or not information
   regarding the misconduct came through a protected communication. Commanders should
   understand the prohibitions on reprisal and restriction and should coordinate with the
   servicing JA for effective legal guidance on these issues.

     6.3.4. Air Force members may file complaints of reprisal with IGs at any level and receive
     the protections of 10 USC 1034.
     6.3.5. To gain statutory protection of the law, the Air Force member must file the complaint
     with any IG within 60 days of becoming aware of the unfavorable personnel action that is the
     subject of the allegation. The IG may waive this time requirement if they determine there
     are extenuating circumstances justifying the delay in filing the complaint or there is special
     Air Force interest in the matter. Refer to Table 3.12, rule 3 for additional information.
6.4. Policy for Receipt of Reprisal Complaints. The following outlines Air Force policy for
receiving reprisal complaints. A complaint is not considered an allegation of reprisal unless the
answers to the first two questions of the acid test (Attachment 21) are ―Yes.‖
     6.4.1. Military Me mbers. Air Force IGs must advise military members alleging reprisal of
     the provisions of 10 USC 1034 and DoDD 7050.06, and of the rights afforded to
     complainants under the Whistleblower Protection Statute. IGs s hould use Attachme nt 17,
     Whistleblower Rights under 10 USC 1034, to assist them.
        6.4.1.1. The IG must comply with the notification requirements described in paragraph
        6.5, and depending on the subject‘s grade, paragraph 3.32, 4.3, or 5.6 as appropriate.
        6.4.1.2. IGs should ask complainants whether they have also filed their complaint with
        IG DoD. If the complainant has, then IGs should include this in the notification letter to
        IG DoD (refer to paragraph 6.5). No complaint analysis at their level is required unless
        otherwise directed by a higher-level IG (refer to paragraph 6.6.3).
        6.4.1.3. IGs must ask the complainant whether the allegations that constituted the
        member‘s protected communication were previously addressed.        For additional
        information, refer to paragraph 6.6.2.
     6.4.2. If an IG receives a complaint from a civilian employee in which they allege reprisal,
     follow the guidance in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1. Reprisal Referral for Civilian Employees.

     alleging Air Force civil service employees, nonappropriated fund employees, or defense
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                109


   contractor employees are the victims of reprisal. These employees receive protection from
   statutes other than 10 USC 1034.
   6.4.4. 29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1614 requires reprisal allegations in connection
   with an EEO complaint be processed through the EEO procedures.
6.5. Notification Require ments for Reprisal Complaints. IAW DoDD 7050.06, IG DoD must
be notified (through SAF/IGQ) within 10 duty days from the date an IG receives a complaint
containing allegations of reprisal. To meet IG DoD‘s 10-day notification requirement, IGs at all
levels will notify SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG within 7
duty days using the letter format in Attachme nt 18. Attach the letter in ACTS and send the
notification in ACTS to the next higher-level IG.
   6.5.1. Before sending the notification, the IG will determine if the complaint needs to be
   transferred to another IG. If so, notification requirements belong to the receiving IG.
   Reference Tables 3.7 and 3.8.
   6.5.2. Before sending the notification, the IG will answer the first two questions of the acid
   test found in Attachme nt 21. If the answer to questions one and two are both ―Yes,‖ a
   reprisal allegation notification is required. If the answer to either question is ―No,‖ there is
   no requirement for a reprisal notification. The next higher level IG must review and approve
   this decision.
       6.5.2.1. Prior to sending the notification, if the IG determines that while the answers to
       questions one and two are ―Yes,‖ the reason for the perso nnel action is not reprisal (i.e.,
       the action was taken for a valid reason), the required notification can include a
       recommendation to dismiss the allegation.
       6.5.2.2. A recommendation to dismiss the allegation must include the rationale for the
       selected resolution strategy and supporting documentation.
   6.5.3. Forward a copy of the written complaint, or a detailed narrative of the allegations,
   with the notification letter.
   6.5.4. IGs receiving allegations not within the purview of the Air Force will transfer the
   complaint to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. SAF/IGQ
   will transfer the complaint to the appropriate agency.
6.6. Conducting a Reprisal Complaint Analysis (RCA). The IG receiving the complaint must
expeditiously conduct a reprisal complaint analysis to determine whether an investigation is
warranted. Within 29 days after receipt of the complaint, the IG must notify SAF/IGQ (through
their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG) of the results of the complaint analysis.
Reserve and Guard IGs must complete the complaint analysis by the end of the next Unit
Training Assembly after receiving the complaint. Follow the format shown in either
Attachment 19 or 20 when completing a complaint analysis into allegations of reprisal.
   6.6.1. Before conducting an RCA, the IG must find out if the issues that constituted the
   protected communication were previously addressed.
       6.6.1.1. If the issues were previously addressed, IGs should obtain a copy of the
       applicable documents from the appropriate agency.
110                                                    AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


      6.6.1.2. If the issues were not previously addressed, the IG will conduct a complaint
      analysis on them to determine the appropriate avenue for resolution.
  6.6.2. A reprisal complaint analysis will be conducted following the procedures in Section
  3C and this paragraph. Document the reprisal complaint analysis following the format in
  either Attachme nt 19 or 20. The IG may consult with the servicing legal office prior to
  formalizing the complaint analysis.
      6.6.2.1. IGs should refer to IGDG 7050.6, Guide to Investigating Reprisal and Improper
      Referrals for Mental Health Evaluations, and to the Acid Test for Reprisal (Attachment
      21) as a guide to address the reprisal allegations. The reprisal complaint analysis will be
      completed within 29 days of receipt by the office conducting the RCA. When
      documenting an RCA, the IG will answer the first three questions of the Acid Test. If the
      answers to the first three acid test questions are "Yes," the IG will complete/conclude the
      reprisal complaint analysis with a recommendation to the appointing authority to
      investigate unless a decision to dismiss can be logically derived primarily from
      documentary evidence and minimal clarification interviews. If insufficient documentary
      evidence exists to recommend dismissal, investigation is required. During an RCA,
      answering question 4 of the Acid Test is not required. Consult the appropriate
      MAJCOM, JFHQ, or NAF IGQ and/or the JA prior to finalizing the complaint analysis.
      6.6.2.2. If an investigation is warranted, notify SAF/IGQ through the appropriate
      MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU via ACTS.
      6.6.2.3. If a reprisal complaint analysis determines a reprisal investigation is not
      warranted, the IG conducting the complaint analysis must forward a paper copy of the
      analysis including a copy of all supporting documents, to SAF/IGQ through their
      MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG office. IGs must put the case in completed
      status in ACTS and transfer the case to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ,
      FOA, or DRU IG office.
         6.6.2.3.1. SAF/IGQ will provide an interim response to complainants informing them
         the complaint analysis was forwarded to IG DoD for final determination. IGs will not
         advise the complainant of the recommendation that was sent to IG DoD.
         6.6.2.3.2. SAF/IGQ will forward the complaint analysis to IG DoD for approval.
         6.6.2.3.3. If IG DoD agrees with the Air Force‘s determination, they will notify
         SAF/IGQ who will in turn notify the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. It is the
         responsibility of the MAJCOM (SAF/IGQ for ANG cases), FOA, or DRU IG to
         notify the complainant there is insufficient evidence to conduct a reprisal
         investigation under 10 USC 1034. Upon case closure, the MAJCOM IGQs will
         notify (via ACTS) the IG that conducted the complaint analysis.
         6.6.2.3.4. If IG DoD disagrees with the Air Force‘s determination, they may retain
         the complaint for investigation or direct the Air Force to conduct an investigation.
         SAF/IGQ will normally delegate the investigation down to the lowest-level IG office
         through the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.
      6.6.2.4. If the complaint analysis determines the allegation does not meet the definition
      of reprisal under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                111


      document the analysis in the RCA. Use Attachme nt 22 for the acid test for abuse of
      authority in your analysis.
   6.6.3. If the complainant files concurrent complaints with an Air Force IG and IG DoD, the
   IG DoD will conduct the complaint clarification. IG DoD may direct the Air Force to
   conduct an investigation.
   6.6.4. IGs or IG staff will not conduct formal or sworn interviews during the reprisal
   complaint analysis, but they may conduct informal interviews (not sworn or transcribed). If
   the responsible management official (RMO) is interviewed, avoid questions related to motive
   or RMO reasons. To the maximum extent possible, base the analysis on documentary
   evidence and information gathered from the complainant and from witnesses who are not
   potential subjects.
6.7. Investigating Reprisal Complaints. Reprisal investigations will be conducted IAW
DoDD 7050.06 and this instruction.
   6.7.1. If IG DoD receives a reprisal complaint directly from a complainant, IG DoD will
   conduct the reprisal complaint analysis. If IG DoD elects to have the Air Force conduct the
   investigation, they will forward the analysis and a tasking letter to SAF/IGQ. SAF/IGQ will
   forward the package to the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG for proper handling of the
   complaint.
   6.7.2. IAW DoDD 7050.06, MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, and DRU IGs must provide a progress
   report (PR) to IG DoD (through SAF/IGQ) and an interim response (IR) to the complainant if
   the investigation is not completed within 180 days after receipt of the allegations. The letters
   must include the reasons for the delay and an estimated time of completion for the
   investigation. IGs must also comply with Air Force requirements for PRs and IRs as
   specified in paragraphs 3.55 and 3.56 of this instruction. If the investigation is not
   completed within 180 days, the IG conducting the investigation will prepare the PR and IR to
   the complainant, e.g., the installation IG forwards the PR to the MAJCOM for forwarding to
   SAF/IGQ. Document PRs in a case note, attach IRs, and document on the Suspense Tab in
   ACTS. Use the sample format in Attachment 13 for PRs.
   6.7.3. If the investigation determines the allegation does not meet the definition of reprisal
   under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the
   analysis in the ROI. Use Attachme nt 22 for the acid test for abuse of authority in your
   analysis.
   6.7.4. The final Report of Investigation (ROI) must identify all protected communications,
   all personnel actions alleged to be acts of reprisal taken after the protected communication
   was made, and all RMOs. If an RMO identified in the complaint analysis is not a subject of
   the investigation, fully explain the rationale in the ROI.
   6.7.5. The final ROI must contain a thorough Acid Test for Reprisal with all four questions
   answered for each allegation of reprisal. Refer to Attachme nt 21 for the format to conduct
   an acid test.
   6.7.6. The final case file must contain a chronology of events beginning with the
   complainant‘s initial protected communication plus any subsequent PCs and list all adverse
 112                                                    AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   personnel actions taken against the military member after the initial protected
   communication.
   6.7.7. When a complainant alleges a combination of reprisal, and/or restriction, and/or
   IMHE referral within the same complaint, IGs must ensure all applicable reporting
   requirements for reprisal, restriction, or IMHE referral are completed IAW Chapters 6, 7,
   and 8.
       6.7.7.1. If, upon clarification, it is clear that the MHE referral was done properly, this
       finding must be included in the ROI and the allegation(s) of reprisal must still be
       investigated.
   6.7.8. All reprisal investigations containing allegations against colonels and below must
   have at least one legal review. Additional reviews are optional but required if higher level
   quality review indicates the need for an additional legal review or if an addendum is
   accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis in the ROI.
6.8. Reprisal Investigation Evaluation Form. To ensure a thorough investigation has been
completed, it is recommended a Reprisal Investigation Evaluation Form (Attachme nt 23) be
completed for reprisal investigations. Additionally, IGDG 7050.6 co ntains an investigative
worksheet (figure 3-1) that may be helpful.
6.9. Reviewing and Approving Reprisal Investigations. IG DoD must approve all military
reprisal investigations regardless of the level where the investigation was conducted. IGs must
mail the entire case file (see Attachment 10) to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA,
or DRU IG and transfer the case in ACTS.
   6.9.1. Appointing authorities may notify the subject‘s commander of the investigation
   findings when they approve the case, but must inform the commander the final findings
   could change because final approval and review rests with IG DoD (DoDD 7050.06,
   paragraph 6.1.5). Commanders should wait until after IG DoD has approved the Report of
   Investigation to take command action.
       6.9.1.1. IAW DoDD 7050.06, paragraph 6.3.8, a copy of command/corrective action
       must be provided to IG DoD. When command/corrective action is finalized, IGs will
       obtain a copy to include any rebuttal statements. However, if action is verbal or no action
       is taken, IGs will obtain a written description of the action from the commander. IGs will
       forward these documents to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or
       DRU IG, within 7 duty days of becoming aware of such action being completed.
       SAF/IGQ will forward the information to IG DoD.
   6.9.2. SAF/IG will provide an IR to complainants informing them the investigation has been
   completed and forwarded to IG DoD for final approval. Do not inform the complainant of
   the unapproved investigation findings (i.e., substantiated or not substantiated).
   6.9.3. Before forwarding the case file to SAF/IGQ, MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA and DRU
   IGs will conduct a quality review (QR).
   6.9.4. SAF/IGQ will conduct a QR, IAW paragraph 3.72, prior to forwarding the case to IG
   DoD.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                              113


   6.9.5. Follow the procedures specified in Section 3N and/or 3O of this instruction if, during
   higher-level QR, deficiencies are identified or the reviewing official disagrees with the
   findings.
6.10. Final Approval and Notification Require ments. IG DoD will notify SAF/IGQ upon
approval of the investigation‘s findings.
   6.10.1. SAF/IGQ will provide a copy of IG DoD‘s final approval to the applicable
   MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.
   6.10.2. The MAJCOM (SAF/IGQ for ANG), FOA, or DRU IG will provide the final
   response to the complainant within 30 days after IG DoD‘s approval of the findings as
   mandated by 10 USC 1034. Upon case closure, the MAJCOM IGQs will notify the
   installation IG via ACTS, when applicable.
      6.10.2.1. Final responses to complainants must advise them of their right to petition the
      AFBCMR for correction of adverse personnel actions (regardless of the findings in the
      case), and their right to later appeal the AFBCMR findings to the Secretary of Defense.
      Complainants should be referred to the virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF)
      (http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/) for assistance.
          6.10.2.1.1. Complainants who petition the AFBCMR should inform the AFBCMR if
          IG records exist pertaining to the pending request.
          6.10.2.1.2. SAF/IGQ will provide supporting documentation directly to the
          AFBCMR (or applicable SAF/MRB agency) upon receipt of an Official Use Request
          from the board for IG records.
      6.10.2.2. If applicable, complainants should also be advised of proper procedures for
      OPR/EPR/PRF appeal to the Evaluation Reports Appeal Board (ERAB). Complainants
      should be referred to the vMPF for assistance.
      6.10.2.3. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU IGs will provide a redacted copy of the ROI (and
      addendum if any) with the final response to the complainant. The ROI should be
      redacted using exceptions allowed by the FOIA, however, no coordination with the FOIA
      office is required. Additionally, IGs have the authority (under 10 USC 1034) to act on
      complainant requests for additional documentation from reprisal investigations without
      going through the FOIA office.
      6.10.2.4. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU IGs will attach a copy of the final response to the
      complainant in ACTS.
      6.10.2.5. SAF/IGQ will provide the final response to complainants for ANG reprisal
      investigations. SAF/IGQ is responsible for redacting the ROI and providing a copy to the
      complainant.
   6.10.3. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU IGs will forward a copy of IG DoD‘s final approval of the
   investigation to the applicable appointing authority. The appointing authority must notify the
   subject‘s commander of the final investigation findings but will not provide a copy of IG
   DoD‘s letter to the commander. The commander will notify the subject.
   6.10.4. IGs will close reprisal complaints IAW established procedures as described in
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.

       disciplinary and administrative action under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
       7.3.1.3. Civilian employees who violate this prohibition are subject to administrative or
       disciplinary action.
   7.3.2. Air Force members may file complaints of restriction with IGs at any level.
   7.3.3. Air Force members must file a complaint with any IG within 60 days of becoming
   aware of restriction. The IG may waive this time requirement if they determine there are
   extenuating circumstances justifying the delay in filing the complaint or there is special Air
   Force interest in the matter.
7.4. Policy for Receipt of Restriction Complaints. The following outlines Air Force policy for
receiving restriction complaints.
   7.4.1. Military Me mbers. Air Force IGs must advise military members alleging restriction
   of the provisions of 10 USC 1034 and DoDD 7050.06, and of the rights afforded to
   complainants under the Whistleblower Protection Statute. IGs should use Attachme nt 17,
   Whistleblower Rights Under 10 USC 1034 to assist them.
       7.4.1.1. The IG must comply with the notification requirements described in paragraph
       7.5, and depending upon the subject‘s grade, follow the procedures in paragraph 3.32,
       4.3, or 5.6 as appropriate.
       7.4.1.2. IGs should ask complainants whether they have also filed their complaint with
       IG DoD. If the complainant has, then IGs should include this in the notification letter to
       IG DoD (refer to paragraph 7.8). Close the case with no further action unless otherwise
       directed by a higher-level IG.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                              115


     7.4.2. If an IG receives a complaint from a civilian employee in which they allege
     restriction, follow the guidance in Table 7.1.

     7.4.3. IGs will not conduct investigations into complaints of restriction when the
     complainant is an Air Force civil service employee, nonappropriated fund employee, or
     defense contractor employee. These employees receive protection from statutes other than
     10 USC 1034.
7.5. Notification Require ments for Restriction Complaints. IAW DoDD 7050.06, IG DoD
must be notified (through SAF/IGQ) within 10 duty days from the date an IG receives a
complaint containing allegations of restriction. To meet IG DoD‘s 10-day notification
requirement, IGs at all levels will notify SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA,
or DRU IG within 7 duty days using the letter format in Attachme nt 18. Once notification has
been accomplished, attach the letter in ACTS and send the notification in ACTS to the next
higher-level IG.
     7.5.1. Before sending the notification, the IG will determine if the complaint needs to be
     transferred to another IG. If so, notification requirements belong to the receiving IG.
     Reference Table 3.7 and 3.8.
     7.5.2. Forward a copy of the written complaint, or a detailed narrative of the allegatio ns,
     with the notification letter.
     7.5.3. IGs receiving allegations not within the purview of the Air Force will transfer the
     complaint to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. SAF/IGQ
     will transfer the complaint to IG DoD.
7.6. Conducting a Restriction Complaint Analysis. The IG receiving the complaint must
conduct a complaint analysis to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Within 29 days
after receipt of the complaint, the IG must notify SAF/IGQ (through their MAJCOM, NAF,
JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG) of the results of the complaint analysis. Reserve and Guard IGs must
complete the complaint analysis by the end of the next Unit Training Assembly after receiving
the complaint.
     7.6.1. If the complaint analysis determines an investigation is not warranted, the IG
     conducting the complaint analysis must forward the results of the analysis, including a copy
 116                                                      AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


     of all supporting documents, to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or
     DRU IG office.
        7.6.1.1. SAF/IGQ will provide an interim response to complainants informing them the
        complaint analysis was forwarded to IG DoD for final determination. IGs will not advise
        the complainant of the recommendation that was sent to IG DoD.
        7.6.1.2. SAF/IGQ will forward the complaint analysis to IG DoD for approval.
        7.6.1.3. If IG DoD agrees with the Air Force‘s determination, they will notify SAF/IGQ
        who will in turn notify the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. It is the responsibility of
        the MAJCOM (SAF/IGQ for ANG cases), FOA, or DRU IG to notify the complainant
        there is insufficient evidence to conduct a restriction investigation under 10 USC 1034.
        Upon case closure, the MAJCOM IGQs will notify (via ACTS) the IG that conducted the
        complaint analysis.
        7.6.1.4. If IG DoD disagrees with the Air Force‘s determination, they may retain the
        complaint for investigation or direct the Air Force to conduct an investigation. SAF/IGQ
        will normally delegate the investigation down to the lowest-level IG office through the
        MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.
     7.6.2. If the complaint analysis determines the allegation is not a case of restriction, analyze
     the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the analysis in the complaint
     analysis. Use Attachme nt 22 for the acid test for abuse of authority in your analysis.
     7.6.3. IGs or IG staff should not conduct formal or sworn interviews with witnesses and/or
     responsible management officials (RMO) during complaint analysis.
7.7. Evaluating Allegations of Restriction. The IG or IO must follow the questions in Table
7.2 in determining if the elements of restriction are present.

Table 7.2. Questions for use in Evaluating Restriction.
 1     How did the RMO limit or attempt to limit the member‘s access to an IG or a Member of
       Congress?
 2     What was the intent of the RMO? (goes to what the message was)
       (1) Reasons for restricting or taking actions that created barriers to making protected
       communications;
       (2) Reasonableness of the RMO’s actions;
       (3) Motive for the RMO’s action.
 3     Would a reasonable person, under similar circumstances, believe he or she was actually
       restricted from making a lawful communication with the IG or a Member of Congress
       based on the RMO‘s actions?
NOTE: Restriction may be communicated by a variety of means (e.g., verbal, written policy,
regulation, order, procedure, counseling, or public statement) and creates a chilling effect.
7.8. Investigating Restriction Complaints. Restriction investigations will be conducted IAW
Chapter 3 of this instruction.
     7.8.1. If IG DoD receives a complaint directly from a complainant, then IG DoD will
     conduct the complaint analysis. If IG DoD tasks the Air Force to conduct the investigation,
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 117


   they will forward the analysis and a tasking letter to SAF/IGQ. SAF/IGQ will forward the
   package to the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG for proper handling of the complaint.
   7.8.2. IAW 10 USC 1034, MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, and DRU IGs must provide a progress
   report (PR) to IG DoD (through SAF/IGQ), and an interim response (IR) to the complainant
   if the investigation is not completed within 180 days after receipt of the allegations. The IG
   conducting the investigation will prepare the 180-day PR and IR. The letters must include
   the reasons for the delay and an estimated time of completion for the investigation. IGs must
   also comply with Air Force requirements for PRs and IRs as specified in paragraphs 3.55
   and 3.56. Use the sample format in Attachme nt 13 for PRs. Attach PRs and IRs in ACTS
   and document on the Suspense Tab.
   7.8.3. When a complainant alleges a combination of reprisal, and/or restriction, and/or
   IMHE referral within the same complaint, IGs must ensure all applicable reporting
   requirements for reprisal, restriction, or IMHE referral are completed IAW Chapters 6, 7,
   and 8.
       7.8.3.1. Ensure the IO investigates all the issues associated with the reprisal, restriction,
       or IMHE referral allegation(s).
   7.8.4. All restriction investigations containing allegations against colonels and below must
   have at least one legal review. Additional reviews are optional but required if higher level
   quality review indicates the need for an additional legal review or if an addendum is
   accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis in the ROI.
   7.8.5. If the investigation determines the allegation does not meet the definition of restriction
   under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the
   analysis in the complaint analysis. Use Attachme nt 22 for the acid test for abuse of authority
   in your analysis.
7.9. Reviewing and Approving Restriction Investigations. IG DoD must review and approve
all restriction investigations, regardless of the level where the investigation was conducted. IGs
must mail the entire case file (see Attachment 10) to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF,
JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG and transfer the case in ACTS.
   7.9.1. Appointing authorities may notify the subject‘s commander of the investigation
   findings when they approve the case, but must inform them that final findings could change
   because final approval and review rests with IG DoD. Commanders should wait until after
   IG DoD has approved the Report of Investigation to take command action.
       7.9.1.1. IAW DoDD 7050.06, paragraph 6.3.8, a copy of command/corrective action
       must be provided to IG DoD. When command/corrective action is finalized, IGs will
       obtain a copy to include any rebuttal statements; if action is verbal or no action is taken,
       IGs will obtain a written description of the action from the commander. IGs will forward
       these documents to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG,
       within 7 duty days of becoming aware of such action being completed. SAF/IGQ will
       forward the information to IG DoD.
   7.9.2. IGs must provide an IR to complainants informing them the investigation has been
   completed and forwarded to IG DoD for final approval. Do not inform the complainant of
   the unapproved investigation findings (i.e., substantiated or not substantiated).

   final response memo to the complainant, when applicable.
       7.10.2.1. MAJCOM (SAF/IGQ for ANG), FOA, and DRU IGs will provide a redacted
       copy of the ROI (and addendum, if any) with the final response to the complainant. The
       ROI should be redacted using exceptions allowed by the FOIA, however, no coordination
       with the FOIA office is required. Additionally, IGs have the authority (under 10 USC
       1034) to act on complainant requests for additional documentation from restriction
       investigations without going through the FOIA office.
       7.10.2.2. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU IGs will provide SAF/IGQ with a copy of the final
       response to the complainant.
   7.10.3. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU IGs will forward a copy of IG DoD final approval of the
   investigation to the applicable appointing authority. The appointing authority must notify the

       FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE (FWA) AND GROSS MISMANAGEMENT
                             COMPLAINTS

11.1. Governing Directives. AFPD 90-3, Inspector General--The Complaints Resolution
Program, establishes policies related to the Air Force FWA Program. DoDI 7050.1, Defense
Hotline Program, establishes guidelines and procedures for Hotline Quality Assurance Reviews
(QAR).
11.2. Key Terms. This chapter uses the following key terms: abuse, fraud, gross
mismanagement, gross waste of funds, and waste. Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of
these key terms.
11.3. Background. Preventing FWA is the primary focus of the Air Force FWA Program.
   11.3.1. (Added-ACC) The purpose of the AF FWA program is to save taxpayer money so
   funds can be put to better use. The expectation for an FWA program is in the IG Act of
   1978, specifically stating the duty to ―recommend policies for activities that promote
   economy, efficiency and effectiveness in operations AND prevent fraud and abuse.‖ The Air
   Force accomplishes this purpose through various partnerships between commanders, AF
   Office of Special Investigations, Security Forces, the Comptroller, the AF Audit Agency and
   the IG.
11.4. FWA Policy. The Air Force policy on FWA is to use all available means to prevent,
detect, and correct instances of FWA; to appropriately discipline perpetrators involved in FWA
activities; and to recoup, if possible, losses of cash, property, and services resulting from FWA.
The primary elements of a FWA prevention and detection program exist within the Air Force in
the audit, inspection, investigation, legal, and security areas.
   11.4.1. The success of the FWA program lies with each individual within the Air Force.
   Support by both military and civilian members is crucial in preventing and eliminating FWA.
   Any individual aware of FWA or lack of controls that could permit resources to be wasted or
   diverted must report the situation through appropriate channels.
   11.4.1. (ACC) The FWA program is interwoven into other efforts to promote economy,
   efficiency and effectiveness, such as audits, inspections and the complaints resolution
   process. The FWA program promotes fraud detection through awareness, emphasizes
   effective internal controls, and provides a means to report suspected fraud. Waste is detected
   through inspections or reporting, and waste reduction is accomplished through Air Force
   Smart Operations 21 (AFSO 21) 8-step problem solving, the Innovative Development
   Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) program, and other proven business practices. Abuse
   is reduced through education, audits and reporting. The overall effectiveness of the FWA
   program depends on the synergies created between complementary programs and agencies
   with a vested interest in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Specific
   Installation IG roles related to FWA (other than those spelled out in this supplement) will be
   determined by the respective Wing Commander.
   11.4.2. (Added-ACC) The ACC FWA program includes three main components:
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                              129


      11.4.2.1. (Added-ACC) Prevention through awareness education, partnerships and
      shared practices.
      11.4.2.2. (Added-ACC) Detection through internal and external inspection, audits and
      investigation.
      11.4.2.3. (Added-ACC) Reporting through chain of command, IG complaints, hotlines
      and quarterly/semi-annual reports.
11.5. IG Responsibilities (MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, DRU, and below). IGs at every level
must comply with AFPD 90-3, and will:
   11.5.1. Provide copies of Air Force FWA Hotline case files from the previous 18-24 months
   pursuant to IG DoD‘s notification of a Quality Assurance Review (QAR). Files may
   originate from Air Force, MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, DRU, or lower-level IGs.
   11.5.2. Assist Defense Hotline Program investigators to assess compliance with policy and
   procedures; analyze systemic strengths or weaknesses of hotline investigations; and evaluate
   the timeliness, independence, objectivity, and overall adequacy of Air Force investigations.
   11.5.3. Implement an active Air Force FWA Program to identify potential FWA.
      11.5.3.1. (Added-ACC) IG inspections are a formal aspect of the AF FWA Program.
      Inspectors will report discrepancies found during inspections that indicate possible fraud,
      waste or abuse of government resources to command and local IG for inquiry and
      possible investigation or audit.
      11.5.3.2. (Added-ACC) ACC Inspection discrepancies and/or strengths that aid FWA
      detection, reduction or elimination should be highlighted in inspection reports, and
      referred to HQ ACC/IGQ in order to compile the FWA report for SAF/IG and the IG
      DoD Semi-Annual Report to Congress.
      11.5.3.3. (Added-ACC) Discrepancies found during inspections with FWA implications
      will be referred to HQ ACC/IGQ and entered into ACTS. The inspector or team chief
      will be listed as the complainant, unit follow-up replies will be forwarded to HQ
      ACC/IGQ, and closure determination will be at the division chief or deputy level for all
      FWA related discrepancies. HQ ACC/IGQ will use the ―Potential FWA Discrepancy
      Requirements‖ memo to ensure appropriate levels of command, to include
      NAF/USAFWC/CC and the ANG Readiness Center/CC, are advised of any additional
      follow-up requirements, such as Reports of Survey, Investigations or Audits.
   11.5.4. Upon receipt of allegations of FWA, conduct a complaint analysis to determine the
   resolution path. The IG must ensure the FWA Special Interest Category in ACTS is selected.
   11.5.5. Advise the next higher-level IG of negative trends disclosed in the FWA Program.
   11.5.6. Advise the next higher-level IG of innovative management procedures and
   techniques for preventing FWA that could be useful for Air Force or DoD-wide application.
   11.5.7. Certify all allegations resulting in IG investigation are fully addressed and the
   requirements of this instruction are followed.

13.1. Governing Directives. AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities, establishes
guidance related to the conduct of intelligence oversight activities.             Directive Type
Memorandum (DTM) 08-052, DoD Guidance for Reporting Questionable Intelligence Activities
and Significant and Highly Sensitive Matters, 17 Jun 2009. Questionable intelligence activities
and significant or highly sensitive matters involving intelligence activities may have serious
implications for the execution of DoD missions. Submission of reports of questionable
intelligence activities and all significant or highly sensitive matters IAW AFI 14-104, Oversight
of Intelligence Activities.
13.2. Key Terms. This chapter uses the following key terms: intelligence activity, DoD
intelligence component, and United States Person. Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of
these key terms.
13.3. Background. Intelligence oversight involves a balancing of two fundamental interests:
obtaining the intelligence information required to protect national security and protecting
individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws of the United States (US). The
primary objective of the Intelligence Oversight Program is to ensure that units and staff
organizations conducting intelligence activities do not infringe on or violate the rights of US
persons. However, it is important to note the program applies to all intelligence activities
whether they deal with US person information or not. Inspectors General at all levels need to be
cognizant of intelligence oversight policies and requirements. An intelligence oversight
complaint, often referred to as a questionable activity, is an allegation of conduct that constitutes,
or is related to, an intelligence activity that may violate the law, any Executive Order,
Presidential Directive, DoD policy regarding intelligence activities, AFI 14-104, and/or other Air
Force policy documents and instructions. This includes activities of any Air Force organization,
even if not specifically identified as an intelligence activity, that is being used for
counterintelligence or foreign intelligence purposes. It includes improper activities by an
intelligence or counterintelligence unit or staff or personnel assigned to the organization. A
complainant alleging an intelligence oversight violation might assert something like, ―Some US
intelligence organization is collecting information on me for no reason.‖ AFI 14-104 directs that
―reports (regarding potential intelligence oversight violations) will be expeditiously provided to
the inspector general at the first level at which an inspector general is assigned and not associated
with the questionable activity, with copies to the servicing legal office and, unless the inspector
general determines such reporting would not be appropriate, to senior intelligence officers at the
same level.‖ Therefore, IGs at all organizational levels must be prepared to receive and then
forward copies of intelligence oversight complaints. IGs assigned to DoD intelligence
components in the Air Force must be prepared to investigate such complaints.
13.4. SAF/IG Responsibilities. SAF/IG will:
   13.4.1. SAF/IGI will report any activities that may indicate an intelligence oversight
   violation to DoD General Counsel, SAF/ GC, AF/A2 , AF/JA, and the Assistant to the
   Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD(I)), per AFI 14-104.

   13.4.2. SAF/IGQ will ensure the appropriate AF unit investigates allegations of intelligence
   oversight violations.
13.5. MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, and DRU IG Responsibilities. IGs will:
   13.5.1. Forward a copy of the complaint to SAF/IGQ. IGs assigned to DoD intelligence
   components will investigate such complaints. Other IGs will forward the case to SAF/IGQ
   who will transfer the case to the appropriate IG for evaluation. JFHQ IGs will forward a
   copy of the complaint to both SAF/IGQ and to the National Guard Bureau, Intelligence
   Oversight Division.
   13.5.2. Provide a copy of the complaint to the servicing legal office.
13.6. Installation IG Responsibilities. IGs will:
   13.6.1. Receive intelligence oversight complaints and notify the senior intelligence officer of
   the organization where the alleged violations occurred by providing a copy of the complaint
   to the responsible unit, agency, or organization.
   13.6.2. Provide a copy of the complaint to the servicing legal office, installation commander,
   MAJCOM/IGQ, and SAF/IGQ.
   13.6.3. IGs assigned to DoD intelligence components will investigate the complaint. Other
   IGs will forward a copy of the complaint to their MAJCOM (SAF/IGQ for ANG cases),
   FOA, or DRU IG who will determine which IG office will evaluate the complaint.
   13.6.4. Refer to AFI 14-104 for specific IG training requirements.

   information.”
   14.5.3. Refer to paragraph 14.4.3 for proper marking of e-mail.
14.6. Protecting Privacy Interests.
   14.6.1. IOs conducting IG investigations will not provide witnesses, subjects, or other third-
   parties with copies of complaints or investigative reports or documents or allow those parties
   to read any complaint filed through IG channels.
       14.6.1.1. A complaint to an IG, or a complaint worked in IG channels, is protected
       information.
       14.6.1.2. During interviews, subjects and suspects must be advised of the specific nature

   14.6.5. Protect the privacy interests of others involved by complying with the established
   guidelines in the PA.
   14.6.6. When an IG investigation is halted because it is determined another type of
   investigation is warranted, guard the protected nature of the IG records involved.
14.7. Maintenance and Disposition of IG Records.
   14.7.1. CDI records will not be maintained by IG personnel or within an IG system of
   records with the following exceptions:
       14.7.1.1. All CDIs with colonel (or civilian equivalent) as the subject.
       14.7.1.2. All CDIs with substantiated allegations against majors and/or lieutenant
       colonels.
       14.7.1.3. Any CDI used as evidence in an IG case.
   14.7.2. Records must be maintained for the Complaints Resolution and FWA programs;
   however, each program has unique requirements. Maintain and dispose of records for both
   programs according to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Tables 90-01, 90-03, and
   90-04.          The       schedule       is     available     on      the  internet     at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. According to those Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule tables, the disposition of some IG documents is based on the
   date the case ―closed.‖ IG offices will use the definition of ―closure‖ as listed in
   Attachment 1 of this instruction to determine the case ―closed‖ date.
   14.7.3. In order to maintain a record of each complaint and its disposition, all IG contacts
   (including referrals, transfers, assistance, investigations, and dismissals) must be logged in
   ACTS.
       14.7.3.1. Each case/complaint is its own record. If paper records are maintained, the
       case file should normally be filed by ACTS File Reference Number (FRNO) in its own
       individual file folder.
   14.7.4. Case records should not include AFOSI reports (unless they are investigations
   against senior officials or colonels (or civilian equivalent)), classified materials, reports of
   special security investigations, or other similarly sensitive documents. If a case must contain
   sensitive documents (other than AFOSI reports as specified above), IGs must cross-reference
   their identifying number or subject and indicate their primary storage location. Do not retain
   them in the local IG office file.
   14.7.5. Do not file any IG complaint correspondence or related documents in an individual‘s
   unit Personal Information File, field personnel records, or a system of records other than the
   system established for IG records.
   14.7.6. Upon case closure, remove and destroy documents such as draft reports, unnecessary
   working papers, handwritten notes, Post-it notes, duplicates, etc.
   14.7.7. Recorded testimony must be destroyed or deleted after the highest level of quality
   review has been completed or after the command action has been completed, whichever is
   later.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 139


      14.7.7.1. If command action was taken, coordinate with the legal office before erasing,
      demagnetizing, or destroying audio tapes or computer storage media to determine if they
      must be retained for a longer period.
      14.7.7.2. If tapes are erased and degaussed, use a professional demagnetizing/erasing
      machine. All identifiable markings must be removed after erasing. Never tape over
      previous recordings or reuse an audiotape unless previous data has been properly erased.
      14.7.7.3. If testimony has been recorded on computer media, appropriate technical
      procedures will be utilized to ensure the testimony is unrecoverable.
   14.7.8. Digital records (e.g., DVDs and CDs).
      14.7.8.1. Destroy according to local Information Security Program guidelines.
   14.7.9. AF Electronic Records Management. Records attached to ACTS case files will
   follow guidelines pertaining to paper records.

Section 14C—Restriction for Use of IG Records

14.8. Restrictions for Use of IG Records. Recipients of IG records must comply with the
following restrictions. EXCEPTION: Documents released pursuant to a FOIA request are then
public documents and may be further disclosed at the recipient‘s discretion.
   14.8.1. Do not use IG records as attachments or exhibits to other official records without the
   written approval of the authority responsible for making release determinations, as delegated
   in this instruction.
   14.8.2. IG records must be returned to the authority responsible for making release
   determinations or properly destroyed upon completion of stated need.
   14.8.3. Do not further release (in whole or in part) IG documents without proper
   authorization from the authority responsible for making release determinations.
   14.8.4. Do not act on FOIA or PA requests for IG records. If, while possessing an IG
   document, an office receives a FOIA or PA request, and if the document is a responsive
   record, then accomplish a referral of the request to the appropriate authority responsible for
   making release determinations (referral procedures are found at DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-
   302, paragraph C1.5.9). Include a copy of any responsive documents in the referral package.
   The authority responsible for making release determinations acts on the request.
   14.8.5. Comply with the provisions of the PA Program in the management of IG records.
   14.8.6. Comply with the provisions and restrictions of 10 USC 1102 and AFI 44-119 in
   using any records obtained from a Surgeon General quality assurance review . These are
   records generated by federal hospital committees in reviewing the quality and standards of
   care provided to patients treated by the medical facility. Ordinarily, these records should be
   reviewed and returned to the originator without being attached to the IG record. Consult
   your servicing legal office before attaching any quality assurance documents to an IG report.
   If a quality assurance record (or any portion of a record) is included in an IG record, ensure it
   is prominently marked as protected by 10 USC 1102 as a quality assurance document.
 140                                                 AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   14.8.7. See DoD 6025.18R, paragraph C.2.3., for applicability of the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to IG operations.

Section 14D—Official Use Requests (OUR)

14.9. Types of OURs. This section covers the following types of OURs:
   14.9.1. For Command action.
       14.9.1.1. By commander.
       14.9.1.2. By legal counsel.
   14.9.2. For other than command action.
       14.9.2.1. Requests from AF/A1.
       14.9.2.2. Requests from other DoD agencies.

       14.9.2.4. Requests from Congress.
       14.9.2.5. Non-governmental agencies.
14.10. Release Determination for OURs. SAF/IG is the authority responsible for making
release determinations for all IG records requested under OUR. SAF/IG makes the following
delegations:
   14.10.1. Senior official investigation records: The Director, SAF/IGS, or designee, is the
   authority responsible for making release determinations for senior official investigation
   records.
   14.10.2. Colonel (or civilian equivalent) and below: The Director, SAF/IGQ, or designee, is
   the authority responsible for making release determinations for colonel (or civilian
   equivalent) and below IG investigative records.
   14.10.3. Command action: Appointing authorities are responsible for making release
   determinations for requests regarding command action resulting from IG investigations.
   NOTE: This only applies to requests for command action and not other types of requests.
   14.10.4. The commander, not the IG, is the authority responsible for making release
   determinations for CDI reports. IG offices will not be the repository for CDI reports.
   Commanders or their designated representatives maintain CDI reports/records.
14.11. Policy and Procedure for all OURs. OURs must be submitted through MAJCOM,
NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG offices to the appropriate authority responsible for making
release determinations. In every case, the following guidance applies:
   14.11.1. Release of IG records pursuant to OURs will ordinarily be made after case closure
   (see paragraph 3.63 for closure requirements).
   14.11.2. To make an OUR for IG records, requestors must:
       14.11.2.1. Submit requests in writing.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                           141


       14.11.2.2. Identify the records requested as specifically as possible (e.g., date of
       investigation, name of IO, subject, and/or complainant).
       14.11.2.3. Explain in detail why the records are needed.
       14.11.2.4. Specify when the records are needed.
   14.11.3. The authority responsible for making release determinations will evaluate OURs
   based on the criteria in Section 14E and must notify the requestor of any applicable
   restrictions on the information provided in the release. Make entries in ACTS to show
   processing of OURs for IG records.
   14.11.4. Maintenance of OUR Records. Records will be retained IAW the AF Records
   Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS.
14.12. OURs for Command Action. The authority responsible for making release
determinations will automatically provide the subject‘s commander with a copy of the relevant
portions of an approved and substantiated report of investigation (without attachments) for
determining appropriate command action. JAs may act on behalf of the commander regarding
the procedures of Section 14C. Commanders submit an OUR to the authority responsible for
making release determinations to: a) seek approval to release relevant portions of the ROI or
case file to the subject, and/or; b) obtain additional portions of the case file beyond the
information initially provided by the authority responsible for making release determinations.
When possible, the authority responsible for making release determinations should provide the
information to the commander, and specify what is releasable to the subject simultaneously.
   14.12.1. Release to Subject.
       14.12.1.1. Refer to AFI 51-202 when providing evidence in an Article 15 action against
       an active duty person. Refer to AFI 36-704 when providing evidence relied on to support
       command action against DoD civilians.
       14.12.1.2. Commanders will provide the subject with evidence (if any) supporting the
       command action in conjunction with the notice of the action. NOTE: Evidence to
       support the command action includes information favorable to the defense and may range
       from no evidence to all the evidence collected.
       14.12.1.3. Defense Counsel Requests. When defense counsel requests IG records to
       represent military members in courts-martial or other disciplinary actions, defense
       counsel must request the records from the servicing legal office who will decide what
       records are relevant for the defense counsel to obtain. IGs should cooperate with any
       request by the servicing legal office to provide IG records.
   14.12.2. Obtaining additional portions of the case file. If a commander determines it is
   necessary to review additional portions of the case file (e.g., witness testimony and/or
   exhibits) to determine appropriate command action, the commander must submit an OUR to
   the authority responsible for making release determinations (sample at Attachment 26). The
   authority responsible for making release determinations will approve or disapprove the
   request with a memorandum like the one at Attachment 27 and must use the wording in
   paragraphs two, three, and four verbatim.
14.13. Requests from AF/A1. AF/ A1 is charged with the responsibility to advise the Secretary
whether officers being recommended for promotion, who have adverse information, meet the
 142                                                    AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


exemplary conduct standards prescribed in title 10 United States Code, section 8583. In order to
do so, they must have access to relevant IG records. Process requests under this provision as
expeditiously as possible.
14.14. Requests from within DoD.
   14.14.1. All record requests from within DoD, such as the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG DoD), the Joint Staff,
   unified commands, defense agencies and field activities, and the other Service components
   (including the Reserve Components), must be forwarded to SAF/IG.
   14.14.2. IG DoD must have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, must
   be able to obtain copies of all records, reports, investigations, audits, reviews, documents,
   papers, recommendations, or other material available to or within any DoD component.
   14.14.3. AFBCMR Cases. Complainants who petition the AFBCMR should advise the
   AFBCMR if relevant IG records exist. The AFBCMR may submit an OUR to SAF/IG for
   those records as it deems appropriate.
14.15. Requests from Government Agencies Outside the DoD, Except Congress. Official
use requests for IG records received from non-DoD governmental agencies must be forwarded to
the appropriate authority responsible for making release determinations. This paragraph does not
apply to congressional requests, which are addressed in paragraph 14.16.
14.16. Requests From Congress.
   14.16.1. There are three types of requests from Congress: committee requests, constituent
   requests, and other requests. Consult AFPD 90-4 and AFI 90-401 for all congressional
   requests. Process all ―constituent‖ requests through SAF/LLI. If members of Congress or
   committee staff members request a copy of the report itself or information on any opinion,
   conclusion, recommendation, or confidential source in the report, advise the congressional
   member their request will be sent to SAF/LL.
   14.16.2. To the greatest extent possible, ask the congressional requestor to accept a factual
   summary in lieu of the IG record.
   14.16.3. Committee Requests. The Air Force must disclose IG records when properly
   requested by a Congressional committee. EXCEPTION: These procedures do not apply to
   classified information (see AFI 90-401 for procedures involving classified information). The
   requirements for a proper congressional committee request are:
       14.16.3.1. The request is from either house of Congress, a committee, a subcommittee, a
       joint committee, or a subcommittee of a joint committee (5 USC 552a(b)(9));
       14.16.3.2. For a matter within their jurisdiction (5 USC 552a(b)(9));
       14.16.3.3. From the chairman of the committee or the ranking minority member (AFI 90-
       401). There is no requirement the chairman sign the request, a letter from a staff member
       requesting records on behalf of the committee chairperson (or ranking minority member)
       for the committee is sufficient. Assuming these requirements are met, SAF/IGQ or
       SAF/IGS must turn over all portions of the file that were requested (unredacted) and
       include a transmittal letter specifying: the portion of the information that is protected by
       the Privacy Act, the need to safeguard the information, and that the information should
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                143


       not be further released (5 USC 552a(b); 32 CFR § 310.40(c); AFI 33-332; and DoDD
       5400.11).
   14.16.4. Constituent Requests. Frequently, members of Congress ask for information
   regarding a constituent based on the constituent‘s request for assistance. There are two types
   of constituent requests: those for general information and those for sensitive information.
   Responses to both types of requests are authorized by the blanket routine use for
   Congressional Inquiries in the AF Privacy Act System notices.
       14.16.4.1. General Information. Requests from a congressional member on behalf of a
       constituent for general information may be answered without permission from the subject
       of the record that will be disclosed (5 USC 552a(b)(3); see also AFI 33-332, for examples
       of general information). IG records typically contain sensitive, not general information.
       14.16.4.2. Sensitive Information. If the information requested by a congressional
       representative is sensitive, a release from the subject of the information involved is
       required (AFI 33-332). Some congressional representatives will provide the release with
       the request. The more sensitive the records, the more carefully you should verify the
       subject‘s consent to the release (AFI 33-332). If the request is for sensitive information,
       and no release is provided, you may only provide whatever information is releasable
       under the FOIA (which could be all, some, or none of the requested record). In those
       cases, see Section 14E to determine what information may be released.
   14.16.5. Other Requests. All other requests from members of Congress are analyzed under
   Exception 2 of the Privacy Act, which permits disclosure of Privacy Act records only when
   required by the FOIA (See 5 USC 552 b (6); also see AFI 33-332, which sets out a test for
   disclosure to third-parties). All other congressional requests are analyzed under the FOIA.
   (This does not mean the request must be submitted under FOIA, just that FOIA analysis will
   be used.) The authority responsible for making release determinations must consult their
   legal office before responding to these requests. Prior to release of these requests, ensure the
   accuracy of the information in the record.
14.17. Requests from Non-Governmental Agencies. Any office that receives a request for
records from a non-governmental agency should forward the request to the authority responsible
for making release determinations for that record, along with a copy of the responsive records.

Section 14E—Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) Requests

14.18. Authority Responsible for Making Release Determinations for FOIA and PA
Requests.
   14.18.1. SAF/IG is the initial denial authority (IDA) for all IG records requested DoD
   5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act and the denial authority for IG
   records requested under AFI 33-332. SAF/IG makes the following delegations:
       14.18.1.1. SAF/IGS is the IDA for senior official cases.
       14.18.1.2. SAF/IGQ is the IDA for all IG cases closed at SAF/IGQ level and for all
       colonel (or civilian equivalent) IG investigations regardless of the level at which they
       were initiated or closed.
 144                                                      AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   14.18.2. MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IGs are the authority responsible for making
   release determinations for IG records when this instruction governs those records, and
   pertains to IG actions closed at their level and below. EXCEPTIONS:
       14.18.2.1. Colonel (or civilian equivalent) cases as specified in paragraph 14.18.1.2
       above.
       14.18.2.2. SAF/IGQ will act as the MAJCOM for ANG IG records maintenance.
       14.18.2.3. Reports involving Reserve personnel. Reports involving members of the
       Reserve Component in Title 10 status (e.g., on active duty) should be maintained in
       federal records. Reports involving members of the Reserve Component in Title 32 status
       (e.g., in state status), even if the report is done by investigating officers in Title 10 status
       should be forwarded to the state unit involved. The federal government should retain a
       copy of these records when there is a federal interest. State records are not subject to the
       FOIA or PA, rather they are subject to state law. This can be a complicated situation--
       consult the servicing JA.
       14.18.2.4. SAF/IGQ will maintain reports involving members of the Civil Air Patrol
       (CAP) while performing Air Force-assigned missions (AFAM). Otherwise, inspector
       general investigations and reports involving CAP members while serving or performing
       missions in its federal chartered non-profit corporate status are subject to the direction
       and control of its governing instructions.
   14.18.3. MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IGs must coordinate all proposed FOIA and PA
   responses with their FOIA and legal offices.
14.19. Procedures Regarding FOIA and PA Requests.
   14.19.1. IGs will coordinate FOIA requests with the FOIA office and the JA. See DoD
   5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 for FOIA responsibilities. Make entries in ACTS to show
   processing of FOIA requests.
   14.19.2. Third-Party requests. Obtain a PA release statement from the subject when a third-
   party requests records on the subject‘s behalf. For subjects represented by counsel, a letter of
   representation will suffice. For requests from Congress, refer to paragraph 14.16.
   14.19.3. When a FOIA request is received from a complainant and ―complainant provided‖
   materials are responsive records to the request, if possible, contact the complainant to clarify
   if he or she is requesting ―complainant provided‖ materials. After clarification, annotate the
   complainant/requestor‘s wishes in the FOIA file. If contact does not occur, process the
   ―complainant provided‖ materials and include releasable portions with response to requestor.
   14.19.4. Requests from individuals will be considered under both the FOIA and PA. In the
   response to the requestor, specify which act afforded them access to the maximum amount of
   information (FOIA or PA), and explain any exemptions or exceptions.
14.20. Maintenance of FOIA Records. Maintain IG FOIA files IAW the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule, and ; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302.
   14.20.1. The authority responsible for making release determinations is responsible for
   documentation, maintenance, and disposition of IG records processed under FOIA.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                145


   14.20.2. IG FOIA case files, including the initial response package and subsequent appeal
   package, if any, should be maintained within the IG file system under the ACTS FRNO.
   14.20.3. If any material is denied to a FOIA or PA requestor, then a record must be
   maintained for six years. NOTE: The FOIA/PA file is an independent file from the
   investigatory file. The record must contain the release and its justification, coordination, and
   any analysis or legal reviews, a highlighted redacted copy of released materials showing
   information withheld from release, and a full and unredacted copy of responsive documents
   (IAW ; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302). If the FOIA or PA request is granted in full, the
   information must be maintained for two years.
   14.20.4. The original investigative file will be destroyed on its scheduled disposition date.

Section 14F—Making Release Determinations

14.21. General Guidance.
   14.21.1. All FOIA or PA responses must be coordinated with the servicing JA. Denials
   require a written legal review.
   14.21.2. Requests by an individual (complainant or subject) for their own records must be
   considered under both the FOIA and the PA, even if the requestor does not cite either act
   (See ; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 and AFI 33-332). This does not mean the person
   receives a copy, it only means both acts must be considered.
   14.21.3. Generally, release of IG records under FOIA or PA will be made only after the case
   has been closed. Respond to requests for open cases citing the appropriate FOIA or PA
   exemptions and exceptions after consulting with your JA. When a case is still open, it is
   generally protected from disclosure under the FOIA under exemption b 7 (c) (a) because it is
   a draft, and it is protected from disclosure under the Privacy Act because it is not yet a
   record.
   14.21.4. The authority responsible for making release determinations will always comply
   with valid court orders for an in-camera review.
   14.21.5. In cases of reprisal and restriction, DoDD 7050.06 requires the IG to provide the
   complainant with a redacted copy of the Report of Investigation with the closure letter. The
   ROI must be considered under both the FOIA and the PA but notification to the FOIA office
   is not required.
14.22. Release Analysis.
   14.22.1. For guidance on analysis of FOIA or PA requests, refer to:

                                           Chapter 15

                                      CIVIL LIBERTIES

15.1. Governing Directives. Public Law 110-53, Section 803.
15.2. Key Terms. This chapter uses the following key terms: civil liberties, reprisal, and
restriction. Refer to Attachme nt 1 for the definition of these key terms.
15.3. Overview. Based on a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, Congress passed
Public Law 110-53, Section 803 in 2007 requiring certain Federal agencies, to include the DoD,
to periodically (not less than quarterly) report allegations of civil liberties violations and
resolution, provide training on civil liberties to agency personnel, and ensure agency policies
and regulations did not violate the civil liberties of agency personnel and the public.
15.4. Civil Liberties. Civil Liberties are the rights of individuals to exercise the freedoms and
rights guaranteed to them under the United States Constitution without the government‘s
improper interference. For purposes of the Air Force Civil Liberties Program, Civil Liberties are
considered to be:
   15.4.1. First Amendment Rights: right to freedom of speech, peaceful assembly and
   association; freedom of the press; and freedom of religion.
   15.4.2. Second Amendment: right to keep and bear arms.
   15.4.3. Fourth Amendment: right against unreasonable searches and seizures.
   15.4.4. Fifth Amendment: right to not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due
   process of law.
   15.4.5. Fifteenth, Nineteenth and Twenty Sixth Amendments : right to vote.
15.5. Identifying Civil Liberties Violations. Regardless of the subject matter of the complaint,
IGs will determine if the complaint constitutes a civil liberties violation. If the complaint meets
the criteria for a civil liberties violation, the IG will:
   15.5.1. Determine the appropriate disposition of the issue(s) contained in the complaint.
   15.5.2. Enter the details of the complaint in ACTS, ensuring that Civil Liberties is selected
   as a Special Interest Item.
   15.5.3. Draft a Civil Liberties Report (Attachment 30) and attach to the case file.
   15.5.4. Update the report as the resolution of the complaint progresses.
   15.5.5. Close the case in ACTS when the issue(s) has been resolved.
15.6. Reporting Requirements.
   15.6.1. Reports of complaints for the preceding quarter alleging violations of civil liberties
   are due to DoD by the 15th of January, April, July and October. In order to meet this
   suspense, SAF/IGQ will pull the reports of complaints initiated, pending or closed from
   ACTS for the quarter no later than the 3rd of January, April, July and October.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 147


   15.6.2. Civil liberty complaints made during courts-martials, non-judicial punishment
   actions, administrative discharge processes, or IG complaints of reprisal or restriction will
   not be reported by the IG as they are reported through other channels.
   15.6.3. Negative replies from the installations/units are not required.
15.7. Reprisal for Making a Complaint. In accordance with Public Law 110-53 Section 803,
no action constituting a reprisal or threat of reprisal shall be taken for making a complaint or for
disclosing information to a privacy officer or civil liberties officer that indicates a possible
violation of privacy protections or civil liberties unless the complaint was disclosed with false
information or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.
   15.7.1. Complaints alleging reprisal will be evaluated in accordance with Chapter 6 of this
   instruction.
15.8. Additional Information. Additional information can be found at the DoD website
(http://dpclo.defense.gov) or the AF website (http://www.privacy.af.mil/civilliberties/).

                                            Chapter 16

                                    OSC INVESTIGATIONS

16.1. Governing Directives. AFI 51-1102, Cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel;
DoDD 5500.19, Cooperation with the United States Office of Special Counsel.
16.2. Key Terms. This chapter uses the following key terms: whistleblowing, prohibited
personnel practices, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, and a
substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Refer to Attachment 1 for definition
of these key terms.
16.3. Overview. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal
investigative and prosecutorial agency whose primary mission is to safeguard the merit system
by protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices (PPPs),
especially reprisal for whistleblowing. OSC investigates PPPs, as well as certain other types of
cases such as allegations of violations of the Hatch Act and the Uniformed Services Employment
and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Additionally, the OSC Disclosure Unit provides a
secure channel for federal employees to report wrongdoing. Disclosure allegations received by
OSC are reviewed and, if OSC determines there is a substantial likelihood of a violation of a
rule, law, or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; or a
substantial danger to public health or safety, OSC will refer the allegations to the Secretary of the
Air Force (SECAF) for investigation. SECAF is then required to conduct an investigation and
submit a report back to OSC. See 5 U.S.C. § 1213.
   16.3.1. SECAF has delegated responsibility for oversight and overall guidance of OSC
   matters to the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC). Responses to queries or requests for
   information by OSC must be routed through SAF/GCA.
   16.3.2. At the request of SAF/GC, SAF/IG shall investigate the allegations referred by OSC.
   Results of OSC inquiries investigated by AF IGs will be routed through SAF/IGQ to
   SAF/GCA.
16.4. Investigative Process.
   16.4.1. For allegations referred to SECAF by OSC for investigation, the statutory suspense
   to submit the final report to OSC is 60 days (see 5 U.S.C. § 1213(c)(1)(B). Extensions are
   granted only for extenuating circumstances. As such, investiga tions referred by OSC must
   be given the highest appropriate priority.
   16.4.2. SAF/IG will refer the OSC allegations to a designated point of contact in SAF/IGQ,
   SAF/IGS, or SAF/IGX as appropriate. The designated point of contact and a lawyer assigned
   from HAF/JAA as the legal advisor will review the allegations and recommend to SAF/IG
   whether the investigation should be conducted at the Air Force or MAJCOM level.
   16.4.3. The investigating officer will consult with the SAF/IG point of contact, AF legal
   advisor, and SAF/GCA representative to draft allegations, develop an investigation plan, and
   draft the report of investigation (ROI) for SECAF signature. To the extent possible before the
   ROI is finalized, evidence and testimony obtained during the investigation should be shared
   as soon as practical with the AF legal advisor and SAF/GCA representative to assist in
   meeting the 60 day statutory suspense.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                149


   16.4.4. The investigating officer will document the investigation in the OSC format for the
   ROI (Atch 31). This format differs from the IG ROI and must be followed.
   16.4.5. The report must include:
      16.4.5.1. A summary of the information with respect to which the investigation was
      initiated.
      16.4.5.2. A description of the conduct of the investigation.
      16.4.5.3. A summary of the evidence.
      16.4.5.4. A listing of any violation or apparent violation of any law, rule, or regulation.
      16.4.5.5. A description of any corrective action taken or planned as a result of the
      investigation.
16.5. Review and Approval.
   16.5.1. The completed case file must be reviewed by the SAF/IG designated point of contact
   and a legal review written prior to release to SAF/GCA.
   16.5.2. SAF/GCA will review and may request further information and/or investigation.
   SAF/GCA will submit the final report for SECAF signature and forwarding to OSC.
   16.5.3. SECAF personally signs the final report submitted to OSC.
   16.5.4. Case will be carried in a completed status until OSC finishes their report at which
   time the case status will be changed to closed.
16.6. Actions by OSC
   16.6.1. OSC will send the SECAF response to the complainants for them to review and
   make comments regarding the investigation. Based on the comments, OSC may return the
   report to the Air Force for clarification or further investigation.
   16.6.2. The final OSC report will be sent to the President and Congress and posted on the
   OSC public website, http://www.osc.gov.

Adverse Information—DOD policy defines adverse information:
   1. A substantiated adverse finding or conclusion from an officially documented investigation
   or inquiry;
   or
   2. Any credible information of an adverse nature. To be credible, the information must be
   resolved and supported by a preponderance of the evidence. To be adverse, the information
   must be derogatory, unfavorable, or of a nature that reflects unacceptable conduct, or a lack
   of integrity or judgment on the part of the individual.
   For the purposes of this definition, the following types of information, even though credible,
   are not considered adverse:
        a. Motor vehicle violations that did not require a court appearance.
        b. Minor infractions without negative effect on an individual or the good order and
        discipline of the organization that:
               (1) Was not identified as a result of substantiated findings or conclusion from an
               officially documented investigation, and
(2) Did not result in more than a non—punitive rehabilitative counseling             administered
by a superior to a subordinate.
   3. Adverse information does not include:
        a. Information previously considered by the Senate pursuant to the officer‘s appointment;
        or
b. Information attributed to an individual 10 or more years before the date of the personnel
action under consideration, except for incidents, which if tried by court—martial, could
have resulted in the imposition of a punitive discharge and confinement for more than one-
year—the date of the substantiated adverse finding or conclusion from an officially documented
investigation or inquiry is used to establish the time period, not the date of the incident.
Allegation—A postulated assertion (assumed without proof) formed by the IG concerning an
individual or a detrimental condition. An allegation is a hypothetical statement containing four
elements, all of which must be proved by a preponderance of evidence to be true for the
allegation to be substantiated. A properly framed allegation will contain the following elements:
1. When, (in what time frame did the improper conduct or behavior occur),
2. Who, (a person, identified by as much information necessary to uniquely identify),
3. Improperly did what, (the specific behavior or conduct that was improper and represents the
adverse information),
4. In violation of what standard, (law, policy, regulation, instruction, or procedure).
A properly framed allegation is constructed as follows:
When (on or about 10 January 2004), Who, (Major John A. Smith, XX Sq/CC) did what, (gave
a referral EPR to SrA William Tell), in violation of what standard, (in reprisal for a protected
communication in violation of 10 USC 1034).

necessary).
Assist—IG assistance is the simple process of making phone calls, asking questions, or soliciting
helpful information from appropriate offices or agencies or putting complainants in touch with

evidence or assertion of personal wrongdoing by a management official. Assistance is the IG
giving aid or support to quickly remedy a personal problem.
Authentication—The process of having a document (correspondence, personal notes, computer
records, etc.) verified as genuine.
Automated Case Tracking System (ACTS)—An AF IG tool to capture all IG investigative and
administrative activity AF-wide. ACTS is the primary data collection tool for IGs at all levels.

or subject, as appropriate, is notified of the results, and the complainant receives a final response.
Colonel (or civilian equivalent)—A Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National
Guard officer in the grade of O-6; or an officer who has been selected for promotion to the grade

GS-15. For purposes of this instruction, these individuals will be referred to as colonels (or
civilian equivalent).
Command Action—Action taken by the commander, who is responsible for the process,
operation, organization, or individual. A commander electing to take no action is deemed to be
command action and must be documented.
Commander—Only officers may command. An officer succeeds to command in one of two
ways; by appointment to command or by assuming command. Generally, an officer assigned to
an organization, present for duty, eligible to command the organization, and senior or equal in

an authorized official. When not otherwise prohibited by superior competent authority, an
officer‘s authority to assume command of an organization passes by operation of law to the
senior military officer (by grade and, within the same grade, by rank within that grade) assigned
to an organization who is present for duty and eligible to command that organization. For
specific rules on appointment to, and assumption of command in the Regular Air Force, Air
Force Reserve, and Air National Guard when in federal service, refer to AFI 51-604,

organization, process or operation. A complainant may be any individual including military
members, civilian employees, retirees, family members, or other parties that request to use the IG
complaint system.
Complaint—A formal assertion concerning a wrong; or violation of law, regulation, instruction,
policy, procedure or rule; or report of conditions detrimental to the operation, mission, or
reputation of the AF.
Complaint Analysis—A complaint analysis is the process for determining the most effective
resolution strategy to resolve the issues raised by the complainant‘s assertion. It is a preliminary
review of assertions and evidence to determine the potential validity and relevance of the
assertion to the AF and to determine what action, if any, in IG, supervisory, or other channels is
necessary. A complaint analysis results in a formal decision document which is reviewed by the
appointing authority. The complaint analysis decision document is used to record the rationale
for the selected complaint resolution strategy.

Investigation—A duly authorized, systematic, detailed examination to uncover the facts and
determine the truth of a matter. IG investigations are administrative in nature--they are fact
finding rather than judicial proceedings. They are not criminal proceedings in which proof

Self-Investigation—A Senior Official is defined as any active or retired Regular Air Force, Air
Force Reserve, or Air National Guard military officer in the grade of O-7 (brigadier general)
select and above, and Air National Guard Colonels with a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).
Current or former members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent and current and
former Air Force civilian Presidential appointees are also considered senior officials. (NOTE:
under DOD policy, an officer becomes an O-7 select, and therefore a senior official, at the time
the selection board that selects the officer adjourns.)
Senior Officer Unfavorable Information File (SOUIF)—A SOUIF is a written summary of
adverse information pertaining to a colonel or a general officer, plus any comments from the
subject officer regarding the written summary. SOUIFs are created for use during the general
officer promotion process and exist solely for that purpose. The Secretary of the Air Force or
designee (SAF/GC) determines if a SOUIF is provided to a promotion board.
Senior Official— A Senior Official is defined as any active or retired Regular Air Force, Air
Force Reserve, or Air National Guard military officer in the grade of O-7 (brigadier general)
select and above, and Air National Guard Colonels with a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).
Current or former members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent and current and

Standards—A law, regulation, policy, procedure, operating instruction, or custom of service
that establishes a criterion for measuring acceptability.
Statement—A written or oral declaration of events made to an IO or IG by a witness, subject or
suspect. For all reports, type any written statements. The witness or IO should sign the typed
statement to certify the validity.
Statutory Authority—Authority derived from statute. For example, The DoD Inspector
General derives his authority from The Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 USC Appendix 3.
Subject—A military member or civil service employee against whom allegations of non-
criminal wrongdoing have been made and/or whose conduct is the focus of an investigation.
Substantial and Specific Danger to Public Health or Safety—Two of the factors that
determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific are (1) the likelihood
of harm resulting from the danger and (2) when the alleged harm may occur. If the disclosed
danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, it is less likely to
be found specific. If the harm is likely to occur in the immediate or near future as opposed to
manifesting only in the distant future it is more likely qualify as a specific danger. Both of these
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                167


factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger, while the nature of the harm—the potential
consequences—affects the substantiality of the danger.
Substantiated—A substantiated finding results when a preponderance of the evidence supports
the complainant‘s allegation of a wrong or violation of law, regulation, procedure, or AF policy
or standards. The facts (from documentation and testimony) indicate the complainant was
wronged or a violation of standards occurred.
Summarized Testimony—A written summary of witness testimony prepared and certified by
the IO. It normally includes only those items directly related to the matters under examination.
The witness or IO must sign all summaries. It is encouraged (not mandatory) that witnesses also
sign summarized testimony, whenever the witness is reasonably available to do so.
Suspect—An individual suspected of a criminal offense. Identify a person as a suspect when the
facts and circumstances known at the time of the interview are sufficient to support a reasonable
belief that the person to be interviewed may have committed a crime. Military suspects must be
advised of their Article 31 rights before the interview begins. Consultation with the servicing
legal office is recommended before reading rights to a suspect.
Systemic—A trend or pattern that relates to, or is common to, an organization.
Technical Review—A technical (expert) review of applicable evidence, findings, and
conclusions.
Testimony—A solemn declaration, usually made orally by a witness, in response to a formal
questioning. It may be recorded and summarized or transcribed verbatim (word-by-word).
   1. Sworn. Obtained from a witness who has taken an oath or affirmation to tell the truth.
   2. Unsworn. Obtained from a witness who has not taken an oath or affirmation to tell the
   truth.
Third-Party Complainant—An individual who makes a complaint on behalf of another
individual against an AF military member, civil service employee, program, or organization.
Third-Party Complaint—A complaint made on behalf of another individual against an Air
Force military member, civil service employee, program, or organization.
Thoroughness—All inspector general operations must be conducted in a diligent and thorough
manner, addressing relevant aspects of the readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline
of the institution. IG operations must clearly and concisely reflect all elements of the issues
under examination. Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure pertinent issues are sufficiently
resolved and that all appropriate root causes and remedies are considered. The results of
inspector general operations must not raise unanswered questions, nor leave matters open to
question or misinterpretation.
Timeliness—Inspector general operations must be conducted and reported with due diligence in
a timely manner. The objective is to be responsive to all parties thereby enhancing AF
credibility. IG operations are to be conducted and completed within a timeframe that facilitates
efficient and effective mission accomplishment while protecting the public‘s safety and security.
IGs are responsible to ensure that the investigation, inspection or evaluation is completed at the
appropriate time.

Transfer—A complaint is transferred when a complaint analysis determines an AF IG other
than the one receiving the complaint should resolve it.
Unlawful Communication—Any communication, whether verbal or written or otherwise
transmitted, that constitutes misconduct, a violation of the UCMJ, or a violation of other
applicable criminal statutes. Some examples of unlawful communications include, but are not
limited to, knowingly false statements; unauthorized disclosures of classified, privileged, or

Waste—The extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of AF funds or the consumption of
AF property that results from deficient practices, systems controls, or decisions. The term also
includes improper practices not involving prosecutable fraud. NOTE: Consider wartime and
emergency operations when explaining possible waste. For example, legitimate stockpiles and
reserves for wartime needs, which may appear redundant and costly, are not considered waste.
Whistleblowing--A protected communication disclosing information by an employee or
applicant that he or she reasonably believes evidences a violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific
danger to public health or safety.

                                   of an IG investigation.

BACKGROUND:

(if any) and the events that led the complainant to contact the IG office.

ISSUES/ANALYSES/RESOLUTION PATHS:
[ISSUE 1: example for issues requiring INVESTIGATION]
Issue 1. That Col First abused his authority by requiring a new subordinate to report for duty earlier than the Report No
Later Than Date (RNLTD).


        This is a protected document. It will not be released (in whole or in part), reproduced, or given additional
          dissemination (in whole or in part) outside Inspector General channels without prior approval of the
                                         Inspector General (SAF/IG) or designee
                                          FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)
                                                 (FOUO Only When Filled In)
Issue 1 Analysis.
     a. Review what the complainant believes the subject did.
     b. Explain what the Air Force instruction says or what the standard is.
     c. Explain when this alleged violation occurred.
     d. Allegation 1 (Frame the allegation as follows):
     On (state the date), Col Alan B. First, 99 MSG/CC (describe the improper behavior or conduct) abused his authority
     by requiring Amn Joe M. Complainant to report for duty earlier than his RNLTD in violation of (state the standard)
     AFI XX-XXX.
     e. (Compare the alleged actions to the standard and draw a conclusion whether an IG investigation is warranted. Use the
     words: ―This allegation warrants an IG investigation because....‖)
Issue 1 Resolution Path.
 172                                                                      AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012

     a.   Recommend 99 WG/IG conduct an IG investigation into issue 1.
     b.   Recommend 99 WG/IG sign memo to complainant at Attachment 2.
     c.   Recommend 99 WG/IG sign memo to subject‘s commander at Attachment 4.
     d.   Recommend 99 WG/IG sign notification memo to MAJCOM/IGQ of allegations against a colonel at Attachment
     5.
[ISSUE 2: example for issues that are DISMISSED]
Issue 2. That TSgt Second improperly provided performance feedback to Amn Complainant.
Issue 2 Analysis.
     a. Review what the complainant believes the subject did.
     b. Explain what the Air Force instruction says or what the standard is.
     c. Explain when this alleged violation occurred.
     d. (If an allegation cannot be framed, explain why. Specifically discuss the elements that are missing and the resulting
     impact on the complaint resolution strategy.) An allegation cannot be framed for this issue because no standard has been
     violated. TSgt Second provided Amn Complainant with three performance feedback sessions (one every 60 days) within a
     180-day period. The sessions occurred on (date 1), (date 2), and (date 3). AFPAM 36-2627, Airman and NCO Performance
     Feedback System (EES), paragraph 1.6 states ―[Performance feedback] Sessions are also held if the rater determines there
     is a need for one, or within 30 days of a request from a ratee, provided at least 60 days have passed since the last feedback
     session.‖

e. (Compare the alleged actions to the standard and draw a conclusion whether an investigation is warranted. Use the words:
―This issue does not warrant investigation because...‖) After discussing this issue with Amn Complainant and reviewing the
performance feedback forms, it is clearly apparent that TSgt Second properly provided constructive feedback, which was
intended to improve Amn Complainant‘s performance. This issue does not warrant investigation because a proper allegation
cannot be framed.

            dissemination (in whole or in part) outside Inspector General channels without prior approval of the

                                                 (FOUO Only When Filled In)

     c. Explain when this alleged violation occurred.
     d. Allegation 3: TSgt Gary H. Instructor abused his authority by requiring Amn Joe M. Complainant to (do
     something) in violation of (state the standard) on (state the date).
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                                                  173

      MEMORANDUM FOR 99 MSG/CC
      FROM: (Appointing Authority)
      SUBJECT: IG Investigation - Notification to Subject‘s Commander
      1. We will be conducting an Inspector General investigation concerning Lt Col First M. Last. I am not
      allowed to discuss the specifics at this time, but, in general, the allegation is that Lt Col Last abused his
      authority. You will be apprised of the findings upon completion of the investigation.
      2. The fact that allegations have been made is not to be construed as proof of wrongdoing. An
      independent investigating officer has been appointed to determine the facts and circumstances
      surrounding the allegations and report their findings to me.
      3. In accordance with AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution, please inform Lt Col
      Last (he/she) is a subject in this investigation and that the investigating officer will soon contact
      (him/her) to make the necessary arrangements and collect (his/her) sworn testimony. Also ensure that
      (he/she) understands the following points:
           a. (He/She) must not attempt to identify the names of the complainant or witnesses. The IG
           system is designed to be confidential and to protect the identity and privacy of all individuals
           involved in the investigation. In fact, almost any action on (his/her) part to talk to witnesses or the
           complainant may give the appearance of improperly influencing the witnesses or reprising against
           the complainant. (He/She) must maintain confidentiality and permit the IG investigators to do
           their job.
           b. Any attempt to interfere with the investigation, testimony, or evidence could have more serious
           consequences than the alleged wrongdoings.
           c. To preclude compromise of the initial fact finding, subjects, complainants, and witnesses will
           not discuss the circumstances of the allegations or their testimony with anyone except the IG
           complaints staff, the appointed investigating officer, or their legal counsel--if they elect to seek
           legal advice.


                                       FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)
                                            (FOUO Only When Filled In)




SAMPLE INITIAL NOTIFICATION MEMORANDUM TO SUBJECT’S
COMMANDER, Continued
           d. Here is what Lt Col Last can expect: (1) the investigating officer will gather facts and interview
           witnesses; (2) (he/she) will be interviewed last; (3) (he/she) will be notified whether the allegations
           against (him/her) were ―substantiated‖ or ―not substantiated‖ by (his/her) commander. Please
           advise Lt Col Last to trust the process.

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ AFMC/IG
FROM: Donald L. Smith, Colonel, USAF
SUBJECT: INVESTIGATION PLAN: COL TURNER DEFEAR
1. Mission: Investigate allegations of command accountability in the Systems Program Office at
Other AFB, USA.
2. Facts Bearing on Investigation:
   a. Background:
    Ms Hedda Fright is the former spouse of Air Force Lt Colonel I. Ben Wrong, currently
assigned to the Systems Program Office at Other AFB USA. Ms Fright alleged on 28 Sep 02 Lt
Col Wrong attempted to kill her when he struck her with a hammer in her apartment in Any
Town. Col Wrong was subsequently acquitted of attempted murder and failure to go charges by
a general court-martial.
    Ms Fright later wrote the CSAF, General Tedrey Smith, complaining that Lt Col Wrong‘s
supervisor, Col Turner Defear could have prevented the events of 28 Sep 02 from occurring. Ms
Fright related that Col Defear was aware of a pattern of alcohol abuse and unusual behavior by
Lt Col Wrong as early as November 2001 but elected not to intervene in what he perceived was a
domestic dispute. Ms Fright stated she requested assistance from Col Defear on at least three
occasions between Nov 00 and Sep 02. She says the Other AFB Flight Surgeon, Lt Col Carey
Hands, also went to Col Defear on three or four occasions to inform him of Lt Col Wrong‘s
behavior, but Col Defear refused to act, believing it would unnecessarily damage Lt Col Wrong‘s
career.
    On 5 Apr 01 Gen Smith requested the Inspector General investigate the apparent lack of
action by Col Defear in these matters. On 12 Apr 01, Col Kevin J. Sullivan, HQ AFMC/IG
appointed Col Donald L. Smith as the Investigati ng Officer for these matters.
   b. Chronology
       Nov/Dec 99          Ms Fright approaches Col Defear for the first time about her husband‘s
                           alleged heavy drinking.
       Dec 99              Lt Col Wrong allegedly admits to Col Defear he has a serious drinking
                           problem. Col Defear allegedly enlists the assistance of the Flight Surgeon,
                           Lt Col Carey Hands.

      Dec 99              Lt Col Wrong allegedly admitted to Wright-Patterson Medical Center
                          (WPMC) for emergency treatment.
      Jan 00              Lt Col Wrong allegedly admitted to Alcohol Rehab Program at WPMC.
      Feb 00              Lt Col Wrong allegedly released from Rehab Program at WPMC and
                          placed in Other AFB Alcohol Rehab Program.
      Apr 00              Ms Fright requests Col Defear do something about Lt Col Wrong, her
                          former husband. Reveals:
                             - Behavior is getting stranger.
                             - Driving drunk.

                               work.
                             - Col Defear orders Lt Col Wrong to stay out of her section of the
                               building.
      Apr-Sep 00          Ms Fright alleges on two occasions she spoke with Col Defear directly
                          about her husband and his behavior, and on at least 3 or 4 other occasions
                          Dr Hands spoke with Col Defear as well. Col Defear allegedly responded
                          by stating he did not want to get involved in ―a domestic dispute.‖

                              WITNESS INTERVIEW FORMAT

This interview format is for use with witnesses who are NOT subjects and who are NOT suspects
Prior to Witness Arriving
Arrive early to work with your IG POC to ensure that the interview room is ready. Here are
some recommended items to go over:
   a. A good practice is to add your questions to this template and use it as your note taker.
   b. Discuss with your legal advisor the potential for rights advisement as well as bargaining
   unit representation, (as applicable).
   c. Ensure that you have a copy of the Privacy Act readily available for the witness to review
   and other documents that you may want to refer to or have the witness review. Check that
   they are in order you will use them.
   d. Have tissues on hand in the event the witness becomes emotional and water for yourself
   and the witness, if desired.
   e. Ops check the recorder(s) one more time.
   f. Ensure that the phones are turned off or being answered by someone in the IG office.
   g. Place a ―Do Not Disturb - Interview in Progress‖ sign on the door.
   h. Have pens, pencils, and note paper available and handy.
   i. The CSAF Hand-Off Policy does not require a hand-off for witnesses in an investigation.
   However, if you encounter a witness that is distraught or visibly upset, ensure that you have a
   plan to hand them off to a responsible individual.
The interview is conducted in four parts: Pre-Interview, Read-In, Questioning, and Read-out.
The following are suggested topics to cover for each part of the interview during the Pre-
Interview discussion.
Part 1 - Pre-Interview (Recorder is OFF)
The Pre-Interview is an opportunity for the investigating officer to relay to the witness what they
can expect during the interview. It relaxes the witness and eases some of the apprehension that
they feel. It also starts the bonding process between you as the investigating officer and them as
the witness.
   A. The first step is to use small talk to relax the witness and build rapport. Remember
   that the witness may not be sure why they are in the IG office so it‘s a good time to
   assure them that they are a witness and not the subject of the investigation.
   B. More often than not, the witness‘ attention will be immediately drawn to the recorder. This
   is a good time to acknowledge that the interview will be recorded to ensure that an accurate
   record of the interview is captured. The recording will be transcribed or summarized and
   included in the report of investigation that you will prepare. If the individual does not focus on
   the recorder at first, be sure to address its use later in the Pre-Interview portion.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 185


   C. Ask for some identification to verify the witness is who you are expecting. At the same
   time, show the witness your ID card and appointment letter (but not the attached page with the
   allegations. Explain that you will be going into more detail as you start the interview.
   D. Explain your role as the investigating officer. Below are some suggested areas to cover:
      a. Impartial representative of the commander and IG
      b. Unbiased and impartial fact finder
      c. Gather documents and interview witnesses; analyze the relevant facts; and determine
      whether the allegation(s) are substantiated or not based on a preponderance of the evidence.
      d. Your conclusion will be documented in a report of investigation for the appointing
      authority to approve after it receives an IG and legal review.
   E. Explain the role they play in the investigation:
      a. Their statements are valuable as a first person account of the circumstances surrounding
      the allegations and are invaluable to you to ensure that all the facts are uncovered.
      b. Their testimony, or any witness testimony, will be used within the Department of
      Defense for official purposes.
      c. It is Department of the Air Force policy to keep such information and reports closely
      held. Nonetheless, in some instances, there may be public disclosure of IG materials, as
      required by the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, or as otherwise provided for by
      law and regulations. In most cases, their identity will be redacted but there is a chance it
      could be released. Any release outside the Department of the Air Force requires the
      approval of SAF/IG, and in such cases, release (when unavoidable) is kept to the minimum
      necessary to satisfy legal or Department of the Air Force requirements.
   F. If there are any other individuals in the interview, explain their role and ensure the witness
   knows that you are the investigating officer and responsible for the interview.
Read-In:
   A. The read-in as well as the read-out are required to be verbatim. This may be uncomfortable
   as you will be referring to your script and not maintaining constant eye contact. Assure them
   that the questioning will flow more naturally.
   B. Explain that during the Read-In, you will be asking them to provide personal information
   about themselves--name, address, Social Security Number, etc. The Privacy Act of 1974
   requires that the investigating officer inform the witness of the requirement to gather this
   information and how it will be used. Let them read the Privacy Act statement during the Pre-
   Interview and explain that you will confirm that they have read the statement and have no
   questions. They do not need to sign the Privacy Act.
   C. They will be answering questions under oath. Ask if they prefer to use swear or affirm.
   This is a good time to mark through the other option on the read-in and remember that if they
   elect to affirm, also strike the words, ―so help me God.‖
   D. Inform them that you will be telling them that as a witness, they are not authorized to have
   legal counsel with them.

Questioning:
   E. Briefly tell them your note taking technique and remind them that the interview is being
   recorded so you‘ll use that as the primary source of information. Too much note taking detracts
   from maintaining eye contact and being part of the interview while taking no notes can be
   perceived as not thinking what the witness says is important. Discussing this before will help to
   alleviate these perceptions.
   F. The questions should be non-adversarial and designed to elicit information, not to get a
   confession. Do not ask leading questions; let them talk; don‘t fill in answers or lead them to
   answers you want to hear.
   G. Inform the witness that this is an administrative investigation and both hearsay and opinion
   may be used in your evaluation of the facts but you will be validating the information through
   additional interviews and documentation.
   H. If you use interim summaries, explain that to the witness before starting the interview. Be
   sure that they know you are not attempting to put words in their mouth but rephrasing to ensure
   you understand what they are communicating. This technique also allows you to listen to your
   summary and may point out an inconsistency or gap in their answers.
   I. Assure them that often in an interview, a person may draw a blank or not recall certain facts.
   You‘ll note this and come back to it later in the interview. Also, they will have an opportunity
   to provide additional information if they recall it later but you will have to have that information
   soon in order to incorporate it in your report.
Read-Out:
   A. During the read-out, explain that you will order (or direct for USAFR/ANG personnel and
   civilian employees not subject to the UCMJ) that they not discuss the interview with anyone
   except a chaplain, member of congress, an IG, or their counsel (if they have one). Reiterate that
   they are not the subject of the investigation and are not authorized to have counsel but if they
   decide to talk to a lawyer, they may discuss the interview.
   B. Explain that you will be asking them at the end of the Read-Out if they are stressed. The
   CSAF Hand-Off Policy requires that any witness appearing to be emotional, distraught, or
   stunned during the process of any interview must be released to the commander or designee,
   civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first
   sergeant, or supervisor.
Part 2 - Witness Read-In (Recorder is ON)
The time is now ______ on ____________ (day, month, year). Persons present are the witness
_____________, the investigating officer(s) _______________ [recorder(s) (if present)]
______________________ [And (others) (if present) ______________________

During the course of this interview, I will ask you to furnish information about yourself. The
Privacy Act of 1974 requires that I inform you of the authority for this requirement. The
statement, which I am now handing you, serves this purpose (hand statement to witness). Please
read the statement at this time.
Your testimony will be recorded and transcribed so that a written report can be made available
to the Appointing Authority, ________________________ (name of Appointing Authority).
Please answer each question verbally, since the recorder cannot pick up any nods or gestures.
Additionally, all of your statements will be on-the-record, whether the recorder is turned on or
not.
Because this is simply a witness interview, you are not authorized to have legal counsel present,
and AFI 90-301 mandates that you answer all questions except those that may incriminate you.
OATH
Before we continue, I want to remind you how important it is to give truthful testimony. It is a
violation of federal law to knowingly make a false statement under oath. Now, as part of our
interview process, I will administer the oath.
Please raise your right hand so that I can swear you in.
Do you solemnly swear (or affirm) that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)? (NOTE: if the interviewee prefers to
affirm, the verbiage ―so help you God‖ is not used)
Please state for the record your:
Full name: (spell it out)
Grade: (Active, Reserve, Retired)
Social security number: (voluntary)
Organization:
Position:
Address: (home or office)


Part 3 - Questioning the Witness (Recorder is ON)
The following are some items for consideration as you prepare for the questioning part of the
interview:
Advise the witness of the nature of the complaint but not the specifics (i.e., subject, complainant
etc.).
Proceed with questions necessary to obtain all direct knowledge of the ma tters under investigation.
If a witness refuses to answer questions based on self-incrimination or any other reason, stop the
interview and consult with the IG and legal office on how to proceed.
Be prepared for the witness to diverge from the question. You can allow some divergence but
remember that you are the interviewer and control the session. Be sure that you get an answer to
your question and not let the witness escape answering. If necessary, repeat the question.

Take notes of items that you need, or want, to re-address later in the interview as well as
documentation that the witness does not have with them.
Be sensitive to the need for a break during an extended interview. The length between breaks is
dependent on the flow of the interview but normally an hour is a good target. Ensure that you
capture the time of the break before turning off the recorder then don‘t forget to restart the recorder
when the interview continues.
Do you have any further information, statements, or evidence, which you wish to present
concerning the matters we have discussed?
Do you know of anyone else who can provide further information concerning these issues?
Part 4 - Witness Read-Out (Recorder is ON)
This is an official investigation. It is protected in the sense that my report will be made to the
Appointing Authority or higher authority for such use as deemed appropriate.
You are ordered (or "directed" for USAFR/ANG persons and civilian employees not subject to
the UCMJ) not to divulge the nature of this investigation or the questions, answers, or
discussions included in this interview with anyone except a chaplain, member of Congress, IG,
union representative (for civilian employees only), or your counsel (if you have one) unless
authorized to do so by the Appointing Authority, higher authority, or me.
If anyone should approach you regarding your testimony or the matters discussed here, you are
required to report it immediately to me or (state the name of the IG and the Appointing
Authority).
Per AFI 90-301, I, as the investigating officer, am prohibited from providing a copy of your
testimony to you. However, you may submit a request in writing for the report or any part
thereof to the IG office or the appropriate FOIA office. The release authority will evaluate your
request under both the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, and provide the
releasable information to you.
You may submit additional relevant information for my consideration, but if you wish me to
consider the additional information before my investigation closes, I must receive that
information on or before _______________ (insert date).
If you are under stress related to this interview, you may seek assistance from your supervisory
channel, the mental health community, or you may contact either the IG or myself and
arrangements will be made for you to receive assistance.
Do you have any questions?
The time is ____________. This interview is concluded. Thank you.
The witness may recall additional information or want to discuss the circumstances further after
the recorder is off. Remind them that anything they say is on the record, even if the recorder is
off. If you believe the information is essential to your investigation, inform the witness that you
will be re-starting the recorder. It is OK to use an abbreviated read-in but ensure that they
understand they are still under oath and explain the circumstances under which the interview was
re-initiated.

                              SUBJECT INTERVIEW FORMAT

This interview format is for use with witnesses who are subjects and NOT suspects.
Prior to Subject Arriving
Arrive early to work with your IG POC to ensure that the interview room is ready. Here are
some recommended items to go over:
A. A good practice is to add your questions to this template and use it as your note taker.

representation as applicable. Ensure you understand what may trigger the cha nge from a subject
to a suspect and know what to do at that point.
C. Ensure that you have readily available a copy of the Privacy Act for the subject to review and
other documents that you may want to refer to or have the subject review.
D. Have tissues on hand in the event the subject becomes emotional and water for yourself and
the subject, if desired.
E. Ops check the recorder(s) one more time.
F. Ensure that the phones are turned off or being answered by someone in the IG office.

   or designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee,
   first sergeant, or supervisor.
   b. The person designated to receive the subject after the interview should be directed not to
   discuss the interview or other aspects of the investigation with the subject. They should also be
   informed if the subject invoked his/her right to remain silent and that further discussion would
   violate the subject‘s Article 31 rights.
   c. The IO must document the hand-off within the report of investigation.
The interview is conducted in four parts: Pre-Interview, Read-In, Questioning, and Read-out.
These are expanded below.

  days or weeks may have elapsed since that notification. They will most likely be nervous about
  the exact allegations and anxious at the same time to tell their side of the story.

information on or before _______________ (insert date).
In accordance with the CSAF “Hand-off” policy, I must personally refer you to your commander or
designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first
sergeant, or supervisor at the conclusion of this interview. I have coordinated this requirement with
your commander and ______________________(state the name of the individual who will accomplish
the person-to-person hand-off) will meet you here as we conclude the interview.
Do you have any questions?
The time is ____________. This interview is concluded. Thank you.
The subject may recall additional information or want to discuss the circumstances further after
the recorder is off. Remind them that anything they say is on the record, even if the recorder is
off. If you believe the information is essential to your investigation, inform the subject that you
will be re-starting the recorder. It is OK to use an abbreviated read-in but ensure that they
understand they are still under oath and explain the circumstances under which the interview was
re-initiated.
Document the hand-off at the end of the interview. Include your perception of their emotional
state, who was designated to meet them, their position, and the time of the hand-off.

                              SUSPECT INTERVIEW FORMAT

This interview format is for use with witnesses who are suspects and NOT subjects.
Prior to Suspect Arriving
Arrive early to work with your IG POC to ensure that the interview room is ready. Here are
some recommended items to go over:
   A. A good practice is to add your questions to this template and use it as your note taker.
   B. Ensure that you have readily available a copy of the Privacy Act for the suspect to review
   and other documents that you may want to refer to or have the suspect review.
   C. Have an Article 31 Rights Advisement card or statement with the proper allegations filled
   in. Consult with the legal representative to ensure you do this right. Also discuss with your
   legal representative the procedures if the suspect initially elects to confer with a lawyer then
   returns to continue the interview.
   D. Have tissues on hand in the event the suspect becomes emotional and water for yourself
   and the suspect, if desired.
   E. Ops check the recorder(s) one more time.
   F. Ensure that the phones are turned off or being answered by someone in the IG office.
   G. Place a ―Do Not Disturb - Interview in Progress‖ sign on the door.
   H. Have pens, pencils, note paper available and handy.
   I. Ensure that you have coordinated the CSAF Hand-Off with the commander or designee for all
   initial interviews of the suspect.
       a. These referrals require a person-to-person contact between the IO and the suspect‘s
       commander or designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101
       or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor.
       b. The person designated to receive the suspect after the interview should be directed not to
       discuss the interview or other aspects of the investigation with the suspect. They should also
       be informed if the suspect invoked his/her right to remain silent and that further discussion
       would violate the suspect‘s Article 31 rights. The IO must document the hand-off within the
       report of investigation.
The interview is conducted in four parts: Pre-Interview, Read-In, Questioning, and Read-out.
These are expanded below.
Part 1 - Pre-Interview (Recorder is OFF)
The Pre-Interview is an opportunity for the investigating officer to relay to the suspect what they
can expect during the interview. It relaxes the suspect and eases some of the apprehensi on that
they feel. It also starts the bonding process between you as the investigating officer and them as
the suspect.
196                                                      AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


  A. The first step is to use small talk to relax the suspect. Remember that the suspect has been
  previously notified by the commander that they are the suspect of an investigation but several
  days or weeks may have elapsed since that notification. They will most likely be nervous about
  the exact allegations and anxious at the same time to tell their side of the story.
  B. More often than not, the suspect‘s attention will be drawn to the recorder. This is a good
  time to acknowledge that the interview will be recorded to ensure that an accurate record of the
  interview is captured. The recording will be transcribed or summarized and included in the
  report of investigation that you will prepare. If the individual does not focus on the recorder at
  first, be sure to address its use later in the Pre-Interview portion.
  C. Ask for some identification to verify the suspect is who you are expecting. At the same
  time, show the suspect your ID card and appointment letter (but not the attached page with the
  allegations. Explain that you will be going into more detail as you start the interview.
  D. Explain your role as the investigating officer. Below are some suggested areas to cover:
          a. Impartial representative of the commander and IG.
          b. Unbiased and impartial fact finder.
          c. Gather documents and interviewing several witnesses; analyze all the relevant facts;
          and determine whether the allegation(s) are substantiated or not based on a
          preponderance of the evidence.
          d. Your conclusion will be documented in a report of investigation for the appointing
          authority to approve after it receives an IG and legal review.
  E. Explain the role they play in the investigation:
          a. This is their opportunity to provide their side of the situation and reasons for their
          actions.
          b. Their testimony, or any suspect testimony, will be used within the Department of
          Defense for official purposes.
          c. It is Department of the Air Force policy to keep such information and reports
          closely held. Nonetheless, in some instances, there may be public disclosure of IG
          materials, as required by the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, or as
          otherwise provided for by law and regulations. In most cases, their identity will be
          redacted but there is a chance it could be released. Any release outside the
          Department of the Air Force requires the approval of SAF/IG, and in such cases,
          release (when unavoidable) is kept to the minimum necessary to satisfy legal or
          Department of the Air Force requirements.
  F. If there are any other individuals in the interview, explain their role and ensure the suspect
  knows that you are the investigating officer and responsible for the interview.
Read-In
  A. The read-in as well as the read-out are required to be verbatim. This may be uncomfortable
  as you will be referring to your script and not maintaining constant eye contact. Assure them
  that the questioning will be freer flowing.
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 197


   B. Explain that during the Read-In, you will be asking them to provide personal information
   about themselves--name, address, Social Security Number, etc. The Privacy Act of 1974
   requires that the investigating officer inform the suspect of the requirement to gather this
   information and how it will be used. Let them read the Privacy Act statement during the Pre-
   Interview and explain that you will confirm that they have read the statement and have no
   questions. They do not need to sign the Privacy Act.
   C. Inform them that you will be telling them that as a suspect, they are authorized to have legal
   counsel with them. The suspect may ask you if they should confer with an attorney before the
   interview but it is not your place to advise them.
   D. They will be answering questions under oath. Ask if they prefer to use swear or affirm.
   This is a good time to mark through the other option on the read-in and remember that if they
   elect to affirm, also strike the words, ―so help me God.‖
Questioning
   A. Briefly tell them your note taking technique and remind them that the interview is being
   recorded so you‘ll use that as the primary source of information. Too much note taking detracts
   from maintaining eye contact and being part of the interview while taking no notes can be
   perceived as not thinking what the suspect says is important. Discussing this before will help to
   alleviate these perceptions
   B. The questions should be non-adversarial and designed to elicit information, not to get a
   confession.
   C. Inform the suspect that this is an administrative investigation and both hearsay and opinion
   may be used in your evaluation of the facts but you will be validating the information through
   additional interviews and documentation.
   D. If you use interim summaries, explain that to the suspect before starting the interview. Be
   sure that they know you are not attempting to put words in their mouth but rephrasing to ensure
   you understand what they are communicating. This technique also allows you to listen to your
   summary and may point out an inconsistency or gap in their answers
   E. Assure them that often in an interview, a person may draw a blank or not recall certain facts.
   You‘ll note this and come back to it later in the interview. Also, they will have an opportunity
   to provide additional information if they recall it later but you will have to have that information
   soon in order to incorporate it in your report.
   F. At the end of the questioning, they will be afforded an opportunity to make further
   comments.
Read-Out:
   A. During the read-out, explain that you will order (or direct) that they not discuss the
   interview with anyone except a chaplain or their counsel (if they have one).
   B. Explain that the CSAF Hand-Off Policy requires that all suspects must be released to the
   commander or designee, civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101
   or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor. Inform the suspect that this has been coordinated and
   give them the name of the person to whom they will be released.

RIGHTS ADVISEMENT
NOTE: Two categories of rights advisement are included below for suspect interviews. The first
is for active duty personnel and USAFR/ANG subject to the UCMJ. The second category is for
civilians and USAFR/ANG personnel not subject to the UCMJ.
Before we begin our discussion, I want to make it clear that you have the following rights:
       (1) For active duty personnel and USAFR/ANG personnel subject to the UCMJ:

you are suspected. I advise you that under the provisions of Article 31, UCMJ, you have the
right to remain silent, that is say nothing at all. Any statement you make, oral or written, may be
used as evidence against you in a trial by court-martial or in other judicial or administrative
proceedings. You have the right to consult a lawyer and to have a lawyer present during this
interview. You have the right to military legal counsel free of charge. In addition to military
counsel, you are entitled to civilian counsel of your own choosing, at your own expense. You

face adverse administrative action for failing to cooperate, you will not be kept here
involuntarily. You also have a right not to answer questions that are self-incriminating. You
have a right to be fully informed of any allegations that have been made against you.
Do you understand your rights?
Are you willing to answer questions?
OATH
Before we continue, I want to remind you how important it is to give truthful testimony. It is a
violation of federal law to knowingly make a false statement under oath. Now, as part of our
interview process, I will administer the oath.
Please raise your right hand so that I can swear you in.
Do you solemnly swear (or affirm) that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)? (NOTE: if the interviewee prefers to

Social security number: (voluntary)
Address: (home or office)


Part 3 – Questioning the Suspect (Recorder is ON)
Proceed with questions necessary to obtain all direct knowledge of the matters under investigation.
Be prepared for the suspect to diverge from the question. You can allow some divergence but
remember that you are the interviewer and control the session. Be sure that you get an answer to
your question and not let the suspect escape answering. If necessary, repeat the question.
Take notes of items that you need, or want, to re-address later in the interview as well as
documentation that the suspect does not have with them.
Be sensitive to the need for a break during an extended interview. The length between breaks is
dependent on the flow of the interview but normally an hour is a good target. Ensure that you
capture the time of the break before turning off the recorder then don‘t forget to restart the recorder
when the interview continues.
At the conclusion of the interrogatories, ask:
 200                                                      AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012

concerning the matters we have discussed?
Do you know of anyone else who can provide further information concerning these issues?

The findings and conclusion for each allegation should build on the factual summary and
discussion in this section. Findings must be supported by the facts addressed in the analysis
(testimony and documentation). Findings must address all allegations. Each allegation should
be addressed separately. If the facts do not demonstrate it is more likely than not that the alleged
wrong occurred, the allegations should be found not substantiated. The IO must sign the report
at the end of Tab C.
NOTE: Recommendations are optional at the discretion of the appointing authority. If an IO is
tasked to make recommendations, the recommendations are not binding. If requested,
recommendations will be provided under separate cover and will be filed at Section I, Tab D (not

   MEMORANDUM FOR 99 MSG/CC
   FROM: (Appointing Authority)
   SUBJECT: Results of IG Investigation
   1. We have recently completed an Inspector General investigation into an allegation that Lt Col Jane
   Boss, Commander, 9777th Security Force Squadron, Kirtley AFB, FL, abused her authority when
   selecting a military member for TDY to Southwest Asia. An impartial officer investigated the
   allegation and found it to be not substantiated.
   2. The investigation found that Lt Col Boss established and followed a fair and equitable procedure for
   selecting squadron personnel for TDY. The complainant possessed the grade, AFSC, and SEI required
   for the TDY; had the fewest number of days TDY of anyone eligible for the tasking; possessed a
   worldwide qualified physical profile report; and did not present a hardship or humanitarian reason
   justifying exemption or deferment from TDY.
   3. In accordance with AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution, paragraph 3.64.2, you
   must inform Lt Col Boss, in writing, of the finding of the investigation. The Report of Investigation
   has been reviewed and approved, and we consider the matter closed. [For reprisal cases, replace the
   last sentence with: The Report of Investigation has been reviewed and approved locally; however,
   final approval authority rests with the Department of Defense Inspector General because the
   complainant alleged military whistleblower reprisal.]
    4. [For cases containing substantiated allegations, include this paragraph] A copy of the Report
    of Investigation (without attachments) is provided for your review to determine appropriate command
    action. IAW AFI 90-301 [include only applicable references: paragraphs 3.64, 3.65, 3.67, 5.6,
    5.7, Table 3.17 rule 1, Table 5.1 rule 7, and Table 5.2 rule 1], please advise the [use applicable
    title(s): Appointing Authority, IG] of what command action is taken and provide the required
    documents. IG records are protected documents. IAW AFI 90-301 paragraph 14.12, you must
    submit an Official Use Request to the authority responsible for making release determinations to: a)
    seek approval to release relevant portions of the ROI or case file to the subject of any proposed
    command action, and/or b) obtain additional

                                       (FOUO Only When Filled In)
   portions of the case file beyond the information initially provided by the authority responsible for
   making release determinations. This transfer of IG records is permitted as an intra-agency disclosure to
   officers of the agency having a need for the record in the performance of their official duties. You are
   advised of the protected nature of the report and instructed to comply with the provisions of the Privacy
   Act in using the report. We require that you use all reasonable means at your disposal to prevent
   further release of the information other than official discussions with personnel and legal officials on
   disciplinary proceedings against the subject. IG records are not to be used as attachments or exhibits to
   other official records without the written approval of the authority responsible for making release
   determinations. The IG records must be returned to the authority responsible for making release
   determinations upon completion of the stated need.

                WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS UNDER 10 USC 1034

1. Any Air Force military member who reasonably believes a personnel action (including the
withholding of an action) was taken or threatened in reprisal for making or preparing to make a
protected communication (as defined in 10 USC 1034, DoDD 7050.06 and AFI 90-301) may file
a complaint with the Air Force Inspector General (or lower level IG). To qualify as a protected
communication, it must be made to: an IG; a member of an IG office investigative staff;
Member of Congress or their staff; a member of a DoD audit, inspection, investigation, or law
enforcement organization; safety, Equal Opportunity, and family advocacy organizations; any
person in the member‘s chain of command; Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force; Command
Chief Master Sergeant; Group and Squadron Superintendent, or First Sergeant.
2. It is of utmost importance for all military members to understand that they receive
whistleblower protection under 10 USC 1034 when submitting a complaint with any IG. This
office will promptly notify IG DoD of your complaint. Upon receipt of the notification, IG DoD
may decide to retain your allegations for complaint analysis at their level. If IG DoD decides to
retain your allegations, this office will discontinue its efforts to resolve your complaint in order
to allow IG DoD to proceed unimpeded.
3. This office will expeditiously conduct a complaint analysis to determine if a reprisal
investigation is warranted. If the complaint analysis determines that a reprisal investigation is
not warranted, IG DoD will be notified accordingly. However, IG DoD reserves the right to
investigate the complaint.
4. If a reprisal investigation is warranted, this office will conduct the investigation, unless
otherwise directed by a higher level IG office.
5. IG DoD will maintain oversight throughout the conduct of any investigation into allegations
of reprisal.
6. You must understand that the IG may dismiss your allegations if you did not file this
complaint within 60 days of becoming aware of the personnel action that is the basis for your
allegations.
7. Be advised that acceptance of your complaint under 10 USC 1034 entitles you to the
following statutory provisions: review and approval of the finalized investigation by IG DoD;
right to receive a redacted copy of the final Report of Investigation in accordance with the
Freedom of Information Act; right to petition the Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records (AFBCMR) for correction of adverse personnel actions; and right to appeal AFBCMR
findings to the Secretary of Defense.
Acknowledgment
I have read and understand the above explanation of my rights under 10 USC 1034 and proper
reprisal complaint procedures.

   Date
 24 Jan 07       SrA Complainant refuses to complete course objectives due to seeing one of his
                 classmates fall during one of the class objectives. During a meeting with the
                 Electrical System Apprentice Course Instructor Supervisors, SrA Complainant
                 stated that he was threatened with discharge from the AF, threatened with court-
                 martial and called a coward.
 7 Feb 07        2007-XXX1--SrA Complainant came to the 199th Wing Inspector General‘s
                 Office to discuss the treatment that he received from the instructors in the
                 Electrical System Apprentice Course. The Electrical System Flight Commander
                 was contacted and SrA Complainant was referred back to his commander.

              Brief summary of communication: MSgt Helpful interviewed SrA Complainant for
              background information on the Electrical System Apprentice Course because he was

              climbing the poles without a safety harness. The IG reminded SrA Complainant that
              Wing Safety was conducting an assessment. The safety report was provided to SrA
              Complainant on 4 Mar 07. (Attachme nt 4)
              NOTE: The following protected communication occurred after the alleged
              adverse actions
       d. Date: 18 Jun 07
          To Whom:
          Name: MSgt Very P. Helpful
          Position/Title: Deputy Inspector General, 199th Wing, Somewhere AFB, USA
          Brief summary of communication: SrA Complainant requested that his complaint
          be dropped.
   (2) Was an unfavorable personnel action taken or threatened; or was a favorable
   action withheld, or threatened to be withheld, following the protected disclosure? Yes.
       On 5 Mar 07, Lt Col Boss, Commander of the 199th Training Squadron eliminated SrA
       Complainant from the Electrical Systems Apprentice Course. (Attachment 8)
    (3) Did the official(s) responsible for taking, withholding, threatening, or influe ncing
   the personnel action know about the protected communication? Yes.
       SrA Complainant stated he told Lt Col Boss he contacted the IG regarding safety issues.
    (4) Does the preponderance of the evidence establish that the personnel action would
   have been taken, withheld, or threatened if the protected disclosure had not been
   made? Yes.
(a) Reasons: (the responsible management officials took, withheld, threatened, or influenced
the action)

              Lt Col Boss stated on the MAJCOM Form 125 that SrA Complainant be eliminated
              from training based on his fear of falling. AFI 36-2102, Classifying Military
              Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), 7 Mar 2006, states members who hold the Electrical
              Systems Apprentice Specialty Code must have ―freedom from the fear of heights‖
              (Attachment 9). Additionally, SrA Complainant was not administered the fear of
              heights test prior to course entry, when he enlisted in the AF. Further, Captain
              Hospital, Clinical Social Worker for the 199th MDG, recommended SrA
              Complainant for elimination and retraining into another career field on 13 Feb 07
              (Attachment 7).
              NOTE: An argume nt to dismiss should be made primarily on docume ntary
              evidence and limited interviews of the witnesses and RMO. If a dismissal is not
              warranted or the argume nt to dismiss is not completed within 29 days of the
              open date, an imme diate recomme ndation to investigate is warranted.
       (b) Reasonableness: (of the action taken, withheld, threatened, or influenced
       considering the complainant‘s performance and conduct)
 216                                                     AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


           The facts showed SrA Complainant‘s elimination from training was reasonable under
           the circumstances. Although SrA Complainant was proficient at pole-climbing with a
           safety harness, he refused to pole-climb without the harness, a requirement for
           completion of training. Additionally, SrA Complainant identified himself as having a
           fear of heights.
       (c) Consistency: (of the actions of responsible management officials with past practice)
           Lt Col Boss‘ decision to eliminate SrA Complainant from training was consistent
           with past practice. SrA Complainant identified a fear of falling and would not pole-
           climb without a safety harness. Without the requisite climbing ability and confidence
           to pole climb without a safety harness, SrA Complainant would not pass the course.
       (d) Motive: (of the responsible management official for deciding, taking, withholding, or
       influencing the personnel action)
           Unknown.
           (NOTE: In this example, the IG was unable to determine the motive without
           interviewing the RMO.)
       (e) Procedural correctness:
           Lt Col Boss‘ decision to eliminate SrA Complainant from training was conducted in
           accordance with regulation and procedure.


8. ANALYSIS OF COMPLAINT:
   a. SrA Complainant alleged he was eliminated from the Electrical Systems Training course
   in Mar 07 in reprisal for his Jan-Feb 07 protected communication to the IG regarding safety
   issues in the Electrical Systems Training course. The facts showed SrA Complainant refused
   to complete the pole-climbing course objective based on a fear of falling. In accordance with
   the Enlisted Classification Directory, members entering the electrical career field must have
   ―freedom from fear of heights.‖
   b. The facts showed SrA Complainant was not administered the fear of heights test IAW
   AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards, prior to entering the Electrical Systems
   Apprentice Course. The squadron did not identify this discrepancy until the pole-climbing
   portion of the Electrical System Apprentice Course when SrA Complainant indicated he had
   a fear of falling. Additionally, on 14 Feb 07, SrA Complainant contacted the IG about being
   yelled at and the wing safety office regarding safety concerns in the Electrical Systems
   Apprentice Course.
   c. On 5 Mar 07, the squadron commander removed SrA Complainant from the Electrical
   Systems Apprentice Course and recommended he be retrained based on his fear of falling
   and the failure of the AF to administer the fear of heights test before he entered the career
   field.
9. DETERMINATION:
Based on a review of the documentation and complainant interview, an investigation into the
allegation of reprisal under 10 USC 1034 for being eliminated from training is not warranted and
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                                            217


the allegation of reprisal should be dismissed. Further, the acid test for abuse of authority was
conducted and there is no evidence of abuse of authority.
[Must provide detailed rationale if recommending NOT to conduct an investigation -- Analysis
and any attachments/testimony must be forwarded to IG DoD (through MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
and SAF/IGQ) for final determination]

NOTE: Lt Mooney alleged that his assignment as a casual student on 16 Apr 10 to administrative duties
in the 502 TRS Stan Eval section was an adverse personnel action since his new duties had nothing to do
with his training. Clarification revealed this is standard practice in the 502 TRS when students are in an
extended non-training status and is consistent with AETC policy. A review of the assigned duties found
they were compatible with Lt Mooney‘s training status, grade, and lack of a qualified AFSC. In fact, the
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                        219


duties had the potential for positive career impact in that Lt Mooney was productive and contributing to
the unit mission vice simply waiting on the personnel system to make a determination in his case. For
these reasons, the assignment to the Stan Eval section as a casual student will not be cons idered as a UPA
in this analysis.

    SKE #     Date                                                    Event

          1          Dec 09       The complainant was selected for AFSC 13S, Space and Missile Officer
                                  Career Field (Atch 5).
          2        29 Dec 09      Complainant reported for training at Ground Zero AFB AZ. He informed
                                  his Flight Commander, Capt Wayne Johns, and the 502 TRS Personnel
                                  Reliability Program (PRP) Monitor, Capt Nicole Pope, that he had
                                  reservations about launching nuclear weapons and that he was possibly
                                  medically ineligible for PRP. The Flight Commander and PRP Monitor
                                  asked the complainant to write a Memorandum For Record (MFR) outlining
                                  his reservations concerning nuclear duty. Capt Pope scheduled the
                                  complainant for a medical appointment on 4 Feb 10 to ensure medical
                                  eligibility (Atch 1 and 2).
      3             4 Jan 10      Complainant submitted a memo to the Flight Commander outlining his
                                  reservations about nuclear weapons (Atch 1, 2 and 3).
      4             22 Jan 10     The complainant was informed that he would not be starting the 1 Feb 10
                                  missile training course due to his objections to nuclear weapons duty and
                                  questionable medical qualifications for PRP (Atch 2 and 3).
      5             4 Feb 10      Complainant was found medically qualified for PRP (Atch 2 and 3).
      6             5 Feb 10      Complainant asked Capt Pope when he could meet with Lt Col Warren
                                  Peace, 502 TRS/CC, concerning reservations about nuclear weapons duty.
                                  Capt Pope did not know (Atch 2).
      7            25 Feb 10      The complainant again attempted to determine when he could speak with the
                                  502 TRS/CC. Capt Natalie Johnson (502 TRS/DOC) spoke with Flight
                                  Commander and appointment with 502 TRS/CC was set for 1 Mar 10 (Atch
                                  2).
      8             1 Mar 10      Complainant met with the 502 TRS/CC, the Flight Commander, and the First
                                  Sergeant, MSgt Nick Jackson, to discuss the complainant‘s concerns about
                                  nuclear weapons duty. Complainant would not answer several of 502
                                  TRS/CC questions and 502 TRS/CC asked the complainant to take a week to
                                  formulate his answers. 502 TRS/CC requested complainant return with an
                                  MFR outlining his answers. Follow-on meeting scheduled for 8 Mar 10
                                  (Atch 2).
      9             8 Mar 10      Complainant provided previously requested MFR to 502 TRS/CC indicating
                                  his position concerning nuclear weapons duty had not changed and he still
                                  did not have answers to her questions. 502 TRS/CC informed complainant
                                  she would be recommending his separation from the AF using the Not
                                  Qualified for Promotion (NQP) process (Atch 2 and 3).
      10           10 Mar 10      502 TRS/CC met with 44th Space Wing Judge Advocate (44 SW/JA) to
                                  discuss NQP package for complainant. Decision made to delay initiation of
                                  NQP package for complainant due to pending adjudication of an NQP
                                  package for another student in similar circumstances already being worked
                                  by 44 SW/JA (Atch 3).

      11    22 Mar 10      Complainant filed complaint with the 44th Space Wing Inspector General
                           (44 SW/IG) at Ground Zero AFB AZ (FRNO 2010-15101). Case transferred
                           to 555 TRW/IG for analysis and disposition on 23 Mar 10 (Atch 2). (PC 1)
      12    25 Mar 10      502 TRS/CC learned that the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) had
                           established a separation/reclassification board for students who failed to
                           complete Initial Skills Training (IST). 502 TRS/CC also informed that 44
                           SW/JA had finished NQP package they had been working on concerning a
                           different student (Atch 3).
      13    27 Mar 10      555 TRW/IG finished analysis of complaint alleging noncompliance with
                           AETCI and determined complaint should be referred to 501st Training
                           Group Commander (501 TRG/CC) (Atch 2).
      14    29 Mar 10      After learning of new procedures, 502 TRS/CC directed the Flight
              0800         Commander and his replacement, Capt Larry Heston, to begin AETC Form
                           125A,Record of Administrative Training Action, recommending separation
                           to the AFPC separation/reclassification board scheduled for 15 Apr 10.
                           Until AFPC established the new procedures, only option for 502 TRS/CC
                           concerning students not entering training was to pursue separation via NQP
                           or reclassify student (Atch 3).
      15    29 Mar 10      555 TRW/IG sent final response memo to complainant and emailed referral
                           memorandum to 501 TRG/CC, formally referring complaint to command for
                           further analysis and final disposition (Atch 2).
      16    29 Mar 10      501 TRG/CC called 502 TRS/CC and informed her of the IG complaint
                           referred by 555 TRW/IG (RMO Kno wledge) (Atch 3).
      17    31 Mar 10      Complainant met with 502 TRS/CC and First Sergeant. Complainant
                           informed 502 TRS/CC that he had filed complaint with 44 SW/IG.
                           Complainant informed 502 TRS/CC that, after speaking with Capt Chad Pitt
                           (502 TRS instructor), his reservation about performing nuclear weapons duty
                           were gone and he felt 100% capable of doing the job. Based on conversation
                           with complainant, 502 TRS/CC was comfortable and confident in
                           recommending complainant for reclassification instead of separation.
                           However, his original objections to nuclear weapons duty were sufficient for
                           her to have continued reservations about his ability to deploy nuclear
                           weapons. As a result, she initiated an AF Form 286A to permanently
                           decertify the complainant from PRP. (UPA) The complainant was given 14
                           days to submit documents to 502 TRS/CC as the certifying authority. On 8
                           Apr 10, the complainant acknowledged his right to appeal the permanent
                           decertification via digital signature on the AF For 286A and also certified
                           that he would not submit any additional information to the 502 TRS/CC in
                           response to his decertification. 501 TRG/CC reviewed the PRP
                           decertification on 12 Apr 10 (Atch 3, 4, and 5).
      18    12 Apr 10      501 TRG/CC emailed 555 TRW/IG a summary of actions taken in response
                           to the referral of the complainant‘s original IG complaint (Atch 3).
      19    25 May 10      The Initial Skills Training Reclassification/Discharge Panel met at AFPC
                           and determined the complainant would not be reclassified but would be
                           discharged (Atch 6).
      20   On or about 1   Complainant was notified of the IST panel decision and informed he would
              Jun 10       be discharged from active duty with an honorable discharge. Since the
                           complainant was prior enlisted in the AF, he was also offered the
                           opportunity to reenlist at his previous enlisted grade (Atch 6).

      21              9 Jun 10           Complainant filed complaint with 555 TRW/IG alleging his PRP
                                         decertification was in reprisal for his filing an IG complaint of wrong on the
                                         part of the 502 TRS/CC. Current case file, FRNO Case 2010-20101,
                                         opened. (PC 2 – Occurred after UPA) (Atch 1)
ANALYSIS.

NOTE: An argument to dismiss should be made primarily on documentary evidence and limited
interviews of the witness and RMO. If a dismissal is not warranted or the argument to dismiss is not
completed within 29 days of the open date, an immediate recommendation to investigate is warranted.

UPA 1, AF 286A PRP Decertification:

502 TRS/CC. After the complainant expressed reservations about nuclear weapons duty, he was unable
or reluctant to answer the 502 TRS/CC questions concerning acceptable casualty levels. The 502
TRS/CC gave him an additional week to prepare a written response to her questions after which she
would interview him again to determine his status (SKE #8). The complainant, after one week, still
would not give a specific answer to her questions and she determined he was not suited for entry into the
Space and Missile Officer‘s course (SKE #9). At that time, the only options available for the 502
TRS/CC for dealing with this situation was to either reclassify the complainant or seek separation through
the Not Qualified for Promotion process.

                                              FOR OFFICIAL US E ONLY (FOUO)
                                                   (FOUO Only When Filled In)


The 502 TRS/CC advised the complainant she intended to separate him from the AF using the NQP
process (SKE #9). Because the 502 TRS/CC intended to pursue separation, decertification from PRP was
not an issue as a PRP determination would be necessary only if the 502 TRS/CC intended to recommend
reclassification and continued service for the complainant.

    Initiation of the NQP process to separate the complainant was delayed pending resolution of a similar
NQP action already in progress. Starting a second NQP action would likely saturate the available JA
resources (SKE #10). In addition, the 502 TRS/CC appeared to view the ongoing NQP action as a test
case and needed the process feedback before beginning the complainant‘s NQP action. During this delay,
the 502 TRS/CC learned of the recently established Initial Skills Training Reclassification/Discharge
Board at AFPC (SKE #12). Upon learning that this option was available, she elected to have the
complainant meet the AFPC board in lieu of NQP action with a recommendation to the board that the
complainant be separated from active duty (SKE #14). At this point in the process, the 502 TRS/CC
learned of the IG complaint filed by the complainant with 555 TRW/IG from the 501 TRG/CC (SKE
#16). In response to the complaint, the 502 TRS/CC met with the complainant to fully inform him of the
actions ongoing at which point the complainant also informed the 502 TRS/CC that he had filed the IG
complaint (SKE #17). The two actions establish 502 TRS/CC knowledge of the protected
communication. During the same conversation, the complainant restated his position with respect to
employment of nuclear weapons and tried to convince the 502 TRS/CC that his position had changed
sufficiently to where he should be retained in the Space and Missile Officer course. The 502 TRS/CC,
based on the conversation, reversed her original decision that the complainant should be separated from
the AF. Since she now believed the complainant should be retained and reclassified, she had to make a
decision with respect to his PRP status. She remained unconvinced, based on the complainant‘s original
objections, that the complainant‘s attitude had changed sufficiently to merit her full faith and confidence
 222                                                                         AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


that he would execute the nuclear mission. Based on this analysis, she proceeded to permanently
disqualify the complainant from PRP (SKE #17).

     With respect to the PRP decertification, it must be noted that the complainant did digitally
acknowledge his right to appeal the decertification and also to submit matters to the 502 TRS/CC on his
behalf. The complainant elected not to exercise either of these rights at the time and apparently accepted
the PRP decertification without protest (Atch 4). The 502 TRS/CC did recommend to the AFPC board
that the complainant be retained and reclassified. The material she submitted to the board did note that
the complainant had been permanently disqualified from PRP due to his objections to employment of
nuclear weapons (Atch 5). On 25 May 10, the AFPC board determined that the complainant should not
be retained and directed he be discharged with an honorable discharge (SKE #20). When the complainant
was notified of these results, he elected to file the current complaint alleging the PRP decertification was
in reprisal for his filing the original IG complaint (SKE #21).

     The evidence leads us to believe the 502 TRS/CC would have permanently disqualified the
complainant from PRP even if the protected communication had not occurred. The actual catalyst for her
PRP decision was her change of opinion that the complainant should not be separated but reclassified. At
that point, she had to make a decision regarding PRP. If the 502 TRS/CC thought that the complainant
was able to do the nuclear mission, then reclassification would not be necessary as he would be fully
qualified to begin Space and Missile Officer training. However, the evidence suggests this was not the
case and, despite the complainant‘s assertion that his previous objections were no longer valid, she did not
have full faith and confidence he could do the nuclear mission. At this point, PRP
            This is a protected document. It will not be released (in whole or in part), reproduced, or gi ven additional
              dissemination (in whole or in part) outsi de Inspector General channels without prior approval of the

                                              FOR OFFICIAL US E ONLY (FOUO)
                                                   (FOUO Only When Filled In)



decertification was required by directive which rendered the complainant ineligible for Space and Missile
Officer training and led to the decision that reclassification was necessary. The 502 TRS/CC
determination of the complainant‘s suitability for Space and Missile Officer duty was consistent before
and after the protected communication. Accordingly, we feel the evidence does not warrant further
inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 regarding this RMO.

501 TRG/CC. On 12 Apr 10, the 501 TRG/CC reviewed and agreed with the decertification action
enacted by the 502 TRS/CC (SKE #17). The 501 TRG/CC had knowledge of PC#1 as the original IG
complaint was referred to her by the 555 TRW/IG and she, in turn, notified the 502 TRS/CC of the
complaint (SKE #15 and #16). The 501 TRG/CC was not named in any assertions of wrongdoing by the
complainant in his original complaint. As such, the likelihood that she had a motive to reprise is low.
Her agreement with the 502 TRS/CC decertification decision is reasonable based on the complainant‘s
actions as stated above. The complainant adamantly expressed concerns about his ability to employ
nuclear weapons until faced with the prospect of separation (SKE #17). When confronted with the
prospect of separation, the complainant had a sudden change of heart and expressed full confidence that
he would be able to employ nuclear weapons and wished to continue training. The 502 TRS/CC noted
the change in attitude and reversed her decision to recommend separation and, instead, fully supported
reclassification and indicted by her recommendation to the IST Board (Atch 5). However, the 502
TRS/CC still did not believe the complainant would be able to employ nuclear weapons without
reservations based on the initial series of contacts they had concerning the subject. Thus, she was unable
to support PRP certification that would allow him to continue in Space and Missile Officer training. In
light of the evidence, her conclusion was reasonable and based in fact. The 501 TRG/CC appears to have
AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                                             223


agreed with the 502 TRS/CC decisions as she supported the reclassification effort via endorsement of the
favorable package submitted to the IST Board (Atch 5). Her concurrence w ith the 502 TRS/CC PRP
decertification decision, based on the evidence, is logical and reasonable and appears to be the result of
her charter to ensure personnel with missile launch responsibility meet the reliability requirements of PRP
and will be able to execute the nuclear launch option if necessary. The evidence supports both the 502
TRS/CC and 501 TRG/CC reservations about the true intentions of the complainant when he reversed his
stance on employment of nuclear weapons. Accordingly, we feel the ev idence does not warrant further
inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 regarding this RMO.

RECOMMENDATION:

The evidence does not support the conclusion that the 502 TRS/CC or 501 TRG/CC reprised against the
complainant thru their PRP decertification actions. Rather, the evidence suggests the PRP decertification
action would have occurred regardless of any protected communications. The need to make a PRP
decision was precipitated by the decision to discontinue NQP processing and refer the
separation/reclassification decision to the newly established AFPC IST Board. This decision was made
prior to the protected communication. Prior to the protected communication, the 502 TRS/CC was going
to recommend the IST Board separate the complainant. After learning of the protected communication
and meeting with the complainant, the 502 TRS/CC decided to support reclassification vice separation but
could not, in good faith, support PRP certification. The PRP decertification action is supported by the
available evidence and complainant actions. The 501 TRG/CC review and endorsement of the PRP
decertification action is reasonable and consistent with her nuclear surety responsibilities. The evidence
suggests the PRP decertification decision was not an issue for the complainant until the IST Board
decided he should be separated despite the 502 TRS/CC and 501 TRG/CC support of reclassification.

rationale that mitigates against reprisal supports our argument that the RMO actions do not support
credible allegations of abuse of authority.

It is our conclusion that no further inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 is warranted and this
complaint should be dismissed pursuant to review and approval by IG DoD MRI.

NOTE: Lt Rooney alleged that his assignment as a casual student on 16 Apr 10 to administrative duties
in the 502 TRS Stan Eval section was an adverse personnel action since his new duties had nothing to do
with his training. Clarification revealed this is standard practice in the 502 TRS when students are in an
extended non-training status and is consistent with AETC policy. A review of the assigned duties found
they were compatible with Lt Rooney‘s training status, grade, and lack of a qualified AFSC. In fact, the
duties had the potential for positive career impact in that Lt Rooney was productive and contributing to
the unit mission vice simply waiting on the personnel system to make a determination in his case. For
these reasons, the assignment to the Stan Eval section as a casual student will not be considered as a UPA
in this analysis.

              1         Dec 09     The complainant was selected for AFSC 13S, Space and Missile Officer
                                   Career Field (Atch 5).
              2        29 Dec 09   Complainant reported for training at Ground Zero AFB AZ. He informed
                                   his Flight Commander, Capt John Wayne, and the 502 TRS Personnel
                                   Reliability Program (PRP) Monitor, Capt Nicole Kidman, that he had
                                   reservations about launching nuclear weapons and that he was possibly
                                   medically ineligible for PRP. The Flight Commander and PRP Monitor
                                   asked the complainant to write a Memorandum For Record (MFR) outlining
                                   his reservations concerning nuclear duty. Capt Kidman scheduled the
                                   complainant for a medical appointment on 4 Feb 10 to ensure medical
                                   eligibility (Atch 1 and 2).
          3             4 Jan 10   Complainant submitted a memo to the Flight Commander outlining his
                                   reservations about nuclear weapons (Atch 1, 2 and 3).
          4            22 Jan 10   The complainant was informed that he would not be starting the 1 Feb 10
                                   missile training course due to his objections to nuclear weapons duty and
                                   questionable medical qualifications for PRP (Atch 2 and 3).
          5            4 Feb 10    Complainant was found medically qualified for PRP (Atch 2 and 3).
          6            5 Feb 10    Complainant asked Capt Kidman when he could meet with Lt Col Gwyneth
                                   Paltrow, 502 TRS/CC, concerning reservations about nuclear weapons duty.
                                   Capt Kidman did not know (Atch 2).

    7        25 Feb 10   The complainant again attempted to determine when he could speak with the
                         502 TRS/CC. Capt Natalie Portman (502 TRS/DOC) spoke with Flight
                         Commander and appointment with 502 TRS/CC was set for 1 Mar 10 (Atch
                         2).
    8        1 Mar 10    Complainant met with the 502 TRS/CC, the Flight Commander, and the First
                         Sergeant, MSgt Jack Nicholson, to discuss the complainant‘s concerns about
                         nuclear weapons duty. Complainant would not answer several of 502
                         TRS/CC questions and 502 TRS/CC asked the complainant to take a week to
                         formulate his answers. 502 TRS/CC requested complainant return with an
                         MFR outlining his answers. Follow-on meeting scheduled for 8 Mar 10
                         (Atch 2).
    9        8 Mar 10    Complainant provided previously requested MFR to 502 TRS/CC indicating
                         his position concerning nuclear weapons duty had not changed and he still
                         did not have answers to her questions. 502 TRS/CC informed complainant
                         she would be recommending his separation from the Air Force using the Not
                         Qualified for Promotion (NQP) process (Atch 2 and 3).
    10       10 Mar 10   502 TRS/CC met with 44th Space Wing Judge Advocate (44 SW/JA) to
                         discuss NQP package for complainant. Decision made to delay initia tion of
                         NQP package for complainant due to pending adjudication of an NQP
                         package for another student in similar circumstances already being worked
                         by 44 SW/JA (Atch 3).
    11       22 Mar 10   Complainant filed complaint with the 44th Space Wing Inspector Genera l
                         (44 SW/IG) at Ground Zero AFB AZ (FRNO 2010-15101). Case transferred
                         to 555 TRW/IG for analysis and disposition on 23 Mar 10 (Atch 2). (PC 1)
    12       25 Mar 10   502 TRS/CC learned that the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) had
                         established a separation/reclassification board for students who failed to
                         complete Initial Skills Training (IST). 502 TRS/CC also informed that 44
                         SW/JA had finished NQP package they had been working on concerning a
                         different student (Atch 3).
    13       27 Mar 10   555 TRW/IG finished analysis of complaint alleging noncompliance with
                         AETCI and determined complaint should be referred to 501st Training
                         Group Commander (501 TRG/CC) (Atch 2).
    14       29 Mar 10   After learning of new procedures, 502 TRS/CC directed the Flight
               0800      Commander and his replacement, Capt Charles Heston, to begin AETC
                         Form 125A,Record of Administrative Training Action, recommending
                         separation to the AFPC separation/reclassification board scheduled for 15
                         Apr 10. Until AFPC established the new procedures, only option for 502
                         TRS/CC concerning students not entering training was to pursue separation
                         via NQP or reclassify student (Atch 3).
    15       29 Mar 10   555 TRW/IG sent final response memo to complainant and emailed referral
                         memorandum to 501 TRG/CC, formally referring complaint to command for
                         further analysis and final disposition (Atch 2).
    16       29 Mar 10   501 TRG/CC called 502 TRS/CC and informed her of the IG complaint
                         referred by 555 TRW/IG (RMO Kno wledge) (Atch 3).
 228                                                                         AFI90-301_ACCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


       17            31 Mar 10           Complainant met with 502 TRS/CC and First Sergeant. Complainant
                                         informed 502 TRS/CC that he had filed complaint with 44 SW/IG.
                                         Complainant informed 502 TRS/CC that, after speaking with Capt Brad Pitt
                                         (502 TRS instructor), his reservation about performing nuclear weapons duty
                                         were gone and he felt 100% capable of doing the job. Based on conversation
                                         with complainant, 502 TRS/CC was comfortable and confident in
                                         recommending complainant for reclassification instead of separation.
                                         However, his original objections to nuclear weapons duty were suff icient for
                                         her to have continued reservations about his ability to deploy nuclear
                                         weapons. As a result, she initiated an AF Form 286A to permanently
                                         decertify the complainant from PRP. (UPA) The complainant was given 14
                                         days to submit documents to 502 TRS/CC as the certifying authority. On 8
                                         Apr 10, the complainant acknowledged his right to appeal the permanent
                                         decertification via digital signature on the AF For 286A and also certified
                                         that he would not submit any additional information to the 502 TRS/CC in
                                         response to his decertification. 501 TRG/CC reviewed the PRP
                                         decertification on 12 Apr 10 (Atch 3, 4, and 5).
       18            12 Apr 10           501 TRG/CC emailed 555 TRW/IG a summary of actions taken in response
                                         to the referral of the complainant‘s original IG complaint (Atch 3).
       19            25 May 10           The Initial Skills Training Reclassification/Discharge Panel met at AFPC
                                         and determined the complainant would not be reclassified but would be
                                         discharged (Atch 6).
       20          On or about 1         Complainant was notified of the IST panel decision and informed he would
                      Jun 10             be discharged from active duty with an honorable discharge. Since the
                                         complainant was prior enlisted in the AF, he was also offered the
                                         opportunity to reenlist at his previous enlisted grade (Atch 6).
       21             9 Jun 10           Complainant filed complaint with 555 TRW/IG alleging his PRP
                                         decertification was in reprisal for his filing an IG complaint of wrong on the
                                         part of the 502 TRS/CC. Current case file, FRNO Case 2010-20101,
                                         opened. (PC 2 – Occurred after UPA) (Atch 1)


ANALYSIS.

UPA 1, AF 286A PRP Decertification:

502 TRS/CC. After the complainant expressed reservations about nuclear weapons duty, he was unable
or reluctant to answer the 502 TRS/CC questions concerning acceptable casualty levels. The 502
TRS/CC gave him an additional week to prepare a written response to her questions after which she
would interview him again to determine his status (SKE #8). The complainant, after one week, still
would not give a specific answer to her questions and she determined he was not suited for entry into the
Space and Missile Officer‘s course (SKE #9). At that time, the only options available for the 502
TRS/CC for dealing with this situation was to either reclassify the complainant or seek separation through
the Not Qualified for Promotion process. The 502 TRS/CC advised the complainant she intended to

pursue separation, decertification from PRP was not an issue as a PRP determination would

be necessary only if the 502 TRS/CC intended to recommend reclassification and continued service for
the complainant.

    Initiation of the NQP process to separate the complainant was delayed pending resolution of a similar
NQP action already in progress. Starting a second NQP action would likely saturate the available JA
resources (SKE #10). In addition, the 502 TRS/CC appeared to view the ongoing NQP action as a test
case and needed the process feedback before beginning the complainant‘s NQP action. During this delay,
the 502 TRS/CC learned of the recently established Initial Skills Training Reclassification/Discharge
Board at AFPC (SKE #12). Upon learning that this option was available, she elected to have the
complainant meet the AFPC board in lieu of NQP action with a recommendation to the board that the
complainant be separated from active duty (SKE #14). At this point in the process, the 502 TRS/CC
learned of the IG complaint filed by the complainant with 555 TRW/IG from the 501 TRG/CC (SKE
#16). In response to the complaint, the 502 TRS/CC met with the complainant to fully inform him of the
actions ongoing at which point the complainant also informed the 502 TRS/CC that he had filed the IG
complaint (SKE #17). The two actions establish 502 TRS/CC knowledge of the protected
communication. During the same conversation, the complainant restated his position with respect to
employment of nuclear weapons and tried to convince the 502 TRS/CC that his position had changed
sufficiently to where he should be retained in the Space and Missile Officer course. The 502 TRS/CC,
based on the conversation, reversed her original decision that the complainant should be separated from
the Air Force. Since she now believed the complainant should be retained and reclassified, she had to
make a decision with respect to his PRP status. She remained unconvinced, based on the complainant‘s
original objections, that the complainant‘s attitude had changed sufficiently to merit her full faith and
confidence that he would execute the nuclear mission. Based on this analysis, she proceeded to
permanently disqualify the complainant from PRP (SKE #17).

     With respect to the PRP decertification, it must be noted that the complainant did digitally
acknowledge his right to appeal the decertification and also to submit matters to the 502 TRS/CC on his
behalf. The complainant elected not to exercise either of these rights at the time and apparently accepted
the PRP decertification without protest (Atch 4). The 502 TRS/CC did recommend to the AFPC board
that the complainant be retained and reclassified. The material she submitted to the board did note that
the complainant had been permanently disqualified from PRP due to his objections to employment of
nuclear weapons (Atch 5). On 25 May 10, the AFPC board determined that the complainant should not
be retained and directed he be discharged with an honorable discharge (SKE #20). When the complainant
was notified of these results, he elected to file the current complaint alleging the PRP decertification was
in reprisal for his filing the original IG complaint (SKE #21).

     The evidence leads us to believe the 502 TRS/CC would have permanently disqualified the
complainant from PRP even if the protected communication had not occurred. The actual catalyst for her
PRP decision was her change of opinion that the complainant should not be separated but reclassified. At
that point, she had to make a decision regarding PRP. If the 502 TRS/CC thought that the complainant
was able to do the nuclear mission, then reclassification would not be necessary as he would be fully
qualified to begin Space and Missile Officer training. However, the evidence su ggests this was not the
case and, despite the complainant‘s assertion that his previous objections were no longer valid, she did not
have full faith and confidence he could do the nuclear mission. At this point, PRP

decertification was required by directive which rendered the complainant ineligible for Space and Missile
Officer training and led to the decision that reclassification was necessary. The 502 TRS/CC
determination of the complainant‘s suitability for Space and Missile Officer duty was consistent before
and after the protected communication. Accordingly, we feel the evidence does not warrant further
inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 regarding this RMO.

501 TRG/CC. On 12 Apr 10, the 501 TRG/CC reviewed and agreed with the decertification action
enacted by the 502 TRS/CC (SKE #17). The 501 TRG/CC had knowledge of PC#1 as the original IG
complaint was referred to her by the 555 TRW/IG and she, in turn, notified the 502 T RS/CC of the
complaint (SKE #15 and #16). The 501 TRG/CC was not named in any assertions of wrongdoing by the
complainant in his original complaint. As such, the likelihood that she had a motive to reprise is low.
Her agreement with the 502 TRS/CC decertification decision is reasonable based on the complainant‘s
actions as stated above. The complainant adamantly expressed concerns about his ability to employ
nuclear weapons until faced with the prospect of separation (SKE #17). When confronted with the
prospect of separation, the complainant had a sudden change of heart and expressed full confidence that
he would be able to employ nuclear weapons and wished to continue training. The 502 TRS/CC noted
the change in attitude and reversed her decision to recommend separation and, instead, fully supported
reclassification and indicted by her recommendation to the IST Board (Atch 5). However, the 502
TRS/CC still did not believe the complainant would be able to employ nuclear weapons without
reservations based on the initial series of contacts they had concerning the subject. Thus, she was unable
to support PRP certification that would allow him to continue in Space and Missile Officer training. In
light of the evidence, her conclusion was reasonable and based in fact. The 501 TRG/CC appears to have
agreed with the 502 TRS/CC decisions as she supported the reclassification effort via endorsement of the
favorable package submitted to the IST Board (Atch 5). Her concurrence with the 502 TRS/CC PRP
decertification decision, based on the evidence, is logical and reasonable and appears to be the result of
her charter to ensure personnel with missile launch responsibility meet the reliability requirements of PRP
and will be able to execute the nuclear launch option if necessary. The evidence supports both the 502
TRS/CC and 501 TRG/CC reservations about the true intentions of the complainant when he reversed his
stance on employment of nuclear weapons. Accordingly, we feel the evidence does not warrant further
inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 regarding this RMO.

RECOMMENDATION:

The evidence does not support the conclusion that the 502 TRS/CC or 501 TRG/CC reprised against the
complainant thru their PRP decertification actions. Rather, the evide nce suggests the PRP decertification
action would have occurred regardless of any protected communications. The need to make a PRP
decision was precipitated by the decision to discontinue NQP processing and refer the
separation/reclassification decision to the newly established AFPC IST Board. This decision was made
prior to the protected communication. Prior to the protected communication, the 502 TRS/CC was going
to recommend the IST Board separate the complainant. After learning of the protected comm unication
and meeting with the complainant, the 502 TRS/CC decided to support reclassification vice separation but
could not, in good faith, support PRP certification. The PRP decertification action is supported by the
available evidence and complainant actions. The 501 TRG/CC review and endorsement of the PRP

decertification action is reasonable and consistent with her nuclear surety responsibilities. The evidence
suggests the PRP decertification decision was not an issue for the complainant until the IST Board
decided he should be separated despite the 502 TRS/CC and 501 TRG/CC support of reclassification.
Lastly, the same rationale that mitigates against reprisal supports our argument that the RMO actions do
not support credible allegations of abuse of authority.

It is our conclusion that no further inquiry or investigation under 10 USC 1034 is warranted and this
complaint should be dismissed pursuant to review and approval by IG DoD MRI.

1q. Did the military me mber make or prepare a communication protected by statute, DoD
Directive, or AFI 90-301 (to an IG; a member of an IG office investigative staff; Member of
Congress or their staff; a member of a DoD audit, inspection, investigation, law
enforcement, equal opportunity, safety, or family advocacy organizations; any person in
their chain of command; Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force; Command Chief Master
Sergeant; Group/Squadron Superintendents/First Sergeant)?
1a. Answer Yes or No. [Providing details including the dates of protected communication; who
the member made the protected communication to; and what the protected communication
concerned.] See Note 1.
2q. Was an unfavorable personnel action taken or threatened; or was a favorable action
withheld or threatened to be withheld following the protected communication?
2a. Answer Yes or No. [Provide an explanation of what was the unfavorable or withheld
favorable personnel action, or threat thereof, taken or withheld. Also detail which officials were
responsible for which particular action.]
3q. Did the official(s) responsible for taking, withholding, threatening or influencing the
personnel action know about the protected communication?
3a. Answer Yes or No. [Briefly state supporting facts, evidence, and testimony. It is important
to state when each official responsible for (or influencing) the adverse action became
knowledgeable. Give specific dates whenever possible. If an exact date is unknown, state "on or
about" what date or time frame. Do not make general statements such as "Everyone knew that
the complainant talked with the IG."] See Note 2.
4q. Does the preponderance of the evidence establish that the personnel action would have
been taken, withheld, or threatened if the protected communication had not been made?
4a. Answer Yes or No. [Be specific and explain logic and rationale. Establish whether there is
a genuine connection between the adverse personnel action and the protected communication.]
*** When answering the fourth question, the following five (5) related questions regarding the
personnel action must be addressed in the analysis as separate subheadings:
   (1) Reasons the RMO took, withheld, threatened or influenced the action;
   (2) Reasonableness of the action taken, withheld, threatened or influenced considering the
   complainant’s performance and conduct;
   (3) Consistency of the actions of RMOs with past practice;
   (4) Motive of the RMO for deciding, taking, withholding or influencing the personnel action;

    (5) Procedural correctness of the action. This will allow the IO to determine explicitly
   whether or not the adverse action was: (a) reprisal (in the case where answers to the first
   three questions are “yes”); or (b) an “abuse of authority” (in the case where the answer to
   either the first or third question is “no”) See Note 3.
Note 1: If the complainant did not make or prepare to make a protected communication, then it
must be determined if the responsible management official(s) suspected, believed, or heard
rumors that there was a protected communication before the allegation can be dismissed as a
reprisal. If there is a question about whether or not a confirmed communication is a ―protected‖
communication, the IO should enter a ―Finding"; even if the IO finds the communication wasn‘t
―protected,‖ he or she should nonetheless proceed with the Acid Test as if it were. In those cases
where complainants allege an action was taken in ―reprisal‖ for a communication not protected
by statute, DoD or Air Force Directive, the investigation is not over. The IO should determine
whether or not the adverse action was otherwise an ―abuse of authority.‖
Note 2: If the official responsible for taking, withholding, threatening, or influencing the
personnel action did not know about the protected communication, then reprisal cannot be
substantiated. However, the IO should nonetheless proceed with the Abuse of Authority Acid
Test to determine whether or not the adverse personnel action was otherwise an ―abuse of
authority.‖
Note 3: If the answer to the first three questions is "yes" and the answer to the fourth question is
"no," then reprisal generally has occurred. As with any investigation, especially those alleging
reprisal, consult your legal office. During an RCA, answering all five sub-questions of question
4 is not required. Consult the appropriate MAJCOM, JFHQ, or NAF IGQ and/or the legal office

                 FORMAT FOR ACID TEST FOR ABUSE OF AUTHORITY

Definition: Abuse of authority is an arbitrary and capricious exercise of power that adversely
affects any person or results in personal gain or advantage to the abuser.
Answer the following questions to determine if abuse of authority has occurred:
1. Did the responsible manage ment official’s (RMO’s) actions either:
  a. Adversely affect any person? (e.g., demotion, referral OPR, extra duty, etc.)
       OR
  b. Result in personal gain or advantage to the RMO? (e.g., promotion, award, etc.)
If questions 1(a) and 1(b) are both answered ―no,‖ then it is not necessary to consider question
two. If either part of question 1(a) or 1(b) is answered ―yes,‖ the IO must answer question two.

2. Was the RMO’s action either:

  a. Outside the authority granted under applicable regulations, law or policy?

       OR

  b. Arbitrary and capricious? You must use the following factors in your
  analysis:

       (1) What were the Reasons the RMO took, withheld, or threatened the action?
       (2) What was the Reasonableness of the action taken, withheld, or threatened
       considering the complainant‘s performance and conduct?
       (3) Were the actions taken by the RMO Consistent?
