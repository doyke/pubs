OPR: AFGOMO (Maj Kenneth J. Huxley)                  Certified by: AFGOMO (Col T. Michael Moseley)
Supersedes AFR 36-93, 28 February 1990.                                                   Pages: 5
                                                                                   Distribution: F)

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-26, Military Force Management, and estab-
lishes policies and procedures for general officer (GO) official photos. It requires GOs and colonels
selected for promotion to the grade of brigadier general (Brig Gen) to submit photos for Air Force use,
and it assigns specific responsibilities. This instruction also applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) and
United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR), including individual mobilization augmentees (IMA).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is the first publication of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2632; the office of primary responsibility
(OPR) has changed to the Air Force General Officer Matters Office (AFGOMO). It substantially revises
Air Force Regulation (AFR) 36-93 and complements AFI 35-302, USAF Fact Sheets and Official Biogra-
phies Guidance and Procedures; and deletes excess information and updates photo program policies and
procedures.

Section A—General Information

1. Use of Official Photographs. All extended active duty (EAD), USAFR, and ANG GOs (and colonels
selected for promotion to Brig Gen) must have an official color photo. The photo is a functional part of
the HQ USAF GO Selection Folder maintained by AFGOMO (for GOs on EAD); HQ USAF/REPS (for
non-EAD USAFR and IMA GOs); and NGB-GO/AF (non-EAD ANG GOs). The photo is also used to
support GO assignment and promotion nominations; respond to public and internal information requests;
and, in the case of EAD and ANG GOs, prepare the individual’s official Air Force biography.

2. When New Photographs Are Required. All EAD, USAFR, and ANG GOs and colonels selected for
promotion must have a color photo taken within 30 calendar days of promotion to the next higher grade.
Officers may elect to have photos taken at other times, as needs dictate (e.g., before promotion selection
boards, nomination for assignment, etc).

3. Distribution of Official Photographs. See Table 1.

4. Responsibilities and Procedures:
    4.1. Individual Officers. See paragraph 2. Contact the servicing base visual information support
    center (BVISC) to schedule a photo appointment within 30 calendar days of the promotion effective
    date. Ensure all photos are properly labeled (see paragraph 4.3.6.) and distributed according to Table
    1. Officers assigned to the Pentagon may have their photo taken at Photographic Services (HQ 11 CS/
    SCUP, Pentagon, Room 1C600, DSN 225-2603). Officers may use commercial photographers if the
    guidelines established by this instruction are met; however, the officer must bear all costs.
    4.2. Office of Public Affairs Resource Library (SAF/PAC). Maintain adequate supply of GO pho-
    tos. Respond to internal, public, and media requests for GO photos.
    4.3. BVISCs. Provide color photographic support to those individuals listed in paragraph 2. of this
    instruction.
       4.3.1. If the officer is wearing a service dress uniform with shoulder rank insignia, use the formal
       head and shoulders pose. Have the officer face the camera directly, with the body turned approx-
       imately 45 degrees to the right (left shoulder forward to the camera).
       4.3.2. If the officer is wearing a service dress uniform with sleeve rank insignia, use the head and
       torso pose with hands folded in front, right over left, resting on a dark support.
       4.3.3. Use a large or medium format camera with the appropriate portrait lens.
       4.3.4. The studio area should be large enough to allow subject placement approximately 6 feet
       from background and hair lights. Also use key and fill lights, and position the camera about eye
       level. Use a solid color backdrop and lighting that gives a neutral gray background. Flags (United
       States and Air Force, or United States and ceremonial) may be included in background (officer’s
       option).
       4.3.5. Use color film with ASA not to exceed 200. Process film and negatives according to the
       manufacturer’s recommendations. Negative retouching is authorized, but don’t retouch the photo.
       Electronic manipulation of the image is not authorized. Take as many exposures as necessary to
       obtain required composition or technical quality.
       4.3.6. Finished photos will be 8- by 10-inches, in color, without a border or frisket. Use a
       self-adhesive label to place officer’s name, SSAN, and date of photo on reverse of finished photo
       and all copies.
       4.3.7. Notify officer when completed photo is ready. If the officer disapproves the photo, give an
       additional sitting as requested.
       4.3.8. Once the officer approves the photo, print adequate copies so the officer can satisfy the
       requirements of Table 1. Provide the officer or designated representative with a high quality copy
       negative to meet future printing requirements. BVISCs will mail the original color negative
       directly to 11 CS/SCUT-A for permanent retention in the Still Media Record Center. BVISCs
       supporting ANG GOs or Brig Gen (Sels) should maintain the color negative for future reprint
       requirements.
    4.4. AFGOMO, HQ USAF/REPS, and NGB-GO/AF. Maintain official photos in the officers’ HQ
    USAF GO Selection Folder and appropriate office files.
