                                             Chapter 1

                      PURPOSE, ASSUMPTIONS, RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. This instruction describes Andersen Air Force Base (AAFB) procedures when
the base responds to an incident involving aircraft that land off station, i.e., a divert situation.
This includes emergency and non-emergency diverts for aircraft assigned or deployed to AAFB,
as well as circumstances where higher headquarters (HHQ) tasks AAFB to respond. The
overarching objective of this INSTRUCTION is to synchronize and focus the efforts of AAFB
resources and highlight the coordination required with units deployed to or using AAFB facilities
to respond in these situations. It is intended to supplement, but not replace, other existing
guidance, e.g. 36 ABWI 21-107, Crashed, Damaged, or Disabled Aircraft Recovery Program.
1.2. Assumptions.
     1.2.1. The 36 WG does not have permanently assigned subject matter experts or resources
     available to fully man and equip an aircraft recovery effort. Other units, e.g., deployed,
     tenant, transient or off-station, will be required to support recovery efforts. Expeditiously
     executing aircraft recovery from neighboring airport facilities requires longstanding
     partnership building with local civilian and military authorities and training with their first
     responders.
     1.2.2. The 36 WG possesses full spectrum emergency response capabilities with these
     possible exceptions:
        1.2.2.1. Robust and diverse Mission Design Series (MDS) expertise and equipment.
        1.2.2.2. Clearly defined central line of accounting/funding responsibilities for recovery
        operations.
        1.2.2.3. Dedicated airlift capability.
        1.2.2.4. MDS-trained first responders at divert locations.
1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. The 36 WG/CC will:
        1.3.1.1. Provide manpower, support and overall direction to recovery efforts.
        1.3.1.2. Determine command and control for the divert situation. Coordinate with HHQ,
        other supporting units and parent unit leadership (of the divert aircraft), as required.
        Assume command and control as applicable through the command post and installation
        control center per AAFBI 10-207, Installation Control Center Procedures and Functions.
        1.3.1.3. Assign an incident commander and/or senior military liaison officer (hereafter
        referred to as the “team leader”) for the divert site, as well as a quick response team.
        1.3.1.4. Ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, that local airport managers are aware of
        the possibility of a divert situation. Develop formal agreements as required. Coordinate
        these efforts with the US Defense Representative to Guam, the Commonwealth of the
        Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the
        Republic of Palau (USDEFREP).

  1.3.2. The 36 MSG/CC will:
     1.3.2.1. Activate the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as required. The EOC will
     serve as the focal point for communications with the team leader per AAFBI 10-207,
     Installation Control Center Procedures and Functions.
     1.3.2.2. Provide direction to the reception working group and deployment control center
     (DCC). DCC will facilitate the expeditious deployment of the quick reaction team and
     remain engaged until all forces return to base. Coordinate all actions through the EOC,
     once activated.
     1.3.2.3. Provide security augmentation and subject matter expertise to the team leader, as
     required.
     1.3.2.4. Provide contracting and procurement support to the team leader.
     1.3.2.5. Provide mission support as required to the quick response team and follow-on
     forces. Examples include:
        1.3.2.5.1. Lodging reservations.
        1.3.2.5.2. Vehicle support.
        1.3.2.5.3. Orders processing.
        1.3.2.5.4. Personnel accountability.
        1.3.2.5.5. Communications (mobile/handheld) support.
        1.3.2.5.6. Casualty assistance/mortuary support.
     1.3.2.6. Ensure airfield personnel at potential divert locations in the local flying area are
     trained in MDS-specific first responder duties, as required.
     1.3.2.7. Ensure formal agreements per para. 1.3.1.4 above address entry of armed
     security forces personnel. Activate these agreements as applicable upon notification of a
     divert situation.
     1.3.2.8. Provide the team leader when tasked by 36 WG/CC. Be prepared to provide a
     Contracting Officer with the quick response team.
  1.3.3. The 36 MXG/CC will:
     1.3.3.1. Provide and prepare personnel to serve on a quick response team, to include an
     officer or SNCO to serve as the lead maintenance representative on scene (and potentially
     the team leader). Team will determine in advance, to the maximum extent possible, the
     aircraft maintenance requirements and respond with required resources.
     1.3.3.2. For transient aircraft where no aircraft-specific maintenance expertise is
     available on AAFB, contact the parent unit to coordinate response and recovery actions,
     when authorized by 36 WG/CC.
     1.3.3.3. Provide EOC maintenance member. In the absence of an EOC, the MOC will
     serve as the focal point for all communication with the lead maintenance representative.
     1.3.3.4. Provide the team leader when tasked by 36 WG/CC.
  1.3.4. The 36 OG/CC will:
