This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD.

This pamphlet series enables application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation –
Part III Mobility, Appendix V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-
402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF,
AFRC, ANG and DOD agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets
contained herein, in accordance with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas). AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 4 deals specifically
with aircraft originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. McDonnell Douglas
Corp. first formed in 1967 after the Douglas Co. (founded 1920) and McDonnell Aircraft Corp.
(originating in 1928) merged. Through the last merger into the Boeing Company in 1997, the
Boeing Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing,
Donald Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of
the date of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet
aircraft alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Addenda. Volume 4 is not separated from each
subsequent addendum, but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction
for each addendum. The same information for Volume 4 essentially gets republished--unchanged
with each Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Quick Reference Tables. All chapter
descriptions for various models are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick
Reference Tables. The information in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated
in the expanded chapters as they are meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum E. Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) MD-90 Series.
The MD-90 Series aircraft are narrow body, single-aisle, twin-engine aircraft, designed for
medium range. This is an advance in the line of aircraft that was originally the DC-9 Series,
which then transitioned to the MD-80 Series. The MD-90 continued with the five-abreast seating
arrangements of its predecessors, but incorporated all of the innovations of the MD-88, as well as
a longer fuselage, newer, more efficient and powerful engines and an advanced flight deck (with
later-built models having a full "glass cockpit"). The MD-90 Series was initially set to continue
on much longer than it actually did, and a second production line actually opened up in
Shanghai, China. However, after the McDonnell Douglas - Boeing merger of 1997, the decision
was made to discontinue the Series, since the B737-800's basically covered the same market
demand. From the initial delivery in February 1995 until the last MD-90 was delivered on
October 2000, 116 MD-90's were manufactured.

The first and only model in the Series, the MD-90-30, was type-certified in November 1994. The
MD-90-30 shares the same fuselage diameter and fuselage aft-mounted engines as the DC-9 and
MD-80 Series, as well as the MD-80's unique, middle lower cargo compartment, in addition to
the forward and aft sections. The MD-90-30's engines and interior were also redesigned to allow
for a more comfortable and quieter ride than the DC-9 or MD-80. An Extended Range version,
the MD-90ER, was also offered, but only one was built.


AMCPAM 24-2, Volume 4, Addendum E will focus primarily on the:

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 4 Addendum.
