and 14. All refuel accounting documents will be collected during the off-station period and
turned into debriefing section (or the ICO) upon re-deployment.
4.7.5. (Added) During "IMDS-CDB down" periods or when IMDS-CDB will not be available
units will use blank printouts of IMDS-CDB debriefing screens or locally devised products to
ensure accurate debriefing information are obtained. Input the collected data into IMDS-CDB at
the earliest opportunity.
4.7.6.2. (Added) For the purpose of recording repeat/recur discrepancies, a corrective action
occurs when parts are removed, replaced, repaired, or when any form of troubleshooting or
adjustment is completed (e.g., cleaning of electrical contacts, resetting of connectors, recycling
power, etc.).
4.7.6.3. (Added) A discrepancy requesting an in-flight operational check of a maintenance
action will not be counted as a repeat or recur if a sortie was flown and the discrepancy
operationally checked was not corrected by the maintenance action. Any subsequent sortie that
the discrepancy returns on will NOT follow repeat/recur guidelines if an in-flight operational
check is requested.
4.7.6.4. (Added) The Debrief checklist will document in-flight refueling boom strike/fuel
overspray information. As a minimum, identify Air Refueling Wing, tanker call sign, tanker tail
number, air refueling track, air refueling time (Zulu) and refueling track events.”

changes, engine TCTOs, and engine equipment.
6.2.6.16.5.4. (Added) The MOC is responsible for overall management and control of the
location subsystem and aircraft status reporting (IMDS-CDB and REMIS corrections).
6.2.6.16.5.10. (Added) The Programs and Resources Flight is responsible for overall
management and control of the personnel management subsystem. This includes loading,
deleting, and updating of maintenance personnel records in IMDS.
6.2.6.16.5.11. (Added) The MSL (if applicable) is the liaison between the IMDS-CDB host
database manager and the Enterprise Supply-Solutions (ES-S), formerly known as the Standard
Base Supply System or SBSS. MSL will assist users to resolve ES-S transactions issues (e.g.,
supply rejects) for correction and work with the host Supply and/or IMDS host database manager
to initiate a DIREP in case of a program problem.
6.2.6.16.6. (Added) The DIT will include at least one representative from each work center that
repairs aircraft. It will also include participation from PS&D, MOC, EM, debrief, and QA.
Section chiefs of the appropriate work center will appoint in writing primary and alternate
section DIT monitors. DIT monitors will be at least 5-levels and familiar with the unit’s
assigned weapon systems. DIT will hold monthly meetings. A senior Maintenance leader (no
lower than the MOS/CC or as designated by the MXG/CC) will chair the DIT meeting. Analysis
will publish meeting minutes and send to squadron leaders (AMXS, MXS, MOS, etc.) and all
work centers. As a minimum, meeting minutes will include: new agenda, old agenda, attendees,
and non-attendees.
6.2.6.16.6.3.1. (Added) Workcenter DIT monitors will comply with this paragraph guidance.

and QA’s IMDS vs. 781 forms review when computing DIT error rates.
6.2.6.17.1.1. (Added) Analytical Studies. MMA will provide results of investigations, analyses,
or studies to work centers. The most effective study is one that goes beyond superficial
conclusions. It helps solve a problem relative to mission performance. Specific studies are
provided to the requester, and a file copy is retained for future reference. Disseminate the study
by electronic means or include it in a monthly maintenance summary.
6.2.6.17.1.1.1. (Added) The study should state assumptions up front, and should be summarized
to state how the significance is measured.
6.2.6.17.1.1.2. (Added) Although not the only format, most studies will begin with background
information. The study should include the data, research, investigation, and statistical findings,
along with their respective sources. Conclusions relevant to the study should be drawn from the
data, research, investigation, and statistical findings. The study should include recommendations
to address the conclusions relevant to address the conclusions relevant to the problem (other
issues uncovered can be identified, but should be kept separate).
6.2.6.17.2.1. (Added) Deficiency analysts will be a 5- or 7- level and should have at least 6
months experience on the weapon system. At least one of the deficiency analysts assigned will
be a SSgt with the following skills: aircraft maintenance, off-equipment avionics, flightline
avionics, or engines. Other skills may be included to effectively analyze specific functions of an
aircraft weapon system. Ensure candidates have sufficient writing and math skills to perform the
job. Deficiency analysts will be rotated with a maintenance section or flightline within 24
months to maintain AFSC proficiency. Deficiency analysts serve a dual role; they provide
analytical support to the squadrons and maintenance managers, and also provide technical
expertise for the MMA section. They use analytical data and their technical knowledge to
identify problems, work with the customer, and help find solutions. They should not limit
themselves to pointing out general areas for investigation; they should identify deficiencies
applicable to a work center, particular equipment end item, and maintenance practice or
management action. Deficiency analysts will:
6.2.6.17.2.1.1. (Added) Review QA summaries for positive and negative trends.
6.2.6.17.2.1.2. (Added) Review debriefing data and abort information daily to assist in the

6.2.6.17.2.1.7. (Added) Deficiency analysts will not be utilized as a full time DIT monitor.
6.2.6.17.3. (Added) Dedicated AMU Analysis (where applicable). The AMU analysis function
is intended to provide dedicated analytical support for the AMU.
6.2.6.17.3.1. (Added) The MMA section NCOIC may dedicate an analyst to each AMU.
Accomplishing AMU analysis tasks are the dedicated analyst’s primary responsibility. The
MMA section NCOIC is responsible for the overall effectiveness of the AMU analysis program.
To improve the overall effectiveness of the dedicated analyst program, analysts should be rotated
approximately every 12 months. When the analyst is not located in the AMU, they will still
spend time in the AMU daily. As a minimum, the AMU analyst will:
6.2.6.17.3.1.1. (Added) Review maintenance debriefing data to track in-flight discrepancies and
deviations on each aircraft. Review aircraft status inputs from the MOC for WUC accuracy.
Closely monitor fix time on Code 3 breaks and report results to AMU supervision daily. Brief
problem aircraft and systems to AMU supervision daily.
6.2.6.17.3.1.2. (Added) Review Debriefing Sortie Recap (TRIC DRC, summary and detailed
report) for all scheduled flyers and spares from the previous day. Compare sortie recaps to
Summarized/Detailed Status for an Equipment-ID (TRIC EST, options 3 or 5), Code-3 Fix Time
Report (TRIC FTR), and Maintenance Snapshot Inquiry (TRIC QMS) to validate code-3 breaks.
Ensure subsystem on DRC and FTR matches the WUC on EST and QMS. Also ensure EST has
WUC out to the 5th position to the greatest extent possible. Work with MOC and debrief
sections to correct mismatches daily.
6.2.6.17.3.1.2.1. (Added) Ensure all “NONE FOUND” entries on FTR are investigated and
corrected, paying special attention to landing time on DRC vs grounding times on EST option 3
or 5.
6.2.6.17.3.1.3. (Added) Compare QMS to detailed DRC for all pilot reported discrepancies
(PRDs). Ensure WUC subsystem matches on both products, and is applicable for the
discrepancy recorded.
AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            19


6.2.6.17.3.1.4. (Added) Ensure all deviations on detailed DRC are properly documented by
comparing DRC and AUR. To the greatest extent possible, ensure all maintenance deviations
have an associated event ID. Contact MOC or debrief sections, as applicable, for corrections
daily.
6.2.6.17.3.1.5. (Added) Ensure all uncompleted flight data on the Accomplishment Utilization
Report (TRIC AUR) or TRIC UOL is reviewed daily.
6.2.6.17.3.1.6. (Added) Ensure all repeat/recurs (using TRIC PRD and QRE) are validated and
investigated for short term (less than 90 days) and long term trends.
6.2.6.17.3.1.7. (Added) Process EST (option 3 or 5) and ensure all possession changes (to
BQ/BT/BU etc) have an approved depot assistance request.

monthly as required by the MXG/CC.
6.2.6.17.3.3. (Added) Provide analyses as requested by AMU supervision or when identified
through review of AMU performance data.
6.2.6.17.3.4. (Added) Validate CANN documentation in IMDS-CDB at least weekly, with AMU
supply and inform AMU supervision of its accuracy. If errors exist, a more frequent validation
may be required. Advise AMU supervision of recurring problems.
6.2.6.17.3.5. (Added) Monitor the UTE rate for the AMU.
6.2.6.17.3.6. (Added) Analyze programmed and actual attrition factors.
6.2.6.17.3.7. (Added) Attend AMU scheduling/production meetings.
6.2.6.18. (Added) Management Contributions to the Analytical Process: Maintenance managers
have a significant impact on the usefulness of the MMA to the unit. Managers should constantly
review how information is being organized and presented. The lack of focus regarding use of
data, improper arrangement of data for analysis, or unclear presentations of results can obscure
meaningful information. Managers should be familiar with how data is developed, interpreted,
and presented to ensure accurate presentations of results for decision making. Special studies
and analyses specifically targeted for areas of concerns to managers are valuable tools in helping
units isolate factors surrounding problem areas.
6.2.6.19. (Added) Maintenance Performance Studies. Primary concerns of maintenance
managers are how well the unit is meeting mission requirements, how to improve equipment
performance, identifying emerging support problems, and projecting trends. Maintenance
performance is compared with standards, goals, and maintenance plans. The performance rates
computed by analysis are data sources for making comparisons. When the operational
requirements are not achieved, MMA will perform an investigation to determine the cause. As a
minimum the following areas will be considered:
6.2.6.19.1. (Added) Are operational requirements realistically based on availability of
equipment?
6.2.6.19.2. (Added) What are the causes for flying schedule deviations (cancellations, aborts,
additions or early/ late takeoffs)?
 20                                             AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012


6.2.6.19.3. (Added) Are specific aircraft, equipment, systems, or subsystems contributing to a
disproportionate share of deviations/turbulence?
6.2.6.19.4. (Added) Is specific equipment failing to perform as scheduled? Does this equipment
require more or less maintenance than others?
6.2.6.19.5. (Added) Are there enough people to meet mission needs? Are certain work centers
documenting significant overtime or show consistently high utilization rates?
6.2.6.19.6. (Added) Is there an appropriate balance of skills within AFSCs and between the
units?
6.2.6.19.7. (Added) Do higher rates for repeat/recur discrepancies indicate training/experience
shortfalls?
6.2.6.19.8. (Added) Is there sufficient time to schedule and work maintenance problems?
6.2.6.19.9. (Added) Are trends significant? Are the trends short term (6 months or less) or long-
term? Where will the unit likely be in 6-12 months?
6.2.6.19.10. (Added) Are there seasonal or cyclical variations? Are current variations outliers?
6.2.6.20. (Added) Equipment/Mission Analysis: When adverse trends are identified, further
investigation may be necessary to gather facts. QA, unit managers, and work center technicians
should be contacted for assistance in performing these investigations. Consolidate the results in
the form of briefings or interim reports, depending upon the seriousness of the trend. The
product of these reports should be viewed as indications of the unit’s success in keeping
equipment mission ready. Consider the following questions when reviewing negative trends:
6.2.6.20.1. (Added) Which systems are creating a high NMC rate? Are these the normally high
systems? If so, are they higher than normal? What are the high driving components, and what is
being done (or could be done) to address the problems? What factors are causing an increase or
decrease in the NMC hours? Are the unit's deployments affecting the rate, if so to what extent?
6.2.6.20.2. (Added) Are specific aircraft or equipment causing trend distortions?
6.2.6.20.3. (Added) What systems have high CND, repeat or recur malfunctions?
6.2.6.20.4. (Added) What parts or components cause NMCS conditions? Are these normal, or is
a new problem emerging?
6.2.6.20.5. (Added) Are the items repaired on station? Are they 2LM components? Could they
be repaired locally?
6.2.6.20.6. (Added) Is supply support sufficient and responsive? If not, why not? Are stocks
adequate?
6.2.6.20.7. (Added) Is the lack of training, technical data, or tools and equipment affecting
certain systems or AFSCs?
6.2.6.21. (Added) Analytical Process: The analytical process consists of identifying contributory
factors, manipulating raw data into meaningful formats, computing management indicators,
performing statistical measurements, and creating accurate, complete, and easy to understand
presentations. An analytical process uses a number of methods, (e.g., visual observation that is
dependent upon the experience and knowledge of the observer; comparative analysis that may be
AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 21


performed statistically or visually and involves the comparison of two or more like operations or
items to identify variations or differences, and statistical analysis or statistical investigation that
is the methodical study of data). These methods are used to reveal facts, relationships, and
differences about data and data elements and are a useful adjunct to comparative and visual
analysis. Analysts should use these tools and other methods to perform analytical studies to gain
insight into unit performance and to enhance process improvement.
6.2.6.22. (Added) Analytical Studies: MMA will provide results of investigations, analyses, or
studies to work centers. The most effective study is one that goes beyond superficial
conclusions. It helps solve a problem relative to mission performance. Specific studies are
provided to the requester, and a file copy is retained for future reference. Disseminate the study
by electronic means or include it in a monthly maintenance summary.
6.2.6.22.1. (Added) The study should state assumptions up front, and should be summarized to
state how the significance is measured.
6.2.6.22.2. (Added) Although not the only format, most studies will begin with background
information. The study should include the data, research, investigation, and statistical findings,
along with their respective sources. Conclusions relevant to the study should be drawn from the
data, research, investigation, and statistical findings. The study should include recommendations
to address the conclusions relevant to address the conclusions relevant to the problem (other
issues uncovered can be identified, but should be kept separate).
6.2.6.23. (Added) Maintenance Analysis Referrals: A referral is a procedure used to identify,
investigate, and propose corrective action for management problems. These are highly effective
tools to make agencies aware of common problems. Referral reports are used to start the referral
procedure and document the corrective actions for implementation and future reference. Due to
the amount of investigation and research needed to properly process referrals, ensure they are not
used for problems that can be resolved more efficiently through verbal or less formal
communications. Referrals are not determined by a quota system. They are used only when
necessary to affect a permanent solution to a problem that cannot be solved by other means.
Referral reports must be concise, accurate, and timely to provide maintenance managers with
information for making decisions. Anyone can initiate a referral, but MMA is the OPR and
assigns a referral number and maintains a log of all referrals. The log should reflect the referral
number, initiating agency, date, subject, and action taken. QA will work with unit managers and
work center technicians to perform investigations and recommend corrective actions. Route
through the affected agencies for comments, with the final addressee as the MMA section.
Retain copies and indicate whether additional monitoring or follow-up action is necessary.
Provide a completed study to each MXG QA.
6.2.8. (Added) Software Analysis Section (B-2 units). The software analysis section processes
and analyzes B-2 OBTS or OGP data, as applicable, in order to provide timely and accurate
information to aid the maintenance effort, identify software discrepancies to the appropriate
OPRs, and identify trends to maintenance supervisors and assigned engineers. B-2 units address
all hardware and software deficiencies/anomalies associated with aircraft diagnostics using the
OBTS, and the OGP. A team of maintenance technicians compares data extracted from the
OGP, and the OBTS paper tape to ensure accuracy and validity of the data in support of airframe
availability. This section works closely with maintenance analysis functions in order to identify
trends in system performance.
 22                                            AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012


6.2.8.1. (Added) Demonstrated knowledge and ability should be of primary importance in
assigning personnel to this section; however, each flightline avionics AFSC should be
represented. All assigned personnel should have performed in their AFSC within the last 3
years.
6.2.8.2. (Added) As a minimum, the responsibilities of this section are to:
6.2.8.2.1. (Added) Analyze and establish the accurate status of all reported Reference
Designator Indicators.
6.2.8.2.2. (Added) Identify to appropriate maintenance supervisors (and engineers, if assigned to
the unit), adverse system/maintenance trends.
6.2.8.2.3. (Added) Identify/Report OBTS/OGP software deficiencies via Software System
Trouble Report (SSTR) program through OGP Lab at Tinker AFB, OK.
6.2.8.2.4. (Added) Assist maintenance technicians in identifying and reporting Ground
Readiness Test deficiencies.
6.2.8.2.5. (Added) Provide OBTS/OGP information products, as required, to support the
production effort.
6.2.8.2.6. (Added) Assist/train maintenance technicians to use OGP maintenance reports in
troubleshooting malfunctions.
6.2.8.2.7. (Added) Maintain historical data for each assigned aircraft in accordance with the
RDS.
6.2.8.2.8. (Added) Analyze data-dependent maintenance codes to determine whether
maintenance action is required. Generate, retrieve, and analyze the debrief report from the OGP
in support of each sortie debrief. Provide Debrief section a list of OBTS reported aircraft
malfunctions/faults to be entered into IMDS/AFTO FORM 781A.
6.3. (Added) Maintenance Training Flight (MTF). To provide a standard yet flexible (fit
squadron unique mission) maintenance training program, Unit Training Manager (UTMs) should
be physically located (work) in the units they support to ensure they understand that unit’s
mission and training requirements. Maintenance Training Flight (MTFs) will appoint, in writing,
each UTM to one or more units, as manning dictates, to manage unit commanders’ training
programs.
6.3.5. (Added) All AFSC and CDC waiver packages will be coordinated through the MTF for
concurrence/recommendation before processing to Base Training Office for processing.
7.1. (Added) General/Standardize Core Scheduling Practices . PS&D will supplement this
chapter to ensure standardization of key processes and effective program management. PS&D
will provide functional guidance to AGE/Armament/Munitions sections. PS&D will SAV
scheduling processes with the affected Flight Chief and with outgoing/inbound personnel
responsible for executing scheduling duties. Additionally, PS&D will perform a SAV annually
to ensure scheduling & documentation processes are properly executed. PS&D is overall
responsible for notifying the MXG/CC of fleet availability and management issues that may
jeopardize mission success. As a minimum, current paper copies or electronic versions of
technical orders 00-5-15, 00-20-1, 00-20-2 00-20-9, 00-25-4, 00-25-107, applicable -6, and
11/14 series will be available in PS&D.
AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             23


7.1.1. (Added) Units will automate new AFTO FORM 95s and maintain them in the MIS. This
approach eliminates duplication and provides a single source repository. If current AFTO
FORM 95 documents are partially automated, then complete automation is highly encouraged.
When the AFTO Forms are completely automated and reconciled for 100% accuracy, destroy the
duplicate hard copies. Units that choose to maintain previously documented history on the
original hard copies, then document the hard copy with an entry that states, “History as of this
date is automated and maintained in the MIS.”                      Also, the first entry of the
continuation/automated AFTO IMT 95 will be documented with an informational entry,
“Previous history as of this date is maintained in the aircraft jacket file or decentralized file.”
7.1.3. (Added) Notify item manager when items are received and the AFTO IMT 95 is missing
for proper disposition instructions.
7.1.6. (Added) Units will use Maintenance Scheduling Application Tool (MSAT) or future HAF
standardized Aircraft Maintenance Scheduling Mission Support Application to facilitate the
management of MIS data for SI, TCI, and TCTO processes.
7.1.12. (Added) In conjunction with MDSA, MOF PS&D will develop manual JCN block
assignment and procedures IAW Para 6.2.6.16.4.4.8.2. IMDS-CDB uses year-event-identifiers
instead of JCNs, and uses an automatic JCN assignment feature. The procedures need to be
established only for manual input of JCNs during IMDS-CDB downtime and deployment
processing.
7.2.1.2. (Added) Aircraft Document Review (ADR) will be accomplished every 30 calendar
days. If the aircraft has been away from home station and the last documents review exceeds 30
calendar days, review the documents within 3 duty days after return. A document review will be
performed on aircraft prior to assuming alert/IR. For aircraft on alert/IR, document reviews may
be done at the alert/IR facility.
7.2.1.3.2. (Added) The DCC or alternate will transcribe forms IAW TO 00-20-1 and print a new
set of automated Aircraft AFTO FORM 781-series prior to starting the ADR process. ADR
procedures will assign responsibilities to ensure discrepancies with a scheduled start date and
time greater than 5 calendar days after the date of discovery are deferred, all TCTOs are entered
on the AFTO FORM 781K IAW TO 00-20-1, aircraft hours and engine times match data in
IMDS-CDB, modular engine flying hours and manual cycles are verified with EM section, and
entries on the front of the AFTO FORM 781K are made IAW TO 00-20-1.
7.2.1.3.3. (Added) PS&D is not required to review the Aircraft AFTO FORM/IMT 781-series
during the 30 calendar day ADR process. However, assistance will be provided to the DCC or
Alternate if discrepancies are noted in which they cannot resolve. PS&D will continue to review
automated AFTO FORM/IMT 781-series forms during pre/post dock inspections, PDM input
and prior to aircraft deployments.
7.2.1.3.5. (Added) Aircraft Section (DCC or Alternate), Section NCOIC and Flight Chiefs will
reconcile the on-line Automated Records Check (ARC) with aircraft AFTO FORM/IMT 781-
series to ensure the forms and MIS match. DCC will take the necessary actions to correct
discrepancies, sign off the ADR JCN in the MIS and forward to PS&D for filing. Replace the
old ADR with the most current ADR.
7.2.2. (Added) Pre- and post-dock meetings waivers must be justified and submitted to
AFGSC/A4M Plans and Scheduling functional manager for notification.

alternate DCC, production superintendent; EM and PS&D Armament and Egress will attend as
required.
7.2.2.1.7. (Added) Out-of-configuration Inspection/Time Change/TCTO items with established
life limits will be resolved prior to post-docking the aircraft. Unresolved issues will be brought
to AMXS/MXS/MOS supervision immediately and resolved prior clearing the inspection
suspense validation.
7.2.2.2. (Added) Unresolved aircraft configuration management issues that arise at the pre-dock
meeting will be presented to Squadron Superintendent for final resolution.
7.2.3. (Added) Unresolved Aircraft Configuration Management issues at the post-dock will be
briefed to Squadron Superintendents for proper resolution.
7.2.4. (Added) PS&D will notify the MXG/CC of ACM, TCI and safety of flight issues that
require immediate resolution.
7.2.4.5. (Added) Tracked items that have an established life limit will be highlighted to the
MXG/CD if the issue cannot be resolved immediately for necessary actions.
7.2.4.6. (Added) Establish data cleansing procedures to ensure uninstalled time change items
with associated JSTs are deleted from the database on a quarterly basis. Coordinate with DBM
for assistance with auto-cleansing via use of a QLP.
7.2.5.1. (Added) MIS possession purpose code changes are not authorized for technical data
clarification via -107 requests.
7.2.6.1. (Added) The wing life support function will manage Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
items not tracked as installed on-equipment.
7.2.6.1.2. (Added) PS&D will email applicable Modification Manager or Production
Management Specialist the IMDS TCTO Data Code Inquiry (TRIC TCI) for each applicable
TCTO 150 calendar days prior to rescission date.
7.2.6.2.2. (Added) PS&D monitors completion of commodity TCTOs and coordinates with
performing work centers to ensure compliance within specified time limits. PS&D establishes
schedules for completion of installed commodity TCTOs with companion aircraft TCTOs.
PS&D schedules aircraft TCTOs. The EM section schedules non-installed engine-related
TCTOs and coordinates with PS&D on installed engine related TCTOs. The munitions squadron
PS&D will manage TCTOs for all air-launched surface attack guided missiles and associated
support equipment, munitions, nuclear ordnance commodity management items, guidance kits,
air intercept/aerial guided missiles and air intercept/aerial rockets.
7.2.6.2.2.3. (Added) TCTO monitors will request a REMIS Master TCTO Record from the
TCTO POC identified in the published TCTO and reconcile it with IMDS prior to deleting Data
Codes from IMDS. If discrepancies are noted, forward a copy of the MIS product to the TCTO
POC to update REMIS. When IMDS and REMIS match, delete from IMDS.
7.2.6.2.2.4. (Added) If TCTOs are loaded in IMDS manually; the TCTO monitor will contact
the TCTO POC and request a REMIS Master TCTO Record. This record will be used to
reconcile all data elements between IMDS and REMIS in order to eliminate system interface
errors during TCTO resync reporting to REMIS.
AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               25


7.2.6.2.2.5. (Added) Refer to AFGSCI 23-251, Combat Oriented Supply Organization Policy,
for specific procedures to order TCTO Kits.
7.2.6.2.2.6. (Added) MOF PS&D will ensure equitable distribution of TCTO kits to AMUs.
Notify the dedicated AMU scheduling representative with the number of kits available and verify
TCTO status changes in IMDS-CDB.
7.2.6.2.2.7. (Added) Armament, AGE, Munitions and Engine Management (EM) TCTO
monitors will keep MOF PS&D informed of problems. MOF PS&D will assist when necessary.
7.2.6.2.2.13. (Added) Annotations to the original MIS product and/or separate tracking sheet
used to monitor TCTO status is sufficient. Repetitive printing/filing Screen #525 in the TCTO
folder is not required. Upon completion of TCTO, run a part number listing to ensure no
additional parts applicable to the TCTO were gained or loaded into the MIS. Print a new MIS
product and file in TCTO folder.
7.2.6.2.3.7. (Added) Provide IMT FORM 82, Certificate-Proofing TCTOs/Kits to the TCTO
monitor for filing in the TCTO folder.
7.2.7.1.2. (Added) Track and monitor both DOM and DOI JSTs for accuracy. However, use
only the DOM when the two frequencies match
7.2.7.1.3. (Added) For (AFE) items, only items installed in the aircraft and listed in TO 00-20-9
(except for batteries) will be tracked/scheduled in MIS (i.e., parachute components and the
survival kit cutter cord are loaded in MIS). If AFE is installed on aircraft and is considered an
end item (i.e., back style parachutes, survival kit, multi-place raft kits, quick don masks, life
preservers, and anti-exposure suits), the item will be loaded against the aircraft in MIS. If the
item is a component of a larger item, only the larger item is loaded in MIS, not the components
(i.e., life rafts installed inside survival kits which are loaded, will not be loaded independently).
Load the earliest due date of the larger item or installed sub-component, as the due date in MIS.
7.2.7.6. (Added) TCIs are considered due for replacement at the HPO and Phase inspection
nearest to the replacement date without exceeding authorized over-fly limits in applicable
technical orders.
7.2.7.6.1. (Added) Careful consideration must be given when ordering CAD/PAD items 6 to 9
months early e.g., if a cluster of TCIs that are due at the 9th month mark and additional TCIs are
due on the 10th or 11th month, the aircraft will be scheduled for additional major maintenance
closer to the time change items that are due in the 9th month period. Therefore, it may be more
cost effective not to schedule TCIs too early. Instead, consider the most effective grouping of
TCIs. This concept balances the 9 month rule with cost effectiveness. However, aircraft
availability for deployments and contingency operations is the determining factor in deciding to
group TCIs into a single down period.
7.2.7.6.3. (Added) The using organization submits time-change issue requests to the Munitions
Accountable System Officer (MASO) between 45 and 60 calendar days before the next calendar
year quarter (see AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non Nuclear Munitions).
7.2.7.8. (Added) Ensure the part number, serial number, position, reference designator, and lot
number (as applicable) are loaded. For Calendar TCIs check the Date of Manufacture (DOM),
Date of Installation (DOI), frequency and due dates to ensure they are accurate. For hourly, start,
 26                                           AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012


or cycle tracked TCIs, verify the DOI, and the sum of previous operating time/starts/cycles plus
current operating time/starts/cycles equals the frequency due time.
7.2.7.11. (Added) Agencies requesting changes or updates to the need-date of any cartridge
actuated device/propellant actuated device (CAD/PAD) item must coordinate with PS&D and
MASO in sufficient time to preclude emergency issue requests. Refer to AFI 21-201 for
emergency issue and contingency issue requests.
7.2.7.12. (Added) PS&D will submit an updated quarterly forecast when the need date for parts
are outside of the calendar quarter which the parts were forecasted for on the annual forecast.
PS&D then forwards it with the adjusted totals to munitions operations for ordering of the
additional assets.
7.2.8.1. (Added) Coordinate updates or any new generation plans with Eighth Air Force Task
Force 204 (8AF/TF 204) for evaluation. 8AF/TF 204 will forward its recommendation(s) to
AFGSC/ other appropriate agencies for review/approval. Reference AFGSCI 10-450, Nuclear
Committed Bombers General Planning Summary, for more guidance.
7.2.8.5. (Added) Unit generation flow plans will be evaluated annually. The AMUs, MOC, QA,
Wing Weapons Manager (WWM), MOS for contracted UH-1N maintenance, and PS&D for
effective use of resources. PS&D will notify Wing Plans when Generation Flow Plans require
modification. See Para 7.2.8.1 of this supplement.
7.2.9. (Added) Refer to AFI 21-103 for additional information on “temporary loans.”
7.2.9.5.1. (Added) Special IMDS procedures are required to minimize loss of data associated
with aircraft transfer/data migration. The TBE process is used for unit-to-unit transfers, 3WO
process is used for PDM-to-unit transfers and unique IMDS procedures are required when PDM
visits result in a MDS/SRD change (e.g., B-2A to B-2B). Contact IMDS DBM for support.
7.2.11.1. (Added) The DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, will be filed to cross reference AFTO
IMT 95s historical data that is maintained in IMDS.
7.2.11.1.1. (Added) Automated history is the primary method for maintaining individual
historical documents. Aircraft and component MIS history will be saved to file/disk and placed
into the jacket file only for permanent equipment transfer or when requested (e.g.,
accident/safety investigation board). Ensure history files are not corrupt prior to placing them
into the jacket file. Maintain a back-up file until the gaining unit confirms receipt. Ensure
AFTO IMT 95s are printed and shipped with item for overhaul.
7.2.11.1.3. (Added) Annual inspections are required for hard copy/manually maintained items.
Automated AFTO IMT 95 items will be reconciled to ensure all required items are tracked and
loaded with a historical header using IMDS screen 390. QLP programs developed by data base
managers are recommended to identify missing 95 tracked items and/or missing AHE header
record.
7.2.11.1.4. (Added) The last seven sets of forms are defined as the last seven sets of like kind
(i.e. seven AFTO FORMs 781A, 781H, 781J, and 781K).
7.3. (Added) Operations and Maintenance Planning Cycle. Refer to AFGSCSUP11-102,

7.5.3. (Added) OSS current Operations Flight presents the AMXS and OS coordinated annual
plans to the OSS, MXS, MOS, MXG and OG CCs for coordination prior to final approval from
the wing commander. Approved plans are forwarded to AFGSC/A4M and serve as the annual
flying hour program contract.
7.6. (Added) Quarterly Planning . Refer to AFGSCI 21-165.
7.7. (Added) Monthly Planning . Refer to AFGSCI 21-165.
7.8. (Added) Weekly Scheduling . Refer to AFGSCI 21-165.
7.8.3. (Added) AMU PS&D will deconflict the flying and maintenance pages with the AF IMT
2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule/AF IMT 2401, Equipment
Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, to ensure they match prior to submission to MOF PS&D.
The published AF IMT 2402/2401 should reflect the unit’s planned action for each aircraft each
flying day. Maintain AF IMTs in accordance with the RDS.
7.8.3.9. (Added) Refer to AFGSCI 21-165.
7.10.3. (Added) PS&D will coordinate with the applicable AFGSC/A4V weapon system team
aircraft manager when developing PDM schedule/listing.
7.10.7. (Added) Schedulers will monitor Dash 6 and associated technical orders to ensure time
change/inspection frequencies align and support the maintenance concept of the weapon system.
Scheduled maintenance requirements that do not align with the established maintenance concept
and affect aircraft availability will be identified and forwarded to the Product Improvement
Working Group (PIWG) for consideration and/or resolution.                Aligning maintenance
requirements will eliminate additional downtime and increase aircraft availability.
7.10.7.1. (Added) Load JSTs for all aircraft and engine -6 special inspections with frequencies
greater than or equal to 30 calendar days or 50 hours. Units have the option to load JSTs with
frequencies less than 30 calendar days/50 hours.
7.10.7.3. (Added) Maintain the TCI and SI matrix using MSAT.
7.10.7.4. (Added) Units will use MSAT during quarterly reviews and ensure accurate data in the
MIS.
7.10.14. (Added) Use AFGSCI 21-165 for computing MSE.
7.11.1. (Added) (MINOT AFB only) Provide functional manager support to 91 MW.
7.11.2. (Added) (MINOT AFB only) 91 MW maintenance management scheduling personnel
will serve a minimum of 18 months for continuity; they then become subject to AFI 21-101
rotation guidance.
7.11.3.1. (Added) Ensure 2R1X1 personnel performing scheduling functions in sections where
2R1X1 personnel are not assigned (i.e. armament, AGE) either permanently or temporarily are
trained in day-to-day scheduling tasks. Ensure a AF IMT 797 equivalent is developed for each
required area, and ensure training is provided. The unit 2R functional will establish training
procedures and ensure coordination is accomplished with the respective workcenter section
chief.
7.11.3.1.1. (Added) Units may develop a familiarization training outline that correlates weapon
system knowledge with PS&D duties. Coordinate with maintenance supervision, production
 28                                           AFI21-101_AFGSCSUP 28 FEBRUARY 2012


superintendant or MTF personnel to provide familiarization training that achieves outlined
objectives.
7.11.3.3. (Added) No less than two assigned maintenance schedulers will have access to the
REMIS MIS. Ensure host wing PS&D provides REMIS coverage for each decentralized
scheduling office (e.g., TFI, AGE, etc.). Airmen with PCS orders or within 6 months of DOS do
not count towards unit’s requirement due to the long turn time to get REMIS access. AVDO and
TCTO monitors will use REMIS, in addition to IMDS, to manage their programs.
8.1. (Added) General. In those units where contractor personnel, regardless of type of contract,
perform maintenance functions, every effort should be made to co-locate all aircraft maintenance
government Contracting Officer Representative (CORs) with the MXG QA. In small efforts,
where the COR function is performed as an additional duty, the COR will be appointed as an
augmentee and may remain with the assigned unit.
8.1.1. (Added) CORs, or personnel who oversee CORs, such as QA superintendent, Chief
Inspectors must be trained, managed and evaluated IAW Chapter 18.
8.1.2. (Added) For munitions units not aligned under a maintenance group or geographically
separated from parent group, the QA munitions inspectors may be directly responsible to the
assigned squadron commander. This will be documented by a delegation letter from the group
commander.
8.2. (Added) QA authorizations are based on tasks described in the Air Force Manpower
Standard . The MXG/CC has the option of centralizing, certain programs i.e. Exercise
Evaluation Team membership, Self Inspection, COR etc. However, while centralized control of
these programs is desirable and often necessary, management of excessive programs diminishes
QA's ability to administer functions required by this chapter. Commanders should consider
augmenting UMD-authorized QA personnel to fulfill obligations of locally imposed programs.
Additional QA authorizations must be funded utilizing existing manpower resources.
8.2.1.7. (Added) Deficiency Assessment.
8.2.2. (Added) Use MIS or AFGSC form 122 or locally developed form which captures all
required AFGSC form 122 data.
8.2.10. (Added) Ensure in-depth QA involvement regarding aircraft in Hangar Queen status.
8.2.10.1. (Added) Perform a final review of all AFTO FORM/IMT 781-series initiated since the
last flight prior to the first flight.

8.10.8.8.46. (Added) Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) identified for use in nuclear
operations on unit NCE list.
8.10.9. (Added) Personnel Evaluations will be tracked separately on Evaluation and Inspection
Plan. There is no minimum standard for number of personnel evaluations to perform quarterly.
Personnel evaluation numbers will include evaluations outlined in paragraph 8.10.14. Personnel
Evaluations will be separated into RIL categories for trending.
8.10.9.4. (Added) Review and update at least quarterly. All updates/changes must be approved
by the MXG/CC.
8.10.10.2.1. (Added) Zonal observation items are CAT II.
8.10.10.2.2. (Added) QA reviews CAT II major discrepancies quarterly to determine if

card or checklist.
8.10.14. (Added) Ensure a Personnel Evaluation (PE) is accomplished annually on all
technicians that perform maintenance to include MTF instructors who sign off tasks. The PE
must be accomplished prior to the end of the 12th month from the time the individual received
their last PE. Do not reset date upon PCS. If a new individual arrives from a base that didn’t
track PEs accomplish PE within 6 months of arrival and every 12 months after that.
8.10.14.1.2. (Added) Errors committed by the team member(s) and not detected by the team
chief will also be attributed to the team chief. Team evaluations are rated the same as PEs.
8.10.14.1.4. (Added) Graduate Assessment. Inspectors, working in conjunction with MTF,
perform an established number of PEs on MTF graduates to provide feedback to MTF on the

AFGSC/A4MX concurrence. AFGCS/A4MX in conjunction will MXG QAs will perform
annual common AQL reviews. Any changes, deletions or suggestions will be sent to
AFGSC/A4MX for approval.
8.10.18.2. (Added) When establishing the AQL/baseline consider at least 6 months of data.
8.10.20. (Added) AMU Supervision will also attend. The agenda should also include reviewing
the KTL/RIL, AQL/baselines, QVI, PE, DSV/TDV/UCR, SI review, and trend analysis. Include
an “honor roll” of individuals consistently earning excellent ratings. The WG/CC will receive
the quarterly briefing electronically.
8.11. (Added) Units may use QA2000, QA2006, or any other database that captures all
mandatory requirements.
8.11.7. (Added) The Assessment Sub-Category may be adjusted to each different airframe, but
the main categories will remain the same throughout the command. Those categories are:

10.4.2. (Added) When TAS (or equivalent AFGSC-approved database) is not available or with
MXG/CC approval during temporary conditions such as local generation exercises use the
AFGSC Form 140 for shift inventory. The AFGSC FORM 140 remains in the tool room support
section or workcenter. A separate AFGSC FORM 140 is maintained for each CTK. The form is
used to record CTK/tool transactions (check-in/check-out). Completion of each line of the
AFGSC FORM 140 denotes a complete inventory of contents. The "out time/signature" block is
annotated by the person signing out/assuming responsibility for the CTK/equipment. The "in"
block is annotated by the tool CTK custodian/alternates or designated representative when the
CTK/equipment is returned by the user. The person annotating the "out" block is not the same
person annotating the "in" block.
10.4.2.3. (Added) Units may establish a program for secure sealing of low-use tools. This
method involves identifying items that ordinarily require counting during shift inventories, and
sealing the items with a physical indicator to speed inventory by avoiding unnecessary counting.
Tools that are not signed-out for 45 calendar days or more are considered low use. Examples are
drill bit kits, Allen key sets, and tap and die sets, files, etc. Inventory the identified low-use
items any time they are returned from a job and seal them in a way that prevents opening without
breaking the seal (i.e. computer label sticker, lead seal, plastic zip strip, etc.). Label the item
with the signature of individual performing tool count, date counted and sealed, number of
pieces, tool kit number or item number. The low-use sealed items are only required to be
verified as "present" during daily shift inventories as long as the seal is intact. The seal remains
valid as long as the item is unused and the seal remains secure, or until the next annual CTK
inventory. Low use items will be identified on the appropriate MIL.
10.4.3.3. (Added) In addition to their primary purpose, E-tools are authorized for use in
accessing .mil and .government web sites along with digital technical order web sites, for official
business only. These are the only authorized sites.

necessary.
10.8.1.5. (Added) Units will develop local procedures to ensure proper tracking, reporting and
accountability for all AFGSC Form 145s that are issued. The person who discovered the lost or
missing item will immediately notify the production superintendent or equivalent. An AFGSC
Form 145, Lost Tool/Object Report, will be initiated and routed if the item is not found within 1
hour of initial notification. (Note: The AFGSC 145 must be completed even if the lost tool/item
is found 1-hour past the initial notification.) The completed original Lost Tool/Object report
must be submitted to QA within 5 duty days from date of initiation for filing. Additionally, a
copy of the report may be filed and maintained by the Wing FOD Monitor if the Wing CV has
assigned responsibility for tracking lost tools/items. Maintain the original report in QA for one
year.
10.8.1.10. (Added) The QA chief inspector notifies the applicable AFGSC A4 Weapon System
Team providing all pertinent information. The AFGSC functional manager confers with the
responsible Air Logistics Center (ALC) on appropriate action and, in turn, notifies the unit on
actions to take.

heating systems are designed to cut-out when doors are opened more than 3 feet. In addition,
facility managers shall inform the CE HVAC shop immediately if the heating system
malfunctions to ensure proper system operation during cold weather.
16.1.8. (Added) AFE personnel will locate inadvertent beacon activation on the flightline for the
B-52.
16.1.9. (Added) During B-52 contingency operations, AFE personnel are responsible to
configure personnel locator beacons in the correct mission configuration and theater
requirements, or as directed by Crisis Action Team or Special Instructions.
16.3. 4 (Added) All egress maintenance/inspections will be stopped when lightning is within
five nautical miles of the installation (including in-shop, hangar, HAS, etc.). This will be
confirmed through Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). Continuing an explosive operation
in a lightning protected facility is not prohibited, however, it should not be performed unless
priority aircraft are involved and approved by MXG Commander or Deputy.

18.11.4.1.1.8. (Added) Any inspections not loaded (except those specifically exempted by Air
Force technical data) and improperly loaded aircraft, and low cycle fatigue cycle items.
18.11.4.1.1.9. (Added) TO violations, not using required TOs to perform tasks, or violations of
mandatory directives and supplements, when such may cause damage to government property or
injury to government personnel.
18.11.4.1.1.10. (Added) Use of out-of-date technical data or improper use of tools, which may
cause damage to government property or injury to government personnel.
18.11.4.2. (Added) Minor Discrepancy. An unsatisfactory condition that requires repair or
correction but does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight, jeopardize equipment
reliability, or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment operation. Note: If the COR
determines it is appropriate, minor discrepancies that consist of a grouping of like deficiencies;
for example, a bench stock with 6 co-mingled bins, 10 bins not flagged, and 4 bins with torn
labels may be documented as one discrepancy against the observation guide.
18.14. (Added) Chief COR will complete a Monthly Activity Report (MAR) that should include
inspections/evaluations/audits results for that month, with a summary of deficiencies noted and
any trends identified. It is also recommended to include any CAR updates, a summary of the
business relationship with the contractor, and Chief COR comments. See Attachment 13 (MAR)
(Added) for suggested content and format for a MAR. MAR will be routed to the applicable
AFGSC functional.
18.15.4. (Added) Corrective Action Requests will be initiated by CORs when appropriate.
CARs are issued when the contractor fails to meet a Service Summary requirement, for major
nonconformance, or when the contractor fails to correct minor nonconformance in a timely
manner. As a minimum this could have an effect on the contractors past performance and could
result in money being withheld from the contractor for failure to perform. When a COR has
initiated a CAR, immediately forward a copy of this report to the Chief COR. The Chief COR
and COR may compute a proposed payment deduction based on the performance period in which
the performance occurred. Following Chief COR, FAM, and Program Manager (PM) review,
the CAR will be routed NLT 3 duty days to the CO. The CO will evaluate the CAR and, if
appropriate, sign and send to the contractor (return receipt requested), and assign a suspense for
corrective/preventive actions. The CO shall forward the CAR within 5 calendar days of receipt
from Chief COR/PM coordination. Upon receipt of the contractor’s response, the CO, in
consultation with the Chief COR, and if applicable, the FAM must evaluate the contractor’s
response and take the appropriate action. See Attachment 14 (CAR) (Added) for suggested CAR
content and format.
