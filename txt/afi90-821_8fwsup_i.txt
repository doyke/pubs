                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including
aircraft and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support
functions. This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational
illnesses and injuries in the workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the
health and physical hazards associated with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when,
using or handling hazardous chemicals in work area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred
to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program, and is not to be confused with other
separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program (HMMP).
HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop
hazards.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for
   those work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All
   employees that work in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a
   manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable
   emergency, will be provided information about the hazardous chemicals to which they are
   exposed. This information shall be provided by means of a hazard communication program,
   including but not limited to material safety data sheets (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of
   warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material
   Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey letters] and
   training.
   1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
       1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals,
       and indirect-hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental
       United States (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as
       established in accordance with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
       1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units
       (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be
       potentially exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in
       contractor facilities. Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the
       contractor’s Federal compliant hazard communication program. The Air Force retains
       ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel participation and oversight.

        1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated
        facilities when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the
        following exceptions:
            1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific
            contracts, from their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM
            regulation or any applicable State and local requirements.
            1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with
            Federal HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are
            not authorized to use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
     1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force
     installations even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
     1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication
     Program description contained in Para. 2.2.
     1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in
     sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction
     applies to these operations only as follows:
        1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals
        are not removed or defaced.
        1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
        maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals
        received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
        1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work
        area/shop, and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a
        hazardous chemical from a sealed container.

                                          Chapter 2

                        HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except
as stated in Para. 2.2 below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner
employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program
requirements do not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is
   formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s)
   dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under
   normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or
   trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does
   not pose a physical hazard or health risk to employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs,
   e.g., pills or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier
   toner, etc (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical
   manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
   exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be
   experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended).
      2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program
      and require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation
      with BE. For example:
          2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not
          require this training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner
          daily will require training.
          2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require
          training; however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel
          using the same cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.

   2.2.11. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
   2.2.12. Biological hazards.
   2.2.13. Munitions as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
2.3. Installation Written Hazard Communication Program. Each Air Force installation
whose employees will potentially be exposed to hazardous materials not exempted as described
in Para. 2.2 must create a written hazard communication program to support work area/shop
implementation of the HAZCOM program. The written program must include installation-
specific procedures to meet the HAZCOM program requirements and specifically, will include:
   2.3.1. How MSDSs are accessible to employees (see Para. 2.5).
   2.3.2. Container labeling procedures and requirements (see Para. 2.6).
   2.3.3. Training requirements and procedures (see Para. 2.7).
   2.3.4. Chemical inventory requirements (see Para. 2.8).
   2.3.5. Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and
   unlabeled pipes (see Para. 2.9).
   2.3.6. Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical (See Para. 2.4; applies to only
   work area/shops which produce hazardous chemicals).
2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the
supplier or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air
Force activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include
hazard determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained
on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing
organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to AFIOH.
2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by
the chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid
procedures, and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be
prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will
maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29
CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCONUS supplier, a document meeting the
intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
   2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for
   every item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file
   must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In
   addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-
   hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which
   matched the old material, must be retained.
   2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to,
   the chemical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line
   or CD-ROM, or through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources,
   the BE Flight may be contacted for further assistance.
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                           15


   2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
      2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have
      unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
      2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version.
      OSHA does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to
      immediate employee access" are created.
      2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be
      determined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker
      to obtain an MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally
      splashed with a hazardous chemical.
      2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
      access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up
      system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
      another non-impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or
      BE Flight. Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a
      case-by-case basis.
      2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of
      the MSDS to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and
      planning, and will be available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of
      MSDSs.
      2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g.,
      their work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line
      operations), the MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this
      situation, the supervisor shall ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required
      information in an emergency.
          2.5.3.6.1. (Added-8FW) Mobile radio, cellular phone, or telephone access is
          acceptable providing there are no barriers in communicating the information.
   2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is
   protected and used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health
   hazard education. During the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will
   discuss trade-secret limitations with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors
   using materials with trade-secret information are encouraged to be familiar with requirements
   and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i). When requesting proprietary information, the
   BEE may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding a manufacturer’s
   proprietary information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure criteria are not clear.
2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial
   distributors to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal
   HAZCOM standard. Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the
   supply system or through local purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and
16                                            AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


  HAZMARTs will ensure incoming containers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and
  HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to identify any containers received
  without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
  2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows
  [See 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
     2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
     Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
     2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic
     Substances Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
     2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary
     device or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products
     (e.g., flavors and fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
     Cosmetic Act.
     2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for
     non-industrial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
     and regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that
     Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
     and Firearms.
     2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the
     Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when
     subject to a consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or
     regulations issued under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
     2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance
     with the Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the
     Department of Agriculture.
  2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
  area/shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not
  obliterated or covered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container
  labels [refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
     2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
     2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical
     and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
     This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
     2.6.4.3. (Added-8FW) Name and address of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or
     other responsible party.
  2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined
  purposes. If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements,
  the original label may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the
  information required by the Federal HAZCOM standard, information on the original label
  must remain legible.
  2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             17


      2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
      gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who
      made the transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to
      HAZCOM requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be
      under the control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container
      and only within the work shift in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain
      full control over the chemical or departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual
      material left in the portable container, this material shall either be disposed of under
      applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or labeled in
      accordance with applicable regulations.
      2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a
      central distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other
      employees, then the portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance
      with HAZCOM requirements.
2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
   2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to
   hazardous materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on
   the AF HAZCOM program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards
   prior to the use of hazardous chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals
   (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and fire department) review and approve the shop specific
   hazard training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
   the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors shall be trained according to their
   specific contract provisions.
   2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior
   to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work
   area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change.
      2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
      their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training,
      at a minimum, will include the following:
          2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
          hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material
          used in association with work area/shop processes.
          2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical
          used (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards;
          including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g.,
          asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
          2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard
          communication program.
          2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
          2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
 18                                              AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


          2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal
          protective equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to
          hazardous chemicals specific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray
          painting process). Supervisors shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop
          survey reports for specific control requirements.
          2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental
          chemical release (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the
          locations of emergency eye wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
          2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank
          change-out every three months).
      2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is
      required when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical
      is introduced. The training shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2.
      Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of
      information to meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops
      either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training as described in
      Para. 2.7.2.1 will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes in
      working conditions and potential exposures.
   2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities,
   such as GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7) or they may participate in
   that GOCO’s or other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the
   training meets the requirements of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
   2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM
   standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance
   with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to
   document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form
   55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external HAZCOM
   training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where
   applicable.
   2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a
   performance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be
   measured by assessing worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to
   include, but not be limited to:
      2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the
      nature of the hazard.
      2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
      2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
      2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what
      precautions (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use
      when working with hazardous chemicals.
2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            19


   2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the
   hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
   the work area/shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
   area/shop). The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
   Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
   2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the
   nature of the chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the
   hazard communication program and training requirements appropriate for that work
   area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization
   process, controls which hazardous chemicals can be used in each work area/shop on an
   installation.
2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed
       infrequently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
       2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
       (AFSC) or job series.
   2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
   and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
   and controls, for the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1. OIs do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks
   and associated hazards and controls. Supervisors will ensure workers review these
   procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the gaining activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
       2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1 for workers not
       previously trained.
       2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific
       chemical hazards and associated controls.
2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses
hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in
an industrial shop) may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication
program and access to MSDSs must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR
1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM
information for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
program.
2.11. Forms Prescribed. Air Force Form 55 (AF55), Employee Safety and Health Record;
Air Force Form 3952 (AF3952), Chemical/Hazardous Material Request/Authorization Form
2.12. (Added-8FW) Forms Adopted OSHA Form 174, Material Safety Data Sheet

Hazard Warning—Any words, pictures, symbols, or combination thereof appearing on a label
or other appropriate form of warning which convey the specific physical and health hazard(s),
including target organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the container(s).
HAZMART—As the customer service desk for the IHMP, it is the only entity on an installation
authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or
location where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs
are managed and tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation
where LRS personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have
at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander. The
HMMP team may designate additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs
performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities
 24                                             AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012

4.     STUDENT’S GUIDANCE: It is conceivable that this workbook contains the most
important information you will ever receive. If retained and applied, this information could
maintain your health and prolong your life.

5.       TARGET POPULATION: All personnel who handle or use hazardous chemicals.


I.       Introduction

     (1) Your rights: By law (Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 1910.1200), you have
     the right and are required to receive information and training regarding the hazardous
     chemicals that you handle or work with. This information and training is the “Hazard
     Communication Program,” commonly referred to as HAZCOM. You may also hear it
     referred to as the ―Right-to-know‖ program. This program deals specifically with your
     supervisor informing you of the hazardous chemicals within your workplace. It also provides
     you the training required to safely work with and around hazardous chemicals. You were first
     introduced to this program when you received the ―Department of Defense Federal Hazard
     Communication Training Program‖. The training you are about to receive is a continuation of
     that program and addresses the hazardous chemicals you will be exposed to, established
     protective measures, and how to find the information needed to protect yourself. You can
     expect to receive some aspect of this program for as long as you work with or around
     hazardous materials.

     (2) Your Responsibilities: Under AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental
     Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program, you have specific responsibilities.
     You are required to follow the training you are given, comply with personal protective
     equipment requirements, including its use, inspection, and care, and give due consideration to
     personal safety and the safety of fellow workers.

     (3) Methods of Recourse: If you feel you have not received information which you need or
     have a right to under the Hazard Communication Program, talk to your supervisor. You may
     contact Public Health at extension 782-4509.

     (4) OSHA Expanded Standard Chemicals: Under AFMAN 48-155, Occupational And
     Environmental Health Exposure Controls, mandates strict adherence to OSHA expanded
     standard substance requirements contained in 29 CFR 1910.___, (Benzene, Cadmium, Lead,
     etc.) Your shop is current with annual training requirements. Expanded training is
     documented on (where)

III. Operations/Tasks in Your Workplace Involving Hazardous Chemicals.

The operations/tasks listed below involve working with one or more hazardous chemicals.
Ensure you are trained before attempting to accomplish any task involving hazardous materials.


       (1) OPERATION/TASK: Repair/Maintenance of Shop Equipment

  Personnel use a splice kit to splice cables/wires. The kit provides the materials necessary to
  reattach cables once they are spliced. The sizes of the kits vary depending on the size of the
  cable/wire being spliced. During this process a mold/casting is placed around the cable/wire,
  resin is mixed in the packet and then poured into the mold. If the cable/wire is in a damp area
  a varnish/tar is painted on top of the resin to further protect the cables/wires from moisture.
  The majority of operations are conducted outside or in a manhole. Electrical equipment is
  cleaned using a cleaner/degreaser. Product is sprayed onto components and is left to
  evaporate. This activity is performed on an as needed basis. Contact and absorption hazards
  may be encountered during use of chemicals. Operations are sometimes performed in
  confined spaces. Good personal hygiene practices limit potential ingestion hazards. Thermal
  hazards may exist while operations are performed outdoors and noise hazards are present
  when working near or with noise producing equipment or on the flightline.

      IV. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials

             (1) A Non-Routine Task is:

                    (a) A task included within the activities of a workplace but performed
      infrequently.
            (b) A detail or temporary duty performed outside of an employee’s normal workplace or
            AFSC. This includes squadron and base details.

             (2) Supervisors will ensure work area operation instructions (OIs) thoroughly describe
      non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls for the infrequent tasks listed in this section.
      OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TOs), other official documents, or
      manufacturer’s instructions adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers
      review these procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
       34                                               AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


              (3) When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
      the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the
      activity:

                      (a) The initial DOD HAZCOM Training Program if not previously trained.
             (b) Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and
             associated controls.
             (c) The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal supervisor
             describing the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55 can be updated.

           (4) Our-Non-Routine Tasks are:

      (If non-routine tasks do not exist, then write a bullet statement stating that your shop does not
      perform non-routine operations.)

      V.       Material Safety Data Sheets

      Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are designed to help you understand how to work safely
      with chemicals in your work area. Although MSDSs may vary in appearance and length, most
      MSDSs will have approximately 8 to 10 sections which explain the proper ways to handle and
      store chemicals in your work area. An MSDS also provides information on health hazards of the
      chemical, precautionary measures to follow, and emergency procedures.

               - Know where MSDSs are kept (location of MSDS’s)
               - MSDSs must be accessible to all personnel

      HAVE AN MSDS AVAILABLE WHEN SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION

      EXPLANATION TO THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                35




CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION
The introductory section of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) includes the chemical
manufacturer’s name, address and emergency phone number, the chemical name, trade name,
and chemical formula. This section helps you identify the chemical on the MSDS.

HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS
This section lists any hazardous ingredients found within the chemical that can be hazardous to
you. In this section you might also see the terms TLV (Threshold Limit Value) and PEL
(Permissible Exposure Limit). Both terms are used to express the airborne concentration levels
of a C.A.S. (Chemical Abstract Service), which will usually be listed in this section the MSDS.
The C.A.S. numbers identify specific chemicals according to information published by the
American Chemical Society.

PHYSICAL DATA
This section lists such important physical properties of the chemical as boiling point, vapor
density, percent volatile, appearance and odor, and other. This information helps determine the
degree of hazards associated with the chemical in different work environments. For example,
vapor density describes the weight of a vapor relative to an equal volume of air (air=1). If a
chemical has a vapor density greater than 1, the vapor will be heavier than air and tends to fall
and hug the ground.

FIRE AND EXPLOSION DATA
This section helps you determine the chemical flash point, which is the temperature at which a
chemical will release enough flammable vapor to ignite. Chemicals that ignite at or above 100F
are classified as flammable. In addition, this section usually lists the chemical’s upper and lower
flammability limits, proper types of extinguishing media required to safety extinguish the fire
(example Co2, water, foam, etc.), special firefighting procedures, and any unusual fire and
explosion hazards associated with the chemical.

HEALTH HAZARD DATA

This section describes health effects associated with being overexposed to the chemical through
ingestion, inhalation, and skin or eye contact. The information may include: the acute
(immediate) and chronic (long term) effects of overexposure to the chemical, whether the
chemical is a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), emergency and first aid procedures to
follow in case of overexposure, whether overexposures may require immediate medical
attention, and medical conditions that may be aggravated upon contact with the chemical. If you
work in an area where overexposure is possible, safety equipment may be needed to protect you.

REACTIVITY DATA
The information contained in this section helps you determine if the chemical will react with
other chemical or conditions. Chemicals that are reactive (unstable) may explode, burn, or
release toxic substances under certain conditions. In addition, this section usually tells you if the
 36                                               AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


chemical is stable or unstable and list any chemicals or substances that might be incompatible
with the chemical.

SPILL OR LEAK PROCEDURES
This section lists the procedures to follow when a chemical is accidentally released or spilled. It
will also cover types of cleanup and protective equipment needed to safely contain or clean up a
spill as well as proper ways to dispose of the chemical.

SPECIAL PROTECTION INFORMATION
This section lists the types of special protective equipment (respirators, gloves, eye protection,
and ventilation) that is recommended to be used when with the chemical. Remember, there are
various types of protective equipment that are specially designed for certain tasks. Consult with
your supervisor to ensure you are using the correct type for the work you are performing.

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
The last section usually discusses special precautions to be taken to during handling and storage
of the chemical. Also, this section will usually discuss any other health or safety concerns that
have not already mentioned in another section of the MSDS.

VI. Labeling

To ensure employees are aware of all hazardous material within their workplace, OSHA requires
all containers of hazardous materials brought into or used within a workplace to have the
contents labeled, tagged, or marked.

   (1) The chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor is required to label, tag, or mark each
   container with:

       (a) The identity of the hazardous material
       (b) Appropriate hazard warnings
       (c) Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer, importer, or distributor

These labels, tags, or markings will not be removed, defaced, or changed. If it becomes
necessary to replace a label, tag, or marking due to damage or loss, a DD Form 2521 (8‖ x 11‖)
or DD Form 2522 (4‖ x 6‖), Hazardous Chemical Warning Label, will be used. One of these
forms will also be used to meet the labeling requirements for existing stocks of unlabeled
materials and for transferring, repackaging, or distributing of bulk quantities of hazardous
materials into other containers (breakdown quantities).

   (2) The supervisor will ensure that each container of hazardous chemicals in the workplace is
   labeled, tagged, or marked with:

      (a) The identity of the hazardous chemical
      (b) Appropriate hazard warnings.
      (c) If the container is used or transported for use outside of the workplace, the name, duty
      section and phone number of the responsible individual will be included.
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 37


   (3) Stationary containers may have their contents identified using signs, placards, or other
   such written material in place of labels as long as the alternative method identifies the
   container to which it is applicable.

   (4) Small quantity containers, when filled, used, and emptied by one employee during one
   shift within the workplace, will be marked, as a minimum, with the name of the material in
   use. If these small quantity containers are filled from other containers, the source container
   will have the required OSHA markings.

Warning labels may be formatted with either message or symbol which will identify the
chemical and communicate the hazards of the chemical within the container. Labels may also
address:

First aid - The label may explain what to do if the chemical comes in contact with eyes or skin or
if it is ingested or inhaled.

Fire - The label may list the type of extinguisher to use if the chemical is flammable, and if it
should catch fire.

Spills - Some warning labels may contain information on how spills should be handled.

Handling and Storage - The label will provide storage information and may list the type of
personal protective equipment required to handle/use the chemical.

VII. Physical and Health Hazards

The specific chemicals used during a particular operation or task will be addressed during the
training or orientation for that operation or task.

Consult label and MSDS for information on specific chemicals before handling or use.

VIII. Methods and Observations to Detect Presence or Release of a Hazardous Material in
the Workplace (N/A if this does not apply)


(1) Continuous Monitoring Devices:


(2) Monitoring Conducted by the Supervisor:

(3) Visual Appearance: Many chemicals have a distinct color and others, by their lack of color,
could be visually confused with water. Certain colors can be distorted depending upon the
lighting and the color of the material the chemical is in contact with. For these reasons, be
extremely careful when attempting to identify an unknown spill by color alone.
 38                                              AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012


(4) Odor: Chemicals can also have a distinctive smell, such as an oily or alcohol-like smell.
Unfortunately, some chemicals are nearly odorless. In these cases, remain aware of your or a co-
worker’s physical reactions. Burning eyes, nose or throat, prickly skin, loss of coordination, and
dizziness are a few signs of exposure to a hazardous chemical.

(5) Monitoring by Bioenvironmental Engineering: May be performed as a part of a survey,
when a new process or chemical is introduced into the workplace, or when over-exposure to a
chemical is suspected.

IX. Protective Measures

Controlling chemical hazards often require a combination of protective measures: engineering
controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment. We will examine how
these controls are used.

(1) Engineering Controls

  (a) Substitution: Finding a less hazardous chemical used within a process, finding a less
  hazardous process, or finding a less hazardous piece of equipment. Examples within this
  work area: Identify procedures to take when substitution of a chemical is to be implemented

  (b) Isolation: Using barriers or enclosures to separate the employee from the hazard.
  Examples within this work area are: List specific examples as applicable in the workplace

  (c) Ventilation: Providing a constant source of fresh air to the work area or removing
  airborne hazards at the source. Examples within this work area are: List specific industrial
  ventilation systems used in the workplace and what exposures they are used to control

  * Bioenvironmental Engineering will be consulted before initiating any changes in the
  ventilation system.

(2) Administrative Controls

  (a) Information and Training: In order to recognize the need for protection against a hazard,
  you need to be aware that a hazard exists. This information is passed to you through Hazard
  Communication Training, technical data, and on-the-job training (OJT).

  (b) Safe Work Practices: Through information and training, you learn the safe work practices
  to use with chemicals you will use or be exposed to. Common sense also goes a long way.

  (c) Good Housekeeping and Personal Hygiene: The goal of good housekeeping is to contain
  and remove hazards through proper storage, proper cleanup, and the prompt removal and
  correct disposal of chemical wastes. Correct personal hygiene around hazardous chemicals
  involves washing your hands before eating, drinking, or smoking, prompt removal of
  contaminated clothing, and cleaning of the clothing before wearing again.
AFI90-821_8FWSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             39


   (d) Environmental, Medical, and Personal Monitoring: In some workplaces, the hazard of a
   chemical used requires the use of machines to monitor the air to warn of possible
   overexposure. Another method is physical exams of the personnel to detect adverse health
   conditions, both before allowing exposure to a chemical and at specific intervals while
   working with a chemical. In all workplaces, monitoring by the workers and the supervisors
   for poor work practices, poor housekeeping, and damaged equipment is the first line of
   defense against unprotected exposure to hazardous chemicals.

(3) Personal Protective Equipment: Technical data and MSDSs will specify the protective
equipment necessary while using specific chemicals. The protective equipment used in this
workcenter and their locations are: List the specific location of these items

Emergency Procedures: When controls fail or there is an accidental release of a hazardous
chemical, emergency actions to safeguard life and property must be taken. The following are
actions established in this workcenter: (talk about spill kits and eyewash stations and/or eyewash
showers here. List the specific location of these items)

As you become familiar with the job, you may be able to suggest ways to improve your
operation. Don’t hesitate to talk these ideas over with your supervisor and don’t forget to submit
them on an AF Form 1000.

X. Conclusion

We’ve covered some very important information today, information which will permit you to do
your job safely and avert health problems in later years.

You should now know and understand:

1. Your personal rights and responsibilities under OSHA.

2. HAZCOM requirements that apply to your job and workplace.
