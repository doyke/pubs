                           GENERAL OPERATING GUIDANCE

2.1. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. All flights will have an aircraft
commander designated on a flight authorization form, or equivalent, in accordance with AFI 11-
401, Flight Management, as supplemented by MAJCOMs. ANG will comply with AFI 11-401,
NGB Sup 1. Aircraft commanders are:
   2.1.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft. Vested with the authority necessary to
   manage their crew and accomplish the mission.
   2.1.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   This begins upon notification and terminates upon mission completion. If the aircraft
   commander determines that conditions are not safe to prosecute the mission, the aircraft will
   not depart until the condition is corrected.
   2.1.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to higher
   authority.
   2.1.4. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed concerning mission
   progress and/or difficulties. The final authority for asking for and accepting waivers affecting
   the crew or mission.
   2.1.5. Responsible for ensuring aircraft security when away from home station.
   2.1.6. The focal point for interaction between aircrew and mission support personnel.
2.2. Posse Comitatus Act. See AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies.
(N/A for ANG units on State missions in non-Title 10 status). CONUS: In cases of extreme
emergencies, in order to prevent the loss of life, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great
property loss, a commander may offer assistance to civil authorities and victims necessary to
meet immediate needs until civil authorities can arrive. OCONUS: IAW SOFA/ROE. If
possible, seek command approval prior to commencing these operations.
2.3. Drug Law Enforcement Agencies (DLEA) Support/United States Coast Guard
(USCG). Units receiving requests for operational DLEA/USCG support (flight support, aerial
reconnaissance, etc.,) should inform the requesting organization to redirect the request through:
   2.3.1. FORSCOM J-3, Counter Drug, Fort McPherson, Ga., 30330-6000, DSN 367-5000 or
   commercial (404) 669-5000 for CONUS units.
   2.3.2. Appropriate theater J-3 for overseas units.
   2.3.3. Operational DLEA requests will be routed through appropriate command channels, in
   turn through MAJCOM, as applicable. Units should not respond directly to drug law
   enforcement agency requests.
   2.3.4. Requests for non-operational support (equipment loans) should be referred to the
   installation commander who will staff the request through the appropriate Regional Logistics
   Support Office (RLSO).
2.4. Medical Evacuation.
 10                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   2.4.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Missions. Medical evacuation flights may be operated to
   transport seriously ill or injured persons, and/or to transport medical personnel, equipment, or
   supplies under emergency conditions when other means are not suitable or readily available.
   Ensure all mission requests are coordinated through the appropriate Rescue Coordination
   Center (RCC).
   2.4.2. Medical Assistance. If one or more qualified pararescuemen are immediately
   available, deployment of aircraft will not be delayed pending arrival of a local flight
   surgeon/physician.
2.5. Aircrew Qualification. Crewmembers occupying a primary position during flight must be
H-60 qualified and current for the mission events to be flown, or conducting training/recurrency
for that crew position/mission IAW AFI 11-2HH-60, Vol 1, HH-60-Aircrew Training.
Otherwise, AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11-401, and MAJCOM supplements
apply.
2.6. Crew Complement. The minimum crew is two pilots and flight engineer for all flight
operations except those specified in Table 2.1 or as waived IAW 1.4.2.1 All low-level
maneuvers involving flight below 500 feet AGL, except profiles listed in the table, require two
qualified scanners. During engine running crew changes and other ground operations when the
engines are running, a minimum of one pilot will be strapped in and monitor the controls at all
times. The term ―Co-Pilot (CP)‖ in Table 2.1 is only used to reference a qualified pilot that is
not considered an Aircraft Commander qualified in the events being flown. A second Aircraft
commander may be used in lieu of a ―CP‖. In addition, a MAJCOM designated Flight Test
Engineer (FTE) may fly in place of a copilot IAW AFI 11-401 para 1.12.1. FTEs will not have
control of the aircraft during critical phases of flight.

 NOTES:
 1. FCF crewmembers must be certified IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1, AFI 21-101, Aerospace
 Equipment Maintenance Management, and applicable MAJCOM directives, and designated
 in writing (AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training or AF Form 4348, USAF
 Aircrew Certification). When certified crewmembers are not available, non-certified
 crewmembers may be designated by the squadron/deployed commander or his/her
 representative on the flight authorization.

 2. Guardian Angel (GA) PJ/CRO personnel will be utilized IAW AFI 16-1202V3 or
 equivalent when published. The use of medically qualified personnel other than GA is
 authorized during peacetime SAR or combat MEDEVAC missions based off GA
 availability.

 3. Aircraft taxi or flight is not permitted. FE must be engine run certified. Two pilots are
 authorized to perform maintenance ground runs without an FE present after a qualified
 aircrew member has accomplished a preflight. An engine run certified FE or pilot may
 perform maintenance ground runs with engine run qualified maintenance personnel during
 non-rotors turning operations. The pilot crew position is considered any HH-60G qualified
 pilot/copilot.

 4. Or an additional HH-60G qualified FE.

 5. NVG Water Operations Scanner Certification has been removed from AFI 11-2HH-60v1.
 Units currently utilizing this position for Left Scanner duties during NWOPS are
 grandfathered until 31 Dec 2010 to upgrade individuals to NWOPS. Only personnel
 certified prior to the release date of this publication are grandfathered.

2.7. Passengers. DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for
passenger movement on DOD aircraft. AFI 11-401 provides further guidance on orientation and
public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly. In all cases, passengers will be
manifested on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
   2.7.1. Passengers will not be carried on flights involving low level, tactical mission events,
   pilot recurrency, air refueling, AHC, unusual attitudes, or water operations. These restrictions
   do not apply when passengers are operating under the restrictions of AFI 11-401 and
   MAJCOM guidance for familiarization flights, are designated as Mission Essential Personnel
   (MEP), or otherwise approved by the OG/CC. Passengers will not be carried on any flight
   involving practice emergency procedures. Comply with AFI 11-401 when flying MEP when
   an unqualified pilot has access to the controls.
   2.7.2. Space-required. DOD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not previously
   mentioned, who are authorized official travel on DOD aircraft. COMAFFOR determines and
   approves eligibility for all space required categories and may be delegated to the OG/CC
   with TACON of the aircraft. The following exceptions do not apply:
       2.7.2.1. Restrictions. There are no restrictions on mission events. Passengers will be
       restrained by the safest means possible within mission constraints/cabin configuration
 12                                 AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


       requirements. Aircraft Commander will ensure that supported forces are briefed on the
       mission profile and mission events before flight.
       2.7.2.2. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401,
       paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft). Simulated EPs are
       prohibited (Exception: EPs required for the purposes of a functional check flight are
       authorized. In this context, personnel on board are required for mission accomplishment.
       Limit personnel to absolute minimum required). Other mission events are authorized.
       Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers. Aircraft
       Commander will ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and
       mission events before flight.
2.8. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Refer to AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-401, MAJCOM
Supplement. Guidance in preceding reference applies regardless of qualification of pilots.
   2.8.1. Unless stated otherwise in MAJCOM supplements to AFI 11-401, OG/CC or
   equivalent with Operational Control (OPCON) is the approving authority.
   2.8.2. Crew chiefs and maintenance/logistic support personnel are required to wear nomex
   flight gear when performing in-flight duties.
2.9. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between rescue units to accomplish
flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). The MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3) is the approval authority for
qualified H-60 crewmembers from other US military services. AFI 11-2HH-60V1, HH-60
Aircrew Training, specifies HH-60 difference qualification training for H-60 pilots from other
US military services. When qualified H-60 pilots from other US military services fly at a set of
controls, a current and qualified Air Force IP will occupy the other set of controls. The training
being conducted supports specific flying training not available through AETC formal training
courses.
   2.9.1. Interfly approval is not required for:
       2.9.1.1. 34 WPS Aircrews and Students.
       2.9.1.2. CTF aircrews assigned or attached to ACC, AFMC and AFRC.
       2.9.1.3. MAJCOM (flying unit owning aircraft) approved Joint Exercises.
       2.9.1.4. MAJCOM Realistic Training visits.
       2.9.1.5. HHQ Unit Visits, SAVs, Formal Visits, ORIs, and OREs.
       2.9.1.6. Senior Supervisory crewmembers approved IAW AFI 11-401.
2.10. Alert Personnel/Duty. Comply with Air Tasking Order (or equivalent) for alert
requirements and response times. Squadron/Deployed CC’s determine the length of tours, flight
duty periods, crew rest requirements, and scheduling IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General
Flight Rules, para 9.4 and MAJCOM supplement.
2.11. Alert Aircraft. Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows:
   2.11.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                      13


   2.11.2. Plan preflight validity periods to limit the need to update the preflight during an alert
   period. Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, regardless of whether it
   has flown or not, a complete aircrew preflight and hover check is required.
   2.11.3. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided
   the following conditions are met:
       2.11.3.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission
       requirements.
       2.11.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency.
       2.11.3.3. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
       area.
   2.11.4. Rescue Equipment. All hoist equipped alert aircraft will carry an alternate
   insertion/extraction device on board as an alternate means of insertion/extraction in the event
   of hoist malfunction/ failure
   2.11.5. Thru-Flight Inspections.
       2.11.5.1. IAW T.O. 00-20-1-WA-1, the maintenance thru-flight inspection is a between
       flights inspection and will be accomplished after each flight when a turnaround sortie,
       continuation flight or continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection
       is not required. The thru-flight inspection consists of checking the aerospace vehicle for
       flight continuance by performing visual examination and/or operational checks of certain
       components, areas, or systems, according to established TOs to ensure that no defects
       exist which would be detrimental to further flight. An alert crewmember or other HH-60
       aircrew member designated by the Mission Commander will be present during the thru-
       flight inspection or at the completion of the thru-flight inspection to ensure all
       cowlings/access doors are secure and to check the areas in which the inspection and/or
       maintenance was performed.
   2.11.6. Aircrews should perform HIT/Hover/Hoist Checks (probe, weapons, IEWS
   preflights, as required). Once accepted for alert, make the following entry in the AFTO
   FORM 781A, MAINTENACE DISCREPANCY AND WORK DOCUMENT: ―Aircraft
   accepted for alert_______(time/date). Hit Check, Hover Check, and Hoist Check
   performed‖. To ensure integrity of the crew preflight, an alert crewmember will be present
   whenever maintenance is performed, or at the completion of the maintenance, to check the
   area in which maintenance was performed. If an alert crewmember is not available, Mission
   Commanders may authorize another HH-60 aircrew member to check the area in which
   maintenance was performed and ensure the alert crew is briefed on the maintenance actions.
   The check must be performed prior to flight.
2.12. Alert Procedures. Alert crews will conduct a general briefing at the beginning of each
alert period. Alert crews are authorized to prepare TOLD and DD Form 365-4, Record of Weight
and Balance Personnel, using the worst weather conditions expected during the alert period.
This TOLD will be used only for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons,
new TOLD will be accomplished.
   2.12.1. When an alert crew change occurs, and the same aircraft remains on alert, there is no
   requirement to perform another preflight. Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72
 14                                 AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   hrs, regardless if it has flown or not, complete another full Dash 1 aircraft preflight and hover
   check. When an alert aircraft changes, the alert crew will perform an aircraft preflight, hover
   check, and cocking of the aircraft. If the alert crew is not available, a ―buddy preflight‖ crew
   may be used to preflight, hover and cock the aircraft at the Mission Commander’s discretion.
2.13. Reconstitution of Alert. Whenever a squadron's alert forces have been launched on a
mission, the squadron should make every effort to reconstitute its alert capability to assist/meet
additional taskings.
2.14. Armed Crewmembers. Squadron commanders may direct arming of crewmembers as
deemed necessary by mission threat analysis. During all operations with an aircraft weapon
system on board, an aircrew member will be armed. Protect these weapons, and other installed
weapons, in compliance with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of force by Air Force Personnel,
AFPD 16-8, Arming of Aircrew, Mobility, and Overseas Personnel and AFI 31-101, Integrated
Defense. If a crewmember is armed for the sole purpose of providing security for an aircraft
weapon system, they may be armed with any approved Air Force sidearm or GUU-5/M-4/M203.
2.15. Armed Passengers. The aircraft Commander is the final approving authority for armed
passengers. At the discretion of the aircraft commander the FE/AG may collect, secure, and
transport weapons for passengers who are authorized to carry them.
2.16. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. With Wing/CC
approval, civilian law enforcement or medical personnel may be transported to mishap/disaster
sites. During life or death SAR missions already in progress, when wing commander approval
cannot be obtained in a timely manner, the aircraft commander may approve civilian law
enforcement/medical personnel to fly aboard their aircraft. (N/A for NGB units on state
missions).
2.17. Maximum Flight Duty Period. IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9, and MAJCOM
Supplements.
2.18. Crew Rest Period. IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9 and MAJCOM Supplement and Para
2.10
2.19. Deployment Spin-up. Prior to known/anticipated contingencies, units will complete
ground and flight pre-deployment spin-up training. Spin-up training will begin within 90 days of
required delivery date (RDD). OG/CC is the approval authority for the spin-up training syllabus
and waiver authority to begin spin-up training beyond 90 days of the RDD.
2.20. In-Flight Supervision.
   2.20.1. IPs and Flight Lead (FL)-qualified squadron supervisors may permit a wingman to
   lead during limited portions of a CT mission, if appropriately briefed. This provision will
   only be used to allow wingmen to practice events in which they are already qualified or to
   help determine if they are ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP/supervisor is responsible
   for the flight.
   2.20.2. FLs may delegate the tactical lead to their wingman for specific tasks or may fly in a
   chase position on their wingman for authorized events. While leading in this capacity, the
   wingman may make decisions for the flight, but the FL will retain overall authority and
   responsibility.

                     MISSION PLANNING/FLIGHT PREPARATION

3.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning/preparation is shared jointly by
the individual aircrew members, and the operations and intelligence functions of the
organization.
3.2. Briefing/Debriefing Requirements. Refer to Attachment 2 for briefings. The aircraft
commander or flight lead is responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will promote safe,
effective mission accomplishment. The aircraft commander or flight lead is responsible for
ensuring appropriate mission/event briefings are completed prior to accomplishment. Mission
elements/events may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not
compromised. Flight lead/aircraft commanders will ensure changes are acknowledged by all
flight members/crewmembers. If feasible, an alternate mission will be briefed. The alternate
mission must be less complex than the primary mission
   3.2.1. Additionally aircraft commanders and/or flight leads will:
   3.2.1.1. Ensure all crewmembers/passengers attend the briefing unless previously
   coordinated with squadron supervisors and aircraft commander/flight lead. Anyone not
   attending the flight briefing must receive a briefing on mission events, duties and emergency
   procedures prior to flight.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure specific items pertinent to all mission events are covered. Those items
       understood by all participants, and written in squadron standards, may be briefed as
       ―standard.‖ Units may augment these guides as necessary and reproduce in user-desired
       format as long as all items are listed.
       3.2.1.3. For all low-level mission briefings (flight below 500’ AGL) and AHC sorties,
       brief low altitude flight maneuvering, gross weight, the onset of blade stall angle of bank,
       and maximum sustainable angle of bank at planned maneuvering speed, obstacle/ground
       avoidance, and aircraft performance limitations based on the worst-case conditions for
       the intended sortie. For low altitude training over water/featureless terrain, include
       specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes, and spatial disorientation,
       and aircraft deconfliction.
       3.2.1.4. When dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, brief flight responsibilities,
       proper formation position (minimum rotor separation based on the largest rotor diameter),
       aircraft unique capabilities, tactics, limitations and requirements for each phase of flight.
   3.2.2. All missions will be debriefed. Consider using approved, portable VTRs and PFPS
   trails to enhance capturing lesson’s learned.
   3.2.3. Prior to each flight the aircraft commander will ensure all passengers are briefed IAW
   TO 1H-60(H)G-1CL1 and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
   3.2.4. Complete Operational Risk Management prior to flight. Evaluate risk and mitigate
   appropriately for the flight.
3.3. Weather Minimums:
 16                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   3.3.1. VFR Minimums. The following minimum weather criteria (ceiling/visibility) apply
   during all VFR training operations (unless higher is specified):
      3.3.1.1. Day training: 700/1. EXCEPTION: Group CC’s may establish weather
      criteria less than those specified for flights which only require hover operations (eg.
      hover checks, FCFs). In no case will weather minimums be less than AFI 11-202V3
      requirements.
      3.3.1.2. Night training:
          3.3.1.2.1. 1000/3 for unaided and night practice emergency procedures.
          3.3.1.2.2. 700/2 for NVG operations.
      3.3.1.3. Operational Weather Minimums. In no case will weather minimums be less
      than AFI 11-202V3 requirements.
   3.3.2. IFR Takeoff Minimums:
      3.3.2.1. Training Flights. Weather equal to or higher than published approach
      minimums (ceiling and visibility), but no less than one-half mile (RVR 2400) at the
      departure airfield.
      3.3.2.2. Operational Flights:
          3.3.2.2.1. Without a departure alternate, visibility at the departure point must be at or
          above the published visibility minimums required for the appropriate aircraft category
          for an available approach.
          3.3.2.2.2. With a departure alternate, weather at the departure point must be equal to
          or above one-half the published visibility minimums required for the appropriate
          aircraft category, but no less than one-quarter mile (1200 RVR) for an available
          approach. Published visibility is required if a copter-only approach is used at the
          departure airfield.
              3.3.2.2.2.1. The departure alternate prevailing weather must be equal to or better
              than the lowest published approach ceiling and visibility minimum (no lower than
              1200 RVR), and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after the time you would expect
              to arrive.
              3.3.2.2.2.2. The departure alternate should be within 60 minutes flight time.
   3.3.3. Life or Death Missions. Wing commander may approve helicopters to take off with
   visibility less than the requirements of paragraph 3.3.2.2 if an appropriate course of action is
   available, and a detailed plan developed and briefed. Weather at the recovery and landing
   areas must meet the minimum requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.3.4. Destination IFR Requirements. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
3.4. Adverse Weather Planning:
   3.4.1. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM guidance. Do not fly into rain
   shafts beneath cumulonimbus clouds.
   3.4.2. Wind Restrictions: IAW the Flight Manual.
3.5. Fuel Planning:
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                      17


   3.5.1. Fuel Conservation. Aircrews will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and
   precious resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiency throughout all
   phases of mission execution, to include ground ops, flight profiles. Incorporate enroute
   tasks to make maximum use of airborne training opportunities. Terminate the sortie when
   mission and training objectives are met.
   3.5.2. For instrument flight planning purposes, when visibility-only criterion is used, or
   when destination weather information may be unreliable, fuel requirements for descent,
   approach, and missed approach will be 500 pounds. Ensure sufficient fuel remains to arrive
   at the alternate with appropriate reserves.
   3.5.3. For all flights, VFR or IFR, plan to arrive at destination with a 500-pound total fuel
   reserve. This will allow for approximately 20 minutes of usable fuel.
3.6. Area Maps.
   3.6.1. Local Area Hazards Map. The squadron commander will appoint one person as
   OPR for the Local Area Hazards Map and PFPS/FalconView databases. Positive hand-off of
   Chart update manuals (CHUM) duties will be utilized to ensure continuity and CHUM
   completion during deployments, TDY’s, etc. Hazards and obstacles to local operations and
   frequently used areas will be plotted on a suitable chart and displayed. Changes will be made
   as received and brought to the attention of all crewmembers. The chart will be reviewed
   monthly with the reviewer annotating new hazards and ensuring PFPS/Falcon View
   databases are updated as well.
   3.6.2. VFR Flight Maps. Aircrew flying VFR will include sectional charts or PFPS/Falcon
   View (or PFPS/FalconView produced maps) with airports/heliports, airspace boundaries,
   airways, MTRs, parachute jump and SUAS boundaries displayed during mission planning.
   Low-level charts and route books used during flight will be annotated with the location and
   dimensions of Class B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields and other potential high density
   traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas, ultra light/hang glider sites, etc.) within 5NM of
   planned route. Annotate and brief applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the
   vicinity of Class B/C/D airspace, MTR crossing, and any other possible areas of conflict.
   ECHUM and Manual CHUM overlays will also be displayed on PFPS/FalconView produced
   VFR Flight maps as the top overlay unless safety or map readability are adversely affected.
   WARNING: Sectional Charts do not accurately depict the location of hazards. Use extreme
   caution when utilizing Sectional Charts near charted obstacles.
3.7. Landing Zone Surveys:
   3.7.1. All landing zone agreements must be approved by the Wing CC/COMAFFOR (or
   delegated representative). Unit tactics offices must ensure that surveys are conducted and
   updated IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.
   3.7.2. Squadron commanders must ensure thorough site surveys are conducted on all training
   and operational Helicopter Landing Zones (HLZ). All obstructions and/or terrain that could
   potentially damage the aircraft must be annotated on the survey.
   3.7.3. Single-ship training LZs must provide a minimum of 25-foot clearance from any
   portion of the helicopter to the nearest obstacle. Multiple-ship LZs must be large enough to
 18                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   provide a minimum of one rotor diameter width separation between aircraft, and 25 feet of
   clearance from all other obstacles.
   3.7.4. The following items will be included on survey diagrams: LZ suitability (size, shape,
   slope, surface condition), site elevation, obstructions, orientation of the long axis,
   recommended approach and departure headings, prominent landmarks, and any
   restrictions/limitations (hover operations only, single-/multi-ship operations, etc.).
   3.7.5. At a minimum, surveys must be updated/reviewed every 6 months.
   3.7.6. Exercise HLZ surveys. If an aircrew HLZ survey is not possible, squadron
   commanders may authorize one of the following methods, in order of priority: CCT or
   ground party, satellite photography survey, or thorough map survey (1:50,000 scale map or
   less). Aircrew will exercise extreme caution when operating into sites that were surveyed
   with one of these methods.
3.8. Low Level Surveys:
   3.8.1. Prior to training or exercise operations below 500 feet AGL, a survey of the route/area
   will be accomplished as follows:
       3.8.1.1. An extensive map study will be made of the selected routes and areas. All
       obstacles and hazards 50 feet above terrain or natural vegetation within the boundaries
       will be annotated on the flight map. The Chart Updating Manual (CHUM) will be used to
       ensure current obstacles are depicted on maps.
       3.8.1.2. Surveying an area rather than a specific route for low level navigation will
       increase the effectiveness of the training by allowing greater flexibility in planning
       navigation legs. If surveying the entire low level area is not possible, ensure the area
       within 5 NM of the route is surveyed.
       3.8.1.3. The survey will be accomplished during daylight hours, and will be conducted at
       the lowest practical altitude.
       3.8.1.4. If low-level helicopter flight operations have not been conducted in that
       area/route for 6 months, a resurvey will be accomplished.
       3.8.1.5. Units deployed for training, operational, and exercise missions do not have to
       conduct their own flight surveys if a current master map and flight survey is provided to
       them by a DOD or NATO military agency that operates helicopters.
3.9. Illumination Requirements for Helicopter Landing Areas:
   3.9.1. Night operations into unprepared/unlighted areas may only be conducted using NVGs.
   EXCEPTION: Helicopters may be authorized by the squadron commander to operate into
   prepared/unlighted areas unaided, provided the crew is aware of all obstacles, and aircraft
   lighting provides sufficient illumination to clearly see the approach path and landing surface.
3.10. Altitude Restrictions. Conduct all operations at or above 500 feet above ground level
(AGL) except when lower altitudes are required for takeoff, departure, arrival, landing,
operational missions, training flights in approved areas or routes, or approved exercise missions.
Pilots must ensure that flights conducted below 500 feet do not create a hazard to persons or
property on the surface.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                   19


   3.10.1. Helicopters are limited to a base altitude of 100 feet AGL during day and night
   tactical NVG operations. EXCEPTION: Flight down to 50 feet AGL is authorized during
   preplanned tactical missions. Approval to fly at 50 feet AGL is limited to specific route
   segments for the purpose of defeating threats. Approval authority is squadron CC/DO/ADO,
   or any H-60 tactical mission qualified IP.
   3.10.2. Minimum en route altitude for unaided night navigation, both operationally and for
   training, is 500 feet above highest obstacle (AHO) within 5 NM.
   3.10.3. Minimum en route altitude for non-tactical NVG flight is 500 feet AGL.
   3.10.4. Pilots must compute a minimum safe altitude for each leg of a low-level route.
   EXCEPTION: For flights conducted in a designated low-level area, one minimum safe
   altitude may be computed for the planned area of operation. The heading and altitude must
   provide a minimum of 1000 feet (2000 feet in mountainous areas) above the highest obstacle
   within 5 NM either side of the planned route centerline. This altitude will be used in the
   event of inadvertent IMC.
   3.10.5. Obstacle Clearance. If known obstacles cannot be visually identified prior to 1/2
   NM, climb to a sufficient altitude to ensure obstacle clearance, and do not descend to planned
   en route altitude until obstacle clearance is assured.
   3.10.6. NVG low level operations may be conducted down to 100 feet (50 feet on approved
   flight legs) obstacle clearance with sufficient available ambient illumination equivalent
   (approximately 5% moon disk) for operations using ANVIS, F-4949s or PNVGs. Even if the
   minimum illumination as stated above is available, the decision on whether there is sufficient
   available illumination to safely conduct NVG operations down to minimum altitudes rests
   entirely with the aircraft commander or flight lead.
      3.10.6.1. When sufficient available illumination is not available, the minimum altitude is
      500 feet AGL in non-mountainous areas and 500 feet AHO within 2 NM of course
      centerline in mountainous areas. Approaches should be accomplished with additional
      light sources (searchlight/LZ lighting). NOTE: For NVG VFR low level operations,
      mountainous areas are defined as areas where a 500-foot elevation change occurs within
      one-half NM.
   3.10.7. With the exception of terminal operations, the minimum altitude for night over water
   flight is 100 feet AWL.
   3.10.8. Helicopter Air to Air Refueling Altitudes. Air refueling training will be
   accomplished at a minimum of 1000 feet AGL. Training air refueling below 1000 feet AGL
   requires MAJCOM/A3/COMAFFOR approval.
      3.10.8.1. For additional employment procedures and techniques refer to AFTTP 3-3.HH-
      60G Combat Aircraft Fundamentals-H60G.
3.11. Minimum Equipment for NVG Operations:
   3.11.1. Operable Radar Altimeter at both pilot and copilot stations.
   3.11.2. NVG compatible cockpit lighting.
      3.11.2.1. Green/Blue chemlites are considered NVG compatible and may be used to
      augment lighting, or as backup lighting in the event of failed aircraft lighting. Chemlites
 20                                 AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


       should not be used as a routine practice to correct a problem where maintenance should
       be performed, except for operational missions.
       3.11.2.2. During overwater operations install low intensity chemlites over each exit and
       place a chemlite on all emergency egress window handles.
   3.11.3. At least one of the following: an operational IR landing light, IR searchlight, variable
   intensity searchlight, or FLIR.
   3.11.4. All primary crewmembers (pilot, copilot, FE, and AG) must wear approved NVGs.
   Do not fly with goggles that fail to meet the prescribed visual acuity standards.
3.12. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements:
   3.12.1. Overwater aircrew flight equipment (HABDs, life preservers, anti-exposure suits,
   and life rafts) are not required when overwater flight is limited to short distances during
   takeoff/landing and anytime the aircraft is within autorotational distance of land.
   Additionally, life rafts are not required when cover is provided by a boat or hoist equipped
   helicopter. Units will define covership responsibilities in AFI 11-2HH-60 Vol 3, Chapter 8.
   At a minimum, response times, radio contact procedures and loiter times will be defined.
   During all other overwater flights aircrew will wear HABDs, all occupants will wear life
   preservers, a life raft will be carried, and anti-exposure suits will be worn IAW AFI 11-
   301v1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program (ALS), and MAJCOM instructions. Battlefield
   Airmen and Special Operations Personnel are exempt from these requirements when wearing
   mission equipment and/or clothing that meets or exceeds protection afforded by standard
   aircrew flight equipment.
   3.12.2. Survival Vest Requirements. Helicopter crewmembers will wear survival
   vests/Load Bearing Vest (LBV) on all flights departing the local traffic pattern (N/A
   Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officers).
3.13. Tool Kits. The flight engineer will have a tool kit on board for all flights departing the
local traffic pattern. Individual units will establish requirements for tools to be included in these
kits. As a minimum, the kit will include enough tools to remove and install chip detector plugs.
Tool kits will have an inventory list for accountability and will be sealed. If the seal is broken,
the flight engineer will inventory the kit and sign the accountability list prior to the next flight.
3.14. Publication Kits. Units will maintain one publication kit per PAI aircraft (N/A for 58
SOW). Prior to departure, the aircraft commander or designated representative will ensure a
current kit is aboard the aircraft. Items duplicated in the kit need not be carried by crewmembers.
Publication kits are not required during FCFs as long as a flight manual is carried. Units will
tailor the contents of the kit to meet local requirements, and list these items in their local

   model number that is not listed in the current "Status Report on Medical Material Items
   Tested and Evaluated for use in the Aeromedical Evacuation System," Brooks AFB, TX
   78235. Authorization for medical material not listed in this report will be addressed to
   MAJCOM/A3/SG on an individual basis.
3.16. TOLD. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) will be completed and briefed prior to takeoff.
All computations on the TOLD card for takeoff will be annotated for initial takeoff. In-flight
computations will be the minimum required for the intended operations. TOLD will be
confirmed prior to initial landing to ensure operations are IAW para 4.16 of this instruction. The
HOPS features of PFPS may be used to compute TOLD. It is the Flight Engineer’s
responsibility for the accuracy of automated TOLD computed using HOPS.
3.17. Weight and Balance Documentation:
   3.17.1. Units will maintain a current weight and balance book for each assigned aircraft. As
   a minimum, the book will contain:
       3.17.1.1. Computed DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F –
       Transport, to reflect all missions. Canned DD Forms 365-4 are authorized.
       3.17.1.2. Equipment Weight Listing (list of commonly carried equipment).
       3.17.1.3. Standard Configuration Equipment Checklist and/or floor plan drawing.

   in the back of each aircraft AF FORM 781 folder.
   3.17.3. A new or corrected DD Form 365-4 need not be recomputed provided the initial
   takeoff gross weight (item 16) is not changed by more than 500 pounds. The flight engineer
   will compute in-flight crew/passenger/equipment movement to ensure CG limits are not
   exceeded. These computations will address the maximum number of personnel/equipment
   allowed in a specific compartment without exceeding CG limits. Although no written
   adjustments are required, the flight engineer will compute these changes and brief the aircraft
 22                               AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   commander of the new CG and TOLD requirements. These computations will be briefed
   during the crew/mission brief or during flight, as required.
   3.17.4. Use of the approved automated weight and balance system is authorized. Use the
   most current version of Automatic Weight and Balance System (AWBS) found at the
   following website: https://awbs.hill.af.mil

   a compartment/seat/position, their weight, and the compartment/arm/station.
   3.17.7. A crew member, normally the flight engineer, will verify basic weight and moment
   on the DD Form 365-4 matches the Chart C located on the aircraft. One copy of the
   completed DD Form 365-4 will be on the aircraft for the required mission.
3.18. Required Equipment/Aircraft Configuration:
   3.18.1. Reference AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, and
   MAJCOM supplement for Mission Essential Subsystems List (MESL). The MESL is
   maintained by the respective weapons system manager at HQ ACC/A4MWH.
   3.18.2. Aircraft will not be modified to secure, and/or install equipment, unless authorized
   by aircraft technical orders or DODI 5000-2 AF Sup 1, Operation of the Defense Acquisition
   System.
      3.18.2.1. Heli-Basket, Rescue Basket and Bambi Bucket are authorized when the crew is
      certified.
   3.18.3. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the
   Aircraft Commander. If one AC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment
   without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that AC, or a different AC, to
   subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. If the AC elects to operate
   with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements (e.g., revised
   departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.), prior to flight with the
   mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions.
   3.18.4. If a minor inflight AFCS malfunction occurs which can be isolated, the flight may be

   3.18.6. A hoist cable quick splice device and V-blade knife will be carried on all hoist
   equipped aircraft.
   3.18.7. Cargo/Equipment. Items requiring frequent access weighing less than 200 pounds
   may be secured with seat belts. Secure cargo/equipment items not requiring rapid removal
   during an aircraft or medical emergency. Reference TO 1H-60(H)G-5 for loading and
   restraint criteria.
3.19. Water Operations:
   3.19.1. Operable Radar Altimeter at both pilot and copilot stations are required for both day
   and NVG water operations.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                     23


   3.19.2. All required water hoist extraction devices will be on board, inspected, and readily
   accessible prior to low and slow deployments. Additionally, complete required rescue hoist
   checklists prior to final approach for hoist infiltrations or exfiltrations.
   3.19.3. Live water operations training (actual deployment of personnel) requires coverage by
   a boat, hoist equipped helicopter, helicopter capable of deploying PJs and/or a life raft or
   H/K/MC-130 rigged for deployment of MA-1 survival kit(s)/ RAMZ . Cover ship will
   maintain line of sight communications with the deploying helicopter at all times.
   3.19.4. Non-Live day water operations require a controlling agency (Coast Guard, ATC,
   Operations Desk, etc) to know the intended LAT/LONG for water operations, personnel on
   board and expected completion time prior to commencing. Line of sight communications is
   not required during actual water operations. Upon completion, the controlling agency will be
   contacted with your follow-on intentions. Non-live night water operations requires coverage
   by a boat, hoist equipped helicopter, helicopter capable of deploying PJs and/or a life raft, or

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. Checklists. Accomplish all Flight Manual checklists using the Challenge-Response (C-R)
method for normal checklist procedures, and the Challenge-Response/Response (C-R/R) for
emergency procedure checklists.
4.2. Equipment in the Cockpit. Ensure the area around and under both collective sticks is
clear of all items that may interfere with proper movement of the collective.
4.3. Passengers Occupying Crew Positions. Any passenger occupying a crew position will be
on intercom with all appropriate restraint devices worn. Passengers will not occupy a seat with
access to a set of flight controls.
4.4. Copilot Maneuvering Policy. The following maneuvers will only be performed for
training or currency by copilots under the supervision of a qualified instructor pilot at a set of
controls:
   4.4.1. Air Refueling Contacts. EXCEPTION: Copilots certified to perform contacts IAW
   AFI 11-2HH-60V1, HH-60, Aircrew Training, do not require instructor pilot supervision.
   Copilots may log currency with an aircraft commander while performing copilot duties.
4.5. Deployment of Non-USAF Personnel. Squadron/Deployed CC may authorize current
DoD AIE qualified personnel to deploy from aircraft under their control. The squadron
commander must ensure the personnel are qualified to perform the event, are fully briefed on,

   requirements dictate otherwise.
   4.7.3. Aircraft may operate in restricted areas and warning areas with reduced lighting; anti-
   collision, strobe lights, and position lights off (all lights off or in any combination) IAW AFI
   11-202V3, paragraph 5.17.1.
       4.7.3.1. FAA Exemption 5891B (Docket No FAA 2001-9618) allows two or more
       helicopters to operate with reduced lighting (position lights off or IR) while conducting
       NVG training at or below 500 feet AGL. Refer to: HQ ACC/A3TV CoP/Waivers for
       specifics of the waiver. NOTE: At least one aircraft in the flight must carry a visible
       strobe IAW FAA guidance.
       4.7.3.2. HH-60s not operating IAW paragraph 4.7.3.1 or in a warning/restricted area will
       operate with the following lighting configurations:
          4.7.3.2.1. Visible (non-IR) position lights and at least one strobe light that provides
          full 360-degree lighting.
          4.7.3.2.2. For formation flights, the lead aircraft will operate with overt or IR
          position lights on, as a minimum. Strobe lights usage is optional. The wingman or last
          aircraft in the formation will operate with position lights on, and at least one strobe
          light on which is visible for 360 degrees.

   passengers/MEGP through the safe approach zone.
   4.9.3. Rotors turning off and onload for crew changes are authorized. The new crew will
   review aircraft forms, weight and balance, asterisk items before takeoff items and TOLD.
4.10. Helicopter Maneuvering. Helicopter operations are limited to the maximum sustainable
bank angle for planned airspeed, except when conducting aircraft handling characteristics (AHC)
training, evasive maneuvering, emergency procedures training, or for tactical reasons when
altitude and airspeed allow recovery to a sustainable condition prior to reaching minimum
altitude. If at any time the aircraft exceeds the maximum sustainable angle of bank for the
current conditions, the pilot flying (or anyone else on the crew noticing the condition) must
announce "overbank" to the crew.
   4.10.1. For all flights, crews will brief blade stall and maximum sustainable bank angles for
   planned weights and airspeeds using applicable flight manual and energy maneuverability
   charts. If a pilot or copilot maneuvers beyond maximum sustainable bank angle (negative
   energy state), they must ensure they have the altitude/airspeed to prevent descent below the
   established minimum altitude.
4.11. AF FORM 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   4.11.1. Review the AFTO Form/AF FORM 781 before applying power to the aircraft or
   operating aircraft systems. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A
   maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian will sign the
   exceptional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the aircraft commander may
   sign the exceptional release. Ensure the AF FORM 1896, USAF Ground Fuel Identaplate,
   and a US Government Air Card are aboard the aircraft.
   4.11.2. Authority to Clear a Red X. The aircraft commander or flight engineer normally
   are not authorized to clear a Red X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a
   Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not available, the home station chief of
   maintenance may authorize the flight engineer to clear the Red X condition.
4.12. Aircraft Refueling. When not directly involved in the refueling operation, personnel will
remain at least 50 feet from the aircraft. (EXCEPTION: Approved hot
refueling/FARP/contingency operations). Do not taxi another aircraft within 50 feet of a
refueling operation.
   4.12.1. Aircrew members qualified in refueling may perform refueling duties. Flight
   engineers/aerial gunners used as refueling supervisors will comply with TO 00-25-172,
   Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. At bases with MAJCOM
   support, aircrews will not refuel except in isolated cases when maintenance support is not
   readily available and the mission would be delayed.

       time flight to a suitable location for corrective maintenance accessibility or to a location
       where communications can be established.
4.14. Fuel Dumping. Do not initiate fuel dumping except for life and death rescue missions,
operational missions, MAJCOM exercises or emergencies. Except during emergencies, or
operational needs dictate due to inability to climb due to threats or weather, fuel will not be
dumped below 3,000 feet AGL or over agricultural/populated areas.
4.15. Power Required. All primary flight crewmembers are required to know the power
margin for intended operations. Power available versus power required will be briefed prior to
final approach. For multiple approaches to the same area, power available/power required will
be briefed for the applicable AIE with the smallest power margin. Updates will be briefed if
gross weight or temperatures increase.
   4.15.1. Power required charts are based on having ground effect. Power figures will be
   computed using "without wind" charts for unknown or predicted site conditions.   NOTE
   Landing to a slope also affects power required due to loss of ground cushion and power
   margins should be considered.

     approach may be completed to a touchdown or a 10-foot hover. When terminating to a
     touchdown, ensure flight manual touchdown limits are not exceeded.
     4.20.3.12. Roll-on Landing. Use an entry airspeed no less than safe single engine
     airspeed or 70 KIAS if safe single engine airspeed is not available. Maximum touchdown
     speed is 60 knots ground speed.
32                               AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


     4.20.3.13. Practice Single-Engine Landing. Initiation of practice single-engine
     emergencies will not be lower than 300 feet AGL, 80 KIAS. NOTE 1: Practice single-
     engine emergencies may be initiated below the above listed altitude as long as torque
     available is limited on both engines versus reducing torque available on the simulated
     failed engine. Instructors must use caution when simulating single-engine emergencies at
     low altitudes and airspeeds. NOTE 2: When a throttle is retarded for simulated single-
     engine emergencies, the landing area should be a prepared sod, dry lakebed, or hard
     surface and should provide ample room for a roll-on landing.
        4.20.3.13.1. The following simulated single-engine maneuvers will be practiced by
        simulating a limited torque available on both engines versus reducing torque by actual
        throttle manipulation: single-engine air refueling and single-engine approaches to a
        spot (min-roll).
     4.20.3.14. Stabilator Malfunction. Do not initiate a stabilator malfunction when
     aircraft attitude is greater than 10o nose low. Do not exceed the flight manual stabilator
     placard limits when manually slewing the stabilator.
     4.20.3.15. Boost/SAS-OFF. Initiate on the ground or in straight and level flight at a
     minimum of 300 feet AGL and 80 KIAS.
     4.20.3.16. Electronic Control Unit (ECU)/Digital Electronic Control (DEC)
     Lockout. Initiate on the ground or in flight at a minimum of 300 feet AGL and 80 KIAS.
     4.20.3.17. Unusual Attitude Training. Instructors simulating unusual attitudes for
     training will not exceed 30 degrees of bank, 20 degree nose high attitude, 10 degree nose
     low attitude, nor initiate the maneuver below 1000 feet AGL (N/A for simulator training).
     4.20.3.18. Practice Autorotations. Accomplish IAW the flight manual and the
     following restrictions.
        4.20.3.18.1. The maneuver will terminate and a power recovery initiated at the first
        indication of abnormally high/low rotor RPM, excessive sink rate, low airspeed,
        ineffective flare, or at any time an inadvertent touchdown might occur.
        4.20.3.18.2. All practice autorotations will be terminated with a power recovery no
        lower than 15 feet AGL with a maximum ground speed of 30 knots.
        4.20.3.18.3. Practice autorotations require the aircraft to be aligned within 45 degrees
        of the wind direction when winds exceed 15 knots, at or below 15 knots, aircraft
        heading will be within 90 degrees of the wind.
        4.20.3.18.4. Do not practice autorotations in excess of 180 degrees when recovery
        will be below 500 feet AGL.
        4.20.3.18.5. Minimum entry altitude for 180-degree autorotations will be 800 feet
        AGL; 500 feet AGL for all others. The throttles will remain in fly. For all
        autorotations, the aircraft must be wings level, have a minimum of 80 KIAS, rotor
        RPM within limits, and be aligned for landing/recovery heading at no lower than 150
        feet. Initiate the flare between 125 and 75 feet AGL with a minimum of 80 KIAS. If
        any of these conditions are not met, initiate a power recovery immediately. The wings
        level requirement does not prohibit minor heading corrections on final.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                    33


       4.20.3.19. Low Altitude Autorotations (LAA).
           4.20.3.19.1. The primary training objectives of the Low Altitude Autorotation are to
           emphasize the immediate need to establish an autorotative profile in a tactical regime,
           and to demonstrate limited aircraft maneuvering ability at low altitudes during
           autorotations.
              4.20.3.19.1.1. Conduct LAA in accordance with the restrictions established in
              4.21.3.18 and the following:
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.1. Left scanner, low-level check, and use of VAWS are not
                  required.
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.2. Descent from normal pattern altitudes to LAA pattern
                  altitudes no earlier than abeam the intended autorotation target point.
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.3. Minimum entry airspeed of 80 KIAS and rotor RPM within
                  limits.
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.4. Maximum offset angle should not exceed 30 degrees from
                  the intended landing area.
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.5. Minimum entry altitude is 100’ AGL.
                  4.20.3.19.1.1.6. When LAA entry altitude is between 125-100’ AGL, initiate
                  the maneuver by smoothly reducing the collective to full down while
                  simultaneously adjusting the cyclic to establish a nose-up attitude.
4.21. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC). Aircraft Handling Characteristics maneuvers
are designed to familiarize the aircrew with aircraft performance and limitations. The maneuvers
accomplished on the AHC sortie should be performed together as a portion of the overall sortie
or on a dedicated sortie. Selective maneuvers should be performed as a warm-up prior to low-
level operations. See AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, HH-60G for detailed
descriptions of each AHC maneuver.
   4.21.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics Maneuvers General Guidance. Except as noted
   below, all maneuvers will be entered from a minimum of 1000 feet AGL, at chart or cruise
   airspeed, and the recovery completed above 500 feet AGL.
       4.21.1.1. Pitch Up. Enter at a fixed cruise power setting at a minimum of 500 feet AGL.
       4.21.1.2. Pitch Down. Enter from straight and level flight at 60-80 KIAS and at a
       minimum altitude of 1500 feet AGL.
       4.21.1.3. Overbank. Enter at a minimum altitude of 1500 feet AGL.
       4.21.1.4. Two Step Climbing Turn. Enter at a minimum altitude of 500 feet AGL.
       4.21.1.5. Low-Level AHC maneuvers will be initiated at a minimum of 100 feet AHO,
       and recovered no lower than 100 feet AHO, except for quickstop (low-level deceleration)
       maneuvers.
           4.21.1.5.1. Initiate quickstops at a minimum of 80 KIAS and 50 feet AHO.
           Terminate quickstop maneuvers no lower than 50 feet AHO, and at no time will any
           part of the helicopter be below 50 feet AHO.
 34                              AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


         4.21.1.5.2. Quickstop training will only be accomplished to open prepared surfaces
         (runway or taxiway), or surveyed LZs. OGE hover power + 5% power is required for
         low-level quickstops. Pilots will not perform this maneuver with a tail wind condition
         of greater than 10 knots.
   4.21.2. Airspeed for onset of blade stall must be computed using the chart in TO 1H-
   60(H)G-1, Flight Manual USAF Series HH-60G Helicopters. AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G energy
   maneuvering charts may be used for all other computations.
4.22. Shipboard Operations. Units authorized by their MAJCOM to perform shipboard
operations will qualify crews IAW AFI 11-2HH-60, Vol 1, and the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Navy and the Departments of the Army and
the Air Force. Conduct Operations IAW Joint Pub 3-04 and AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G.

                                            Chapter 6

                       COMBAT RESCUE/MISSION OPERATIONS

6.1. Low-Level Operations:
   6.1.1. Evasive maneuvers will be performed IAW AFTTP 3-1.HH-60G, Combat Aircraft
   Fundamentals, HH-60G . Training rules (TR’s) and maneuvering category will be IAW AFI
   11-214.
       6.1.1.1. Enroute evasive maneuver training will not be conducted below 100 feet AHO.
       6.1.1.2. Aircrew will make crew advisory calls prior to all turns, and will continuously
       clear the flight path throughout the turn.
       6.1.1.3. Prior to making a break call ensure the aircraft is cleared in the direction of turn.
       If a break is required to the opposite side of the scanner calling the break, the opposite
       scanner is responsible for immediately clearing the aircraft and calling ―CLEAR
       RIGHT/LEFT‖ or ―STOP TURN.‖
       6.1.1.4. Flight Lead/Aircraft Commanders are responsible for ensuring that planned
       evasive maneuver training takes into account aircraft performance, environmental
       conditions, formation spacing, and crew/flight experience.
       6.1.1.5. Simulated ground fire in the LZ is permitted from the ground or at a minimum of
       10 foot hover. Crews will ensure compliance IAW para 6.1.1.4 of this AFI.
   6.1.2. Unknown Position. During training, if unable to establish aircraft position, climb to a
   safe altitude and reorient your position before resuming low level navigation.
   6.1.3. Tactical low-level approaches will only be flown during tactical training missions and
   operational missions. Conduct combat rescue terminal operations IAW AFTTP 3-1.HH-60G.
   6.1.4. Low Level Checklist and FENCE Check. Crews will accomplish the 11-2HH-
   60V3, CL-1, Low Level Checklist prior to conducting low-level operations. FENCE checks
   will be performed at the appropriate times during the mission.
   6.1.5. Map annotations. As a minimum annotate course line, waypoints, hazards, MSA, and
   threats.
   6.1.6. Pilots will ensure scanners and deploying personnel are updated on the status of the
   flight, and advised of events that impact the mission and their duties. As a minimum, the
   pilot should alert scanners and deploying personnel at 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and
   1 minute prior to the objective.
6.2. Formations. See AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G for formation positions and definitions. The
minimum separation between the closest portions of any two helicopters in a formation is one
rotor diameter. Maximum formation separation is based on environmental conditions, visibility,
illumination, crew experience, threat situation, and mission requirements. Refer to paragraph 6.3
for further formation separation restrictions. Rotor disk (RD) separation will be based on the
largest rotor disk diameter.
6.3. Formation Maneuvering. There are eleven basic Tactical Formation Maneuvers (TFM)
aircrews may employ: break, shackle, check, split, dig, hook, tac, cross, pinch, cover, and center.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                   37


See AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G for maneuver performance and description. TFM should not be
conducted from the echelon position.
   6.3.1. Tactical Formation Maneuvering Restrictions. The following restrictions will be
   adhered to when conducting TFM:
      6.3.1.1. When flying in formation with less than 3-rotor disks separation, the only
      authorized Tactical Formation Maneuvers are: shackle, split, cover, and dig.
      6.3.1.2. Center and cross turns will not be accomplished at night.
   6.3.2. NVG Formation and Maneuvering Restrictions. Restrictions are defined in terms
   of the effective available illumination. Low illumination is defined as less than 10%
   equivalent moon illumination. Medium illumination is defined as 10-40% equivalent moon
   illumination. High illumination is defined as above 40% equivalent moon illumination. The
   restrictions in the following paragraphs assume ideal training conditions and aircrew
   proficiency with the maneuvers listed.
      6.3.2.1. En Route. The formations and formation separation restrictions below apply
      when relying on visual means to ensure aircraft deconfliction and determining formation
      aspect and closure rates relative to the other aircraft. En Route formation spacing and
      aspect angle may be increased beyond the below restrictions as long as non-visual means
      are used to ensure aircraft separation/deconfliction. Altitude splits, TACAN, and
      geographic or timing separation are all means that can be used to ensure deconfliction.
      Flight leads are ultimately responsible for ensuring the conditions are appropriate for the
      planned formation spacing/maneuvering and a deconfliction plan is briefed. Aircrews
      will limit maneuvering at night while over featureless terrain or water since the visual
      cues required for safe maneuvering are dramatically reduced. When conducting basic
      tactical maneuvering at night, formation lead will specify roll out headings during break,
      split, hook, and tac turns.
          6.3.2.1.1. The restrictions for low effective illumination are:
             6.3.2.1.1.1. Aircraft separation of 1-3 rotor disks unless additional non-visual
             forms of separation are utilized.
             6.3.2.1.1.2. Maximum angle offset of 30° left or right except during refueling in
             echelon formation.
             6.3.2.1.1.3. Maneuvering based on staggered and fluid trail formations.
          6.3.2.1.2. The restrictions for medium effective illumination are:
             6.3.2.1.2.1. Aircraft separation 1-10 rotor disks unless additional non-visual
             forms of separation are utilized.
             6.3.2.1.2.2. Maximum angle offset of 45° left or right.
             6.3.2.1.2.3. Maneuvering based on staggered and fluid trail formations.
          6.3.2.1.3. The restrictions for high effective illumination are:
             6.3.2.1.3.1. Minimum aircraft separation is 1 rotor disk. The maximum separation
             is based on environmental conditions, crew experience, threat situation, and
             mission requirements. Maneuver IAW AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G
 38                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


6.4. Dissimilar Formation. Formation flights with dissimilar aircraft are authorized when all
participating crewmembers are briefed and thoroughly familiar with the other aircraft's
performance and tactics. Rotor disk separation is based on the largest rotor disk diameter.
MAJCOM/A3/COMAFFOR approval is required to fly formation with non-NATO, civilian and
Heritage/Historic aircraft.
6.5. Communication. Formation flight will not be initiated without positive radio
communications capability. Whenever possible, conduct a communication check of all aircraft in
the formation prior to takeoff.
6.6. Taxi. Aircraft will taxi with a minimum of 100 feet spacing from main rotor to tail rotor.
6.7. Turning Rejoins. Maximum angle of bank at night is 20o.
6.8. Night Formation. NVGs are the primary method of conducting night formation. Unaided
night formation should only be accomplished when environmental conditions preclude the use of
NVGs. Unaided formation light settings must be adjusted to provide sufficient illumination and
visual references for all aircraft in the formation.
6.9. Changing Formation. Unless briefed otherwise, Formation Lead will direct and chalk two
will set the formation. Lead changes should only be directed by Flight Lead.
6.10. Water Operations:
   6.10.1. During NVG water operations do not exceed 30o bank angle when below 100 ft
   AWL.
   6.10.2. Water patterns:
       6.10.2.1. Initiate climbing turns at a minimum of translational lift airspeed and 50 feet
       AWL. Do not descend below 50 feet AWL until established on final.
       6.10.2.2. Low and slow maximum altitude is 10 feet AWL, and the maximum ground
       speed is 10 knots. WARNING: Wave height/action can make it difficult for aircrew to
       maintain low and slow parameters, and momentary deviations should be expected.
       Altitude and ground speeds exceeding 10 feet and 10 knots increase the potential for
       injuring a swimmer, and altitudes below 10 feet increase the potential of the aircraft
       contacting the water. When conditions make it difficult to maintain safe parameters, the
       aircraft commander should evaluate mission urgency and consider other methods of
       swimmer deployment--such as a fast rope or hoist.
       6.10.2.3. If swimmer deployment is not required, make the observation pass above
       translational lift at a minimum of 25 feet AWL.
       6.10.2.4. When conducting NVG Water operations ensure all crewmembers have
       adequate visual references to assess aircraft position, altitude, and ground speed/drift.
       Any crewmember that loses visual references will immediately bring it to the attention of
       the rest of the crew. Except during terminal operations maintain a minimum of 50 KIAS.
6.11. Mission Essential Personnel Loading/Off Loading:
   6.11.1. Personnel will have weapons pointed down and safetied, and radio antennas
   collapsed prior to entering the rotor plane. They should enter the rotor plane area only when
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                     39


   cleared by a crewmember and should always enter from the sides of the helicopter (3/9
   O’clock when obstacle clearance permits).
   6.11.2. Once the aircraft has completed the approach to a hover or landing (as briefed), or
   when cleared by the Aircraft Commander, the restraint devices may be released. Exit only
   when cleared by the aircraft commander.
6.12. General AIE Procedures (Fast Rope, Rappel, Rope Ladder, Hoist):
   6.12.1. Mission Briefing. Prior to deployment, the aircraft commander will ensure the
   applicable items from the alternate insertion/extraction briefing in Attachment 2 are
   completed for the device to be used.
   6.12.2. Safetyman. For all AIE operations, one crewmember in the cabin will be designated
   as the safetyman. The safetyman will monitor intercom and be secured with a crewman's
   harness. The safetyman will be in a position to observe the entire operation, and will relay
   commands to the deploying team. The safetyman will continuously evaluate the safety of the
   operation, and immediately inform the rest of the crew, and take the necessary action to avert
   a hazardous situation.
   6.12.3. Rope Master. The rope master is the deploying team leader, and is responsible for
   making the final determination on the safety of the deployment. During operations where the
   rope master cannot safely determine operational parameters (aircraft altitude, drift, obstacles,
   and rope position), the rope master will coordinate with the safetyman for assistance.
   6.12.4. During AIE operations, all personnel will ensure that non-essential equipment,
   and/or personnel, do not interfere with the deployment operations.
   6.12.5. Deployment Procedures:
      6.12.5.1. During all AIE operations, the pilot flying the approach will give the command
      "ROPES, ROPES, ROPES" when the aircraft is in a position to safely deploy the device
      and the team. This is the pilot’s clearance for the team to deploy. The device will be
      deployed on the first command "Ropes."
      6.12.5.2. Following the pilot’s clearance for the team to deploy and during operations
      where the rope master can safely determine operational parameters, the team will deploy
      at the discretion of the rope master.
      6.12.5.3. During operations where the rope master cannot safely determine operational
      parameters (aircraft altitude, drift, obstacles, and rope position), the safety man will
      evaluate parameters and advise the rope master when, in the judgment of the safety man,
      the operation can safely be conducted. The final decision to deploy the team remains with
      the rope master. WARNING: Altitude deviations while personnel are on the ropes will
      have an adverse effect on their braking ability and can cause serious injury. During the
      hover, scanners must relay sufficient information to the pilots to ensure the ropes do not
      leave the ground during altitude deviations.
   6.12.6. During NVG operations the safetyman must ensure the rope master can see the
   appropriate hand signals.
   6.12.7. Ropes will be released or retrieved prior to commencing forward flight to prevent
   possible entanglement.
 40                                 AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   6.12.8. During night deployments, chemlites will be used to identify all ropes. During night
   water deployments, additional chemlites will be placed over all exits and on release handles
   to facilitate egressing the helicopter.
6.13. Fast Rope:
   6.13.1. If the H-bar/FRIES is used it will be extended and locked prior to final approach.
   6.13.2. If requested by the deploying rope master, the aircraft may have a maximum forward
   ground speed of 5 kts.
6.14. Rappelling:
   6.14.1. The rappelling ropes will be attached to the cabin ceiling rappel rings, upper cargo
   net attaching points, or the H-Bar/FRIES release mechanism using locking carabineers with
   minimum force criteria of 5000 pounds or 23 kN. The H-Bar/FRIES should be extended
   when the release mechanism is being used to perform rappelling operations to aid in release
   mechanism operation.
   6.14.2. Once hooked to the rappelling equipment, personnel may release other restraints in
   preparation for the exit. On short final, personnel may position themselves to facilitate
   immediate deployment.
6.15. Rope Ladder Operations: WARNING: Use only certified rope ladders for live training.
   6.15.1. The rope ladders will be attached to the cabin floor tiedown fittings or cabin ceiling
   rappel rings using locking carabineers.
   6.15.2. The maximum number of personnel on a ladder is limited to three.
   6.15.3. In an emergency, or if the aircraft comes under fire, personnel will secure themselves
   to the ladder and the aircraft may depart the immediate area. Slow forward flight to a safe
   area may be accomplished if flight characteristics and power requirements allow. Care
   should be taken during forward flight due to the twisting and turning of the ladder. Airspeed
   should not exceed 40 KIAS. See WARNING paragraph 3.20 for additional guidance.
   6.15.4. If mission conditions permit, close the cabin door not being used for recoveries prior
   to personnel entering the aircraft.
6.16. Hoist Procedures: WARNING: Failure to properly inspect, monitor, and report hoist
and/or cable deficiencies may result in undetected cable damage that could result in cable failure.
All aircrew must thoroughly understand and comply with TO 1H-60(H)G-1 and MAJCOM hoist
operating procedures/limitations.
   6.16.1. Commanders will ensure live hoist operations are limited to operational missions,
   aircrew qualification/evaluations, exercises, and proficiency training. Crews will evaluate the
   potential hazards associated with live hoist operations, and consider all recovery options
   during operational missions and exercises.
   6.16.2. Hoist Operator Procedures:
       6.16.2.1. All crewmembers must be vigilant for shock loads to the cable. If shock
       loading is observed, cease live hoist operations and replace the cable prior to the next
       mission. NOTE: During water operations, the dynamic action of waves increases the
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                    41


      potential for shock loading. Additionally, the increased drag of the stokes litter/personnel
      in the water increases the total force applied to the cable.
      6.16.2.2. During live hoist operations, if the cable contacts the aircraft, operations will
      cease until a visual check of the cable is complete and no defects are noted.
      6.16.2.3. Do not ground the hoist near spilled fuel.
      6.16.2.4. Except during water recoveries, lower the stokes litter to the survivor after the
      helicopter is established in a hover. For water recoveries, the stokes litter may be
      deployed utilizing low and slow deployment procedures.
          6.16.2.4.1. The stokes litter will only be lowered and raised with the hoist from a
          stabilized hover over the intended target. A maximum airspeed of 40 KIAS may be
          used with the stokes deployed to stop a swinging or rotating litter during an
          emergency, or to maintain position in high winds or over a moving vessel. During
          actual rescue missions, accomplish a thorough risk assessment if speeds in excess of
          40 KIAS are required during stokes use, particularly when the stokes is empty.
      6.16.2.5. The rescue basket may be lowered on final approach at airspeeds below 30
      knots. While in slow forward flight for a water recovery, the 10-foot line may be allowed
      to contact the water prior to reaching the survivor.
      6.16.2.6. Use of a tagline with the SKEDCO liter is mandatory.
      6.16.2.7. If mission conditions permit, close the left cabin door prior to conducting live
      hoists.
6.17. Parachute Delivery Operations:
   6.17.1. Mission Briefing. A thorough briefing will be conducted. All aircrew members and
   the jumpmaster will attend. Ensure the briefing covers the use of restraining devices, exits,
   and movement in cargo compartment. When conducting operations with jumpers from other
   services, the procedures outlined in this instruction and FM 3-21.220/AFMAN 11-420, Static
   Line Parachuting Techniques and Tactics and AFMAN 11-411, Special Forces Military Free-
   Fall Operations will be used unless different procedures are authorized by the MAJCOM.
   6.17.2. Personnel will exit the aircraft on command of a qualified jumpmaster, after
   clearance is received from the aircraft commander. The primary exit for parachute operations
   is the left door.
   6.17.3. Abort Procedures. When conditions are not safe for the drop, or if the drop is
   aborted for any reason, the following procedures will apply: The term "Abort" will be used to
   alert the crew of an aborted deployment. A crewmember will display a closed fist to
   personnel not on intercom.
   6.17.4. The minimum pattern altitude is 1500 feet AGL/AWL. Specific airspeed must be
   briefed prior to takeoff.
   6.17.5. Static lines will not be attached until the aircraft is 1000 feet AGL/AWL.
   6.17.6. When delivering parachutists from only one side, ensure the door on the opposite
   side of the cabin is closed.
 42                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   6.17.7. The pilot will give 10-minute, 5-minute, and 1-minute warnings prior to reaching the
   drop zone. The pilot will call 1 minute prior to drop and will announce "clear to drop" after
   he receives the response "safetyman check completed." The final decision on whether or not
   to jump rests with the aircraft commander. The jumpmaster will acknowledge all calls from
   the pilot.
6.18. Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) Training. Helicopter air combat maneuvering
training against fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft is authorized. Training will be conducted
IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1, AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-1/3-3.HH-60G, and the following:
   6.18.1. All crewmembers must be trained and current in Aircraft Handling Characteristics
   and Basic Helicopter Maneuvering IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1.
   6.18.2. Maneuvering restricted to the Limited Maneuvering Category as described in AFI
   11-214 may be conducted by all combat mission qualified H-60 crews.
   6.18.3. Maneuvering beyond the Limited Maneuvering Category restrictions of AFI 11-214
   may only be conducted when an instructor certified in ACM is in command of the flight, or
   the entire crew has received initial ACM training and certification IAW AFI 11-2HH-60V1.
   6.18.4. All visual NVG air-to-air training requires a discernable horizon.
6.19. Weapons Employment:
   6.19.1. Units will ensure that weapon systems employment procedures and training
   standards are included in the unit weapons and tactics training program. Refer to AFI 11-214,
   AFTTP 3-1.HH-60G, AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G, and local range procedures/restrictions for
   guidance. Units will ensure that detailed local weapons procedures are included in their local
   Chapter 8.
6.20. Reduced Visibility Approaches/Departures: Refer to AFTTP 3-3.HH-60G, Combat
Aircraft Fundamentals, HH-60G for techniques and procedures.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                      43


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. Blind Procedures. Use the following procedures when                    one   or   more   flight
members/elements lose visual contact within the formation in VMC:
   7.1.1. Two conditions may result in the formation losing visual contact:
      7.1.1.1. An Anticipated Blind is when terrain/environmental factors cause a loss of
      visual cues for a short duration or when visual cues are lost when using pre-coordinated
      non-visual station keeping that provides sufficient SA to ensure deconfliction. Examples:
      Holding one aircraft in terrain while the other unmasks for line of sight to the survivor;
      Crews see terrain that will come between the formation; Using non-visual means to
      maintain aircraft separation.
      7.1.1.2. An Unanticipated Blind situation is when visual cues are the sole references used
      for formation separation and these cues no longer provide sufficient distance, aspect or
      closure rate cues to ensure deconfliction, or when non-visual methods do not provide
      sufficient SA to ensure positive deconfliction. Examples: The wingman loses lead in
      ground lights or while maneuvering independently such as during evasive maneuvering.
   7.1.2. Anticipated Blind Procedures:
      7.1.2.1. If any flight member/element calls "Blind," then the other flight
      member/element will immediately acknowledge with "Visual" and an informative
      position call or acknowledge with ―Blind‖.
      7.1.2.2. Flight lead will direct the prebriefed deconfliction plan.
   7.1.3. Unanticipated Blind Procedures:
      7.1.3.1. If any flight member/element calls "Blind," then the other flight
      member/element will immediately acknowledge with "Visual" and an informative
      position call or acknowledge with ―Blind‖.
      7.1.3.2. If the other flight member/element is also "Blind", then the flight lead will take
      action to ensure separation between flight members/elements. When unable to ensure
      separation using non-visual means, flight lead will direct an altitude separation of at least
      200 feet. The flight lead will specify either AGL or MSL when directing the formation to
      deconflict with altitude. Climbs/ descents through the deconfliction altitude should be
      avoided if possible.
   7.1.4. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind" call, then the flight
   member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known position of the
   other flight member/element and alter altitude if unable to ensure aircraft separation by non-
   visual means.
   7.1.5. If visual contact is not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to
   ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a Terminate/Knock-It-Off if
   necessary. Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks must be
   considered.
 44                                 AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


   7.1.6. When using visual cues as the sole means of ensuring aircraft separation, the
   formation will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained or non-visual separation
   methods are coordinated.
7.2. Lost Wingman Procedures. When a wingman goes inadvertent IMC and loses sight of the
preceding aircraft, all members of the formation must react quickly and precisely to prevent a
midair collision. In such a case, the aircraft losing contact will call, "Call Sign, Position, Lost
Wingman." Formation lead will immediately initiate the breakup by announcing "Call Sign,
Execute," the type of breakup (i.e. mountainous or non-mountainous) unless prebriefed, base
―heading‖ (magnetic), base ―airspeed‖, and base ―Minimum Safe Altitude‖ (MSA). Formation
lead will maintain base parameters and all wingmen will take action based on the base heading,
airspeed and MSA. Wingmen will acknowledge lead's call. Once the formation executes the IMC
breakup, lead will announce or brief any changes to magnetic headings, airspeed, and MSA.
   7.2.1. If another aircraft in the formation calls lost wingman and you still have sight of the
   preceding aircraft, maintain formation position on that aircraft. If you then lose sight of the
   preceding aircraft, execute lost wingman procedures for your original position in the
   formation.
   7.2.2. If a wingman calls lost wingman and lead is still VMC and able to ensure
   terrain/obstacle clearance, lead should stay VMC. Formation lead must still make heading,
   airspeed, and MSA calls for the wingman executing the lost wingman procedure.
   7.2.3. Non-Mountainous Procedures. The following lost wingman procedures are for non-
   mountainous operations (Figure 7.1). In operational situations, where the risk of actual
   enemy detection/engagement is greater than low altitude marginal weather operations,
   alternate breakup procedures may be briefed/executed.
       7.2.3.1. Formation lead maintains base heading (usually straight-ahead), airspeed, and
       climbs to MSA.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                 45


Figure 7.1. Non-Mountainous Procedures.




      7.2.3.2. Wingmen turn away from the preceding aircraft and climb according to the
      following procedure: multiply your position by 10o for your heading offset, lead aircraft
      will climb to MSA, Chalk 2 will climb to MSA plus 300, Chalk 3 will climb to MSA plus
      600 feet, Chalk 4 will climb to MSA plus 900 feet, etc. Timing for all wingmen is 30
      seconds and starts when you reach your altitude. At the end of your timing, return to the
      announced heading.
   7.2.4. Mountainous Procedures. The following lost wingman procedures are for
   mountainous operations (Figure 7.2). In operational situations, where the risk of actual
   enemy detection/engagement is greater than low altitude marginal weather operations,
   alternate breakup procedures may be briefed/ executed.
      7.2.4.1. Formation lead will maintain announced base airspeed or higher and climb as
      prebriefed. If possible, lead should accelerate to allow the formation more maneuvering
      room and to avoid excessively slow airspeeds for wingmen.
 46                              AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


      7.2.4.2. Aircraft number two will adjust to maintain announced airspeed minus 10 knots,
      and climb 300 feet above MSA.
      7.2.4.3. Aircraft number three will adjust to maintain announced airspeed minus 20
      knots, and climb 600 feet above MSA.
      7.2.4.4. Aircraft number four will adjust to maintain announced airspeed minus 30 knots,
      and climb 900 feet above MSA.
      7.2.4.5. As each aircraft reaches its assigned altitude, maintain heading and assigned
      airspeed for 3 minutes, then accelerate to a base airspeed.

                                            Chapter 8

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. Requirements. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. Procedures
herein will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in this instruction, nor is this
chapter intended to be a single source document for procedures contained in other directives or
instructions. Unnecessary repetition of guidance provided in other established directives should
be avoided; however, references to those directives is acceptable when it serves to facilitate
location of information necessary for local operating procedures. The title of this supplement will
be IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, (e.g., "AFI 11-2HH-
60V3_41RQS"). Follow instructions on page 1 of this volume for approval/distribution of
supplements. Individual squadron Local Operating Procedures are required for all HH-60 units.
If more than one HH-60 squadron is co-located at the same installation, only one Chapter 8 is
required but all Squadron Commanders must approve and gain approval through their
appropriate chains of command.
8.2. Organization. The local chapter will be organized in the following format and will
include, but is not limited to, the following:
   8.2.1. Introduction.
   8.2.1. (920RQW) The purpose of this chapter is to describe local operating procedures.
   Directives contained within this chapter are not intended to either supersede other AFI
   guidance, or relieve aircrew from using sound judgment and common sense.
   8.2.2. General Policy.
   8.2.2. (920RQW) All aircrew are responsible for ensuring they maintain qualified, current
   and mission ready status. Deviations to the following guidelines must be coordinated and
   approved by the unit Director of Operations Officer (DO) or Commander (CC).
       8.2.2.1. (Added-920RQW) Scheduling
           8.2.2.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Priorities: Scheduling priorities are listed in order of
           precedence from highest to lowest: SAR, 45 SW Range Support, Regain Combat
           Mission Ready (CMR) Status, Evaluation, Formal Upgrade Training, Continuation
           Training, and Media Events (to include Air Shows).
           8.2.2.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Individual Availability: To maintain currency, CMR,
           Rated Aircrew Program (RAP) look-back and a level of proficiency, aircrew
           members are required to provide the squadron with minimum amounts of flight
           availability each month. Crewmember minimum availability is maintained within the
           301 RQS Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) under scheduling as directed by the
           Commander. Availability worksheets are due by the 24th of each month.
           Availability of Traditional Reservists (TR) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) will
           be calculated against Rated Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking and Flying Hour
           Program. Each aircrew member will review their currency status and ensure
           schedulers are providing them ample opportunity to maintain currency, CMR status
           and increase availability during in-unit upgrades.
48                                AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


         8.2.2.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Within two workdays of the 22nd of each month,
         301RQS/DO will produce a monthly schedule outlining key events. In addition, they
         will produce a completed two-week rolling schedule. The monthly/rolling two-week
         schedule is available for member’s review via Patriot Excalibur (PEX). The 920th
         Wing Commander approves the finalized weekly flying schedule at 1400 on Friday
         proceeding the upcoming week. DOS will ensure the Wing’s final schedule is posted
         to PEX and distributed via e-mail. Changes after this schedule is finalized will be
         coordinated with the affected members via phone or e-mail by the schedulers.
         8.2.2.1.4. (Added-920RQW) For recurring evaluations, each aircrew member
         should ensure that they make every effort to complete all flight evaluation requisites
         prior to the end of their fourth month in phase. It is incumbent upon each individual
         to ensure that they are scheduled for their flight evaluation prior to the end of the fifth
         month in their phase period. Evaluations to include No-notices can be scheduled
         within the member’s availability without member coordination.
     8.2.2.2. (Added-920RQW) Aircrew desiring to reschedule their UTA must start
     coordination with 301 RQS/DOT two (2) weeks prior, but no later than one (1) week
     prior to the scheduled UTA. DOT will complete the reschedule worksheet with
     coordination through scheduling, Stan/Eval, and supervision. Members will be notified
     NLT the Wednesday prior to the UTA of the status of their reschedule request.
     Reschedule requests within 1 week of UTA will be dealt with on an individual basis and
     must first be approved by 301 RQS/DO/CC.
  8.2.3. Mission Planning/Preparation.
  8.2.3. (920RQW) All aircrew are responsible to ensure thorough and detailed mission
  planning is accomplished prior to every flight. Refer to 301 RQS Standard Operating
  Procedures (SOP) to assist in accomplishment of mission planning.
     8.2.3.1. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Commander (AC) Responsibilities.
         8.2.3.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Commanders will ensure that all GO/NO-GO
         requirements (FCIF, Boldface, flight Physical, Alt Chamber, Egress and basic
         currency) are ―GO‖ prior to stepping to the aircraft. Any changes to the flight orders,
         to include adding new crewmembers, will also be ―GO.‖ All currency dates may be
         checked by either referring to PEX, the 301st training site, GO/NO-GO flying
         currency product furnished by Flight Management contained within the Mission
         Folder, or by referring to the latest currency products posted in the Rescue Operations
         Center (ROC). Regardless of the method, aircrew should insure they are using
         current products. As a last resort to ensure FCIF review, aircrew members can initial
         Flight Authorization by annotation of FCIF number on the same line as their name
         appears. Aircraft Commanders will initial Flight Authorization (FA) to verify
         crewmembers are current and qualified for the mission (and mission tasks). A
         signature is required for all crewmembers added to the printed FA.
         8.2.3.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Commanders and Flight Leads should review
         all crew members’ currency to ensure all necessary training is accomplished.
         Additionally, instructors should review initial qualification or certification syllabus
         when beginning to mission plan to ensure all training events are accomplished. Flight
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                      49


       Engineer, Aerial Gunner instructors, and Pararescue trainers should inform the A/C or
       FL of training requirements one day prior to ensure adequate planning time.
       8.2.3.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft Commanders are responsible to ensure that
       any mission requiring a mission identifier (MI) is executed in accordance with higher
       headquarters guidance. These responsibilities are outlined in AFRCI11-201, FLIGHT
       INFORMATION PUBLICATIONS, and include but are not limited to opening/closing
       the MI, updating the MI, and coordinating changes to an MI. MI’s can be opened and
       closed by 920 RQW/45 SW Combined CP by radio transmission or telephone call.
       MIs are required for the following type missions:
           8.2.3.1.3.1. (Added-920RQW) Landings away from home station, except at
           local training bases when no RON is planned.

           201 Flying Operations Procedures
           8.2.3.1.3.6. (Added-920RQW) Special tasking or high interest missions (such as
           Range Mission and Shuttle support).
       8.2.3.1.4. (Added-920RQW) ACs must insure any passengers, guest aircrew, or
       mission essential personnel (MEGP) flying on unit aircraft have been properly
       authorized by the appropriate authority.
           8.2.3.1.4.1. (Added-920RQW) Any individual flying as a passenger must be
           approved in accordance with AFI 11-401 and the appropriate supplements.
           Additionally, the flight will be conducted IAW AFI 11-2HH-60, V3.
           8.2.3.1.4.2. (Added-920RQW) IAW AFI 11-2HH-60, V3 the Group
           Commander is the approval authority for mission essential authorization. Crew
           chiefs accomplishing functional test flights and unit assigned personnel acting as
           survivors will be typically authorized as MEGPs.
           8.2.3.1.4.3. (Added-920RQW) Visiting aircrew. Aircrew not assigned to the
           unit and flying unit assigned aircraft will go through the same GO/NO-GO
           process as assigned aircrew. They will annotate FCIF accomplishment by
           initialing by their name on the flight order. They will hand carry a copy of
           individual training summary (ITS) and individual data summary (IDS). Without
           ITS and IDS the individual must supply copies of AF 1042 (Medical Clearance),
           AF 702 (Altitude Chamber), Aeronautical Orders (AO) and individual training
           reports to show currencies.
       8.2.3.1.5. (Added-920RQW) Operational Risk Assessment. Aircraft Commanders
       and flight leads must accomplish a comprehensive review of the operational risk for
       each flight. Flight briefs will include the significant risk factors, assessed level of risk,
50                              AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


        and a mitigation plan. The Risk Assessment Worksheet can be used to help guide the
        aircrew in the identification of hazards and weigh the risk of the mission plan.
        Aircraft Commanders will complete a 301 RQS Risk Assessment Worksheet for each
        Flight and turn that copy into the Operations Supervisor prior to the crew stepping to
        the aircraft.
           8.2.3.1.5.1. (Added-920RQW) Hazards.
               8.2.3.1.5.1.1. (Added-920RQW) During flight, all observed hazards will be
               checked against the chart (printed or electronic). If new hazards are observed,
               record the lat/long, height (Above Ground Level (AGL) & Mean Sea Level
               (MSL)), and a description of the hazard. Notify Flight Safety (301 RQS/SE)
               or 301 RQS/DOV of the hazard and they will be responsible for updating the
               local area hazards map and Manual; Chart Updating Manual (CHUM.)
               NOTE: Bulb replacement of lighted antennas and towers now include light
               emitting diodes (LEDs) which can be Night Vision Goggle (NVG)
               compatible.      This effectively makes lighting appear OFF and the
               tower/antenna difficult to visually acquire. If possible, annotate if the hazard
               appears in this manner using unaided vision. Safety and Standard Evaluation
               should post hazard to draw attention to the hazard.
               8.2.3.1.5.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Bristow Academy, Titusville, uses the
               Northern area for student training. Aircrews should monitor 121.95 Bristow
               Operations Frequency (Ops Freq) to maintain Situational Awareness (SA) on
               traffic in the area. While operating in the Northern remote sites located in the
               Tocohatchee State Reserve, should aircrew need to contact Park Service
               helicopters they should utilize 32.375 FM. Park rangers do not routinely
               monitor this frequency, but they will use it in the event they wish to contact
               you. The mission planning section has provided falcon view overlays
               outlining the established training areas utilized by Bristow Academy.

      can be changed during mission planning if coordinated between receiver and tanker.
      Frequently 920th crews will use King Operations (321.0 MHz) as primary and 138.475
      MHz as secondary for both Marion MOA and 15V tracks.
      8.2.4.9. (Added-920RQW) No Fly/Avoid Areas. Do not fly below 500’ AGL within the
      designated no-fly areas.

     8.2.4.10. (Added-920RQW) Run-up/Taxi/Take-off/Landing. All 301st aircraft are
     parked on the ―Valley Ramp‖ (aka 750 Ramp). Unit aircraft routinely use either Golf
     Pad or the intersection of taxiway Mike and Zulu for take-off and landing. Routine crew
     changes are normally conducted in front of life support building. As a reminder, aircrew
     need notify Patrick ground to leave your flight plan open when taxing in for a crew
     change.
     8.2.4.11. (Added-920RQW) Departure/Arrival. The standard departure and arrival
     procedures are via the ―Pineda Arrival/Departure.‖ When contacting Patrick tower,
     either when ready for take-off or prior to penetrating Class D airspace, state your
     intention to utilize the ―Pineda Departure or Arrival.‖ Plan to fly at 500’ AGL or above
     along the causeway, ensuring that while passing over the Merritt Island the aircraft is
     directly over the causeway. Minimum altitude is 1000’ AGL when not on Pineda and
     over Merritt Island. If possible, fly 1000’ AGL or above while over residential areas for
     noise abatement. Clearance for the departure or arrival assumes no active runway
     crossing required. If, when taking off or landing, you need to cross the active runway
     you must request specific clearance for this airspace.
     8.2.4.12. (Added-920RQW) Transition/Contact/Emergency Procedures (EP) training.
     Contact and EP training will normally be conducted at Patrick AFB. The Cape Canaveral
     Skid Strip is an alternate location requiring prior coordination to ensure tower manning
     and the availability of crash fire rescue (CFR). Call 45th Space Wing (SW) Range
     Scheduling at 3-5941 to coordinate use of the Skid Strip. Melbourne Initial Aiming Point
     (IAP) can also be used for Contact, EP, and instrument (CEPI) training. Crews are
     reminded to use Melbourne IAP during times of lower density air traffic. During cross-
     country flights, airports having CFR immediately availability can be used on a case by
     case basis. Ensure the OPS Sup/DO/CC is aware of the planned off-station EP training.
     8.2.4.13. (Added-920RQW) Patrick AFB Traffic Pattern/Cargo Sling.              The airfield
     procedures will all be in accordance with 45 SWI 13-203.
         8.2.4.13.1. (Added-920RQW) Traffic Pattern. Local traffic patterns are contained
         in 45 SWI 13-203. Helicopters will typically fly 500 foot downwind with 300 foot
         base legs while in the pattern at Patrick AFB. Higher patterns can be requested for
         training such as turning auto rotations. Low level auto rotations are normally flown
         with 300 feet downwind and descents to 100 feet on final.
         8.2.4.13.2. (Added-920RQW) The Cargo Sling area is ―at member’s own risk‖.
         Patterns to the Sling area should not conflict with normal local patterns. Patterns with
         actual sling loads will avoid over flight of persons, equipment, and buildings (to
         include boats in the river), unless the sling load to be placed on equipment, building,
         or vehicle.
     8.2.4.14. (Added-920RQW) Flight Following: ―Ops Normal‖ calls will be made to
     Rescue Ops, every 60 minutes (138.475 or 255.5). If radio communication with Rescue
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                   57


      Ops is not possible, then attempt to contact them through an Air Traffic Control (ATC)
      agency. As an example, while flying in Marion Military Operation Area (MOA) or
      AVON Gunnery Range, contact AVON Operations and request they call the Rescue Ops
      with an Ops Normal call. If lost contact is anticipated, call Rescue Operations prior, with
      the estimated return to contact time.
      8.2.4.15. (Added-920RQW) Recovery. Prior to recovery, pass to Rescue Operations
      the aircraft maintenance status and number of minutes until expected landing. Include
      ―Alpha‖ status and a short description of reason. 15 minute prior notification is optimal.
      The maintenance status codes are listed in Table 8.6.

Table 8.6. (Added-920RQW) Maintenance Aircraft Status Codes.
              No Discrepancies (Salt exposure within 10 miles, below 3000 feet) an AFTO 781
Code A-1      entry is not considered a discrepancy in this situation.

              Minor Discrepancies (i.e. avionics, Salt exposure below 30’).
Code A-2
              Major Discrepancy in mission-essential equipment (repair required before next
Code A-3      flight)

           8.2.4.15.1. (Added-920RQW) The bird bath is located near Mike/Zulu for aircraft
           rinsing at the end of a sortie. The bird bath may be activated by keying the mike 5
           times on 148.45 or by requesting Patrick ground to activate the bird bath. Crews are
           highly encouraged to rinse the aircraft at the conclusion of every mission, especially
           after salt water operations (Day or Night Water Ops) with consideration to external
           stores and weapons.
      8.2.4.16. (Added-920RQW) Unmanned Launch Coordination Briefing. Normally, the
      ACs of both aircraft will attend the Coordination briefing. This briefing is typically at
      least three days prior to the launch. DOS will ensure the meeting and required aircrew
      will be annotated on the weekly schedule.
   8.2.5. Instrument Procedures.
   8.2.5. (920RQW) Aircrew should make every attempt to accomplish all instrument training
   while participating in the Instrument Flight Rule(s) (IFR) route structure. Additionally,
   training profiles should include full procedure approaches, holding, and unusual attitude
   training. Local ―Tactical‖ Global Positioning System (GPS) approaches can only be
   accomplished Visual Flight Rules (VFR) during Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)
   under see and avoid rules. If you are using ―Tactical‖ GPS approach system, contact Tower
   requesting ―Long Visual Straight-In‖.
   8.2.6. Combat Rescue Operations.
   8.2.6. (920RQW) Effective Combat Rescue Operations training and employment is based
   on thorough mission planning, succinct aircrew briefings, focused flight execution and
   positive mission debriefs.
      8.2.6.1. Weapons Employment
58                               AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


     8.2.6.1. (920RQW) Local weapons employment is restricted to Off Shore Gun Ranges
     and Avon Park. Gunnery at other DoD approved ranges must comply with local
     directives.
        8.2.6.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Avon Park Range: All gunnery will be IAW technical
        data, AFI 11-2HH60V3, and the Avon Park Range user’s guide. Avon Range uses a
        website (https://avonpark.acc.af.mil/) as the complete guide. Paper copies of Avon
        Range user’s guides will be maintained by DOW, available in the flight briefing
        rooms. But targeting information must be extracted from Online Data. 301
        RQS/DOW will periodically compare online information to In-Flight Guide and
        Extracted Information for accuracy. During mission planning and the aircrew
        briefing, aircrew will identify the intended gunnery targets and associated restrictions.
        Extracts of North and South TAC ranges will be maintained in the 301 RQS In-Flight
        Guide. Helicopter Approved Targets are also consolidated within the 301 RQS
        Standard Mission Briefing (PowerPoint).
        8.2.6.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Off-Shore Gunnery Range: Conduct gunnery IAW
        technical data, AFI 11-2HH60V3, and 301 RQS In-Flight Guide. The gunnery range
        is normally considered as defined by a north – south line defined by mission planning
        database (approximately 15 Nautical Miles (NM) east of Patrick AFB). Surface
        vessels should not be within 10 NM of intended gunnery area. No vessel will be
        within 7 NM. If the area is fowled due to surface vessels, gunnery must cease until
        vessel is clear of 7 NM or a new area further North, East or South will be established.
        301 RQS aircraft do not have the authority to impede or alter vessels on the high seas
        for gunnery training. Once the range is clear and prior to commencement of firing,
        broadcast ―SECURITE‖ call on marine band channel 16 as outline in the In-Flight
        Guide or contained within the ELMO. After completion of firing, broadcast the ―All
        Clear‖ as outline within the In Flight Guide and/or ELMO. Operations Supervisors
        are reminded to call US Coast Guard with position of firing especially if tracer or
        flares are being used.
        8.2.6.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Hot Gun Procedures: If a Hot Gun is to return to
        Patrick AFB, pilots are to maneuver the helicopter to minimize the population areas
        on the side with the Hot Gun. Flight Engineer/Aerial Gunner with the Hot Gun will
        keep the weapon pointed in a safe direction at all times. Normally, that would be
        downward nearly perpendicular to the ground. Pilots should limit bank angles away
        from the Hot Gun (to minimize the gun elevation). Banking into the Hot Gun is
        preferred. The helicopter will announce to Patrick Tower and Rescue Operations of
        the Hot Gun as far out as possible. Inform the Tower to close 11/29 traffic and alert
        the Fire Chief the landing will be at the Cargo Sling Area. Make a request to tower to
        stop all traffic on the perimeter road. Approach the airfield as if landing on the west
        end of Runway 11/29 and land at the West end of Runway 11/29, with the Hot Gun
        side of the aircraft pointed west. Flight Engineer/Aerial Gunner controlling the Hot
        Gun will keep the barrel of the weapon pointed down and into a ditch, if available,
        with an angle away from the airfield (angle toward the river). Weapons Maintenance
        will approach from the non-Hot Gun side of the aircraft and complete Hot Gun
        clearing using appropriate checklist and technical order data. Extracted information
        is contained within the 301 RQS In-Flight Guide with pictorial description.
AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012                                                 59


        8.2.6.1.4. (Added-920RQW) The following special procedure will apply to live
        Infiltrate/ Exfiltrate/ (Infil/Exfil/AIE) training and live fire GAU 18 training: To
        ensure no cook-off during live Infil/Exfil/AIE training, the FE or Gunner performing
        the Infil/Exfil/AIE will ensure the GAU-18 is SAFE and CLEAR of rounds prior to
        conducting the Infil/Exfil/AIE. Announce over intercom when action is complete.
        The crew member not performing the Infil/Exfil/AIE will maintain positive control of
        their weapon ensuring no personnel are in the line of sight of the GAU-18.
        WARNING: The GAU-18 can have a cook-off as much as 5 minutes after sustained
        firing. Positive control of the GAU-18 must be maintained whenever rounds are in
        the chamber.
        8.2.6.1.5. (Added-920RQW) Hung Flare Procedures: If flares or chaff are
        dispensed during any sortie, a hung ordinance check will be accomplished. A hung
        ordinance check will be accomplished by a crewmember visually inspected each
        chaff/flare bucket for partially ejected ordinance. Aircraft with suspected hung
        chaff/flare at Patrick AFB will land and remain on an approved landing surface
        (Golf/Runway/Mike-Zulu) and EOD notified via ATC. This check may be
        accomplished at an approved LZ and if suspected ordinance found, the aircraft will be
        flown back to PAFB or suitable military station avoiding population as much as
        possible and as safety/situation dictates.
     8.2.6.2. (Added-920RQW) Combat Mission Planning: Use the 301 RQS SOP, AFTTP
     3-1Vol 24, and 3-3 Vol 24 as guidelines to develop mission planning. Communications
     Monitoring Report (CMR) currency, evaluations, and upgrade should be used to
     determine mission events.
        8.2.6.2.1. (Added-920RQW) Additional Briefing/Debriefings requirements.
            8.2.6.2.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Blade Stall/EM Data: AFI 11-2HH60 V3
            contains the requirement of onset of blade stall and Energy Maneuver chart data.
            301 RQS standard EM Ps Chart values will be the 1000 line of data. This will
            forgo any intrusion into Onset of Blade Stall that can occur with Ps = 500 or less.
            8.2.6.2.1.2. (Added-920RQW) Training Rules: All tactical briefings will
            incorporate the general training rules as outlined by AFI 11-214. Extracted
            Training Rules are contained in the Standard Mission Briefing as contained in 301
            RQS SOP.
            8.2.6.2.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Debrief: Mission debriefings should concentrate
            on specific areas of the sortie when additional discussion can enhance training.
            Use Mission Objectives (aka Desired Learning Objectives (DLO)) as debriefing
            areas. Examples would be action/reaction of formation interplay between the
            separated crews. Aircraft Commanders and Flight Leads should keep the
            debriefing to issues within the sortie.
     8.2.6.3. (Added-920RQW) EM Warm up: EM warm-up, if desired by flight lead, is
     typically flown immediately after entering the LATN in the vicinity of Lake Washington.
     EM warm-up should be completed as a single ship maneuver. Normally the flight will
     split up at Lake Washington, complete individual EM Warm-up, Low Level and FENCE
60                                   AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


     checks then call for rejoin with status checks. The specific procedure for accomplishing
     ―EM warm-up‖ will be in accordance with 301 RQS SOP or as briefed.
  8.2.7. Abnormal Procedures

     8.2.7.2. (920RQW) Lost Wingman Procedures will be IAW with AFI 11-2HH-60, Vol
     3 and 301 RQS/ SOP.
  8.2.8. Squadron Briefing Standards (May be published as a separate document)
  8.2.8. (920RQW) Squadron Briefing Standards are published within the 301 RQS SOP
  8.2.9. This chapter will include procedures for the following, if applicable:
     8.2.9.1. Filing flight plans.
     8.2.9.1. (920RQW) Filing Flight Plans: Aircrew will file in accordance with 45SWI 13-
     203. Normally flight plans will be completed and faxed to Base Operations. 301 RQS
     does have a filed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with 45 OSS Airfield Operations
     for telephonic filing of VFR Local Flight plans. Filing authority (AC, Ops SUP, or Top
     Three) can call Base Operations (4-2222) with Call Sign, Type, Tail Number, Takeoff
     Time, Local VFR, Estimated Time Enroute (ETE.)
     8.2.9.2. Taxi/parking procedures.
     8.2.9.2. (920RQW) Local Taxi/parking procedures: HH-60 helicopters may taxi into
     outlined parking positions on ―the Valley‖ (750) Ramp without ground marshallers.
     Aircrew are exempt from the 25 foot rule IAW AFI 11-218, Ground Movement of
     Aircraft, by using the taxi lines, rotor circle, and aircraft ground equipment markings.
     Note: The Ground Power Unit is marked at 22 foot on the right side of the aircraft.
     8.2.9.3. Scramble procedures.
     8.2.9.3. (920RQW) Scramble procedures: During times of increased alert and if a
     scramble is anticipated, normal hover checks and aircraft cocking procedures will be
     used. During a scramble, all crew members will report to the flight lead. Copilots, Flight
     Engineers, and Gunners will be sent to aircraft and complete checklist items to engine
     start. Communication checks will be completed with all aircraft, PJ radios, and ROC.
     Aircraft Commanders and Pararescue Team Leaders (PJ) will confirm mission, final
     flight planning, and the commander’s intent then depart to the aircraft. ELMO and flight
     mission electronic data maybe pre-positioned with the copilot or carried with aircraft
     commander depending on situation of alert.
     8.2.9.4. Traffic pattern and landing areas.
     8.2.9.4. (920RQW) Local traffic pattern and landing areas are covered in Normal
     Operations above and within Air Traffic Control 45SWI 13-203.

     8.2.9.5. (920RQW) Air Operations Security at Patrick: Aircraft are protected on the
     Ramp by Restricted Area Quarantine and Security Police Patrols. Aircrews are reminded
     to possess and display Restricted Area Badge while on the Valley Ramp. There are two
     entry control points, one near Life support (south side) and the other is directly opposite
     (north side of ramp) near the MX hanger, to be used for entry and exit of the flight line.
     During hours of darkness, either a reflective vest or belt should be worn by all personnel.
     If reflective material is not available, aircrew should use a visible light source to mark
     their position on a darkened ramp. Additionally the Aerial Gunner will carry a side arm
     when aircraft are uploaded with armament. Additional guidance is available in AFI 13-
     207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy.
     8.2.9.6. Local gunnery and range procedures/restrictions.
     8.2.9.6. (920RQW) Local gunnery and range procedures/restrictions are contained
     within paragraph 8.2.9.1 Weapons Employment and its sub-paragraphs.
         8.2.9.6.1. Discarding of spent/jammed rounds while clearing weapons (rotors
         turning/static).
     8.2.9.7. OPSEC/COMSEC procedures.
     8.2.9.7. (920RQW) OPSEC/COMSEC: Flight Management will maintain COMSEC
     materials for flight use. Aerial Gunners will assist in loading transfer devices (like SKL)
     for aircraft use. Aerial Gunner will maintain control of transfer device from issue,
     through the flight, until device is zeroed and/or turned in to 301 RQS/FM or the
     Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup).       Note: SKL normally retain codes and must be
     returned to COMSEC Safe in Operations.
  8.2.10. Overwater flight covership/boat procedures:
  8.2.10. (920RQW) Adverse Weather. Patrick Base Weather will issue advisories and
  warnings pertaining to the different phases of lightning. Phase I is issued when conditions
  exist for lightning. The flight line is not restricted for ground operations (preflight, equipment
  on-load, etc.). Phase II is issued when lightning has been observed within 5 miles of the
  airfield. The flight line is closed to all operations of external ground personnel. This does not
  restrict the movement of an aircraft. If returning from a flight, the crew will taxi into parking
  without the assistance of ground maintenance personnel. The aircraft commander will
  minimize personnel exposure to the lightning conditions. (Example: call Ops Sup for vehicle
  support to recovery aircraft from flight line).
     8.2.10.1. Response times.
     8.2.10.2. Radio contact procedures.
     8.2.10.3. Loiter time requirements.

  245.
  8.2.11. (920RQW) Bird Watch Procedures (from 10AF) Reserve units will follow the
  BASH guidance contained in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program,
  AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, and
  the following guidance.
 62                               AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


      8.2.11.1. (Added-920RQW) Aircrews will obtain and monitor Bird Watch Condition
      (BWC) advisories prior to departure, low-altitude flight (if available) and arrival.
      Aircrews will adhere to the following BWC guidance:
          8.2.11.1.1. (Added-920RQW) BWC SEVERE:                  Takeoffs and landings are
          prohibited.
          8.2.11.1.2. (Added-920RQW) BWC MODERATE:                    Takeoffs and full stop
          landings are allowed if the departure and arrival route avoids identified bird activity.
          Traffic pattern activities to include planned low approaches are prohibited (other than
          takeoff and full stop landing).
          8.2.11.1.3. (Added-920RQW) BWC LOW. No restrictions to aircraft operations.
          8.2.11.1.4. (Added-920RQW) 920 OG/CC (or higher) is authorized to deviate from
          these guidelines based on mission priority and risk assessment.
   8.2.12. (Added-920RQW) Tower Closed Operations. During times when the control tower
   is not operational, aircrew will contact the 45th/920th Wing Command Post, call sign
   ―BARRIER‖, on 383.00. All operations will be IAW 45th SWI 13-203. In general, 301 RQS
   Helicopters are allowed to conduct Tower Closed Operations for Search and Rescue and
   Range Support Missions. Pilots are responsible for See and Avoid takeoff, flight and landing
   operations. The 45/920 Wing Command Post will coordinate operations within the restricted
   ramp with security police. Additionally, Command Post can control airfield lighting if
   required.
   8.2.13. (Added-920RQW) Base Security. At the direction of the 920 OG/CC and 301
   RQS/CC/DO, the 301 RQS may provide base surveillance flights. These flights will include
   45 SW assigned security personnel flying in MEGP status. Flights should be accomplished
   at 500’ AGL and above.
   8.2.14. (Added-920RQW) Cape Security. The 301st will, at the direction of the Director of
   Operations, provide Cape surveillance flights. The mere presence of US Air Force
   helicopters provides a visible deterrence and an observation platform that is useful in
   safeguarding Cape Canaveral Facilities. All flights must be coordinated with 45 SW Range
   Scheduling at 3-5941. These flights will not routinely require 45 SW security personnel.
   8.2.15. (Added-920RQW) Bambi Bucket Training and Operational Use: The Bambi
   Bucket is a sub-group of Cargo Sling Certification. 301 RQS aircrew utilizing Bambi Bucket
   must first be certified in Cargo Sling Operations. Bambi bucket training and clearance to use
   the bucket are IAW 301RQS local training guidance and Letter of X. Documentation of
   training will be maintained within the individual training records. The currency for Bambi
   Bucket is to maintain Cargo Sling Currency. There will be no additional currency for the
   Bambi Bucket. The Bambi Bucket will be employed using the Bambi Bucket Supplement to
   the 301 RQS In-Flight Guide.

Terms
Aircraft Commander (AC)—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being
in command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
 72                                  AFI11-2HH-60V3_920RQWSUP_I 27 DECEMBER 2012


Air Taxi—Helicopter/VTOL aircraft movement conducted above the surface but normally not
above 100 feet above ground level. The aircraft may proceed either via hover taxi or flight
speeds more than 20 knots. The pilot is solely responsible for selecting a safe airspeed/altitude
for the operation being conducted.
Buddy Preflight—When crewmembers, other that the primary aircrew for a mission, complete
an aircraft preflight up to and may include hover checks. This is a Mission Commander’s tool
used to expedite departures or to ensure alert postures are maintained.
Certification—The process of qualifying aircrew to perform tactical employment and special
weapons capabilities, procedures, and rules.
Chaff—Passive form of electronic countermeasure used to deceive airborne or ground based
radar.
Combat Profile—Normally, a mission designed to penetrate and operate within a combat
environment (training or operational). The specific profile that will be flown is predicated on
type and degree of threat.
Crew Resource Management (CRM)—Training concept that emphasizes team effectiveness
by enhancing individual and aircrew performance in communication, situational awareness,
effective leadership and management, and crew coordination
Formation Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between crews, operates
as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between aircraft
within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the crews of the other aircraft in
the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are maneuvering to
attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during join up and breakaway.
Such a group is treated for air traffic control purposes as a single aircraft.
Hover Taxi—Helicopter/Vertical takeoff-landing aircraft movement conducted above the
surface and in ground effect at airspeeds less than approximately 20 knots. The actual height will
vary, and some helicopters may require hover taxi above 25 feet above ground level to reduce
ground effect turbulence or provide clearance for sling loads.
Low-Level Operations—Flight conducted below 500 feet above ground level
Operational Mission—Any mission not designated as a unilateral training mission.
Tactical Mission—A mission designed to penetrate and operate within a combat or threat
environment
