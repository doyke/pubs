SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The following represents a major modification to the E-8 MESL. The MESL should be reviewed
in its entirety.
1.General. The MESL (Minimum Essential Systems List) is the basis of status reporting in
accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground work for reporting the status of
aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that must work on
an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other missions.
Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and Training System
         2                                         AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADD_P 6 JANUARY 2011


        (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being configured
        for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
        1.1.Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded
        mission systems.
        1.2.Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
        Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
        Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
        configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
        1.3.All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
        Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
        another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify
        the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/ mission equipment.
        1.4.Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by Work Unit Code
        (WUC) against the Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic System Lists (BSLs) across
        the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability
        of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore it is
        important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's
        assigned aircraft. For example, units with combat coded (CA) aircraft would determine and
        report status using only the FSL and BSL (RT) columns related to their DOC statement. Units
        with training (TF) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL
        (TNG) columns, and units with test (CB) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
        only the FSL and BSL (TST) columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is
        reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
