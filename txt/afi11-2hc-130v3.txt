                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The ACC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism
which keeps the ACC Commander informed of the current status of ACC forces while enabling
the wing or group commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). ACC and AFRC are designated as the controlling agency
for assigned Air Force aircraft, while theater commands have operational control (OPCON) of
theater-based assets. Reserve Component (RC) missions for non-mobilized assets are controlled
through applicable ANG and ARC C2 centers. In practice, responsibility for planning and
executing ACC missions is routinely delegated to the wing or group commander. The wing or
group commander, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold missions through the command
post supporting the wing. In the event that assigned forces undergo a change in operational
control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility
to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent OPLAN,
OPORD, or deployment or execution order. NOTE: For certain close-hold activities, security
considerations may compel the wing or group commander to shift mission monitoring
responsibilities from the command post to another wing agency. The wing or group commander
will ensure procedures are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission progress
and advise the MAJCOM/DO and COMACC as appropriate.
2.3. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center
monitors all ACC aircraft that move to, from, or between OCONUS off-station locations. Key
components of the ACC C2 system are the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and
the various C2 facilities at theater and wing locations. When aircraft are deployed in support of
operations and exercises, the Command Center may obtain additional information from situation
reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports (DSR). The following mission monitoring
procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in nature and have not had
operational control changed to another command:
   2.3.1. The respective unit command post tracks CONUS movements of their aircraft based
   on aircrew reports.
   2.3.2. Information on OCONUS movements of ACC aircraft is relayed to the ACC
   Command Center (DSN: 574-5411; commercial: 757-764-5411) via telephone notification
   from host wing command posts. The host wing command posts receive their data directly
   from aircrew or via the en route facility‘s local command post.
   2.3.3. The following paragraphs summarize mission commander, or if none is assigned,
   aircraft commander duties with regard to flight reporting:
       2.3.3.1. Missions at Bases with a C2 Facility. Mission or aircraft commanders will
       ensure that at least 30 minutes prior to landing, the following information is relayed to the
       applicable C2 facility: call signs, mission numbers, ETAs, maintenance status, and
       additional service requirements. After landing, the mission or aircraft commander will
       contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure information. In
       addition, CONUS based crews operating OCONUS must keep their home station
18                                                       AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected takeoff times,
     and other related information. Home station command posts relay information to the
     ACC Command Post. These actions keep the ACC Commander apprised of the locations
     and status of OCONUS forces. When forces CHOP to another theater commander,
     reporting will be through theater C2 centers upon arrival in the assigned area of
     responsibility.
     2.3.3.2. Missions at Bases without a C2 Facility. Mission or aircraft commanders will
     report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status,
     projected takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the host wing command post or
     command center. Methods of communicating this information include HF phone patch,
     satellite communication (SATCOM), satellite phone (SATPHONE), DSN, and
     commercial telephone. Refer to the FLIP, Flight Information Handbook, USAF High
     Frequency Single Side Band (HF/SSB) Airways and Command and Control Station
     section for guidance on mission reporting.
        2.3.3.2.1. Accomplish movement reporting when crew duties and safety permit but
        no later than 30 minutes after the event (1 hour for AFRC).
        2.3.3.2.2. If unable to contact ACC command post (applicable RC command post for
        ARC missions) or Deployed Tanker Airlift Control Center via HF/SSB, retain
        information for submission via voice to the controlling command and control center
        (CCC) when contact is reestablished.
        2.3.3.2.3. Restrict HF transmissions to operational traffic, i.e., movement reporting,
        itinerary revisions, maintenance status, flight plan information, weather and/or
        aircraft emergencies, or other important flight information, as appropriate.
        2.3.3.2.4. If experiencing problems complying with these procedures, report
        problems to the next CCC contacted. The CCC transmits the reporting problems to
        the ACC command post (applicable RC command post for ANG or AFRC missions).
     2.3.3.3. En Route Reporting: En route reports are not required unless specified in an
     OPORD/OPLAN or other mission directive.
        2.3.3.3.1. Unless shorter flight legs dictate, when approximately 3 hours from
        destination, contact the destination, CCC, or if no CCC is available, contact the ACC
        command post (applicable RC command post for ANG/AFRC missions) via HF
        radio. Upon initial contact, confirm your arrival message has been received and
        update your ETA. If your arrival message has been received, no further information
        need be transmitted. If your arrival message has not been received, pass the
        following:
            2.3.3.3.1.1. Mission number
            2.3.3.3.1.2. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
            2.3.3.3.1.3. VIP code. Transmit VIP and honors code in accordance with FLIP
            planning document. Send the VIP code of each VIP on board.
        2.3.3.3.2. When within UHF/VHF range, contact the destination CCC with the
        following information, unless previously transmitted.

   2.4.2. Coordinating with ATC, CCT, STS, range control, users, and others that may have an
   impact on the mission.
   2.4.3. Ensuring that drop zones (DZ)s or landing zones (LZ)s have current surveys (when
   necessary).
   2.4.4. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation
   arrangements.
   2.4.5. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
   2.4.6. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements (see paragraph 2.3.3).
2.5. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. Flight Authorization designates an
aircraft commander for all flights. Aircraft commanders are:
   2.5.1. In command of all persons on board the aircraft.
   2.5.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew.
20                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007

     informed of mission progress.
     2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission
     commander (see paragraphs 2.3.3 and 2.4).
2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of either, conditions are
not safe to start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission
rests with the aircraft commander. If the aircraft commander refuses a mission, it will not depart
until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely.
Another aircraft commander and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the
same conditions.
     2.6.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON,
     except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or
     facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the mission or
     aircraft commander must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
        2.6.1.1. The controlling agency directing the rerouting or diversion is responsible for
        ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft.
        2.6.1.2. The aircraft commander will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or
        aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
     2.6.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the C2 center agency will ensure the
     AC is provided enroute weather, existing and forecast weather for the alternate, notices to
     airmen (NOTAMs), and appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and
     Restrictions Report (ASRR). If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, the
     AC will coordinate with the C2 center for other suitable alternates. The C2 center agency will
     coordinate with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival. The AC is final
     authority on selecting a suitable alternate.
2.7. Posse Comitatus. It is the policy of the DOD to cooperate with civilian law enforcement
officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law
Enforcement Agencies, incorporates that directive and provides uniform policies and procedures
to be followed concerning support provided to federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel,
equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement organizations. Report all requests
for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement authorities through the
appropriate command and control channels.

 NOTES:
 (1) Unit/mission commanders may authorize flights without a navigator on board for pilot
 proficiency (Pilot Pro) sorties. A navigator is required if reported/forecasted weather
 includes thunderstorms or if other inclement weather exists (EXCEPTION: units with APN-
 241 radar). Units will establish procedures regarding the use of navigators on pilot
 proficiency trainers in Chapter 10, Local Operating Procedures.

 (2) Maximum Effort Airland and Hot Refueling operations (not including FARP Tanker
 operations) may be accomplished in a non-tactical environment without a navigator onboard.

 (3) AMSS are not required for pilot proficiency sorties. Unit commanders may authorize
 home station mission training sorties without an AMSS on board when not required for
 mission accomplishment. Units will establish procedures in Chapter 10, Local Operating
 Procedures, regarding the use of AMSS on sorties.

 (4) Two loadmasters are required for the following mission events:
 a) The following Ramp and door airdrops: S/L Personnel, rigged alternate method zodiac
 (RAMZ), container ramp load (CRL), container delivery system (CDS), and combat rubber

 (5) Instructor Loadmaster (IL) and two students are considered full mission complement on
 formal school training sorties, except HAR when accomplishing simultaneous contacts.

 (6) Two LMs or one LM and another qualified crewmember are required if more than 40
 passengers are scheduled to be carried (EXCEPTION: unit moves or contingencies). Both
 crewmembers must remain in the cargo compartment.

 (7) Guardian Angel (GA) is part of the HC/MC-130 mission crew complement for rescue
 missions involving pararescue employment. Minimum GA crew compliment is based on
 employment requirements and defined by AFI 16-1202V3 and appropriate AFTTP GA
 volume.

3.3. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). (See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.)
3.4. Interfly. Interfly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between MAJCOMs to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to
specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances but, may be used to relieve short-term
qualified manpower shortfalls.
   3.4.1. Unless specified in a MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM MOA:
       3.4.1.1. Aircraft ownership will not be transferred.
       3.4.1.2. The unit with operational control of the mission is responsible for the
       publication/maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission flown by the
       aircraft.
       3.4.1.3. Crews will be qualified in the MC/HC-130. Differences training may be
       required between different series aircraft. See AFI 11-2HC-130V1.
       3.4.1.4. Crewmember(s) will follow operational procedures defined in AFI 11-2HC-
       130V3, AFTTP 3-3.33, and the applicable technical orders for the MDS.
       3.4.1.5. The MAJCOM with aircraft ownership will retain all flight and ground mishap
       reporting responsibility.
   3.4.2. Approval Authority.
       3.4.2.1. The OG/CC is the approval authority for interfly on aircraft under his/her
       control.
       3.4.2.2. Interfly for contingency operations must be approved by the MAJCOM/A3 for
       each participating command.
       3.4.2.3. DELETED.
24                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


3.5. Intrafly. Intrafly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members from separate
units under the same MAJCOM to accomplish flying missions. Normally, intrafly should be
used only to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls.
     3.5.1. Group Commander possessing the aircraft is approval authority for intrafly between
     units.
     3.5.2. As a minimum, crews will be qualified in the aircraft, as well as systems or
     configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission. If non-current, comply with
     paragraphs 3.1.1., 3.1.2., and 3.1.3.
     3.5.3. Aircrews flying C-130E/H aircraft will follow AFI 11-2HC-130V1, HC-130--Aircrew
     Training, AFI 11-2HC-130V3, HC-130--Operations Procedures, AFTTP 3-3.33, and the
     applicable technical orders for the MDS.
3.6. Flight Duty Period, Crew Duty Period and Crew Rest Restrictions. (See AFI 11-
202V3) Flight Duty Period (FDP) falls within the constraints of the Crew Duty Period (CDP).
FDP and CDP both begin when aircrew members report for official duties. The maximum Flight
Duty Period is 16 hours for a basic crew. An aircrew member‘s Crew Duty Period is a
maximum of 18 hours or FDP plus two hours. The addition of CDP is intended for a basic crew
to complete aircrew duties at the aircraft after engine shutdown; (e.g. cargo loading/offloading,
refueling, etc.). NOTE: (AFRC and ANG only) CDP and FDP include both military duty and
civilian work. It begins when the individual reports for his or her first duty period (military or
civilian). FDP ends with engine shutdown at the end of the mission or series of missions. CDP
extends up to two hours after FDP ends. When crewmembers perform other duties prior to flight-
related duties (including civilian work for AFRC and ANG crewmembers), CDP/FDP begins
when reporting for the other duties. NOTE: Waiver authority for paragraph 3.6 is MAJCOM/A3
or deployed equivalent unless otherwise noted.
     3.6.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). IAW AFI 11-202V3 and ACC Supplement, FDP is the
     period that starts when an aircrew reports for a mission, briefing, or other official duty
     (including civilian work for ARC crew members) and ends when engines are shut down at
     the end of the mission, mission leg, or a series of missions. Maximum FDP is 16+00 hours
     for a basic aircrew and 20+00 hours for an augmented aircrew.
        3.6.1.1. The basic FDP is 16 hours providing no mission events, helicopter air refueling
        (HAR) below 3,000 feet AGL, pilot proficiency training, or functional check flights
        (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no Air Refueling or HAR at or above 3,000
        feet AGL after 14 hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more
        than 4 hours, the FDP will be 12 hours (the use of altitude hold does not constitute use of
        an autopilot). If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and
        then comply with the basic FDP limitations. Exception: AFRC and ANG FDP is 16
        hours for all mission events, FCF and pilot proficiency training missions originating from
        home station and space center launch and recovery support missions.
        3.6.1.2. The augmented FDP is 20 hours for all Rescue HC/MC-130s, providing no
        mission events, HAR below 3,000 feet AGL, pilot proficiency training, or FCFs are
        accomplished after 16 hours and no Air Refueling events or HAR at or above 3,000 feet
        AGL are accomplished after 18 hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   25


     denied for more than 8 hours, the FDP will be 16 hours (the failure of the altitude hold
     function is not considered a failure of the autopilot).
         3.6.1.2.1. Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical
         phases of flight. Normally, 30 minutes prior to initiating the checklist for an event
         will allow the new crewmember time to get acclimated. EXCEPTION: For training
         missions instructors will plan and brief crew changes to safely maximize training
         objectives.
         3.6.1.2.2. Minimum in-flight crew rest facilities will be 3 bunks or litters.
         3.6.1.2.3. FDP length will be based on the mission to be performed. For example, if
         the planned mission duration is 15 hours from show time to termination, then a basic
         FDP is appropriate even if the crew is augmented. Once established, a basic FDP will
         not be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition.
         3.6.1.2.4. Time spent traveling as a passenger on commercial or military
         transportation in excess of 4 hours counts as part of the duty period. Official duty
         travel for personnel in official military/civilian status will count toward the duty
         period.
         3.6.1.2.5. Aircraft commanders may extend the crew‘s FDP and/or CDP by up to 2
         hours on a mission in progress. Aircraft commanders should attempt to comply with
         the waiver authority in AFI 11-202V3. If this option is exercised, aircraft
         commanders must coordinate with command and control agencies so that downstream
         activities are not adversely affected. Missions will not be scheduled to exceed the
         maximum FDP in this paragraph. Aircraft commanders must carefully weigh all
         factors affecting their crew before electing to extend the flight duty period.
  3.6.2. Crew Duty Period (CDP). CDP is the period that starts when an aircrew reports for a
  mission, briefing, or other official duty (including civilian work for ARC crew members) and
  ends at the completion of aircrew duties at the aircraft. Maximum CDP is 18+00 hours for a
  basic aircrew and 22+00 hours for an augmented aircrew.
  3.6.3. Rescue Alert Procedures. Rescue alert duty is defined as any period during which an
  alert crew is on call to perform a specific mission. Aircrew will be placed into crew rest prior
  to alert status. Upon entering crew rest, an aircrew will be given an expected alert assumption
  time. Rescue alert aircrews must be prepared to respond at any time during the alert period.
     3.6.3.1. Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the
     mission. Alert crews will be readily available in a location which allows the crew to meet
     the required time to launch from notification. Suitable facilities include adequate sleeping
     accommodations for the entire crew, unless at home station.
     3.6.3.2. The alert duty period will begin at a scheduled time determined by the
     unit/mission commander. Provide aircrew members an inviolate 12 hours crew rest prior
     to alert duty. The unit/mission commander will determine the normal length of the alert
     period, not to exceed 72 hours. An alert period may be extended up to a maximum of 7
     days with MAJCOM/A3 (or deployed equivalent) approval provided aircrew members
     receive a 24-hour recovery period prior to the next alert. Predeparture crew rest is
26                                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        waived for flight surgeons or medical technicians who are on alert duty for urgent
        MEDEVAC missions.
        3.6.3.3. The crew duty period will begin when the aircrew shows for flight duties. Crews
        may complete initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, preflight, engine run of
        their alert aircraft) without starting their crew day. This time should not exceed 3 hours.
        Alert response exercises that terminate prior to engine start do not start crew duty time
        when they occur during normal waking hours.
        3.6.3.4. A daily update briefing may be accomplished without starting crew duty time.
        This brief can include weather, local NOTAMS, latest FCIF information, special
        instructions, and any other appropriate items. The aircraft commander determines which
        crewmembers attend the brief.
     3.6.4. Non-Rescue Alert Procedures. PIC shall establish a legal for alert time based on
     aircraft availability and mission requirements, as appropriate. If the crew is not alerted
     within 8 hours (e.g. due to aircraft availability, mission delays, etc), the PIC will return the
     crew to crew rest and establish a new legal for alert time. OG/CC will define alerting
     procedures for local training missions in Chapter 10, Local Operating Procedures. Provide a
     minimum of 2 hours (except ARC at home station) from arrival at aircraft to stations time for
     crewmembers to complete preflight duties (if not previously preflighted).
     3.6.5. Flying the Alert Crew:
        3.6.5.1. If the alert crew is launched and returns with FDP remaining, they may be
        launched again within the constraints of that crew day. Numerous circumstances may
        arise that affect the decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated
        on an individual basis.
        3.6.5.2. The alert crew will not normally be used as a "preflight" or "engine run" crew
        for aircraft other than their alert aircraft. Alert crews will not perform other official
        duties (e.g., additional duties, commander‘s call, safety meeting, etc.) within their alert
        period. EXCEPTION: During normal waking hours, alert aircrew may mission plan at
        the discretion of the aircraft commander.
        3.6.5.3. An alert crew should not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-
        hour alert periods. The crew will receive 12 hours of premission crew rest between the
        first and second alert periods. Following completion of the second 72-hour alert period,
        the crew or crewmember will receive a minimum of 24 hours crew rest prior to
        reassuming alert status.
     3.6.6. Flying Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The crew chief is responsible to the AC. The
     AC, in conjunction with the en route station chief of maintenance, will determine how long
     the crew chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the
     opportunity to sleep 8 hours in each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
     Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
     3.6.7. TDY Crew Rest/Post Deployment Stand Down.
        3.6.7.1. All primary and deadhead crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to be
        away from home station or rotational base for more than 16 hours or recover away from
        home station should be notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                             27


     hours are not considered crew rest, but are designed to allow crewmembers time to
     resolve personal affairs. During these first 12 hours, a crewmember may perform limited
     non-flying duties. The second 12 hour period is inviolate crew rest (ARC will comply
     with AFI 11-202V3 as supplement by MAJCOM/A3).
     3.6.7.2. Postmission crew rest begins upon the final return of an individual to home
     station and runs continuously until completed. Postmission crew rest must be completed
     before starting the 12 hour predeparture crew rest period for a subsequent mission. Do
     not require a crewmember to get immunizations, engage in ground training, perform
     standby or squadron duties, or perform any other activity which would encroach upon
     crew rest. Waiver authority for postmission crew rest is the wing, group, or theater
     commander. Waiver requests for postmission crew rest are considered on a case by case
     basis only with the concurrence of the individual crewmember. Compute post-TDY crew
     rest at the rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of TDY, not to exceed 72 hours (not
     applicable to ARC and to students in formal schools listed in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF
     Formal Schools).

                                            Chapter 4

                          COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an
aircraft for launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable, FMC). Manpower
limitations, skills, and spare part availability have a negative and direct impact on
accomplishment. However, under specific circumstances, some missions can be safely operated
without all equipment being operational. Using the following policies, the AC is the final
authority in determining an overall status of an aircraft. Use the following maintenance
identifiers to effectively communicate a status of an aircraft:
     4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe
     aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated Mission Essential (ME) by the
     AC in AFTO Form781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief
     explanation of the reason for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. An AC
     accepting an aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not
     commit that AC (or a different AC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system
     inoperative.
     4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). Any discrepancies not currently ME, but may become
     ME (if circumstances change), are designated as MC in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy
     block. Every effort will be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest opportunity to
     that maintenance skills, ground time, and spare part availability permit. If subsequently, in
     the AC‘s judgment, mission safety would be compromised by the lack of any component, he
     may redesignate the said discrepancies/component as ME. However, do not delay a mission
     to correct an MC discrepancy.
     4.1.3. Open Item. Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission or any
     subsequent missions are not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and are
     normally worked at home station. Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification
     centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and operative.
     4.1.4. If the aircraft commander elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft
     systems, coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements,
     maintenance requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the
     decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. For Air National Guard (ANG) or
     Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) aircraft on ANG or AFRC mission identifiers,
     coordinate through the Air National Guard Operations Center (NGB/XOOO) or Air Force
     Reserve Command Center (HQ AFRC/DOOC).
4.2. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on minimum equipment requirements and operating
with degraded equipment.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
     4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   29


   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority for
   active duty, ARC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes Operational
   Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or ARC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or ARC directed mission prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight Manual, Maintenance T.O.,
   etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify the appropriate waiver
   authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response time.
4.4. HERP Procedures. For hostile environment repair procedures, reference AFSOCM 11-
201, Hostile Environment Repair Procedures.
4.5. Deviations and Technical Assistance Service. The AC may request (at anytime in the
decision process) technical support and additional assistance from their home unit, MAJCOM
staff, and maintenance representatives.
   4.5.1. ACs electing to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems (with appropriate
   waiver) must coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel
   requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the controlling C2 agency before flight.
   4.5.2. If beyond C2 communication capability, the AC may deviate from this chapter
   according to paragraph 1.3 Aircrew should report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to appropriate MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours. Units must be prepared to collect
   background information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
   4.5.3. When it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by the
   AFI and immediate action is required, the AC may deviate from this chapter. AC‘s should
   report deviations (without waiver) through channels to appropriate MAJCOM/A3 within 48
   hours. Units must be prepared to collect background information and submit a follow-up
   written report upon request.
4.6. Command Operating Guidelines:
   4.6.1. Except as listed in the guidance of this chapter, aircraft will not depart if any
   equipment required to execute flight manual emergency procedures is inoperative.
   4.6.2. Table 4.1. lists minimum equipment requirements and is provided to serve as a quick
   reference guide for the PIC to determine required equipment. Unless specifically referenced
   in the remarks or elsewhere in this chapter, the PIC will determine equipment required to
   accomplish a given mission. The PIC is expected to develop, and is empowered to use,
   prudent ORM analysis based on mission, environment, threat, aircraft systems, and aircrew
   qualification when determining required equipment for safe mission accomplishment.
   *NOTE: For any instrument that presents both analog and digital information, either
   presentation is acceptable at the PICs discretion.

                                                                 be maintained.
   4.6.3. Pressurization and Air Conditioning Systems. Pressurization and both air conditioning
   systems should be operational if patients are carried. If a system fails at an en route stop, the
   mission may continue (coordinate with the senior medical crewmember when patients are
   carried) to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. The
   AC will ensure passengers and patients are briefed on the possibility that discomfort may be
   encountered. Air conditioning/pressurization systems are not required for low level missions
   if a reasonable temperature can be maintained.
   4.6.4. Electrical System:
       4.6.4.1. All engine AC generators for all C-130s should be operational prior to departure.
       If a generator fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue to a destination with
       repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. If the AC generator is not
       equipped with a disconnect, it will be removed and the generator mount padded before
       flight. Local training and contingency missions may continue after a generator is
       disconnected or removed and the mount padded, provided no other electrical
       malfunctions exist.
       4.6.4.2. An operative ATM or APU generator is required for unrestricted flight. If the
       system is inoperative, flight in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) is
       permissible provided no other electrical malfunction exists. The generator of the HC-
       130(H)N will be removed and padded prior to operation of the APU.
   4.6.5. Fuel System. The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity
   indicators is fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible; however,
   flight crews must consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range, should further
   degradation occur. The following paragraphs provide guidelines for degraded fuel system
   operations under most circumstances.
       4.6.5.1. One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel.
       4.6.5.2. One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may
       be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.
          4.6.5.2.1. Verify the tank with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank
          quantity using a fuel tank dip stick. NOTE: Ensure maximum outboard main tank
          fuel weight is not exceeded when stores of any kind are installed on the outboard
          wing (e.g., refueling pods).
          4.6.5.2.2. At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the
          inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.
32                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        4.6.5.2.3. Begin crossfeed operation when the symmetrically opposite quantity
        indicator has decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards). For
        HC/MC-130 tanker aircraft, start crossfeed operation when any main tank decreases
        to 2,000 pounds.
        4.6.5.2.4. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative
        indicator or it‘s symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine
        operation.
        4.6.5.2.5. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
        4.6.5.2.6. Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main
        tank fuel.
     4.6.5.3. One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel
     tanks are checked full or empty. Both external fuel tank indicators may be inoperative
     provided both external tanks are checked empty. When an external tank indicator is
     inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked empty due to foam modification,
     comply with the following prior to flight:
        4.6.5.3.1. Check pressure with each pump in the external tank. If no pressure is
        obtained, the tank is verified empty.
        4.6.5.3.2. If pressure is obtained, transfer the fuel from the external tank. Defuel the
        external tank if unable to ground transfer.
        4.6.5.3.3. When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place
        the tank on crossfeed until no pressure is obtained. This will be completed prior to
        takeoff.
        4.6.5.3.4. HC/MC-130 aircraft with two external fuel tank indicators inoperative may
        fill external tanks to maximum providing fuel is ground transferred to a Benson tank
        with an operable fuel quantity indicator; ground transfer from only one tank at a time.
        Transfer no more that 1,000 pounds at a time between an external tank with an
        inoperative indicator and the Benson tank to maintain fuel balance.
     4.6.5.4. Both auxiliary tank indicators may be inoperative provided auxiliary fuel
     quantity is verified.
     4.6.5.5. Both a main and external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative on the same
     wing provided steps in paragraphs 4.6.5.2 and 4.6.5.3. are followed.
     4.6.5.6. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated
     guidelines per this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external
     fuel tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except per paragraph
     4.6.5.3.4 and the following:
        4.6.5.6.1. Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may
        be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers,
        under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot
        as a backup for lateral wing balance.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  33


         4.6.5.6.2. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available. This
         source can be either the (AR) gage readings or internal aircraft operating fuel quantity
         indicators.
         4.6.5.6.3. Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times. If small
         amounts (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 pounds
         into the tank with the inoperative indicator followed by an equal amount into the
         tank(s) with operative indicator(s). If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then
         transfer 1,000 pounds into the tank with the inoperative indicator, then up to 2,000
         pounds as needed into the tank(s) with the operative indicators, then up to 1,000
         pounds as needed into the tank with the inoperative indicator to bring all tanks
         symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 pounds as needed, repeating the cycle until
         desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks.
         4.6.5.6.4. Benson tank with an inoperative indicator. The flight engineer will verify
         the fuselage tank empty by utilizing the boost/dump pumps to transfer out of the tank
         until tank empty light illuminates. WARNING: Do to the possibility of fuel
         fumes/leaking into the cargo compartment do not verify the fuselage tank full via the
         internal refueling cap.
     4.6.5.7. Fuel may be transferred from main or external tanks with inoperative indicators
     only if the receiver requires emergency fuel. In this situation, the following procedures
     will apply:
         4.6.5.7.1. The fuel counter for the refueling pod being used must be operational to
         track the amount of fuel transferred.
         4.6.5.7.2. Transfer from only one tank at a time.
         4.6.5.7.3. Transfer no more than 1,000 pounds at a time between the tanks with the
         inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance.
  4.6.6. Antiskid System:
     4.6.6.1. The antiskid may be inoperative for flight to a destination with repair capability.
     Required en route stops are authorized. The mission is restricted to one termination
     landing per sortie.
     4.6.6.2. A local training flight may continue once airborne if the antiskid fails provided
     the system is turned off. The mission is restricted to one termination landing.
     4.6.6.3. Assault operations are not authorized with antiskid inoperative.
  4.6.7. Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop
  landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
  EXCEPTION: If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that
  further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown
  to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down
  and locked position. Required en route stops are authorized.
     4.6.7.1. ACs should notify appropriate CC prior to flying with landing gear down and
     locked.
  4.6.8. Doors and Ramp System:
34                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        4.6.8.1. Aircraft will not depart on a pressurized flight unless the door warning light
        system for the cargo ramp is operative.
        4.6.8.2. Aircraft will not be flown with a crew entrance door or crew entrance door
        warning light malfunction.
        4.6.8.3. Aircraft will not be flown pressurized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction.
        Unpressurized flight may be authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction when
        mission requirements dictate.
     4.6.9. Radar. Weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of known or
     forecast thunderstorms.
     4.6.10. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). The CVR will be operational for all departures
     unless parts are not available on station to repair the unit. Passengers will not be flown
     without an operative CVR. If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and terminating
     the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement table 4.1. (See Chapter 1)
4.8. Definitions (Specific to this Chapter):
     4.8.1. Home Station. Home bases of assignment for aircraft. Aircraft will not depart their
     home stations unless home station requirements are met. EXCEPTION: During
     contingencies en route criteria will apply to all aircraft departures.
     4.8.2. En route. En route locations where C-130 maintenance repair capability exists. An en
     route station has the necessary skilled USAF (or USAF contract maintenance personnel),
     support equipment, and technical data available to accomplish most repairs.
     4.8.3. Local Training. A mission that departs home station to perform home station transition
     training, or airdrop training, and returns in the same day.
     4.8.4. Off-Station Training. A mission that departs home station to perform training, as
     directed by the wing commander, without returning the same day. These missions will be
     supported by deployed home station logistics.
4.9. Navigation Systems:
     4.9.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the
     North Atlantic Region or the Composite Hawaii/Mainland US Route System, the following
     fully operable navigation systems are considered the minimum necessary to permit
     compliance.
        4.9.1.1. SCNS aircraft. Fully operational SCNS, to include the navigator‘s, pilot‘s, and
        copilot‘s IDCU.
        4.9.1.2. Compass systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational.
        If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is
        affected. Two independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass and one aligned
        inertial system are required. The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate
        source for the purposes of this paragraph.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  35


   4.9.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the PIC determines the minimum
   navigational capability required to safely accomplish the mission. Consider the following:
   length and route of flight, weather, and experience and proficiency of the crew.
   4.9.3. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory.
   Loss of any component before track entry requires return to a station with maintenance
   capability or re-filing via specified routes.
   4.9.4. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. HC-130 aircraft are approved for
   BRNAV operations. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5. Pilots will
   immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into BRNAV
   airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or
   failures of RNP required equipment.
       4.9.4.1. BRNAV operations require at least one fully operational INS system.
       4.9.4.2. The Maximum time limit for BRNAV operations is 9.6 hours. This time limit is
       contingent on performing a medium accuracy alignment of the aircraft INU. Once the
       time limit is reached, the aircraft must perform a ground based realignment of the INU in
       order to maintain compliance with and continue flight in BRNAV airspace.
       4.9.4.3. While operating in civil-controlled airspace, the aircraft must be flown in INS-
       only and with the autopilot engaged.
4.10. HC-130P aircraft exceeding 38,000 Equivalent Baseline Hours (EBH). In addition to
flight manual restrictions, aircrews will adhere to the following training restrictions when
operating HC-130P aircraft that have reached 38,000 EBH. Aircraft inspected and repaired IAW
TCTO 1C-130-1908 are not restricted: NOTE: Use the following guidance when complying
with remaining subparagraphs. The low level environment is defined as operations conducted
below 3,000 feet above ground level (AGL). The Aeronautical Information Manual defines areas
of mountainous terrain in Figure 4.1
   4.10.1. The following restrictions apply:
       4.10.1.1. Do not exceed 190 KIAS below 3,000 feet AGL.
       4.10.1.2. Flight is prohibited when turbulence is forecasted or reported to be moderate or
       greater.
       4.10.1.3. Flight is prohibited below 3,000 feet AGL in mountainous terrain when the
       winds are forecasted or reported to exceed 35 knots in the low level environment (below
       3,000 feet AGL). This applies to areas of transition (takeoff or landing) and operations
       below the crests of any ridgeline within 50 NM.
       4.10.1.4. Crews will not conduct search patterns or rescue airdrop patterns in
       mountainous terrain if winds exceed 15 knots at an altitude that is 1,000 feet above the
       intended rescue airdrop/search pattern altitude or 1,000 feet above the crest of any
       ridgeline within 20 NM, whichever is higher.
       4.10.1.5. The following maneuvers are prohibited regardless of altitude: Threat
       maneuvering and tactical recoveries. Exception: self contained approaches (straight-in or
       closed pattern).

     4.10.2. The OG/CC may waive these restrictions when the use of a restricted HC-130P is
     required for operations contingencies (does not apply to the restrictions listed in the flight
     manual).
     4.10.3. Crews should minimize aircraft exposure time during low-level operations. It is
     recommended not to exceed 30 degrees of bank with any flap extension and 50 degrees of
     bank with a clean configuration.

5.1. Aircraft Maximum Gross Weight Policy. Aircraft maximum gross weight is 155,000
pounds. Waiver authority for operations above 155,000 pounds is MAJCOM/A3T (AFRC/A3
for AFRC) or deployed equivalent. For Overload Gross Weight, the maximum waiverable gross
weight is 175,000 pounds. NOTE: AFRC/A3 delegates the waiver authority for AFRC HC-130
operations above 155k up to 165k to the WG/CC.
   5.1.1. Fuel Conservation. Aircrews and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a
   limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout
   all phases of mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to
   aircraft gross weight and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond
   optimum requirements for safe mission accomplishments and training objectives. Aircrew
   and flight planners will optimize flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight
   procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power settings should also be considered for
   efficient fuel usage. Aircrews should employ the following aviation fuel optimization
   measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
   accomplishment:
      5.1.1.1. Optimize fuel loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel
      5.1.1.2. Minimize GTC/APU use.
      5.1.1.3. Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engine start time
      standards
      5.1.1.4. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of
      equipment not necessary to accomplish mission
      5.1.1.5. Establish C2 and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification of
      mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time
      5.1.1.6. Aircrew Evaluations. Fuel conservation will be an interest item on all aircrew
      evaluations. Evaluators/instructors will reinforce the importance of optimizing fuel loads,
      start/taxi procedures, and fuel efficient mission execution.
5.2. Takeoff and Landing Policy:
   5.2.1. The pilot in command (PIC) will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs
   and landings.
   5.2.2. Instructor and flight examiner pilots may takeoff or land from either seat under any
   condition.
   5.2.3. An AC qualified pilot may make takeoffs and landings from either seat. Comply with
   paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4.
   5.2.4. An AC qualified pilot will land from the left seat during:
      5.2.4.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.

   airland events will become a currency requirement and required evaluation event for periodic
   mission evaluations.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operation.
   5.5.1. The pilot in the right seat will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing gear only
   after command of the pilot flying the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the other
   pilot will acknowledge the command by repeating it. EXCEPTION: Not required during
   Infil/Exfil checklist.
   5.5.2. The non-flying pilot will operate the flaps for all non-tactical checklists
   5.5.3. The flight engineer may operate the flaps during tactical checklists. EXCEPTION:

   5.5.4. Operate the flaps only at the direction of the flying pilot.
   5.5.5. The non-flying pilot or flight engineer will acknowledge the command by repeating it.
5.6. Use of Outside Observers. To the maximum extent possible, crewmembers should assist
in scanning/clearing outside during all taxi operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures
below 10,000 ft. MSL duties permitting.
5.7. Seat Belts. Crewmembers occupying either the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer seat will
have seat belts fastened at all times.
   5.7.1. All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoff and landing.
   EXCEPTION:          Flight examiners, instructors, mission commanders, crewmembers
   performing scanner duties, outside observers during taxi, flight engineers, medical personnel,
   and loadmasters performing required duties are exempt; however, they will have a designated
   seat (spot for combat loading procedures) and required restraint available.
   5.7.2. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat
   belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air
   turbulence.
   5.7.3. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated U.S. forces and foreign counterparts
   during operations, exercises, and training. Aircraft commanders will ensure personnel are
   secured with a cargo strap during floor loading operations.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting:
   5.8.1. For single ship, non-tactical operations refer to AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   Use taxi lights during all taxi operations. EXCEPTION: When taxi lights have IR lens
   covers installed, use the landing lights instead. Use landing lights at night in unlit areas. Use
   taxi lights in-flight any time the landing gear is extended, unless reflections cause pilot
   distractions. Formation and leading edge lights should be on during operations below 10,000
   feet AGL. Landing lights may be used continuously during local traffic pattern training and
   low altitude maneuvering in high-density traffic areas.
   5.8.2. NVG operations may dictate that external lights are turned off or IR lenses are
   installed. Conduct training operations with reduced or no external lighting within the
   confines of designated restricted areas, warning areas. Lights out operations in MOAs may
   be conducted IAW AFFSA ACC waiver Vol 3/20031.

5.9. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Any
crewmember seeing a 200-foot or greater deviation in planned altitude, deviations in heading or
airspeed, or potential terrain or obstruction clearance problems will notify the pilot immediately.
     5.9.1. The non flying pilot will make the following advisory calls to the flying pilot:
        5.9.1.1. During takeoff roll, the non-flying pilot will state ―Go‖ at refusal speed. Any
        crewmember noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing ―Go‖ will state ―Reject‖
        and give a brief description of the malfunction.
        5.9.1.2. Climb out:
            5.9.1.2.1. Transition altitude.
            5.9.1.2.2. One thousand feet below assigned altitude.

            5.9.1.3.4. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.
        5.9.1.4. Non-precision Approaches:
            5.9.1.4.1. One hundred feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA).
            5.9.1.4.2. ―Minimums‖ at MDA.
            5.9.1.4.3. ―Runway in sight.‖ Called when sufficient visual reference with the
            runway environment is established and the aircraft is in a safe position to land.
            5.9.1.4.4. ―Go around.‖ Called at the missed approach point when visual reference
            with the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach or any time the
            approach becomes unsafe.
        5.9.1.5. Precision Approaches:
            5.9.1.5.1. One hundred feet above decision height (DH).
            5.9.1.5.2. ―Continue.‖ Call at DH if only the approach light system is in sight but the
            aircraft is otherwise in a position for a safe landing. If an approach is continued
            below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility
            minimums), ―go-around‖ must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot
            be made.
            5.9.1.5.3. ―Land.‖ Call at DH or later if runway (or red terminating bars or red side
            row bars) is in sight and the aircraft is in a position for a normal landing.
            5.9.1.5.4. ―Go around.‖ Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not in sight
            or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. If an approach is continued
            below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility
            minimums), ―go-around‖ must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot
            be made.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 41


5.10. Communications Policy:
   5.10.1. Aircraft Interphone: All crewmembers will monitor interphone. Crewmembers will
   notify the AC before going off and when back on headset.
       5.10.1.1. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio
       transmissions.
       5.10.1.2. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit
       voice recorder (CVR) if it is operating. Ensure the CVR remains on and running for 30
       minutes until the tape is clear of any recorded classified conversations. If classified
       information is discussed while the FLIR voice recorder is used in flight, the VHS tape
       must be turned into Intel to be classified upon landing. If en route, have the classified
       courier maintain the VHS tape until the tape has been properly classified.
       5.10.1.3. Non-aircrew members may monitor interphone or radio transmissions only
       when specifically approved by the AC. The AC will ensure the communications policy is
       briefed to these personnel prior to flight. The AC must ensure no one monitors classified
       information for which they are not cleared or transmits classified information over the
       radios.
   5.10.2. Command Radios:
       5.10.2.1. The pilot operating the command radios will inform the crew which radio is
       primary.
       5.10.2.2. The non-flying pilot normally makes all primary radio calls.
       5.10.2.3. All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to
       do otherwise by the AC or subsequent chapters of this instruction. If the crew does not
       have an AMSS, the AC will designate crewmembers required to monitor the HF and/or
       SATCOM radio.
       5.10.2.4. During emergencies, monitor simultaneous UHF and VHF transmissions, if
       able, when operating in a terminal area under radar control.
       5.10.2.5. One of the pilots will record and read back all ATC clearances. The navigator
       or AMSS will record the clearance and monitor the read back. This includes all
       transmissions pertaining to ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach
       procedures. This may be disregarded when ATC instructions require immediate
       execution, or when such action interferes with timely completion of more important
       duties.
5.11. Wind Limitations. Maximum crosswind limits are in accordance with flight manual
limitations. All maximum effort operations and simulated engine out landings (one or two
engine inop) must fall within the ―recommended‖ area unless otherwise approved by the group
commander, or COMAFFOR.
5.12. RCR and RSC. Reference T.O. 1C-130(MDS)-1-1 and AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130.The
runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
The RCR values listed in Table 5.1 are estimates based on operational experience and should be
used only as a guide.

     5.12.1. Limit C-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering
     of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one
     inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than one inch of slush or water is
     present may not be accurate.
5.13. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are
met during flight operations.        Acceptance of a visual or contact approach clearance, or
instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the pilot will maintain a safe interval
for wake turbulence avoidance. The following instructions expand wake turbulence avoidance
criteria, but do not replace guidance in DOD FLIP planning.
     5.13.1. For VFR traffic patterns behind heavy aircraft follow the "Vortex Avoidance
     Procedures" in FLIP General Planning.
     5.13.2. Low approaches behind heavy aircraft will be flown such that the aircraft remains
     well above the flight path of the heavy aircraft.
     5.13.3. Pilots operating under IFR into civil airports will ensure 10 miles or 4 minutes
     separation from heavy aircraft (departure and arrival).
5.14. LZ Markings. LZ markings may vary depending upon the supporting agency (refer to
AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations). The markings to be used must be
established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.
5.15. Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Requirements (ARFF). ARFF requirements at non-
USAF active flying bases are as follows:
     5.15.1. Up to four takeoffs and landings within 14 consecutive days may be accomplished at
     a Landing Zone (LZ) or airfield without ARFF. This is an airfield restriction. Each
     Group/Wing should track landing totals at airfields under their control. If landing totals are
     not tracked at airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Wing/Group current ops will
     track landings to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.
     5.15.2. For more frequent operations at an LZ or airfield, refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft
     Fire Protection for Military Operations Other Than War, and AFI 13-217 to calculate ARFF
     requirements. NOTE: Non-USAF ARFF vehicles may be used if the agent and pumping
     capabilities are equivalent.
     5.15.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
     Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  43


5.16. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures
whenever practical. All speeds and distances will be computed ―without nose wheel steering.‖
For mission accomplishment the PIC may authorize ―with nose wheel steering‖ corrections IAW
performance manual guidance.
   5.16.1. Normal Operations: Minimum runway width is 80 feet or 25 meters. Minimum
   taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
       5.16.1.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is the greater of balanced or unbalanced
       critical field length.
          5.16.1.1.1. Runway Length for Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the pilot flying
          will initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.
          The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
          5.16.1.1.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
          environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a
          safe takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway
          remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
       5.16.1.2. Landing.   Minimum runway length is landing distance plus the following
       corrections:
          5.16.1.2.1. Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 40 (3/4 mile) – add 1,000 feet.
          5.16.1.2.2. RVR equal to or greater than 40 (3/4 mile) – add 500 feet.
          5.16.1.2.3. If runway length available for landing is less than required by the
          previous criteria, crews may use landing ground roll plus 1,000 feet when approved
          by the squadron commander. In this case, you must ensure the landing touchdown is
          in the first 500 feet of the runway.
   5.16.2. Short Field Operations: Minimum runway width is 60 feet or 19 meters. Minimum
   taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
       5.16.2.1. Only assault landing qualified crews may use short field procedures. Use of
       non-hard surfaced runways or taxiways requires group commander, or deployed
       equivalent approval. Detailed procedures can be found in AFTTP 3-1.33, Tactical
       Employment-HC/MC-130.
       5.16.2.2. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is charted minimum field length for
       maximum effort takeoff (MFLMETO). If runway available is greater than MFLMETO,
       then correct for one-engine inoperative air minimum control speed in ground effect
       (Vmca). Takeoff will be made at Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater.
       5.16.2.3. When obstacles are a factor, use actual maximum effort takeoff speed (1.2 x
       power-on stall speed) and climb out at maximum effort obstacle clearance speed (1.3 x
       power-on stall speeds).
       5.16.2.4. If runway available is less than MFLMETO corrected for Vmca, use Vmeto.
       Pilot may choose to use runway remaining at Vmeto to accelerate toward Vmca.
       WARNING: Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is based on obtaining, and then
       maintaining obstacle clearance speed as quickly as possible. Aircraft performance below
       obstacle clearance speed may not allow safe clearance of obstacles.

        5.16.2.5. Landing. Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 feet.
        5.16.2.6. Training:
           5.16.2.6.1. Minimum runway length is 3,000 feet.
           5.16.2.6.2. Compute landing performance with 2 engines in reverse, 2 engines in
           ground idle and full brakes.
           5.16.2.6.3. Takeoff speed will be Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater.
           5.16.2.6.4. Obstacle clearance speed will be actual maximum effort obstacle
           clearance speed, or 10 knots above takeoff speed, whichever is greater.
           5.16.2.6.5. Climb until clear of the simulated obstacle at obstacle clearance speed
           used.
           5.16.2.6.6. Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual max effort speeds
           (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis.
     5.16.3. NVG Operations:
        5.16.3.1. NVG operations may be conducted using normal or short field operational
        procedures.
        5.16.3.2. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is charted MFLMETO.
        5.16.3.3. Landing:
           5.16.3.3.1. Minimum runway length using normal procedures is in accordance with
           paragraph 5.16.1.2
           5.16.3.3.2. Minimum runway length using max effort procedures is ground roll plus
           500 feet if a 500 foot touchdown zone is clearly marked on the runway. If the
           touchdown zone is greater than 500 feet, or unmarked, minimum runway length is
           ground roll plus 1,000 feet. WARNING: On blacked out runways, a go-around
           point will be identified during route study.
        5.16.3.4. Training:
           5.16.3.4.1. Minimum runway length is 3,000 feet.
           5.16.3.4.2. Minimum runway width is 100 feet or 30 meters when an NVG certified
           FP/CP lands from the right seat.
           5.16.3.4.3. Compute landing performance with 2 engines in reverse, 2 engines in
           ground idle and full brakes.
           5.16.3.4.4. Takeoff speed will be Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater, when using
           max effort procedures.
           5.16.3.4.5. Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual max effort speeds
           (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis.
5.17. Operations over Arresting Cables. Avoid landing on (touching down on) arresting
cables (does not include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands on or before the cable, the crew
should contact the tower to have the cable inspected.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                    45


   5.17.1. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 or similar systems are
   installed, with a minimum of eight tiedowns, without regard to the Flight Manual restriction
   on movement over arresting cables. The aircraft should cross the cable on runway centerline
   to avoid damage. When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or
   less than eight tiedowns, use sound judgment to avoid damage to the aircraft. Maintain
   appropriate backpressure on the aircraft yoke during taxi operations to reduce nose landing
   gear down force.
5.18. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria: Without wing walkers, avoid taxi
obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers, by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: Locally
based aircraft may taxi within 25 feet of obstacles without a wing walker when fixed taxi routes
are marked and the obstruction is permanent. Taxi routes must be used by the same model
aircraft for which they were designed and in the specifically designed parking spots. Support
equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas.
   5.18.1. Whenever taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker.           If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane a crewmember to ensure obstruction clearance.
       5.18.1.1. Use low speed ground idle when practical. If foreign object damage (FOD) is a
       problem, the outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway
       conditions, and weather are favorable. Verify all sources of brake pressure before
       shutting down symmetrical engines.
       5.18.1.2. After landing and clearing the runway, with the approval of the AC, the
       loadmaster may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal
       to prepare for cargo offload or onload. Ensure all equipment, cargo, and passengers
       remain secured in the cargo compartment.
5.19. Reverse Taxi.
   5.19.1. The pilot will coordinate engine status/utilization with the flight engineer and taxi
   directions and signals with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi
   operations.
   5.19.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
   5.19.3. Open the aft cargo door. Ramp will be a minimum of 12 inches above horizontal for
   taxi operations.
   5.19.4. The loadmaster will be on the ramp in a position to direct reverse taxi, report any
   hazards, and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance
   remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point. CAUTION: If a
   complete set of ground loading ramps or canary slides are installed, at least one must be
   removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing.
   5.19.5. During reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in
   the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. Avoid taxi obstructions by at least
   25 feet, even if using a wing walker.
   5.19.6. Every effort will be made to avoid the need for reverse taxiing during icy or snowy
   conditions. If unavoidable, extreme caution will be exercised and reverse taxi movement
   will be stopped using throttle control if sliding occurs.
46                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


5.20. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except in combat, emergency conditions, or
rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction. Fuel will not be jettisoned for mission
convenience.
     5.20.1. DELETED.
5.21. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria:
     5.21.1. ASRR Certification Airfields. Aircraft commanders will not make an approach and
     landing into an airfield requiring certification by the ASRR unless they have operated into
     that airfield in the last two years as a pilot, flight pilot/copilot, or observer. See ASRR for
     certification requirements. Waiver authority for certification airfield restrictions is the
     OG/CC.
     5.21.2. During ground operations comply with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
     Movement on the Ground. For contingency operations, the WG/CC may waive minimum
     obstructions clearances to those shown in Figure 5.1 and 5.2. An airfield is considered
     suitable for C-130 operations when:
        5.21.2.1. No obstructions penetrate outside the shaded area of Figure 5.1 This ensures
        obstruction clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 feet of runway centerline
        and the angle of bank does not exceed 5 degrees.
        5.21.2.2. When an obstruction penetrates outside the shaded area of Figure 5.1 specific
        approval by the wing commander or deployed equivalent is required and the AC must be
        advised of the height and location of the obstruction, as well as specific procedures to
        avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle).

Figure 5.1.




        5.21.2.3. Figure 5. 2. depicts minimum obstruction clearance criteria for ground
        operations with the main landing gear on the edge of the operating surface. ACs will be
        advised of any known obstructions that penetrate outside the shaded area.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                    47


Figure 5.2.




5.22. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts may be performed
when required by training syllabus or when approved by the OG/CC. This authority may be
delegated to squadron or mission commanders when the unit is deployed. This authorization will
not be construed to allow repeated buddy or windmill taxi starts at various scheduled en route
stops. Load all passengers after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi start.
5.23. Intersection Takeoffs. Takeoffs will normally be made from the beginning of the
approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely
with the AC. Flight engineers will base TOLD card computations on the runway remaining at
the point the takeoff is initiated.
5.24. Minimum Engine Performance. Minimum engine performance is 95% engine
efficiency. The first take-off of the day should be a static take-off to verify engine performance.
If 95% engine efficiency cannot be obtained on all engines, close engine bleeds and recompute
predicted torque to determine whether an engine or bleed air malfunction exists. In either case
the aircraft will not be flown. CAUTION: Prop blast from engine runs is hazardous to people,
buildings, equipment, and other aircraft. Crews will ensure the area behind the aircraft is clear
before starting an engine run. At no time will an engine run-up be attempted (throttles out of
ground range) unless the aircraft is in an approved engine run-up site or on the active runway.
CAUTION: Request clearance from ground control or tower controller prior to an engine run-
up. Clearance from either ground or tower does not constitute a safe environment for an engine
run. Advise controller anytime prop wash will cross the runway.
5.25. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine
service life.
   5.25.1. During proficiency flights (operations that are primarily confined to the traffic
   pattern) and tactical events, TIT will normally be 970 degrees C for takeoff, not to exceed
48                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     19,600 inch-pounds of torque. Higher power settings may be used, as required, and will be
     briefed by the pilot flying the aircraft.
     5.25.2. Use maximum power for max effort takeoffs (actual or simulated), not to exceed
     19,600 inch-pounds of torque. In order to prevent overtorques and if conditions permit,
     torques of less than 19,600 inch-pounds may be used to simulate max power during training.
5.26. Power Application. To help prevent overtorques, the flight engineer will make a call over
interphone any time torque reaches 17,000 in-lbs. Pilots and flight engineers will monitor torque
as throttles are advanced.
5.27. Three-Engine Takeoffs. Actual engine-out takeoffs require HQ MAJCOM A3 or
deployed equivalent waiver
5.28. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi. Ground crews using
appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft. Aircrews may recover the aircraft at
austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the AC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the
surface will support the aircraft.
5.29. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO). There are two types of onload/offload
operations. They are Normal Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO) and Rapid Onload/Offload
(Rapids). Use EROs whenever practical and time is not critical. The paragraphs below discuss
normal ERO procedures. See Attachment 2 for ERO Checklist. See paragraph 5.30. for
Rapids procedures NOTE: Do not use ERO procedures when explosive cargo (Hazard class
1.1-1.4) is involved unless authorized by the JA/ATT or exercise operation order or contingency
air tasking orders.
     5.29.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
     cargo. The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.
     ACs will assess prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure safe operations.
     5.29.2. General Procedures:
        5.29.2.1. ACs will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
        specific crewmember duties.
        5.29.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and
        radio.
        5.29.2.3. Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable). If conditions warrant,
        open air deflector doors and adjust flaps to further reduce prop blast.
        5.29.2.4. Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs. Taxi lights may be used
        at the discretion of the AC.
        5.29.2.5. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists, and DD Form 365-4,
        Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, for the subsequent sortie. NOTE: DD Form
        365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty.
        5.29.2.6. Resume taxi after the LM has verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready
        to taxi.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                               49


      5.29.2.7. Do not onload or offload through the crew entrance door and ramp, or
      paratroop doors, simultaneously. WARNING: Due to the hazards involved (i.e., prop
      blast, proximity to engines and props, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand
      transferable items of cargo may be onloaded or offloaded through the paratroop doors
      during EROs.
   5.29.3. Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door.
      5.29.3.1. The AC will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.
      5.29.3.2. During onload and offload, station a crewmember (normally the LM) on
      interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 feet and at a 45-degree angle from the
      aircraft axis.
      5.29.3.3. Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.
   5.29.4. Personnel or cargo onload and offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
      5.29.4.1. After the aircraft has slowed to taxi speed, the LM may remove all tiedowns
      except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the
      aircraft is stopped and vehicle drivers are in place. Drivers will not release vehicle
      parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM.
      5.29.4.2. Upon clearance from the AC, open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12
      inches above horizontal.
      5.29.4.3. The LM will direct all onload and offload operations using prebriefed signals.
      Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember when emplaning or deplaning. Deplane
      passengers before cargo and enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location
      dictates otherwise. NOTE: Does not apply to INFIL/EXFIL operations. During
      INFIL/EXFIL operations onload and offload cargo as static trained.
      5.29.4.4. Other qualified LMs may direct the operation, if available, but the crew
      loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
      5.29.4.5. Station the crew loadmaster or another crewmember on interphone and PA in
      the cargo compartment as a safety observer. Safety observers other than the LM will
      remain forward of all cargo.
   5.29.5. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized provided the
   enplaning crew does not approach the aircraft until the deplaning LM on headset is in
   position outside the aircraft.
5.30. Combat Loading. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat
offload, passenger combat loading, and Rapid Onload/Offload procedures (Rapids). See
AFTTP3-3.HC/MC-130 for additional guidance. All personnel in the cargo compartment will be
seated and secured except those personnel having valid duties to perform.
   5.30.1. Combat off-load. Combat off-load provides a means of off-loading single, multiple,
   and married pallets; ramp and airdrop platforms; and CDS containers without the use of
   Material Handling Equipment (MHE). Group commanders or deployed equivalent may
   authorize combat off-load when hostile conditions or similar situations warrant the use of
   these procedures. Basic qualified crews can use combat off-load procedures. Only HC/MC-
50                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     130 aircraft modified with dual rails may conduct combat off-load operations.                 See
     Attachment 2 for expanded combat off-load checklist.
        5.30.1.1. DELETED.
     5.30.2. Passenger Combat Loading. Additional procedures are located in AFTTP3-
     3.HC/MC-130. Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated forces and foreign
     counterparts during operations, exercises, and training. Standard seating configurations
     listed in AFI 11-2HC-130V3, Addendum A, HC-130 Configuration/Mission Planning, are
     recommended, if practical.
        5.30.2.1. DELETED.
        5.30.2.2. When airlifting litter patients, position the litters longitudinally with patients‘
        heads aft and secure each of the litters with a tiedown strap.
            5.30.2.2.1. For one litter, hook the tiedown strap into a floor ring, run laterally,
            wrapping the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the nearest
            to the nearest tiedown ring, and tighten.
            5.30.2.2.2. For two litters side by side, use two tiedown straps for each end. Center
            the inboard handle of each litter over the same ring and hook the hook end of each
            strap to the same ring(into "D" row rings unless mission dictates otherwise), run the
            straps laterally, one left and one right, over each outboard litter handle to the nearest
            tiedown ring, and tighten.
            5.30.2.2.3. For three litters side by side, wrap the straps around adjacent handles.
     5.30.3. Rapids Procedures. These procedures are only authorized when conducting
     Infil/Exfil operations with dedicated unconventional or CSAR/PR forces and foreign
     counterparts. If troops do not provide their own restraining devices, secure personnel using
     passenger combat loading procedures.
        5.30.3.1. Egress and Static Load Training. Conduct static load training prior to all
        Infil/Exfil operations. EXEPTION: For unilateral Infil/Exfil training conducted with
        home-station assigned units using ATV, Quads, Polaris, Gator type vehicles, the OG/CC
        may waive this requirement.

     5.30.3.7. Procedures after Touchdown:
        5.30.3.7.1. Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the pilot states, "Clear
        to open," or as prebriefed. Lower the ramp to the ground once the aircraft has
        stopped, parking break has been set and the pilot states, "Clear to offload."
        CAUTION: Maintain positive control of canary slides/ground loading ramps.
        5.30.3.7.2. Position canary slides/ground loading ramps. NOTE: If a time delay is
        anticipated before onloading, raise the ramp enough to allow the aircraft to taxi in the
        event of an emergency.
        5.30.3.7.3. Complete offload/onload.
        5.30.3.7.4. Raise canary slides/ground loading ramps.
        5.30.3.7.5. Raise the ramp to approximately 12‖ above horizontal.

                           GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 6A— Pre-Mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms.
     6.1.1. Wear the aircrew uniform as outline in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance
     of Air Force Personnel, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement, on all missions; unless
     other attire is authorized (When the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires civilian
     attire, wear conservatively styled clothing).
     6.1.2. All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available during flight and will
     wear them for takeoffs, landings, and when operating in a combat environment. Loadmasters
     will wear gloves for all airdrops and pyrotechnic operations.
     6.1.3. Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
     6.1.4. Arctic clothing is required when engaged in Arctic or Antarctic operations.
6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment.
     6.2.1. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the Foreign Clearance
     Guide.
     6.2.2. Shot Records. Carry shot records on all off-station missions outside the CONUS,
     Alaska, or Hawaii. Aircrew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements for
     the mission.
     6.2.3. Identification Tags. Identification tags should be worn around the neck or carried in a
     flight suit pocket.
     6.2.4. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins,
     clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in the aircraft or on the flightline. EXCEPTION:
     Plain elastic hair fasteners or plastic barrettes are allowed for female crew members,
     providing they do not interfere with the wearing of headsets or helmets, or the donning of
     oxygen equipment. All devices will be accounted for before and after flight.
     6.2.5. Flight Kits. Carry a headset, helmet and oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all
     flights. NOTE: Crewmembers will present their personal helmet and oxygen mask to a life
     support facility for cleaning, maintenance, and communications testing every 30 days.
     6.2.6. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual
     combat missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
        6.2.6.1. Badges will be attached by a lanyard to uniform or displayed on arm band or
        double breakaway lanyard around the neck and will not be displayed from before starting
        engines until engine shut- down
     6.2.7. Reflective Belts. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn IAW local
     directives.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                    53


       6.2.7.1. Deployed commander will direct use in combat zone but will normally be worn
       during night operations.
   6.2.8. Tool and Airdrop Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. Individual units will
   establish requirements for tool kit contents. One LM airdrop kit will be on board for aerial
   delivery missions.
       6.2.8.1. For PDM inputs carry a tool kit containing as a minimum: multi-tool (screw
       drive, pliers, wire cutter) safety wire, fuse pullers and a 3/8‖ wrench.
   6.2.9. Hostile Environment Repair Procedures (HERP) Kit. One HERP Kit will be onboard
   for all OCONUS and contingency deployment missions. Units will identify where the HERP
   Kit will be stored on the aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI. The flight engineer will
   ensure the HERP Kit is onboard and serviceable (sealed) during the aircraft preflight prior to
   departure.
   6.2.10. All crewmembers will carry and perform a thorough preflight their own NVGs prior
   to flight for missions using NVGs. The AC must ensure there is one spare set of preflighted
   NVGs for the flight deck crewmembers (can be either the AMSS or Navigator's set). Each
   crewmember will carry approved spare batteries for their own NVGs.
   6.2.11. Survival and Protective Equipment. All personnel will wear the survival and
   protective gear provided during hostile environment operations. Unit/Deployed commanders
   may amend survival/protective equipment requirements based on the threat. See AFTTP 3-
   3.HC/MC-130 for list of survival/protective equipment.
6.3. FCIF. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Crew members will review the FCIF
before all missions and place initials on AF Form 4121, FCIF Currency Record or document
electronically IAW MAJCOM guidance.
   6.3.1. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF and joining a mission en route will receive an FCIF
   update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor pilots
   flying with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.3.2. Crewmembers without a unit FCIF card (not assigned or attached to the unit) will
   certify FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside their name on
   the file copy of the flight authorization or their ACM orders.
6.4. Airfield Review. Accomplish airfield review IAW AFI 11-202V3.
6.5. Intelligence Briefing. Before departing on missions outside the United States, crews will
receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and
military development in the area in which they will be operating. In theater, aircrews should
receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL), or enroute
stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur. Aircrews will report information of
possible intelligence value to local intelligence officers at completion of each mission.
6.6. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications
specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Units may specify additional publications in their unit
supplement. For multiples of a crew position, each will carry a checklist but otherwise only one
set of publications is required. Units may establish a process to provide these publications

Section 6B— Predeparture

6.7. Authenticators and Classified Material. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators and
other classified materials required for the area being transited. Carry authenticators when flying
into an ADIZ, participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified
in operation plans.
   6.7.1. The COMSEC material required depends on the theater of operation and user. The
   base COMSEC custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in
   obtaining the material required for the mission. Base Operations at AMC bases maintains the
   COMSEC material used on most missions.
   6.7.2. Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at your ultimate destination and
   obtain receipts for classified material. Command Posts may provide temporary storage for
   authenticators/classified materials during ground time at en route stops. Issue and turn-in of
   authenticators is normally a function of Base Operations. At locations where no storage
   facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the aircraft safe, if available.
   6.7.3. Remove classified information stored in any electronic devices.
   6.7.4. Clear all TRANSEC systems, such as secure voice and IFF.
   6.7.5. In the event of an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment
   prior to crash landing or bailout, if possible.
6.8. Narcotics. Maintain narcotics in the pararescue medical kits in accordance with
appropriate directives.
6.9. Mission Kits. Units will maintain one mission kit per aircraft. EXCEPTION: FTUs will
establish the number and content of the mission kits for their assigned aircraft.) Prior to off-
station departures, the AC will ensure a current mission kit is on board the aircraft. The kit will
contain, but is not limited to the items listed in Table 6.2 Items required by a unit or wing
directive to be carried by an individual crewmember need not be duplicated in the mission kit.
Maintain sufficient quantities of directives and planning documents to allow implementation of
evacuation and contingency plans.

NOTE: Units may modify the global kit to carry only FLIP documents for the theater in which
the mission will operate.
6.11. Briefing Requirements.
   6.11.1. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide mission essential
   information. Refer to the appropriate briefing guides for content.
   6.11.2. Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission.
   EXCEPTION: When premission requirements dictate, PIC may excuse certain
   crewmembers from the briefing. The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-
   face briefing prior to engine start.
6.12. Call Signs. Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives for
all missions except local area training missions. Use squadron or wing static call signs as
directed for local area training missions.
   6.12.1. Aeromedical Evacuation. Preface normal call sign with ―AIR EVAC‖ when patients
   are on board.
   6.12.2. Search and Rescue (SAR). When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the
   call sign ―AIR FORCE RESCUE‖ plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.13. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation. This does not preclude VFR training to
maintain proficiency in mission essential VFR operations.
6.14. Sensitive Mission Operations:
   6.14.1. Certain missions require special flight planning procedures or deceptive measures.
   Mission operating directives, MAJCOM/CC operations orders, or other tasking orders will
   direct use of these procedures. Aircrews should be briefed on modification to normal
   procedures prior to execution of the operation. The MAJCOM/CC or COMAFFOR will
   approve missions requiring coordination with non-ACC agencies prior to execution.
   6.14.2. The planning agency tasked with the mission will provide the aircrew with the
   following information:
       6.14.2.1. Departure procedures.
58                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        6.14.2.2. En route procedures to include tracks, ALTRVs, MARSA, tanker rendezvous,
        and emergency divert procedures.
        6.14.2.3. Arrival procedures.
        6.14.2.4. All communications requirements.
6.15. Due Regard Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in
international airspace over the high seas, and in-flight operational requirements conflict with
ICAO rules and procedures, the AC may make the decision to proceed using "Due Regard"
procedures in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and FLIP GP.
6.16. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
     6.16.1. Flight Plans. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or
     furnished by another agency, the PIC and navigator will verify routes and flight altitudes to
     ensure proper terrain clearance. The navigator who prepares or accepts the flight plan will
     remain on duty at the navigator‘s station during departure and will brief the relieving
     navigator thoroughly on all en route and destination hazards.
     6.16.2. The flight engineer will complete the AF Form 4064 and the AF Form 4063 or
     locally developed version, in accordance with Chapter 12. A pilot crewmember or additional
     flight engineer will cross check the AF Form 4064/4063 for accuracy by using the
     performance manual, TOLD computer, or approved tabulated data. As a minimum, the
     person checking the data will:
        6.16.2.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF Form 4063/4064 .
        6.16.2.2. Cross-check air minimum control Vmca (one engine inop in ground effect),
        takeoff, and landing speeds.
        6.16.2.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
        (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.
6.17. Fuel Planning. Accomplish fuel planning in accordance with the certified automated
mission planning software or appropriate fuel planning publications listed in Chapter 11. Flying
at long-range cruise at the cruise ceiling conserves the most fuel and is encouraged, but the pilot
in command may elect to fly at other speeds and altitudes deemed appropriate for the mission.
Use primary fuel management, in accordance with the aircraft flight manual, whenever practical.
     6.17.1. Add extra fuel:
        6.17.1.1. When extra fuel is unavailable at en route stops; when compressed ground
        times during single-day, multi-sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or,
        when en route refueling would delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.
        6.17.1.2. When passengers or patients are on board, to recover to a suitable airfield from
        the Equal Time Point (ETP) at 10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight.
        6.17.1.3. Fuel Conservation. Make every reasonable effort to conserve fuel. Some
        recommended methods are:
        6.17.1.4. Cruise at optimum altitude. Step climb if practical.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  59


      6.17.1.5. Fly missions at the most fuel conservative cruise speed option. On missions
      that are time- rather than distance-oriented, consider flying the lowest practical cruise
      option. Aircraft commanders are encouraged to fly long-range cruise airspeeds on other
      missions, if practical.
      6.17.1.6. Use low speed ground idle or two engine symmetrical power when practical for
      ground operation.
      6.17.1.7. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each
      pound of fuel consumed. As a technique, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5
      knots for each 1,000 feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase
      more than 5 knots for each 1,000 feet of altitude decrease. Do not fly above cruise
      ceiling.
   6.17.2. Required Fuel At Destination. Minimum fuel overhead destination or alternate is
   7,000 pounds. Land with a minimum of 6,000 pounds fuel remaining.
6.18. Departure Planning.
   6.18.1. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures, this chapter,
   and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown
   (IFR/VFR), review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument
   approach plate, NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. The PIC will
   provide the obstacle height, distance, and gradient information necessary for performance
   computations to the flight engineer.
   6.18.2. VFR Departures. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is
   determined by ensuring all the following conditions are met:
      6.18.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the departure
      route.
      6.18.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
      emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
   6.18.3. IFR Departures. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
   6.18.4. DELETED.
   6.18.5. DELETED.
   6.18.6. OG/CC or equivalent must approve takeoff if departure alternates are required.

     greater (visibility ¼ miles or greater):   representative                         1 and 2)

     Below either authorized ceiling or           Authorized if the mission is higher Required
     visibility minimums and RVR is less          headquarters directed and takeoff    (see notes
     than 1600 but equal to or greater than       is approved by the OG/CC or          1, 2 and 3)
     1000.                                        designated representative.
     Notes:
     1. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following
     conditions:

       a. Alternate must be located within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
     equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
     hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400).

     -OR-

       b. Alternate must be located within 2 hours flying time, with weather to be at least 500-1
     above the approach minimums, but no lower than 700-2 for a precision approach or 800-2
     for a non-precision approach for ETA at the alternate +/- 1 hour.

     2. Aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA to the alternate using one engine
     inoperative (OEI) performance criteria.

     3. Departure runway must have operational centerline lighting and dual RVR readouts and
     displays for both the approach and departure end of runway (RVR must be at or greater
     than 1000 at both the approach end and departure end and runway). For runways with
     triple RVR readouts, the pilot may use any two consecutive read-outs to determine if the
     runway is usable for departure (aircraft performance permitting). For example: Approach
     end RVR=800, midfield RVR=1200, departure end RVR=1000. If aircraft performance
     and runway length will permit taking off at midfield, this runway is usable for takeoff.

6.19. Departure Climbout. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument
Flight Procedures, for IFR and VFR Departures requirements.
     6.19.1. Adverse Weather Planning. All missions should be planned to avoid areas of
     severe weather, including icing or severe turbulence. Avoid thunderstorms and
     cumulonimbus clouds (CBs) using the following criteria:
         6.19.1.1. Climb Out, En route, and Descent:
             6.19.1.1.1. FL 230 and Above: 20 NM.
             6.19.1.1.2. Below FL 230: 10 NM.
             6.19.1.1.3. Low level operations: 5 NM.
             6.19.1.1.4. Clear the top of a known or suspected severe thunderstorm by at least
             1,000 feet altitude for each 10 knots of wind speed at the cloud top. Avoid gust fronts
             and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 61


          6.19.1.1.5. Avoid the rain shaft and cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs using the
          criteria of paragraphs 6.19.1.1, 6.19.1.2 and 6.18.1.3 WARNING; Do not fly under
          the anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud.
          6.19.1.1.6. Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of
          a ground-based radar with a weather painting capability. When relying exclusively on
          ground-based radar for weather avoidance and the ground controller is unable to
          provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
              6.19.1.1.6.1. Changing routing.
              6.19.1.1.6.2. Diverting to alternate.
              6.19.1.1.6.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance if unable
              to maintain VMC in an area of significant weather and the ground radar facility
              cannot provide weather avoidance service.
          6.19.1.1.7. The use of ground-based radar as the primary means of thunderstorm
          avoidance should be used only to depart an area of significant weather. It should
          never be considered a normal avoidance procedure.
      6.19.1.2. Takeoff and Landing. The size and intensity of thunderstorms or CBs are so
      variable that the aircraft commander must determine avoidance criteria to be used during
      takeoff and landing. Takeoff and landing may be made without regard to the criteria in
      paragraph 6.19.1.1 provided:
          6.19.1.2.1. The thunderstorm or CBs and associated gust front, if present, can be
          avoided.
          6.19.1.2.2. The distance from the thunderstorm or CBs is increased as soon as
          possible after takeoff to meet the criteria in paragraph 6.19.1.1
          6.19.1.2.3. A missed approach course from the missed approach point is available
          which will provide separation similar to that for departures.
          6.19.1.2.4. The aircraft is not flown below thunderstorms, CBs, or through the rain
          shaft associated with these clouds.
      6.19.1.3. Lightning Avoidance. Lightning occurs at all levels in a thunderstorm. The
      majority of lightning discharges never strikes the ground but occur between clouds or
      within the same cloud at nearly all temperatures and altitudes. Lightning also occurs in
      the clear air around the top and sides of storms.
6.20. Arrival Planning.
   6.20.1. Destination Weather. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 for weather requirements for
   destination and alternate requirements.
   6.20.2. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Ops Group commanders will develop
   ORM guidelines to identify and mitigate acceptable levels of risk for performing contingency
   and training operations. Risk is inherent in flying operations but should be minimized
   consistent with achieving mission accomplishment and training objectives.

Section 6C—Preflight
62                                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


6.21. Preflight. The pre-flight inspection is a flight preparedness inspection done in accordance
with the -6 maintenance requirements manual and the -1 flight manual (as applicable). The pre-
flight inspection includes visually examining the aerospace vehicle and operationally checking
certain systems and components to ensure there are no serious defects or malfunctions.
     6.21.1. A preflight will be required prior to the first flight of the flying period, or when the
     preflight validity period has expired, or a maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
     6.21.2. Aircraft Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements. The aircraft dash one
     preflight inspection will remain valid until aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours
     provided the aircraft is sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
     Refer to paragraph 6.22 for alert aircraft requirements.
     6.21.3. Dash One preflight inspections are normally done in preparation for flight by the
     aircrew assigned to fly the mission designated for that aircraft. Having a partial aircrew, not
     scheduled to fly, accomplish multiple preflights on aircraft not scheduled for the next day‘s
     mission should not normally be accomplished, except to prepare for OREs, ORIs, and
     contingencies.
     6.21.4. When an aerospace vehicle is mobilizing for deployment, units are authorized to
     place the aerospace vehicle on alert status. It must be prepared in accordance with established
     technical orders, accepted by an aircrew, remain under the control of operations, and be
     monitored by maintenance. When sealing an aerospace vehicle, accomplish a complete pre-
     flight inspection prior to sealing the aircraft and again before flight after completion of the
     alert status if the pre- flight validity period has been exceeded. Consequently, further
     preflight inspection or certification of a pre-flight inspection is not required during the alert
     period.
     6.21.5. When placing an aerospace vehicle on alert status, accomplish a complete pre-flight
     inspection prior to going on alert and again before flight after completion of the alert period
     if the pre-flight validity period has been exceeded. Consequently, further preflight inspection
     or certification of a pre-flight inspection is not required during the alert period. (Placing a
     unit on alert does not in itself place the unit‘s aerospace vehicle on alert status).
     6.21.6. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick-turn, a thorough visual
     inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or
     servicing.
6.22. Alert Aircraft. Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows:
     6.22.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
     6.22.2. Whenever operationally feasible, have a crew other than the alert crew preflight the
     alert aircraft. If this is not feasible, follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.6.5
     6.22.3. Aircraft preflight times should align with the alert period and aircraft preflight
     validity period, eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period.
     6.22.4. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided
     the following conditions are met:
        6.22.4.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission
        requirements.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  63


     6.22.4.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency.
     6.22.4.3. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
     area.
     6.22.4.4. The provisions of paragraph 3.6.5.2 are followed.
  6.22.5. Maintenance Thru-Flight Inspections.
     6.22.5.1. IAW T.O. 00-20-1, the maintenance thru-flight inspection is a between flights
     inspection and will be accomplished after each flight when a turnaround sortie,
     continuation flight or continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection
     is not required. The thru-flight inspection consists of checking the aerospace vehicle for
     flight continuance by performing visual examination and/or operational checks of certain
     components, areas, or systems, according to established TOs to ensure that no defects
     exist which would be detrimental to further flight.
     6.22.5.2. IAW T.O. 00-20-1, the thru-flight inspection is a between flights inspection and
     will be accomplished after each flight when a turnaround sortie, continuation flight or
     continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection is not required. The
     thru-flight inspection consists of checking the aerospace vehicle for flight continuance by
     performing visual examination and/or operational checks of certain components, areas, or
     systems, according to established TOs to ensure that no defects exist which would be
     detrimental to further flight.
     6.22.5.3. If maintenance actions are not required, (Alpha-1), the aircraft can be resealed
     for alert once the aircraft servicing is complete. A new aircrew preflight is not required
     until the end of the preflight validity period (72 hours).
     6.22.5.4. If maintenance actions are required (Alpha-2) and the preflight validity period
     has time remaining, the aircrew may reseal the aircraft after thorough inspection of
     maintenance actions.
     6.22.5.5. If prolonged maintenance is required (Alpha-3), the Squadron/Deployed
     Commander will release the aircraft to maintenance for repairs. Normally a complete
     maintenance Dash Six and aircrew Dash One pre-flights are required if major
     maintenance is accomplished. If minor maintenance is accomplished and the aircraft is
     capable of returning to alert status within normal turnaround times, the flight engineer
     may inspect the affected area and place the aircraft back on alert status provided time
     remains on the alert preflight validity period.
  6.22.6. Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, a complete aircrew
  preflight is required.
  6.22.7. Consider alert aircraft off-limits to all personnel except alert crewmembers. No
  maintenance may be performed on the aircraft without approval of the unit/mission
  commander. NOTE: With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and
  T.O. 1C-130-9 section VI cargo), loadmasters may be alerted before the rest of the crew.
  Base the aircrew FDP/CDP on the loadmaster‘s show time.
  6.22.8. A DD Form 365-4 will be prepared for the alert aircraft. Alert crews are authorized
  to prepare a TOLD card using the worst weather conditions expected for the alert period. Use
64                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     the TOLD data for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD
     for the existing weather conditions.
     6.22.9. When a preflighted alert aircraft changes, or an alert crew change occurs and the
     same aircraft remains on alert, the oncoming crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the
     aircraft and check applicable items listed below:
        6.22.9.1. Aircraft Forms; AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
        Document, AFTO 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, and AFTO
        781K, Aerospace Vehicle Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection and Delayed
        Discrepancy Document.
        6.22.9.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
        6.22.9.3. Fuel quantity.
        6.22.9.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
        6.22.9.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
        6.22.9.6. Liquid oxygen quantity.
        6.22.9.7. Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges.
        6.22.9.8. Publications.
     6.22.10. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the flight engineer will ensure an entry is
     made in the AFTO Form 781A stating at a minimum the date and time the aircraft was
     preflighted.
6.23. AFTO Form 781.
     6.23.1. Review the aircraft forms before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
     systems. The exceptional release (ER) must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
     maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER. If one of these
     individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER. Ensure that the DD1896, Jet Fuel
     Identaplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.
     6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
     that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
     another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
     Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. One-
     time flight approval authority is HQ ACC/A3. The PIC's concurrence is required before the
     aircraft can be flown.
     6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
     Chapter 12.
     6.23.4. The chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the AFMC
     repair team must first authorize the release.
     6.23.5. After the maintenance release is obtained, contact HQ ACC/A3, via Stan/Eval
     channels, for flight authorization. AFRC crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1.
6.24. IFF/SIF Operations.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                      65


   6.24.1. Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self-test or
   ground radar interrogator.
       6.24.1.1. If the self-test fails and radar facilities do not permit a ground check, takeoff is
       authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish an
       airborne check immediately after takeoff.
       6.24.1.2. Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative IFF/SIF without the approval of
       ATC and the AC. (Exception: Formations must have at least one operational IFF/SIF
       per element.) If mode 4 fails in-flight, the IFF/SIF unit will be repaired prior to the next
       flight and/or the aircraft will land for repairs, except for the following:
          6.24.1.2.1. Missions that are generated within CONUS and do not plan to penetrate
          the ADIZ.
          6.24.1.2.2. Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or return to base for
          mode 4 failure would seriously degrade mission effectiveness (i.e., presidential
          support, disaster relief, SAR, aeromedical evacuation, etc.)
          6.24.1.2.3. Use the IFF/SIF in accordance with Table 6.5 NOTE: Once set and
          transmitted, IFF/SIF modes 1, 2, and 3/A codes are unclassified and may be left in the
          transponder.

6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.25.1. Aircraft Refueling. Crewmembers qualified in refueling may perform refueling
   duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support. Crew chiefs should be
   scheduled on those missions where a need is anticipated. Two qualified personnel are
   required. Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
       6.25.1.1. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous aircraft refueling/defueling and
       cargo loading or maintenance operations are authorized in accordance with T.O. 00-25-
       172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static grounding/Bonding. Refueling or defueling

        with passengers or patients on board is only authorized for aeromedical evacuation
        missions.
        6.25.1.2. FARP/Hot Gas Operations. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.33 and Chapter 17 of this
        instruction.
     6.25.2. Under no conditions are crewmembers allowed to service liquid oxygen.
     6.25.3. DELETED.
        6.25.3.1. DELETED.
            6.25.3.1.1. DELETED.
6.26. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills
the minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a
portable fire extinguisher for added fire protection.
     6.26.1. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC/APU. A crewmember
     or ground controller may act as fireguard.
     6.26.2. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs will
     not normally be accomplished. If conducted, Crews will adhere to flight manual operating
     limits and procedures.
     6.26.3. Towing. Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations. The
     AC will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to ensure the
     towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the AC must have
     approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The AC will ensure
     the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards.
     Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team
     personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified
     Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances will any crewmember act as the
     towing supervisor.
6.27. Life Support and Oxygen Requirements.
     6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from
     the equal time point should oxygen be required. Oxygen onboard for takeoff will be a
     minimum of 5.0 liters per functional LOX system. On missions with passengers, carry
     passenger emergency oxygen systems (POK, EPOS, or other approved system) if flight
     above FL 250 is anticipated. Do not block access to these systems during flight. Distribute
     and demonstrate proper use prior to climbing through FL 250. The POK does not protect the
     wearer from smoke or fumes.
     6.27.2. Crewmembers occupying a primary crew station will accomplish a communications
     and operations check of their oxygen equipment prior to flight. Crewmembers will preflight
     their planned source of oxygen (Quick Don and/or helmet and mask) to include
     communications checks. All flight deck crewmembers will use the quick don as the primary
     oxygen source when using headset. All flight deck crewmembers will use the oxygen mask
     as the primary oxygen source when using the helmet. The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer
     will be properly connected to the mask interphone system for all phases of flight. The quick
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 67


  don or oxygen mask will remain readily available for use from before engine start until after
  engine shutdown.
  6.27.3. Walk-around bottles will not be considered as a primary source of supplemental
  oxygen for crewmembers performing duties in a primary crew position. Furthermore, walk-
  around bottles will not be considered as a source of supplemental oxygen for any
  crewmember during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL.
  6.27.4. Rafts. Ensure sufficient wing well life rafts are on board to accommodate all
  passengers and aircrew members on overwater flights.
  6.27.5. Life Preserver Units (LPUs). For overwater flights, ensure a sufficient quantity of
  life preservers are on board for all passengers and crewmembers. While overwater, LPUs
  will be sized and readily available at the crewmember‘s station, and worn whenever below
  2,000 feet overwater (except for takeoff and landing). Crewmembers wearing a parachute or
  harness during air refueling overwater will also wear an LPU. For overwater missions
  carrying children and infants, ensure appropriate number and types of LPUs are on board.
  NOTE: Parachutists will provide their own LPUs. The flying unit will ensure the supported
  unit is aware when route of flight requires the use of LPUs. NOTE: Infil/Exfil operations
  may preclude issuing aircraft LPUs to user personnel. In this case ensure sufficient LPUs are
  onboard for all personnel.
  6.27.6. Anti-exposure suits. Anti-exposure suits will be available during overwater flights
  when route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land and the water
  temperature is 60 degrees F or below (NOTE: Anti-exposure suits are not required when
  only the approach or departure is flown over water). If the water temperature ranges between
  51 degrees F and 60 degrees F, the unit or mission commander may waive or extend the anti-
  exposure suit requirement after carefully considering the following factors:
     6.27.6.1. Climate zone and existing weather throughout range of flight.
     6.27.6.2. Operational requirements.
     6.27.6.3. Number and type of aircraft in formation, if applicable.
     6.27.6.4. Time of flight over water.
     6.27.6.5. Risk, based on aircraft load and mission configuration.
     6.27.6.6. Degree of surveillance over mission.
     6.27.6.7. Location, availability, and capability or SAR forces (consider anticipated time
     in the water prior to pick-up).
     6.27.6.8. Winds and wave height, and their impact on SAR forces.
     6.27.6.9. Altitude and distance from land.
  6.27.7. Parachutes. All ACC C-130 aircraft will be configured with one parachute for each
  crewmember.
     6.27.7.1. Crew members should wear parachutes during combat and hazardous
     acceptance flights. EXCEPTION: Unit commanders may authorize crewmembers to
     size and stow their parachutes in an easily accessible location. A restraint harness may be
68                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        used in lieu of a parachute per paragraph 6.27.8; however, a parachute must be fitted and
        stowed in an easily accessible location for each crewmember using a restraint harness
     6.27.8. Restraint Harness.
        6.27.8.1. Personnel performing duties near an open door in-flight will preflight and wear
        a parachute or restraining harness. Wear a restraining harness during operations below
        1000 feet AGL.
        6.27.8.2. During training, loadmasters will wear a restraint harness when performing
        duties near an open exit in flight. Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to
        flight. NOTE: Connect the lifeline to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting
        the aircraft. Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable that
        has an anchor cable stop positioned and taped at FS 737. Do not connect the lifeline to
        an anchor cable that has static lines attached to it for an airdrop. Connect the lifeline
        when at or anticipating moving aft of FS 677.
        6.27.8.3. Flight examiner loadmasters are exempt from this requirement provided they
        are not performing primary or backup loadmaster duties and they will not position
        themselves aft of FS 677
     6.27.9. Survival Kits/Vests. All ACC C-130 aircraft will be configured with one survival kit
     (ML-4) for each aircrew member. Survival vests may be used in lieu of survival kits if the
     mission will not be conducted beyond gliding distance of land. Individual should wear
     survival vests on all combat and contingency missions.

     6.30.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply. Avoid flying over metropolitan or otherwise
     critical areas.
     6.30.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
     theater commander or FLIP planning:
        6.30.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
        other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
        announce that hazardous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base
        support agencies have received the departure message. If not, transmit the mission
        number, ETA, and information listed in paragraph 6.30.6
        6.30.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
        information to the nearest FAA flight service station.
        6.30.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
        airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
     6.30.7. Parking:
        6.30.7.1. DOD requires aircraft carrying DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
        explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
        in areas isolated from personnel. ACs are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
        identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
        area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
        acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host
        procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such
        occurrences.
        6.30.7.2. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. For non-military
        installations, the briefing to the AC will include placarding requirements and, if required,
        placards will be furnished at the onload base. The shipper must make prior arrangements
        with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring placarding. The
        shipper is responsible for cargo identification, fire-fighting procedures, and isolated
        parking requirements.
     6.30.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to IFE. Transmit unclassified information to the
     appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
        6.30.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
        6.30.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
        6.30.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
        6.30.8.4. Fuel on board.
        6.30.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
        information listed in paragraph 6.30.6
        6.30.8.6. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the ACC Command Center or theater CP
        by telephone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials
        information, and other pertinent information as required.
6.31. Hazardous Medical Equipment:
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                73


   6.31.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use ACC air evacuation
   services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment are of major
   concern:
       6.31.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference (EMI)
       which is commonly beyond the limits specified by MIL STD 461A and 462, and
       therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
       6.31.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
       A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
       regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.31.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.31.2.1. Pararescue personnel must inform the AC when nonstandard electronic medical
       equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
       6.31.2.2. The AC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
       during the mission.
       6.31.2.3. The AC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
       navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
       6.31.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
       the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
       additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
       navigational equipment.
   6.31.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
       6.31.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axes.
       6.31.3.2. Pararescue personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment
       to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.

Section 6D— Departure

6.32. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew in accordance with
published ACC briefing guides.
6.33. Departure Monitoring. The navigator and non-flying pilot will back up the pilot and
report any deviations from the planned departure.
6.34. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are considered ―on time‖ if the aircraft is airborne
no later 15 minutes after the scheduled takeoff time. Early departures of up to 30 minutes are
authorized provided local, down-range and aircrew impact are evaluated and no adverse effect
will result.
6.35. NVG Departures.
   6.35.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Pilots may use NVGs to assist in instrument
   takeoffs as mission requirements dictate. Current and qualified NVG aircraft commanders
   may fly NVG departures in weather minimums no lower than 300/1. Crews must give careful
74                                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     consideration to potential hazards during this critical phase of flight. Other weather
     limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
     which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather
     conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and
     weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
     6.35.2. NVG Malfunctions during Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the Pilot experiences
     NVG failure, takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC. If NVG malfunctions
     occur after the pilot not flying states ―GO‖, consideration should be given to either
     continuing the takeoff as an overt instrument takeoff or transferring control of the aircraft as
     the situation dictates. If either pilot‘s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climb out and
     follow the appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs. The non-flying pilot will be ready to
     immediately assume aircraft control if the pilot experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG
     malfunction. WARNING: NVGs and associated components (battery cords, safety cords,
     and other hardware) can become entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or
     other controls. Any interference can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of
     other critical switches or controls. Extreme care must be exercised by pilots during seat
     changes and by flight engineers performing duties that involve leaning forward in the seat;
     i.e. exchanging TOLD cards or adjusting fuel panel switches.

Section 6E— En Route

6.36. Flight Progress. Use all available navigation aids to maintain course centerline and a
positive fix on the aircraft‘s position. Immediately report to the controlling radar facility any
malfunction or loss of navigational capability that may degrade navigational accuracy.
     6.36.1. Flight Deck Entry.
        6.36.1.1. The following personnel are authorized on the flight deck during takeoff,
        landing, and critical phases of flight. They must be in compliance with Chapter 3.
        6.36.1.2. Additional crewmembers (if seats are not required by primary crewmembers,
        instructors, or flight examiners).
        6.36.1.3. Individuals approved by the group commander. NOTE: Does not include non-
        instructor aircrew members
        6.36.1.4. ACs may authorize passengers (except patients) to visit the flight deck during
        non-critical phases of flight. Passenger access to any primary crew station is prohibited.
6.37. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
     6.37.1. Limit the number of persons on the flight deck to the minimum commensurate with
     mission requirements. At no time will this exceed nine (seven for C-130E).
     6.37.2. Keep the flight deck uncluttered and orderly for all flight and ground operations.
     6.37.3. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
     covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item behind the
     condition levers or on the throttle quadrant.
     6.37.4. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the flight deck glare shield.

6.38. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items are accomplished.
   6.38.1. The pilot flying the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless the flight manual or this
   instruction dictates otherwise.
   6.38.2. Carry abbreviated checklists in the USAF Flight Crew Checklist binders. The only
   pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist binders are C-130 series T.O. aircrew checklists,
   MAJCOM approved checklists (includes changes/updates), briefing guides, and approved
   information guides. Units may construct locally approved in-flight guides.
   6.38.3. Crew members may make personal notes in pencil on checklists, briefings, or
   information guides, if desired. Such notes must be current.
   6.38.4. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission need not be
   challenged during checklist accomplishment.
6.39. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be
out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats,
PIC‘s may authorize rest periods IAW AFI 11-202V3 for one pilot occupying a primary duty
station during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Only one
pilot, or the flight engineer, may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the PIC prior
to departing assigned primary duty station. NOTE: Critical phases of flight are defined as
takeoff, approach and landing, and all tactical mission events.
6.40. Cold Weather Altimeter Setting Procedures. Apply cold weather altimeter corrections
for non tactical situations in accordance with AFI 11-202V3. For tactical operations, apply cold
weather altimeter corrections to any reference barometric altitude, e.g. MSA, ESA, NVG
reference altitude, drop altitude, SCA backup altitudes, SCA minimums, etc., used during low
level operations whenever the outside air temperature is below 32º F/0º C.
6.41. Navigational Aid Capability.
   6.41.1. North Atlantic Region and the US West Coast/Hawaii Route System. Aircraft must
   have an operable INS/GPS/SCNS prior to airspace/track entry. Aircraft without this
   equipment must return to a station with maintenance capability or refile via routes specified
   in FLIP.
6.42. North Pacific (NOPAC) Region. Comply with the following procedures when transiting
the Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic CTA/FIRs on the NOPAC north route:
   6.42.1. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route experiencing loss of radar capability
   at any point shall, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan on another track or return to the nearest
   facility with radar maintenance capability.
   6.42.2. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route that have a single drift and
   groundspeed source and experience loss of that source at any point, may continue the
   NOPAC north route if the radar system is fully operable. Verify in flight that satisfactory
76                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     returns are being received on all ranges, particularly the longer ranges (100 NM or greater).
     If the radar system is marginal or inoperative, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan to another
     track or return to the nearest facility with maintenance capability.
     6.42.3. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Report all
     vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP Planning or FIH.
     6.42.4. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
     harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
     air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
     insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
     the type of harassment and request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
     attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
     6.42.5. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206.
6.43. In-flight Meals. The pilot and copilot should not consume meals at the same time and

     6.44.2. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
     aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate Command
     and Control Center (CCC) a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required,
     intentions, and any further pertinent information.
     6.44.3. The aircraft commander may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL when additional
     expertise is necessary to cope with emergencies or other conditions. It convenes at the
     lowest level where expertise is available, and will not be elevated for the purpose of keeping
     the next higher echelon informed.         Table 6.6 lists CONFERENCE HOTEL contact
     information extracted from AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision. See AFI 11-418, for
     further details.

HOURS:        above       personnel.     Robins (478) 327-2612/13/14/15
              Command Post will maintain a
              current listing of home telephone
              numbers for POCs.
   6.44.4. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete
   frequencies. When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch with
   the nearest or controlling CCC. Provide a narrative description of the situation including
   actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired.
   6.44.5. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft,
   if a turnaround is required.
6.45. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on three engines to its
destination if two-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route
and at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times. The
flight engineer will inform pilot of charted two-engine range. If these conditions cannot be met,
the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the
AC, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.
6.46. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel
may meet the aircraft. The request will include the individual‘s sex, approximate age, and the
nature of the medical problem.
6.47. Weather Forecasts.
   6.47.1. The primary contact for in-flight weather assistance is the Pilot Meteorological
   Service (PMSV). NOTE: For all flights outside the local area, the AMSS will obtain the
   destination and alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and
   temperature, before reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA.
   6.47.2. For aircraft flying into Europe, the preferred alternate contact for weather
   information east of 10 degrees west longitude is through Croughton USAF Global Command
   and Control Station (GCCS) to the 21 Operational Weather Squadron, Sembach AB,
   Germany.
78                                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     6.47.3. For aircraft flying into the Pacific theater, the preferred alternate contact for weather
     information west of 140 degrees west longitude is through the USAF GCCS to Hickam AFB,
     HI.
     6.47.4. When operating outside the CONUS, monitor GCCS weather broadcasts. Times and
     frequencies are contained in the FLIP Flight Information Handbook. During contingency
     operations or exercises, use GCCS weather broadcasts to support silent ocean crossings.
     6.47.5. Obtain latest weather prior to descent for landing at destination.

Section 6F— Arrival

6.48. Descent. Crews should plan and initiate their descent in order to comply with ATC arrival
and instrument approach procedures. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other
than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the
initial descent point to landing. The non-flying pilot and navigator will monitor the approach and
report any deviations from prescribed procedures.
     6.48.1. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots and navigators will review appropriate
     terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions.
     6.48.2. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
     night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
     approved instrument approach. Visual approaches may be flown during night VFR
     conditions, if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational/training
     mission requirements dictate.
6.49. Radar Altimeter Procedures. Pilots and navigators will crosscheck radar altimeters
during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout the descent and
maneuvering portion of the approach. Once established in a VFR traffic pattern, the radar
altimeter may be set at the discretion of the pilot.
6.50. Instrument Approach Procedures. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 8, and the
following:
     6.50.1. The C-130 is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 140 knots, the
     minimums for Category "D" will be used. DH/MDA, instrument approach visibility and, if
     required, ceiling minimums will be as published, with the following exceptions:
     6.50.2. If full flight instrumentation is not operational, base DH on a minimum HAT of 300
     feet and RVR 4000, or visibility three-fourths mile if RVR is not available.
     6.50.3. Full flight instrumentation for an ILS includes:
        6.50.3.1. Dual flight displays (one flight director plus ADI repeat satisfies this
        requirement).
        6.50.3.2. Complete differential pressure instruments, compass/heading reference
        systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
     6.50.4. Full flight instrumentation for a PAR will include: complete differential pressure
     instruments, compass systems/heading reference systems, and attitude indicators in both pilot
     positions.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                       79


   6.50.5. Aircrews performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0
   degrees centigrade or below will refer AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information Handbook,
   section D, Temperature Correction Chart.
6.51. Precision Approach. Visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 or one-half mile if RVR
is not available. DH will be based on a HAT of no less than 200 feet.
6.52. Circling Approach. Minimum descent altitude (MDA) will be as published for category
aircraft. If the minimums are not published by category, the minimum altitude will be as
published, but in no case lower than the value indicated below, plus the published airport
elevation:
   6.52.1. Category C. 500 feet - 1 1/2 SM
   6.52.2. Category D. 600 feet - 2 SM
6.53. Coupled Approach Procedures. When a coupled approach is flown, assume manual
control at or above published minimum altitude (MDA/DH).
6.54. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.54.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and crewmembers that are non-current and/or
   unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews may fly IFR approaches which
   transition to NVG landings with weather 300/1 or approach minimums (whichever is higher).
   Crews must give careful consideration to the potential hazards during these critical phases of
   flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NOTE:
   NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions.
   Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn
   and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
   6.54.2. NVG Malfunction during Approach and Landing. If either pilot experiences
   NVG failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC whether or not to transition
   to an overt landing or perform a go-around. If the pilot‘s NVGs fail after touchdown,
   transfer control of the aircraft to the non-flying pilot, if required, for the landing rollout. Use
   overt landing and taxi lights for illumination until both pilots are ready to resume NVG
   operations. The non-flying pilot will be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the
   pilot flying experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. WARNING: NVGs
   and associated components (battery cords, safety cords, and other hardware) can become
   entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other controls. Any interference
   can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of other critical switches or controls.
   Extreme care must be exercised by pilots during seat changes and by flight engineers
   performing duties that involve leaning forward in the seat; i.e. exchanging TOLD cards or
   adjusting fuel panel switches.

Section 6G—Post Flight

6.55. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. The AC will review the aircraft
forms, determine those discrepancies considered as mission essential, and indicate them by
80                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


entering ―ME‖ in block letters in the lower left hand corner of the AFTO Form 781A,
Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document discrepancy block. Use ‗MC‖ (mission
contributing) to indicate any discrepancies that, if not corrected, would substantially affect
mission accomplishment, but are not mission essential. At stations where there is no
maintenance, and maintenance support is required, the AC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the controlling CCC prior to entering crew rest.
     6.55.1. Salt Spray and Clear Water Rinse. The accumulation of salt spray on windshields
     and side windows is a hazard that must be considered for low-level overwater flight. Weigh
     this against mission urgency prior to descent below 500 feet, when heavy seas or high surface
     winds exist. In some cases, it will be preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this
     condition. An entry will be placed in the AFTO Form 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt
     Spray" (state lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet
     above sea level except for takeoffs and landings.
     6.55.2. Clear water rinse facility (birdbath) usage guidelines are as follows:
        6.55.2.1. Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in
        which the aircraft is flown over salt water below 1000‘ AGL, including tactical
        approaches and landings. Multiple instrument approaches do not require a clear water
        rinse, unless, in the judgment of the crew, the aircraft was subjected to salt spray. If a
        birdbath facility is unavailable make the following annotation in the AFTO form 781A,
        ―aircraft subjected to salt spray, birdbath unavailable.‖ The following guidance will be
        used to maximize the effectiveness of the birdbath and to ensure safe operations.
        6.55.2.2. Crews will ensure that sensors such as the radar/IDS are off prior to entering
        the birdbath.
        6.55.2.3. The GTC, ATM, ATM generator, and APU will remain off with doors closed
        to prevent flameout and flooding of the GTC/APU compartment.
        6.55.2.4. Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extend both auxiliary and normal landing
        lights (if applicable).
        6.55.2.5. All four engines should be at normal ground idle with the lowest power setting
        available. Two engines in normal ground idle, and two in LSGI may be used if aircraft
        weight does not restrict the forward movement through the bath.
        6.55.2.6. As full water spray begins, start taxiing slowly on centerline at a rate which
        allows adequate rinsing of the entire aircraft. Hold nose wheel steering centered and start
        windshield wipers. Exercise flight controls while in the birdbath. Complete the AFTER
        LANDING Checklist after rinse is completed, run engines at normal ground idle for a
        minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine nacelles.
        6.55.2.7. Review local procedures for birdbath operating guidelines. Each birdbath is
        unique in design and function and local procedures such as direction of entry, wing tip
        clearance criteria, noise abatement concerns, etc. need to be reviewed prior to its use.
        CAUTION: It is possible to experience an overheat indication during or immediately
        following the birdbath due to water intrusion into the overheat warning systems. Each
        crew will have to analyze the indication and make a judgment as to the emergency action
        to be taken.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                81


       6.55.2.8. DELETED.
   6.55.3. Documentation of Fuel Onload/Offload. Ensure fuel onloaded/offloaded during
   IFR, FARP, and AR is entered in the AFTO Form 781H.

Section 6H—Miscellaneous Procedures

6.56. Life Support Equipment Documentation. Life support will accomplish a thorough
aircraft preflight inspection prior to each mission. Local training missions only require a
preflight inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
   6.56.1. The AC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing; life support, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire mission are on board
   the aircraft prior to departing home station. Prior to departing home station and following
   enroute crew changes, review the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment,
   to ensure all required equipment is on board and required inspections have been completed.
   6.56.2. Crewmembers discovering equipment missing will make an entry in both the AFTO
   Form 781 and AFTO Form 46.
6.57. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious ground or in-flight
incident, the AC should impound the aircraft immediately and contact the ACC Command
Center or controlling agency for further instructions.
6.58. Support Agencies. The AC or a designated representative will pass significant
information to support agencies, such as weather, ATC, or base operations. The actual weather
encountered should be compared to forecast weather, and this information provided to weather
personnel to facilitate improved support. Debrief intelligence, when applicable.
6.59. Crew Debriefing. The AC will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The debriefing
will include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crewmembers may be excused from debrief at the discretion of the AC.
6.60. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the AC will establish a
point of contact with the CCC, base operations, or local airport manager when the crew is
billeted in off-base quarters. The AC will be notified immediately in case of incident or
emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.
6.61. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be, dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
   6.61.1. Ensure a write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A.
   6.61.2. Notify the Command Center as soon as practical. Include route of flight, altitude,
   and weather conditions (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
6.62. Border Clearance.
   6.62.1. Normal Operations:
       6.62.1.1. Border Clearance Responsibility. The border clearance responsibility will be
       as designated by the base or area command IAW DOD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation
82                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        Regulation, Part V, Department of Defense Customs and Border Clearance Policy and
        Procedures, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
        6.62.1.2. Aircraft Commander Responsibility. Border clearance is the responsibility of
        the AC, although many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the
        loadmaster. The aircraft commander will ensure:
        6.62.1.3. Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, if
        required.
        6.62.1.4. Crewmembers and passengers have current shot records or certificates of
        immunization.
        6.62.1.5. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
        6.62.1.6. Departure or arrival to the US is through a port of entry where border clearance
        can be obtained.
        6.62.1.7. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required,
        is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area.
        6.62.1.8. Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see paragraph 6.65).
        6.62.1.9. En route to the US, the loadmaster has distributed personal customs
        declarations to all passengers and crewmembers; has briefed passengers and
        crewmembers on customs regulations; and has prepared and compiled necessary border
        clearance forms for the AC‘s signature.
        6.62.1.10. En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in
        ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
        6.62.1.11. A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which
        has landed in the US for customs clearance, to proceed to another US base to obtain
        border clearance. The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew
        until arrival at the offload station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally
        required for customs inspection. The Permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next
        landing, where the border clearance must be completed, or a new permit obtained. Do
        not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency situation, or directed by
        ACC or AFRC.
        6.62.1.12. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs
        representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not
        deplane passengers or crewmembers, except a scanner, unless necessary for safety. Do
        not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated
        representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all subsequent
        landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
     6.62.2. Exercise and Contingency Operations.
        6.62.2.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
        require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
        immigration, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding
        establishes procedures and waivers.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                              83


      6.62.2.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of
      the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be
      accomplished at the CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry,
      or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.62.2.3. Customs Procedures.
      6.62.2.4. Outbound. No requirements. Filing of a CBP Form 7507 is waived.
      6.62.2.5. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.
          6.62.2.5.1. CBP 7507 (passenger list not required).
          6.62.2.5.2. Cargo manifest.
          6.62.2.5.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days.
          6.62.2.5.4. Troop commander‘s certificate from examination of troop baggage.
          6.62.2.5.5. One copy of DD Form 1854 or CBP Form 6059B for each passenger not
          under command of the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel,
          civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
             6.62.2.5.5.1. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
             meets the aircraft and accepts the troop commander's certificate with respect to
             troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop
             commander should have inspected troop baggage. Troops debark under the
             observation of the Customs representative with only a spot check of articles and
             baggage. The Customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
          6.62.2.5.6. For troops out of the country 140 days or more.
             6.62.2.5.6.1. One copy of DD Form 1854 or CBP Form 6059B for each
             passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news media
             personnel, and crewmembers.
             6.62.2.5.6.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative
             meets the aircraft and collects all declarations. Troops debark under the
             observation of the Customs representative, who may make discretionary
             examination of the baggage.
      6.62.2.6. Immigration Procedures.
          6.62.2.6.1. Outbound. No requirements.
          6.62.2.6.2. Inbound. Submit the following to the Immigration inspector.
          6.62.2.6.3. One copy of CBP Form7507
          6.62.2.6.4. One copy of Immigration Form I-92, Aircraft/Vessel Report.
          6.62.2.6.5. One copy/set of Immigration Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, for
          each foreign national.
6.63. Customs, Immigration, and Agricultural Inspections:
84                                                              AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


     6.63.1. Obtain Customs, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior to
     opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and
     deplaning personnel.
     6.63.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural
     inspection for processing when required by the inspector.
     6.63.3. US military aircraft are sovereign territory. When cleared to over fly or land in
     foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
     and immunities which customarily are accorded to warships. Privileges and immunities
     include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
     immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
     or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
     cargo on board. USAF ACs will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar
     exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ
     USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
     6.63.4. ACs will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign
     government. The AC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the senior ACC (or other
     USAF) representative, US Embassy, or Consulate within the host nation. Customs or other
     officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through
     their own government and with US Department of State representatives. If necessary, the
     crew will seal the aircraft, the crew entered into crew rest, and departure intentions will be
     canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority. Inform C2 authorities by
     the fastest available means should this situation occur.
     6.63.5. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
     consider the following procedures:
        6.63.5.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement to the foreign
        officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without consent of HQ
        USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed
        in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but
        mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
        6.63.5.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, ACs must negotiate to delay
        the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/XOXXI or the appropriate embassy.
        ACs should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to the search and
        that they must relay the host nation request to these agencies for decision. ACs should
        then notify these agencies of the request by the most expeditious means available.
        Thereafter, ACs should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ
        USAF.
        6.63.5.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, ACs should indicate
        that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical
        considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
        6.63.5.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
        on board an aircraft, ACs should state that they protest the course of action being pursued
        and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF of
        the foreign action. ACs should then allow the foreign agents onboard the aircraft,
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   85


       without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and
       appropriate embassy, as soon as possible.
       6.63.5.5. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo
       or equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to
       the FCG should be followed, where applicable.
6.64. Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program:
   6.64.1. The military customs program DOD Directive 5030.49, Customs and Border
   Clearance Program and DOD 4500.9-R were developed to assist the DOD and other US
   Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural
   products, and to expedite entry of DOD personnel and material into the customs territory of
   the United States.
   6.64.2. Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to
   departure and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS-bound
   aircraft. When security considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission
   planners must coordinate with the appropriate agency to ensure the mission is not
   jeopardized.
6.65. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).
   6.65.1. ACs will ensure required spraying is accomplished, and certify the spraying on
   Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.
   6.65.2. Spray the aircraft immediately before the last takeoff prior to entering:
       6.65.2.1. The US or its possessions from a foreign airport between 35 degrees North and
       35 degrees South latitude (Japan excluded and all of Africa included).
          6.65.2.1.1. Aircraft that land in the US north of 35 degrees North latitude need not be
          sprayed between 1 October and 31 March, unless the aircraft will immediately
          proceed to a part of the US located south of 35 degrees North latitude.
          6.65.2.1.2. The US Public Health Service may require spraying of aircraft for
          emergency purposes or special requirements (see FCG for exceptions).
       6.65.2.2. The state of Hawaii, to include flights from the CONUS.
       6.65.2.3. A foreign area, according to the requirements of the country concerned or of
       the USAF (See FCG for individual country requirements).
   6.65.3. Use insecticide, Aerosol D-Phenotrin-2%, NSN 6840-01412-4634 (or equivalent), to
   spray the aircraft.
       6.65.3.1. Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic feet.
       Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed. Do not
       spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.
       6.65.3.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
       baggage, cargo, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
       6.65.3.3. Spray the cabin (aft to forward), the flight deck, and other spaces accessible
       from within the aircraft ensuring all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings
86                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        are closed. Exit and close the crew entrance door when complete. Keep all doors and
        hatches closed for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before
        allowing anyone on board. WARNING: Aerosol D-Phenotrin-2% contains hazardous
        ingredients that when exposed for prolonged periods may become hazardous to humans.
        6.65.3.4. Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
        transited.
        6.65.3.5. If insect or rodent infestation is discovered in-flight, inform the destination
        CCC, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper
        authorities can meet the aircraft.
        6.65.3.6. Upon arrival, do not open doors or hatches except to enplane officials
        inspecting the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload until the
        inspection is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission
        or local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.

                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security, in-flight and on the ground.
Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking. Resistance may vary
from dissuasion to direct physical confrontation, including the use of weapons. Due to the
sensitive nature of anti-hijacking procedures, crewmembers should reference AFI 13-207,
Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO) and the FIH for specific guidance. Aircrews
will not release any information concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts.
7.2. Security. ACC C/HC-130 aircraft are Protection Level ―C‖ resources. This security
priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide. Some
aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per DOD 5200.1-R,
Information Security Program and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
7.3. Procedures. The planning agency must ensure that adequate en route force protection is
available. The amount of force protection required will vary, depending on location and ground
time. ACs will receive a threat assessment and force protection capability evaluation briefing at
home station prior to departure and receive updates en route, if required. During both scheduled
and unscheduled landings at non-USAF installations, ACs will assess the force protection
situation and take the following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:
   7.3.1. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-
   up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15
   7.3.2. Aircrew Surveillance. ACs will direct armed personnel to remain with the aircraft and
   maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft.
   Obtain a means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile
   radio, etc.).
   7.3.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or unavailable
   and the crew is not augmented with security forces, the AC may waive FDP restrictions and
   depart as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to
   depart the location due to system malfunction, coordinate through home station channels to
   acquire force protection support.
   7.3.4. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the AC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
   sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
       7.3.4.1. Use the aircraft lock. NOTE: The aircraft will be locked during all off-station
       missions remaining overnight.
           7.3.4.1.1. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner
           that will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles
           to the airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal the main crew
           entrance door using a boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry.
           Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. If the
           seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate local
           authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
88                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


        7.3.4.2. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
        servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
        will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
        personnel.
7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors. This paragraph
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DVs Code 4 or above. The AC is responsible for
aircraft security at en route stops.
     7.4.1. DOD Installations. Notify base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
     times. Request security forces maintain continuous security surveillance during the entire
     ground time. If the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
     7.4.2. Non-DOD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
     arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
     using AF Form 15.
7.5. Arming of Crewmembers. When directed, at least one crewmember each from the flight
deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons. All crew members will know who is armed.
     7.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons,
     ammunition, lock, and key. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF
     Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crewmembers will be reissued the
     same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember must
     leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crewmember, using AF
     Form 1297.
     7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
     barrels if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon
     on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
     7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons for anti-hijack purposes. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed
     at all times to protect the identity of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the
     flight line, except to and from the CCC, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew
     activities such as base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line
     cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
     7.5.4. Due to the dynamic nature of contingency and combat operations, unit commanders
     may designate all aircrew as arming group B for the purpose of aircraft/resource protection
     for the following weapons: M-9, M-14/M-16 or equivalent, and M-870, IAW AFI 13-207
     and AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
     7.5.5. Weapons Storage In-flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight
     or onload duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check,
     weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight. Crewmembers will rearm before landing.
     Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
     7.5.6. Weapons Storage on the Ground. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons
     and ammunition in the most secure facility available, normally the base armory. If a
     weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country prohibits or restricts the entry of
     weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the locked gun box. Inform command and
     control agency which crewmember has the gun box key (or combination).
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                     89


       7.5.6.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
       overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
       nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military
       services armories, US National Guard and Reserve armories, and US civil law
       enforcement armories. If none of these are available, or the AC believes weapons
       security may be compromised, crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters,
       but one crewmember must remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the
       ammunition over to the AC.
7.6. General Hijacking Guidance. The hijacking of an ACC aircraft could create a serious
international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most
vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be
dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals
for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been
most successful in saving lives and property. Crews must resist all attempts to hijack their
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple discouragement to direct physical attack with
weapons. Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the
problem.
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the
   aircraft commander is fully satisfied with these inspections.                  EXCEPTION:
   Supporting/supported forces may be anti-hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
   7.6.2. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible for
   the anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by
   civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
   7.6.3. Contingency and exercise movements. During contingencies in support of combat
   operations involving the movement of large numbers of personnel and exercises, the
   supported unit should manifest passengers and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.6.4. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their
   person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft except special agents and guards of
   the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry
   weapons.
       7.6.4.1. Take every precaution to prevent accidental discharge of weapons.                 If
       individuals must clear their weapons, ask them to:
           7.6.4.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
           personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons.
           7.6.4.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedure.
           7.6.4.1.3. Troops and deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition
           on an aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or AC. Troops may carry
           unloaded weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft during combat operations.
           When the situation dictates, weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop
           commander or team leader.
90                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


       7.6.4.2. Carrying Concealed Firearms. The Air Force prohibits all military and contract
       employees from carrying concealed firearms on duty except when specifically authorized
       in writing by a firearms-issuing authority and only while performing an official military
       duty. NOTE: Official aircrew orders, specifying the USAF member carry a concealed
       firearm, satisfy the written authorization requirement. Military members who violate this
       provision prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon without written authorization
       are subject to administrative or disciplinary proceedings under Article 92, Uniformed
       Code of Military Justice.
           7.6.4.2.1. Except when it might compromise your mission, always carry AF Form
           523 while bearing concealed firearms. In those cases, the issuing authority retains the
           form. The permit number on AF Form 523 includes the heading "CONCEALED."
           (These procedures help ensure compatibility between US Air Force authorizations to
           bear concealed firearms and other jurisdictional requirements.)
           7.6.4.2.2. ACC authorizes unit commanders to issue AF Forms 523 to personnel
           when missions require those members to bear a concealed firearm on a regular basis
           (for example, assigned and gained aircrews armed specifically for anti-hijack
           purposes).
       7.6.4.3. Hollow Point Ammunition. The use of hollow point ammunition is authorized
       for anti-hijacking purposes except in AORs subject to LOAC or ROE restrictions. In
       such instances, use ball type ammunition and remove and store hollow point ammunition
       until required for anti-hijacking purposes.
7.7. Specific Anti-Hijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crewmembers are familiar with
the ground and in-flight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of
unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207, the FIH and current FAA guidance. In the event
of a hijacking, crewmembers must act immediately and resourcefully, without instruction, in
order to counter the attacker successfully.
7.8. Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment. Planners and Aircraft Commanders may use
the matrix in Table 7.1 to help assess the risk to parked aircraft when located at overseas civilian
airfields. A cumulative score of less than 55 indicates that normal unmanned aircraft security
measures are adequate. A score of 55 to 80 indicates that adequate security is provided by
deployed US ground personnel working 24 hour operations. If the cumulative score is greater
than 80, or if any of the shaded areas in the figure are applicable, commanders should consider
deploying or contracting security personnel. During unscheduled or emergency landings, the
aircraft commander should contact the US Embassy or USDAO for security assistance.

                                              Chapter 8

                           OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The USAF Mishap
Prevention Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force
personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt
corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may
jeopardize the health and well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or
destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, Attachment 3.
     8.3.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
     midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATR
     reports only for mishap prevention. See AFI 91-202 for a list of reportable incidents.
     8.3.2. Procedures:
        8.3.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
        (e.g. center, FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and give the following
        information as appropriate:
            8.3.2.1.1. Identification or call sign.
            8.3.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.).
            8.3.2.1.3. Altitude or flight level.
            8.3.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
            8.3.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a
            written HATR report will be filed upon landing. NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA,
            etc) must know if an official report is being filed.
        8.3.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means
        of communication. Normally, it should be filed at the base operations office at the
        landing airport. If this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety
        office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home
        station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM. In any case, provide the safety office
        with all available information needed to prepare AF Form 651. Turn in a completed copy
        of AF Form 651 to the wing/group safety office. NOTE: HATR reports are not
        privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
     8.3.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action
     provided:

demonstrated. If PJ MOS is demonstrated do not exceed 30 degrees angle of bank. If Air
Refueling MOS is demonstrated, do not use any angle of bank.
9.16. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures. Simulated emergency flight procedures will
be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3 and this instruction.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   99


   9.16.1. If an actual emergency arises, terminate all simulated emergency flight procedures
   training and flight maneuvers practice.
   9.16.2. Practice emergencies (which require simulating an engine shutdown, placing
   switches in other than their normal position, or an abnormal configuration) only during
   training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one
   of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the
   supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may conduct simulated emergency
   procedures during initial or requalification upgrade evaluations. This applies to all maneuvers
   defined in paragraph 9.22 unless otherwise specified in the individual maneuver restrictions.
   9.16.3. Legacy trained copilots may conduct simulated 3-engine approaches, missed
   approaches, and landings with squadron commander approval and when under the direct
   supervision of an IP. NOTE: Unless otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to AFI
   11-202V2, place a letter of certification by the SQ/CC in the FEF and make an entry on the
   AF IMT 1381/4348. Documentation of designation as an AC candidate will be IAW 11-
   2HC-130V1.
   9.16.4. MPD pilots may conduct 3-engine approaches, missed approaches, landings and no-
   flap approaches and landings from the left seat under the direct supervision of an IP. Do not
   compound engine out training with any other simulated emergencies for MPD pilots.
9.17. Simulated       Engine     Failure    and      3-Engine    Approaches/Landings/Missed
Approaches. Direct IP supervision required except for IP candidates under the supervision of a
flight examiner during initial or requalification upgrade evaluations to instructor pilot. One
throttle may be retarded to 500-1000 in-lbs at not less than VMCA (one engine inoperative, out of
ground effect) and not less than 300 feet AGL. Simulated engine failure is authorized in daylight
IMC if the weather is at or above circling minimums and at night with weather at or above 1,000
foot ceiling and 2 SM visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher. For landings,
crosswind component must be within the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. Use
all 4 engines for a touch-and-go takeoff.
   9.17.1. Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the good engines. Turns
   into simulated failed engines should be minimized. Turns into simulated failed engines are
   permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual failed engines and must
   be smooth and coordinated.
   9.17.2. When conducting simulated engine(s) out training, the flight engineer will post
   actual charted minimum control speeds on the TOLD card. For charted one-engine out
   minimum control speed above 109 knots, calculate a new minimum control speed by adding
   8 knots during simulated one-engine out training. For a charted 2-engine out minimum
   control speed that falls between 117 and 128, calculate a new minimum control speed by
   adding 8 knots during simulated 2-engine out training. During simulated 3-engine takeoff
   operations, takeoff speed will be adjusted for minimum control speed. If the charted
   minimum control speed is above 109 knots, add the 8 knot correction factor.
   9.17.3. Additional Restrictions:
       9.17.3.1. Simulated engine-out no-flap landings are restricted to AC candidates and
       above.

                                           Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter contains guidance on HC-130, CSAR MC-130P, and rescue unit
organic C-130E navigation procedures and forms. Publish local procedures in the unit
supplement to this AFI. General instructions for completion of AF IMT 4116, C-130 Navigator
Flight Plan and Log, are provided in this chapter. If information in this chapter conflicts with
AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130, this instruction takes precedence.
11.2. General Flight Planning Procedures. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by
the aircrew or furnished by another aircrew or agency, the aircraft commander and navigator will
jointly verify routing, altitudes, cargo, fuel load, and diplomatic clearance requirements prior to
filing the flight plan. Navigator changes (engine running offload or augmented crews) will
include, as a minimum, a briefing on equipment status and any changes to the original flight
planned routing.
   11.2.1. Flight Plans. Forms printed from either a certified automated mission planning
   system or current IMT products are authorized. Automated mission planning system forms
   will mirror current AF IMT products as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site.
   Computed data will match aircraft type, configuration, requirements and limitations for
   mission to be flown.
   11.2.2. Signature. Sign all fuel and flight plans that are used for planned missions. The
   navigator‘s signature will signify all data was checked for accuracy. On the AF IMT 4116,
   sign in the indicated block on page 2 to certify accuracy of all entries. Any entries not
   required for a particular mission on the AF IMT 4116 may be left blank.
   11.2.3. Data transfer. If the flight-planning computer transfers a flight plan to the aircraft
   electronically, it will be an ACC approved system. HC/MC-130P/N aircrews are authorized
   to use either the Data Transfer Module (DTM) or Data Transfer System (DTS-65000) for
   loading flight management data.
   11.2.4. A MAJCOM-certified flight plan and log (AF IMT 70, AF IMT 4116, or computer
   generated equivalent) is required for all flights except local area training flights with an
   established standard procedure.
   11.2.5. A fuel plan is required for all flights except local area training flights with
   established standard ramp fuel loads.
   11.2.6. Automated Mission Planning. The aircrew is responsible for accuracy of automated
   mission planning data generated for in-flight use. This entails aircrew paying special
   attention to entering arguments such as aircraft configuration, fuel load, engine performance,
   fuel flow model (climb, cruise, descent), heading/magnetic variation calculation,
   temperature, winds, plus any other variables which affect the accuracy of the calculated flight
   and fuel plan.
       11.2.6.1. Creating Flight Logs. In addition to manual flight logs (AF IMT 4116, C-130
       Navigator Flight Plan and Log), MAJCOM-certified automated mission planning system
       software is authorized to create a navigator flight log.

       11.2.6.2. Automated Mission Planning Software. Uncertified versions of automated
       mission planning system software will not be used for actual mission planning. HQ ACC
       will publish a listing of certified automated mission planning system software with
       release notification via aircrew FCIF.
11.3. AF IMT 4116. The AF IMT 4116 was developed to provide a tool for missions
applicable to the C-130 and C-130 variants. Entries on the AF IMT 4116 are either self-
explanatory or explained below.
   11.3.1. CRUISE CEILING - This altitude is obtained from either the automated mission
   planning system flight performance model (FPM), the appropriate aircraft performance
   manual or fuel planning publication, and without regard to ATC requirements for direction of
   flight. Ensure use of 100% or 95% engine performance and appropriate turbine inlet
   temperature (TIT) setting based on current operating procedures and appropriate technical
   order performance data recommendations. When passengers are carried and oxygen is not
   available to them, the HIGHEST ACC FL will not exceed FL 250. Enter the flight level to
   the nearest 100 feet.
   11.3.2. DRAG INDEX - This value is obtained from the appropriate aircraft performance
   manual.

   11.3.3. ENDURANCE - Compute preflight endurance using the Average Cruise Fuel Flow.
   Flying time based on fuel available at takeoff. To compute take Item 11 minus Item 9 minus
   2900 lbs unusable fuel (or as indicated from aircraft technical order/Section V, Primary Fuel
   Management).
   11.3.4. When an alternate destination is required, ensure at least a single separate waypoint
   be included in the flight plan to include name of the alternate, altitude, time, course, distance,
   and winds. If additional IFR enroute waypoints are available, inclusion of these will enhance
   fuel planning accuracy.
11.4. Flight Charts (Oceanic/Category I Route Structure and IFR/Category II
Routing). Hardcopy charts will be available for use during high level flight operations. On
Category II routes when under ATC control, the use of DoD approved FLIP publications meets
this requirement. Appropriate scale electronic charts on a portable moving map system may be
used as the primary aeronautical chart reference; however, hardcopy charts will be immediately
available in case of loss of portable laptop. NOTE: Category I and II Route definitions are
found in Attachment 1.

   TPC, LFC, JOG) are available during departure/arrival procedures (either IFR or VFR).
   When utilizing either hardcopy or moving map display during departure/arrival phases of
   flight (as a minimum) ensure Airports, Airspace Boundaries, SUAS Boundaries, VVOD (if
   available), and ECHUM are displayed. Hardcopy charts for in-flight use during
   oceanic/Category I operations will be either JNC or GNC series. *NOTE: JNCA charts
   (1:3,000,000) may be used; however they are only available from NGA as hardcopy
   products].

   11.4.2. Show the following items on the printed chart:
       11.4.2.1. Navigator‘s name, date constructed, chart number, and chart edition. Charts
       printed from an automated planning system will also include DAFIF and CADRG
       currency. Departure and arrival charts will be chummed.
       11.4.2.2. Flight plan course line, reporting points, waypoint identifier (to correspond
       with flight plan), and ETP location. Flight plan doghouses may be displayed with
       magnetic course and distance.
       11.4.2.3. Annotate suitable emergency airfields. Consider the following factors when
       selecting emergency airfields: weather conditions, runway width/length, runway weight-
       bearing capacity, runway lighting, radio navigational aids (availability/monitored), and
       proximity to planned flight path.
       11.4.2.4. Display appropriate airspace boundaries (e.g., ADIZ, ARTCC, BZ, FIR, UIR),
       Special Use Airspace (SUAS) boundaries, and TFRs pertinent to the route.
       11.4.2.5. If available, display VVOD data on departure/arrival charts. As a minimum,
       under normal circumstances the filter height should be set no higher than 100 feet.
       NOTE: When utilizing charts printed from automated mission planning systems (e.g.
       Falcon View), ensure selection of Lambert Conformal Conic map projection when
       plotting great circle routes. Not all selectable projections provide an approximation of
       great circle routing when measuring courses between points on the chart.
11.5. Use of Laptop Computers during Flight. Certified laptop computers with automated
mission planning software are approved for in-flight use IAW AFI 11-202V3, and their use is
highly encouraged. Portable automated mission planning systems, to include moving map
capability, are intended to enhance aircrew situational awareness. Consequently, independent
GPS-fed laptop computers, which do not fall under the category of CNS/ATM avionic systems,
will not be considered RNAV equipment for IFR enroute or terminal navigation, regardless if the

required navigation performance (RNP) value of that airspace can be maintained. Additionally,
ACC has not provided operational approval for GPS navigation equipment as a primary means of
navigation in remote/oceanic (Category I) areas.
11.6. Fuel Planning. Accomplish fuel planning in accordance with the certified automated
mission planning software or appropriate MDS fuel planning publications listed in Table 11.1
MC/HC-130P/N aircrew will accomplish fuel planning on the AF IMT 4116 or certified
automated mission planning forms which replicate the AF IMT 4116. All other items of the fuel
analysis portion of AF IMT 4116 are explained in Table 11.2 NOTE: When using AF IMT
4116 for fuel planning, ensure that 6,000 lbs is used for landing, instead of 4,000 lbs which is
printed on the form in Block six. NOTE: For tactical mission fuel planning, automated mission
planning calculations (CFPS) will be considered as the primary method and, by exception, 6,000
lbs/hr used in the absence of this capability.

     11.6.1. Automated Mission Planning Fuel Planning. When using automated mission
     planning tools (CFPS), all required fuel, performance, and ETP calculations may be used in
     lieu of manually derived calculations from planning documents and/or performance technical
     orders. Add alternate, identified extra, and reserve fuel in addition to the calculations derived
     from CFPS.
        11.6.1.1. When utilizing the automated mission planning flight performance model,
        normally use 970o TIT and 95% engine performance to calculate cruise altitude ceiling,
        unless directed otherwise by appropriate instructions and technical orders.
        11.6.1.2. When fuel analysis is accomplished using automated mission planning tools,
        use the fuel flow from the last applicable enroute leg of the computer flight plan to
        determine the terminal fuel flow value.

   11.8.1. There are three distinct phases of flight for which required fuel quantities and or fuel
   flows must be calculated. These three phases are: Initial climb out, start cruise and end
   cruise. Procedures for the necessary calculations are as follows:
       11.8.1.1. Prior to any calculations, use the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1, Part 4 Figures
       to extract Time to Climb (TTC), Distance to Climb (DTC), and Fuel to Climb (FTC).
       Apply the correct temperature deviation and correct for pressure altitude to compute all
       climb data.
       11.8.1.2. Using TTC and DTC, calculate climb TAS.
   11.8.2. Initial Climb-Out Fuel. In the climb section of the enroute fuel computation
   worksheet enter takeoff gross weight (TOGW), TTC, and FTC in the appropriate blocks.
   11.8.3. Start Cruise.
       11.8.3.1. Subtract climb fuel from the TOGW to obtain the start cruise gross weight.
       11.8.3.2. Enter the total flight time from the flight plan in the total time block. Subtract
       TTC from the total time to obtain cruise zone time.
       11.8.3.3. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130X-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
       Entering arguments are start cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
       deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four to
       arrive at fuel flow total.
       11.8.3.4. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the zone time in minutes to
       obtain start cruise zone fuel.
   11.8.4. End Cruise.
       11.8.4.1. Subtract cruise zone fuel from the start cruise gross weight to obtain end cruise
       gross weight.
       11.8.4.2. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
       Entering arguments are end cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
       deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four to
       arrive at fuel flow total. This is also the terminal fuel flow.
   11.8.5. Average Cruise Fuel Flow.
       11.8.5.1. Average the start cruise and end cruise fuel flow to obtain the average cruise
       fuel flow.
       11.8.5.2. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the cruise zone time to obtain
       cruise zone fuel total.
   11.8.6. Total enroute fuel. Add the FTC to the cruise zone fuel total to determine total
   enroute fuel.
   11.8.7. Compute preflight endurance using procedures in paragraph 11.3.3
11.9. Multi-Leg Fuel Planning. See Figure 11.7 A multi-leg fuel plan becomes necessary
when a mission includes multiple stops where fuel is unavailable. Use the following procedure
for multi-leg fuel planning; assume a three leg mission with legs labeled A, B, C, and D in
succession:
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  121


   11.9.1. Begin with the final destination leg (C to D) and fuel plan as normal to obtain
   required ramp fuel.
   11.9.2. Next, fuel plan the leg preceding the final destination leg (B to C). Include the
   required ramp fuel from the C to D leg as identified extra fuel. Do not include alternate fuel
   or holding fuel unless those totals exceed the required ramp fuel for the C to D leg. Use 1,000
   lbs. for approach and landing.
   11.9.3. Plan the next preceding leg (A to B) as in paragraph 11.9.2
       11.9.3.1. Unidentified extra is only entered for the first mission segment (A to B).
       NOTE: Fuel requirements must be verified at each stopover airfield. Requirement must
       be recomputed whenever the planned burn off changes; for example, enroute altitude
       changes, actual cargo/passenger load differs from the estimate, holding is accomplished,
       diversion to alternate is required, etc. NOTE: Regardless of the number of mission
       segments involved, fuel planning is always accomplished by planning the last leg‘s
       requirements first. The remaining leg requirements are planned in the reverse order to be
       flown until the refueling airfield is reached.
11.10. ETP Computations. Wind Factor and ETP Data Computations are required on Category
I routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield
(LSAF) and the first suitable airfield (FSAF) is 5 hours or more. Suitable airfields are those
within 100 NM of flight planned course centerline meeting weather, fuel, and HC-130 runway
requirements.
   11.10.1. In-flight ETP. Re-compute the ETP when the actual arrival over any reporting
   point prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused
   by erroneous wind information. If the change was caused by factors other than a change in
   the wind (i.e. slow TAS or deviation for weather), simply compute a new ETA to the ETP, as
   the ETP itself will not have changed.*NOTES: -Wind factor and ETP computations are not
   required for search missions. -Suitable runways for HC-130s are 5000 feet long, 60 feet
   wide, and must have the single-tandem weight-bearing capacity for planned gross weight.
   Consult the pilot if considering an airfield less than 5000 feet long or 60 feet wide.
   11.10.2. Wind Factor Data: NOTE: In the following paragraphs for wind factor
   computation convenience, LSAF means after level-off, abeam or over LSAF, or closest
   planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of LSAF. FSAF means abeam or over
   FSAF, closest planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of FSAF, descent point, or
   destination. Use any of the options in the ETP options graph, Figure 11.1. Specify the
   option used in the ETP computations section of the AF IMT 4116. Record computations in
   the ETP computations section.
       11.10.2.1. TOTAL - Compute the average ground speed (GS) between LSAF and FSAF.
       Divide the total distance between the two end points by the total time between the two
       points: Total Distance Total Time = Average GS Subtract average flight planned true
       airspeed (TAS) from average GS to obtain the total wind factor. WF = Average GS -
       Average TAS
       11.10.2.2. 1st Half. Compute the average GS between LSAF and approximate midpoint
       between LSAF and the FSAF. Subtract flight planned average TAS from the computed
       average GS to obtain the 1st half wind factor.
122                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


      11.10.2.3. 2nd Half. Compute the average GS between the approximate midpoint and
      the FSAF. Subtract flight planned TAS from the computed average GS to obtain the 2nd
      half wind factor.
      11.10.2.4. ETP Data:
          11.10.2.4.1. DISTANCE (LSAF TO FSAF). Enter the total distance (regardless of
          level off) from or abeam the LSAF along course from departure to or abeam the
          FSAF along course toward destination.
          11.10.2.4.2. T( )MIN. The flight time from the ETP to the FSAF or return to the
          LSAF.
          11.10.2.4.3. TOTAL TIME TO FSAF - T = TIME TO ETP. Subtract the time, T(
          )MIN, from the total flight plan time to the FSAF. TIME TO ETP is the total time
          from departure to the ETP (departure and takeoff may not necessarily be the same).
          Compute and record ETA to ETP by adding TIME TO ETP to departure time.
          11.10.2.4.4. Signature Block. Sign the form after completing the flight plan portion
          (or verifying the CFP) and completing the time and fuel analysis, wind factor, and
          ETP data.
11.11. In-Flight Procedures.
   11.11.1. The navigator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed otherwise
   by the PIC. The navigator will record ATC clearances and monitor the read back. This will
   normally include all ATC instructions involving departure, enroute, and approach
   procedures. This requirement does not apply to ATC instructions requiring immediate
   execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes with the timely performance of other
   critical flight duties.
   11.11.2. Departure and Approach Monitoring. Immediately after takeoff, crosscheck all
   available flight instruments with the aircraft radar, IDS (if equipped), moving map, and hard
   copy charts to ensure the aircraft remains clear of all obstacles. During all instrument
   arrivals and departures, use all appropriate navigation aids to ensure an accurate flight
   profile. During arrivals and departures, open the appropriate terminal instrument procedure
   plate to monitor all phases of the terminal procedure. Immediately notify the pilots of any
   deviations. Assist in clearing for other aircraft when possible and practical, but not to the
   detriment of monitoring proscribed terminal procedures. Unless directed otherwise by the
   PIC and never to the detriment of safety, confine activities to these critical duties during all
   terminal phases of flight.
   11.11.3. Flight Following. The navigator will flight follow on all IFR/Category II missions
   using a suitable aeronautical chart IAW paragraph 11.4
   11.11.4. Compute a TAS check when portions of the planned route transiting
   oceanic/Category I airspace of 3 hours or more. Use procedures in paragraph 11.15
   11.11.5. Malfunctions/loss of onboard navigational capability, which degrades required
   navigation performance will be immediately reported to ATC and annotated on the flight log.
   Subsequently, follow procedures IAW paragraph 11.12.2
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  123


   11.11.6. Conduct in-flight fuel management procedures when portions of the planned route
   transiting oceanic/Category I airspace are 5 hours or more.
   11.11.7. Heading Deviation Checks. (Not applicable to dual INU aircraft) Heading deviation
   checks are required when portions of the planned route transiting oceanic/Category I airspace
   are 3 hours or more.
11.12. Flight Records Completion (AF IMT 4116). Flight progress will be recorded for
Category I routes of 3-hours or longer. Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission. Units
may publish local standards for log procedures in the unit supplement. See Figure 11.6 for an
example of a completed AF IMT 4116.
   11.12.1. Standard Log Procedures. The AF IMT 4116 will consist of planning and in-flight
   progress data. The form will be completed in accordance with this regulation and local
   supplements in sufficient detail as to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. Page 1 of the
   form should be completed when a CFP is not available on Category I routes. Page 4, the in-
   flight section, will be used to record present positions and spot readings. The procedures
   below are designed to accommodate a wide range of HC-130 navigation equipment
   configurations.
       11.12.1.1. As soon as practical after level-off or coast-out, whichever occurs last,
       navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          11.12.1.1.1. Record the fix in AF IMT 4116 Section VIII.
          11.12.1.1.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution in AF IMT
          4116 Section VI, VIII or in the REMARKS portion of Section X. Corresponding
          deltas or coordinates for all other navigation solutions should also be recorded.
          11.12.1.1.3. At the time of the fix record as a minimum: GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot wind, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF IMT 4116
          Section IX.
       11.12.1.2. After coast out and in between hourly fixes, record current position every 30
       minutes on AF IMT 4116, Page 4 in Section VI, VIII or in the REMARKS portion of
       Section X.
       11.12.1.3. Plot the current position every hour or within 10 minutes of crossing an
       oceanic/Category I reporting point, whichever occurs first.
          11.12.1.3.1. Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true
          heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude, ETA to the next point, and corresponding
          deltas for all other navigation solutions.
       11.12.1.4. Between recorded positions, record spot readings in the NAV
       DATA/REMARKS portion of section IX of the AF IMT 4116 at regular intervals to
       allow for calculating a Dead Reckoning Position (DR) in the event of a navigation system
       failure.
          11.12.1.4.1. Spot readings will include as a minimum, time, heading, drift angle,
          ground speed, wind vector, and true airspeed.
       11.12.1.5. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position
       by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
124                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          11.12.1.5.1. Record the coast-in fix in AF IMT 4116 Section IX.
          11.12.1.5.2. At the time of the coast-in fix record the primary navigation solution in
          AF IMT 4116 Section VI, VIII or X. Corresponding deltas or coordinates for all
          other navigation solutions will also be recorded. Spot readings for the coast-in fix are
          the same as the coast-out fix.
   11.12.2. In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures will be
   implemented. Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a DR up to the present
   position. Plot a fix or most probable position (MPP) at a minimum of once per hour. A dead
   reckoning position associated with the fix/MPP will be plotted on the chart prior to plotting
   the position. If the navigation system failure is resolved, the navigator may resume log
   procedures as outlined in paragraph 11.12.1
      11.12.2.1. At the time of the fix/MPP record the GMT, current position, true heading,
      spot w/v, true air speed, altitude and ETA to the next point.
11.13. Inflight Fuel Management Procedures.
   11.13.1. Record the fuel readings listed below at level off time and regular time intervals
   (coinciding with entries on aircraft performance record), not to exceed 1 hour and 30
   minutes. Use the worksheet on page 4, Section VII of the AF IMT 4116 to complete in-flight
   fuel management computations.
      11.13.1.1. ETA DEST. Best known arrival time at destination.
      11.13.1.2. TIME. Time of the fuel reading.
      11.13.1.3. TERMINAL FUEL FLOW.
      11.13.1.4. CURRENT FUEL FLOW.
      11.13.1.5. AVG FUEL FLOW. Calculate by adding terminal fuel flow to current fuel
      flow and dividing the sum by 2.
      11.13.1.6. FUEL REM. Fuel quantity at time of calculation. In the interest of safety, use
      the lower of the calculated or gauge fuels.
      11.13.1.7. O/H FUEL. Required overhead fuel (item 13 of the fuel plan).
      11.13.1.8. DIFF. Subtract O/H Fuel from FUEL REM.
      11.13.1.9. FUEL ETE. Calculate using formula in paragraph 11.13.2.3
      11.13.1.10. ETE DEST. Subtract TIME from ETA DEST.
      11.13.1.11. EXT TIME. Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Report this value to the
      pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If they are
      correct, evaluate your destination options.
   11.13.2. Use the following formulas to accomplish in-flight fuel management:
      11.13.2.1. (Terminal fuel flow + Present fuel flow) / 2 = Average Fuel Flow
      11.13.2.2. Present fuel – Overhead fuel = Usable Fuel
      11.13.2.3. Usable fuel / Average fuel burn rate = Fuel ETE
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 125


     11.13.2.4. Fuel ETE – ETE to destination = Extra Time
  11.13.3. AF IMT 4125, Range Control Chart may also be used for in-flight fuel
  management.
     11.13.3.1. Manual Construction (see Figure 11.8).
        11.13.3.1.1. ―POINT NUMBER‖ represents the approximate level-off point (initial
        cruise altitude), 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the flight plan distance as indicated on
        AF IMT 4116 or CFP.
        11.13.3.1.2. Column A, ―ENROUTE AND DESTINATION FUEL‖: AF IMT 4116
        takeoff fuel minus enroute reserve fuel.
        11.13.3.1.3. Column B, ―ENROUTE FUEL‖: The fuel (enroute + identified extra
        fuel) planned to be burned off by the time each of the given points defined in
        paragraph 11.13.3.1.1 are reached.
        11.13.3.1.4. Column C, ―MINIMUM FUEL‖: Subtract Column B (ENROUTE
        FUEL) from column A (ENROUTE AND DESTINATION FUEL). This fuel is the
        minimum, at each given point, to fly from that point to destination with sufficient fuel
        to make a missed approach (if required), continue to the destination alternate, hold,
        make the planned approach, and land with 6,000 pounds of fuel. Minimum fuel will
        also include any identified extra fuel needed overhead the alternate (e.g., excess
        holding, for succeeding legs, etc.). The minimum fuel at the 100 percent point should
        be the same as required overhead fuel.
        11.13.3.1.5. Column D, ―DISTANCE‖: The flight plan distance for the given points
        listed in paragraph 11.13.3.1.1, obtained from AF IMT 4116. This can be
        graphically depicted as either distance flown or distance remaining.
        11.13.3.1.6. ―DISTANCE FLOWN/REMAINING‖: Label the nautical miles to the
        destination along the horizontal scale. For distance flown start with 0 at the left and
        allow the major blocks to represent convenient increments of mileage. NOTE: The
        distance scale should be expanded to the maximum to give as large a presentation as
        possible.
        11.13.3.1.7. Draw a vertical line on the graph representing total distance to
        destination and label this line with the destination name.
        11.13.3.1.8. Estimated Performance/Minimum Arrival Fuel Lines.              Estimated
        Performance is based on planned fuel at T/O, level off, and arrival plotted parallel to
        the minimum fuel line.
        11.13.3.1.9. A ―minimum arrival‖ line will be constructed by plotting fuel in column
        C versus distance in column D.
        11.13.3.1.10. An ―estimated performance‖ line will be constructed by plotting a line
        parallel to the minimum arrival line based on planned take-off, level off and arrival
        fuel. NOTE: The difference between the estimated performance line and the
        minimum arrival line is reserve and unidentified extra fuel. If required, plot vertical
        lines representing ETPs at the appropriate distance flown/remaining.
126                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   11.13.4. The navigator may terminate these procedures one hour from destination, when the
   Category I route segment is completed, or at the discretion of the PIC.
11.14. Heading Deviation Check Procedures. (Not applicable to Dual INU aircraft).
   11.14.1. Heading checks should be computed in Section V of AF IMT 4116, page 4. The
   heading deviation check solves for ―deviation‖ (DEV) for all heading reference systems. The
   SCNS allows the navigator to input compass ―deviation‖ for the number one and two
   compasses. In this case reverse the sign of the ―deviation‖ to arrive at ―deviation correction‖
   and input corrections into the SCNS FLT PRMTR 2-3 page. NOTE: Compass deviation is
   not necessarily constant over time or after significant course changes. Navigators should
   reconfirm deviation on Category I routes every 3 hours or after planned course changes of
   greater than 30 degrees. EXCEPTION: A deviation check is not required on flights
   transiting Category I routes of less than three hours if: 1. The aircraft is equipped with two
   or more operable heading systems (the standby compass is not considered a system for this
   requirement). 2. The difference between systems does not exceed 2-degrees.
   11.14.2. Deviation checks not required for Dual INS equipped aircraft.
   11.14.3. Single INS/SCNS Heading Checks. Record and compare the INS/SCNS magnetic
   heading with all compass systems.
11.15. True Airspeed (TAS) Check Procedures (not applicable for HC-130(H)N aircraft).
   11.15.1. TAS checks should be computed in Section IV of AF IMT 4116, page 4.
   Accomplish as soon as practical or within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Record time of
   the check and altitude on the pressure altimeter. If using free air temperature gauge, record
   indicated outside air temperature (IOAT). Use the heat of compression table on AF IMT
   4116 to convert IOAT to true outside air temperature (TOAT). If using SCNS temperature,
   record TOAT.
   11.15.2. Navigators can use 0 knots for indicated airspeed (IAS) to calibrated airspeed
   (CAS) correction and minus 3 knots for CAS to equivalent airspeed (EAS ) correction for
   TAS above 270 (or minus 2 knots if less than or equal to 270).
   11.15.3. ITAS – Indicated TAS. Record the TAS reading from the TAS meter and the
   SCNS/INS or other computer (if the aircraft is so equipped). Record the difference between
   computed TAS and this reading in the CORR block.
11.16. Grid Procedures. Refer to AFPAM 11-216 for definitions and formulae. NOTE:
Entering arguments include a Grid convergence factor which can only be obtained from
hardcopy NGA charts. Current automated mission planning tools utilizing CADRG NGA charts
do not provide these values.
   11.16.1. SCNS Grid Procedures. For description of SCNS Grid operations procedures, refer
   to T.O. 1C-130-1-4, Section II.
   11.16.2. Manual Grid Procedures. The navigator will use the AF IMT 4116, page 7/Section
   XI when grid navigation procedures are required. Block entries are as follows:
      11.16.2.1. Time. Time of heading/system heading observation.
      11.16.2.2. TH. Observed/computed true heading.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                              127


     11.16.2.3. CA/LONG. Enter +W –E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle.
     11.16.2.4. GH. Observed/computed grid heading.
     11.16.2.5. GYRO #1, GYRO #2. On aircraft equipped with two independent gyro
     stabilized systems with numbers corresponding to aircraft systems (e.g. C-12 No. 1, N-1
     No 2), circled number denotes the primary steering gyro. On aircraft whose systems are
     not numbered or do not correspond to the aircraft system, identify the primary steering
     gyro in ―REMARKS‖.
     11.16.2.6. GR. Gyro reading. Record the reading from the primary compass.
     11.16.2.7. PREC. The amount of precession since the last heading shot (period
     precession): GH – GR = PREC.
     11.16.2.8. RATE/CUM. The hourly precession rate based upon the precession indicated
     at the time of observation. Precession rate is derived from the period precession and the
     applicable elapsed time period (since the last compass reset). Example: 2 degrees
     precession in 40 minutes equals a 3 degrees/hour precession rate. This entry is required
     only when period precession is greater than one degree. The cumulative portion of the
     block is used for tracking the cumulative precession rate once a false latitude has been
     set.
     11.16.2.9. LAT. The mid-latitude between the current observation and the next proposed
     observation.
     11.16.2.10. FALSE LAT. The false latitude setting being used to eliminate precession.
     This entry is required only when a false latitude setting is used.
     11.16.2.11. RESET. Whenever a gyro is reset, place a check mark in this block.
     11.16.2.12. GC. Measured grid course to the next checkpoint.
     11.16.2.13. DRIFT. The number of degrees (+ or -) of drift.
     11.16.2.14. DGH. Desired grid heading. Apply anticipated DRIFT to GC.
     11.16.2.15. RT/2 CORR. See formula on the bottom of the AF IMT 4116.
     11.16.2.16. IGH. Initial grid heading. Used for alter heading.
     11.16.2.17. GRID ENTRY. Apply grivation (GRIV) to Magnetic Heading (MH) to
     obtain desired grid heading (DGH); or apply (LONG) or convergence angle (CA) to True
     Heading (TH) to obtain DGH. See formulas on the AF IMT 4116. NOTE: Grid
     convergence factors can only be obtained from hardcopy NGA charts. Current automated
     mission planning tools utilizing CADRG NGA charts do not provide these values.
     11.16.2.18. GRID EXIT. Apply GRIV to DGH to obtain MH; or apply LONG or CA to
     DGH to obtain TH. See formulas on the AF IMT 4116.
  11.16.3. En route Requirements:
     11.16.3.1. The Grid Entry/Exit section of the AF IMT 4116 will be completed prior to
     heading reference changes. When entering grid operation, spot grivation should be
     applied to the computed magnetic heading to obtain DGH. The aircraft will be
     established on the computed magnetic heading prior to resetting the heading references.
128                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


      When exiting grid, the computed magnetic headings will be the target heading when the
      compass systems are reset. In both cases, the computed magnetic headings will be
      compared to the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion
      data used. This will ensure the validity of initial entry headings and provide precise
      target headings for exit.
      11.16.3.2. Normally, the grid heading will be checked each 30-minutes after grid entry.
      If the compasses are precessing 3 degrees per hour or less, hourly checks may be
      obtained after the first hour.
      11.16.3.3. Determine the precession information for each gyro after each heading check.
      When a gyro‘s precession is greater than 1 degree, reset the gyro to correct grid heading.
      When the period precession is 1 degree or less, the navigator may either reset the gyro or
      treat the precession as zero.
      11.16.3.4. Whenever the period precession is greater that 1 degree (optional for 1 degree
      or less), the hourly precession rate may be removed by use of a false latitude setting.
      When the combined earth rate and gyro precession are less than +15 degrees/hour, the
      false latitude setting will totally compensate for precession. Two considerations are
      necessary:
          11.16.3.4.1. Predicted precession becomes zero.
          11.16.3.4.2. It may be necessary to adjust previous DR and air plot positions if the
          precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks. If this occurs, adjustments
          normally will be small and have negligible effect on DR and air plot accuracy;
          however, the effect should be considered.
      11.16.3.5. To determine false latitude correction, enter the earth rate table with the
      desired latitude and extract the tabulated earth rate value. Algebraically combine the
      earth rate value and the observed hourly precession rate (use cumulative precession rate
      once a false latitude has been set). Re-enter the earth rate table with the combined value
      and extract the corresponding false latitude.
      11.16.3.6. Only 15 degrees/hour can be removed by a false latitude setting. When the
      sum of earth and primary gyro precession rates exceeds +15 degrees, the navigator must
      artificially steer the aircraft (in effect, the aircraft will fly a gentle arc) to compensate for
      the amount of precession in excess of +15 degrees/hour. The formula used to correct the
      DGH to an initial grid heading (IGH) to fly appears on the AF IMT 4116 as ―RT/2
      CORR‖ (note that the formula produces a correction, so the precession rate must be given
      its opposite sign). The precession rate used in the formula must be adjusted to reflect the
      time period in the DR ahead. When ―carrying‖ precession as suggested above, the
      navigator should consider several aspects of the navigational problem: NOTE: When
      precession exceeds 15 degrees per hour, consider the compasses unusable.
          11.16.3.6.1. If alter headings are not made at heading check times, precession will
          have accumulated by alter heading times and a correction (opposite sign of
          precession) should be applied to the IGH using the total precession correction portion
          of the AF IMT 4116.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                             129


         11.16.3.6.2. If the precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks, it may be
         advisable to adjust previous DR and air plot positions described at paragraph
         11.16.3.4.2
  11.16.4. Miscellaneous Procedures:
     11.16.4.1. Normally, when changing charts or crossing the 180 degree meridian, only the
     reference changes; the heading of the aircraft is not altered. The change is made by
     comparing the grid courses and applying the difference to the gyro reading (old chart GC
     350 degrees; new chart GC 331 degrees; GR 353; 350 – 331 = 019 = 334; reset the gyro
     to read 334).
     11.16.4.2. Always recheck computations and formulas when a radical change in
     precession is observed.

                                            Chapter 12

                    FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to duties in the flight manual and other applicable Technical Orders,
flight engineers will comply with the procedures and duties specified in this volume. Except for
ferry flights, hostile environment repair, and C-130 Operations with suspected fuel tank foam
fires these items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal procedures. The aircraft
commander may assign other mission-related duties to the flight engineer as necessary.
12.2. Authority to Clear Red X. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red X.
In a situation where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
unavailable, the flight engineer may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home
station MXG/CC or designated representative. Other crewmembers are not authorized to clear a
Red X. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear Red Xs for engine intakes and exhaust,
engine panels and covers, pitot covers, gear pins, and SPR drains when qualified maintenance
personnel are not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC, RQG/CC, or
representative.
12.3. In-Process Inspections. All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to
perform in-process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. During the assembly or
reassembly of an item at those stages where further assembly will prevent the required inspection
of the item, an in-process inspection will be performed. Document the in-process inspection.
(Refer to T.O. 00-20-1)
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Flight engineers normally are not required to refuel or defuel C-130
aircraft; however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
maintenance personnel are unavailable. This policy is designed for support of the aircraft and
mission while away from home station. The flight engineer will use TO 00-25-172 and TO 1C-
130H-2-12JG-10-1, Job Guide—Ground Handling, Fuel System Servicing and Concurrent
Servicing, during all servicing operations. When concurrent servicing is required the flight
engineer will be the Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS) and follow instructions from TO 00-
25-172and TO 1C-130H-2-12JG-10-1. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft
commander will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer.
12.5. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the
flight engineer will assist the pilot in maintaining the AFTO Form 781. Verify the exceptional
release is signed before starting engines and re-signed, if necessary, at en route stops. After each
flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, and flight duration time(s), etc., are
entered on AFTO Form 781H. Review all AFTO Form 781A discrepancies and ensure clear,
detailed entries are made, symbols, date discovered, and when discovered codes are entered for
each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are signed.
12.6. Flight Monitoring. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all phases of
flight and ground operations. Notify the pilot of all abnormal indications and take action as
required.
   12.6.1. Maintain outside vigilance when flight deck duties allow.
   12.6.2. Monitor the primary radio, inter-plane radio, interphone systems, and HOT LISTEN.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                      131


   12.6.3. Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required climb and cruise power.
   12.6.4. Backup the pilots in monitoring modified contour/low level operations.
   12.6.5. Ensure both heading markers are set correctly during the turn point briefing.
   12.6.6. Ensure pilot/copilot radar altimeter is set correctly for the specific low level altitude.
   12.6.7. Flight engineers will compute zero and 50 percent obstacle clearance speeds for all
   low level operations, prior to entering low level environment.
       12.6.7.1. During low level operations the flight engineer will state ―190 Knots‖ when
       Enroute airspeeds decay to 190 Knots. Flight engineers will further announce to the
       aircrew in 10 knot increments below 190 knots (e.g. ―180‖, ―170‖) until airspeed exceeds
       190 knots. EXCEPTION: not required for planned slowdowns (HAR, airdrops, etc.).
   12.6.8. State "17,000" over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.
   NOTE: In the event of an inadvertent over-torque the following criteria should be carefully
   considered in regards to continued aircraft operations or mission accomplishment:
Torque > 19,600 in lb. < 21,500
781A entry, historical tracking only, no inspection required.
Torque >21,500 in lb. < 23,000 in lb.
781A entry, visual inspection within 25 hours.
Torque > 23,000 in lb. < 23,260 in lb.
781A entry, maintenance required for NDI and engine mounts change within 25 flight hours
Torque > 23,260 in lb.
781A entry, magnetic plug check and if reduction gearbox oil pressure is lower then before over-
torque the reduction gearbox may need to be changed.
NOTE: The 25 flight hour criteria are based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance.
ACC aircraft that experience an over-torque exceeding 23,000 in pounds of torque are to
immediately return the aircraft for inspection/maintenance.
WARNING: Failure to comply with these criteria could result in catastrophic structural failure.
   12.6.9. Notify the pilot when any of the following is noted:
       12.6.9.1. Deviation of more than 200 feet from assigned altitude.
       12.6.9.2. The aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed.
12.7. Tactical Checklists. When the pilot initiates a tactical checklist, read and ensure timely
completion of all checklist items.
12.8. C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) Cards (AF IMT 4063V2/4064V2):
   12.8.1. Takeoff and immediate landing data for the departure airfield will be completed prior
   to takeoff.
   12.8.2. Use AF IMT 4064V2 and AF IMT 4063V2 (mini card) or locally produced and
   approved at OGV level, C-130 TOLD Card. Complete data applicable to the type of takeoff
   and landing to be made (i.e., landing distance for normal landing; ground roll for assault
   landings).
   12.8.3. Record computed data in accordance with the flight manual and this volume.
132                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   12.8.4. Base all performance calculations on 95 percent engine efficiency without nose
   wheel steering unless mission requirements dictate otherwise. Reference paragraph 5.16 for
   guidance concerning when nose wheel steering is authorized for performance data
   calculations.
   12.8.5. Accomplish TOLD card computations using performance manual data, approved
   tabulated data, or TOLD computer.
   12.8.6. Record adjusted speeds to be used; i.e., record minimum control speed (one engine
   inoperative in ground effect) as take-off speed if minimum control speed is higher than
   computed takeoff speed.
   12.8.7. Computed data must equal or exceed the requirements of this volume.
   12.8.8. Following initial takeoff and landing, only affected speeds need to be re-
   accomplished if favorable conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas
   (e.g., gross weight decreases due to fuel burnoff, while pressure altitude and temperature
   remain constant). New data is required for pressure altitude changes of 1,000 feet, gross
   weight changes of 5,000 pounds, or temperature change of 5 degrees C.
   12.8.9. When stop-and-go operations are planned, the flight engineer will compute a
   minimum Stop and go distance required. Runway remaining for takeoff must be sufficient to
   allow takeoff and refusal speeds to be equal. The engineer will compute stop-and-go
   distances by entering the refusal speed chart (backwards) with the take-off speed to be used
   (corrected for Vmca, gust, or crosswinds if required), intercepting all necessary corrections to
   the baseline and the proper Takeoff Factor used (i.e. reduced, normal, or maximum power).
   12.8.10. The minimum TOLD card computations (airspeeds) required for a termination
   landing are: air minimum control speeds, obstacle clearance speed, three engine climb speed,
   50 and 100 percent flap landing speeds. The flight engineer will post flaps up approach speed
   for aircraft equipped with GCAS/GPWS during night or IMC approaches.
   12.8.11. Rescue HC/MC-130 aircraft performing static line personnel drops will compute a
   Minimum Operating Speed (MOS). Place this information on the TOLD card. Compute data
   using power off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degree bank angle plus 5 knots.
   12.8.12. If squadrons want to use a mini TOLD card, it must be submitted through individual
   Group Stan/Eval offices for approval, who will in-turn submit information copies to
   MAJCOM/A3TV.
12.9. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). Complete a USAF C-130 Automated
Inspection, Repair, Corrosion and Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT) system worksheet in accordance
with 1C-130-101, Implementation of C-130 Series Aircraft Usage Report, on all flights.
12.10. Aircraft Fuel Usage Log (AF Form 4108). Maintain AF Form 4108, Fuel Usage Log,
in accordance with paragraph 12.10.2 12.10.1of this volume. Coordinate with the navigator for
fuel reading clock times.
   12.10.1. In-flight Fuel Logging Procedures. The following instructions standardize the
   use, completion, and maintenance of AF Form 4108.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   133


     12.10.1.1. Responsibility. The flight engineer assigned to the flight will complete the
     AF Form 4108 whenever the navigator completes the Range Control Chart. The log may
     also be filled out as necessary for training and to maintain flight engineer proficiency.
     12.10.1.2. Purpose. AF Form 4108 is sufficient for normal ACC operational
     requirements and is used as a simple method of recording aircraft fuel usage data. When
     additional data is required for identifying trends in engine failure, performance, or for
     special test programs, the directing headquarters will furnish necessary forms and
     instructions.
  12.10.2. Instructions for AF Form 4108. Form heading entries are self-explanatory.
     12.10.2.1. Block 1 - Fuel Gage Pounds. Record fuel quantity from the fuel quantity
     indicators before and after flight. This reading is normally taken prior to engine start
     with the indicators powered and after flight prior to power being removed from the
     indicators.
     12.10.2.2. Block 2 - Weight Data. Record the operating weight and the cargo/passenger
     weight from the DD Form 365-4. Ramp fuel weight is obtained from Block 1. Use the
     middle blank space for last minute changes prior to engine start or as otherwise required.
     12.10.2.3. Block 3 - Fuel On/Offload. Enter the total weight of fuel On/Offload during
     air refueling.

         12.10.2.6.2.

         segments. Climbs of 4,000 feet or less will not be recorded separately but will be
         included in the preceding cruise segment. When constant climb is maintained to
         cruise altitude, use fuel flow reading taken at 2/3 climb altitude. When constant climb
         cannot be maintained to cruise altitude due to ATC clearances, etc., enter the
         difference between the sum of the individual fuel quantity gage readings at the
         beginning and end of the climb.
         12.10.2.6.3. Cruise operating conditions are indicated by the number in the cruise

         for this period. Normally, cruise entries will be no more than 60 minutes. However,
         for the first cruise immediately prior to en route or step climb and the last cruise prior
         to descent may be no less than 30 minutes, nor more than 90 minutes.
         12.10.2.6.4.
         final letdown that occurs when landing procedures begin. The loss in altitude during
         final letdown is indicated by "L&T". Landing and taxi is that condition from the end
         of the last entry in the sequence of descents/cruise to engine shutdown on the ramp.
134                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


         Holding time during an approach must be accounted for as an additional cruise
         condition after descent when necessary (30 minutes holding or more). Descents of
         4,000 feet or less will not be recorded separately but will be indicated in the
         preceding cruise segment. When descent exceeds 4,000 feet, Blocks 10 through 17
         need not be accomplished.
         12.10.2.6.5. Helicopter Air Refueling (HAR) and Air Refueling (AR)
         Operations. Cruise, climb, or descent time to refueling altitude ends approximately
         at start of on/offload. Indicate segment with "HAR 1" or "AR1", "HAR 2" or "AR 2",
         etc., in condition Block as appropriate. Blocks 10 through 17 need not be
         accomplished. Blocks 19, 20, 22, 25, and 28 entries not required for AR. At
         completion of on/offload, a new cruise, climb, or descent segment will be initiated.
         NOTE: Rescue, search, combat, combat support, or any special mission which
         requires constant variations in altitude and airspeed may use the same procedures as
         AR/HAR operations. For this type of condition use an "S 1", "S 2", etc., in the
         condition Block. 146
      12.10.2.7. Block 7 - End. Enter time (GMT) for end of conditions.
      12.10.2.8. Block 8 - Set. Enter increment time duration for the conditions for
      WU/TAXI/TO segment. All warm-up and taxi times will be entered in the circle of the
      SET Block. Takeoff time is computed from brake release to the first change of power
      (when reduced power procedures are used, compute takeoff time using 2 minutes).
      12.10.2.9. Block 9 - Total. Enter cumulative total time of SET time excluding the
      warm-up and taxi times entered in the circle SET time.
      12.10.2.10. Block 10 - OATI. Enter indicated outside air temperature reading.
      12.10.2.11. Block 11 - OATC/VAR:
         12.10.2.11.1. OATC. Enter corrected outside air temperature as determined from the
         appropriate performance manual, SCNS computer system, or mission computer(s) as
         required.
         12.10.2.11.2. VAR. Enter temperature variation from standard ICAO temperature.
      12.10.2.12. Block 12 - HP. Enter the pressure altitude for the condition with altimeter
      set at 29.92 Hg.
         12.10.2.12.1. For climb, enter Hp for 2/3 the intended climb altitude when that
         altitude is known. This figure will represent 2/3 pressure altitude of the actual climb.
         If a climb starts at 15,000 feet and concludes at 30,000 feet, you compute the pressure
         altitude for 2/3 of the 15,000 difference which is 10,000 feet. This Hp added to the
         15,000 foot beginning Hp equals 25,000 feet Hp.
         12.10.2.12.2. For cruise, enter actual Hp.

                                 PERSONNEL RECOVERY

Section 15A—PERSONNEL RECOVERY

15.1. Personnel Recovery Fundamentals. Personnel Recovery (PR) is the umbrella term for
operations focusing on recovering captured, missing, or isolated personnel. TTPs for basic skills
required by HC/MC-130P crews in the tactical execution of PR are contained in AFTTP 3-
3.HC/MC-130 and augmented with the following guidance.
   15.1.1. Due to the time-critical nature involved with the recovery survivors, PR is a very
   demanding mission. Because of their medical condition, survivors may perish while a
   traditional preplanned mission is formulated. Most searches are part of an effort to save life;
   therefore, make every effort to complete the search as rapidly and efficiently as possible. A
   thorough scan of the search area and accurate navigation significantly increase the
   probability of detection. Reactions to sightings must be timely and accurate. This section
   outlines operational procedures for conducting effective searches in the C-130 aircraft. Refer
   to the IAMSARV1/V2 for additional information.
15.2. Specialized Rescue Airdrops. Specialized rescue airdrops will be conducted using the
SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklists. See Attachment 2.
   15.2.1. HC/MC-130 aircraft are authorized to perform loadmaster directed airdrops of
   bundles off the ramp, to include trial-line drops, while spotting from an open paratroop door
   [single paratroop door open only].
       15.2.1.1. This configuration will be used when equipment size precludes exit from the
       paratroop door or trail line drops procedures are used.
       15.2.1.2. This configuration will be used for equipment only drops and is not authorized
       for personnel deployment. WARNING: Under no circumstances will a paratroop door
       and ramp and door be open at the same time when parachutists are involved.
       15.2.1.3. If the bundle/equipment dropped from the ramp requires spotting procedures
       from an open paratroop door, ensure life lines are properly adjusted for both exits.
       15.2.1.4. During the PRE-SEARCH /PRE- DEPLOYMENT Checklist, open the
       paratroop door first, then open the cargo ramp and door.
       15.2.1.5. During the POST-SEARCH/POST-DEPLOYMENT Checklist, close the cargo
       ramp and door first, then close the paratroop door.

                     RESCUE HC/MC-130 SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT

Section 16A—General

16.1. General. This Chapter provides procedures, requirements and restriction for HC-130P/N
and CSAR MC-130P tactical employment. It provides parameters used to employ the techniques
and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.33 and other tactics manuals. If a discrepancy exists between this
instruction and a tactics manual, the information in this instruction will take precedence.
16.2. Definitions. See Attachment 1 for a complete list of definitions used in this chapter.
16.3. Checklists/In-flight Guides. Amplified checklist information is included in Attachment
2 of this instruction. Abbreviated checklists/briefing guides/in-flight guides are located in
separate publications called AFI 11-2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2. The flight engineer reads all
tactical checklists unless briefed otherwise by the aircraft commander. Checklist items not
applicable to the aircraft or mission being flown need not be challenged or responded to (e.g.,
Air Deflector Doors - "CLOSED AND OFF" need not be challenged if air deflector doors were
not opened).
16.4. Survival and Protective Equipment. All personnel will wear the survival and protective
gear provided during hostile environment operations. Unit/deployed commanders may amend
survival/protective equipment requirements based on the threat. See AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130
for list of survival/protective equipment.
16.5. Mission Planning. Refer to AFTTP 3.3-33 for in depth mission planning considerations,
   16.5.1. Aircrew Briefings. Aircrew briefings will be conducted IAW Chapter 6 of this
   instruction and the guidance below:
       16.5.1.1. During the mission crew briefing, the aircraft commander will brief all
       applicable items from the aircraft commander‘s briefing guide in AFI 11-2HC-130V3
       CL-1.
       16.5.1.2. Tactical Briefs. All tactical sorties will include a route study and tactical
       briefing. The navigator will conduct the tactical briefing and brief all applicably items
       from the Navigators Briefing Guide located in 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1.
       16.5.1.3. Pilots and navigator are required to attend the tactical route study and brief. It is
       highly desirable the AMSS attend when duties allow.
16.6. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) General.
   16.6.1. Limitations. All aircrew will be familiar with the limitations associated with NVG
   use as discussed in AFMAN 11-217V2, Instrument Flight Procedures and AFTTP 3-3.33.
   NOTE: The route study should emphasize NVG limitations and performance factors and
   their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.
   16.6.2. Preflight. All crewmembers will perform a thorough preflight of their NVGs.
166                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   16.6.3. Inflight Requirements. When NVG use is required, the pilots, navigator, flight
   engineer, loadmaster, airborne mission systems specialist, and scanners should wear them or
   have them immediately available based on mission requirements.
        16.6.3.1. Pilots will wear NVGs with similar acuity and gain. See Figure 6.1
        WARNING: NVGs and associated components (battery cords, safety cords, and other
        hardware) can become entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other
        controls. Any interference can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of
        other critical switches or controls. Extreme care must be exercised by pilots during seat
        changes and by flight engineers performing duties that involve leaning forward in the
        seat; i.e. exchanging TOLD cards or adjusting fuel panel switches.
        16.6.3.2. Panoramic NVG (PNVG) Usage. AN/AVS-10 PNVGs are only authorized for
        use by pilots.

                          * Not compatible with color cockpit displays
   16.6.4. Spare NVGs and Batteries. Mission requirements and duration of the deployment
   will be determining factors for the total number of NVG sets required. The PIC must ensure
   there is one spare set of preflighted NVGs (can be either the AMSS or Navigator's set). Each
   crewmember will carry spare batteries for their NVGs.
16.7. Minimum and Emergency Safe Altitudes (MSA and ESA).
   16.7.1. PFPS TCA Tool. TCA tool calculations do not take vertical obstacles (e.g. towers,
   cables, power lines) into account. Its elevation reference is derived from DTED alone. The
   TCA tool does provide a starting point from which a crew may manually verify MSA/ESA.
   WARNING: The TCA tool will not be used as the sole source for calculating MSA and
   ESA.
   16.7.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an intermediate altitude which will provide
   terrain clearance, yet limit threat detection during situations that require leaving the modified
   contour profile.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  167


      16.7.2.1. Calculate the MSA for en route low level, airdrop and SCAs by adding 500 feet
      above the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of centerline or planned flight path,
      whichever is higher, and rounded up to the next 100-foot increment.
      16.7.2.2. Calculate the MSA for helicopter air refueling legs by adding 1000 feet (2000
      feet in designated mountainous terrain) to the highest terrain or obstacle within 5 NM of
      centerline.
   16.7.3. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA provides a safe altitude which ensures terrain
   clearance. A single ESA will be established for the entire route when there are no significant
   changes in topography. For routes where the terrain does vary significantly, a separate ESA
   may be established for route segments with similar terrain or obstacle elevations.
      16.7.3.1. Calculate ESA by adding 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in designated mountainous
      terrain) to the highest elevation or obstacle within 10 NM of centerline or planned flight
      path, whichever is greater, and rounded up to the next 100-foot increment.
16.8. Chart Requirements.
   16.8.1. Planned low level routes will be drawn on a 1:500,000 (TPC or Sectional) or larger
   scale chart. Use a 1:250,000 (JOG) or larger scale chart for overland threat penetration
   operations, mountainous NVG low-level operations, and the objective areas, unless not
   available or of an inferior quality to a TPC. WARNING: Mixing multiple coordinate data
   can cause significant navigation and target errors. The consistent use of data for all
   coordinates greatly reduces these errors. Ensure the same datum is used to derive coordinates
   for all mission requirements. NOTE: Color copies, laminated, and PFPS charts are
   acceptable forms of hardcopy charts provided the contour and contrast remain intact and the
   chart is used for preflight route study and the flight. If laminated charts are used, the crew
   will ensure that the laminate does not degrade the quality or readability of the chart and that
   all data remains intact. NOTE: For local training routes, if a mountainous NVG route has
   been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown
   with reference to a TPC or Sectional.
   16.8.2. Chart Construction. At a minimum, low-level charts will be annotated IAW Table
   16.2, Required Chart Annotations. In addition, the following general instructions apply:
      16.8.2.1. Use dark ink, pencil, or symbol tapes to portray course lines. Obstacles and
      other chart entries may be drawn or highlighted in any legible color.
      16.8.2.2. The chart code, scale, and edition will be annotated on the chart
      16.8.2.3. The current CHUM/ECHUM/DAFIF (review date included) will be annotated
      on the chart.
      16.8.2.4. Course Arrow Box. A course arrow box will be provided for each leg. At a
      minimum the course arrow box will include leg magnetic course, distance, and MSA.
      Where the leg is split between two charts, use the course arrow box on both.
      16.8.2.5. Print the ESA in bold numbers on the chart. When multiple ESAs are used, or
      when lengthy strip charts are used, the ESA will be annotated on each chart segment.
168                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


      16.8.2.6. When stripped charts are used, a larger scale chart (i.e., ONC, JNC) will be
      prepared by the navigator to allow for major unplanned deviations during critical mission
      phases and emergency egress.
      16.8.2.7. When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap.
      16.8.2.8. Draw course lines using either point-to-point or radius of turn.
          16.8.2.8.1. If using point-to-point, measure true course and distance from point-to-
          point.
          16.8.2.8.2. If using radius of turn see Table 16.1
          16.8.2.8.3. True course is measured from the end of the turn to the next turn point

      16.8.2.9. Annotate appropriate warning and advisory locations on the chart (e.g., 20, 10,
      6, and 1 minute).
      16.8.2.10. Draw deviation lines when the planned route is different than the course line.
      Annotate magnetic heading information near these deviation lines (if desired) to aid in
      dead reckoning during significant turns.
   16.8.3. Chart Annotation. Use the annotation symbology provided in AFTTP 3-3.33. and
   listed below for marking mandatory chart requirements.
      16.8.3.1. Start climb points and their associated reference altitude will be annotated on
      charts at the required distance to go where the start climb is to be initiated on each leg.
      Any of the following annotation styles are acceptable: ―S/C 17/12/3500‖ or ―S/C
      17/3500/12‖ or ―S/C 3500/17/12‖. These examples indicate a climb to the reference
      altitude of 3,500 feet MSL that should be started at 17 NM to go and to be at reference
      altitude by 12 NM to go.
      16.8.3.2. Start descent points for MCAD conducted in IMC will be annotated and
      calculated IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130 IFR Drop Corridor procedures.

1. Required for NVG low-level operations

NOTE: Charts will be classified accordingly based on the information sources and methods used
to obtain data.

   16.8.4. Minimum Hardcopy Chart Requirements for Mission Planning and Flight.
       16.8.4.1. The Navigator will carry a hardcopy chart (or set of charts as required) that
       covers all enroute and objective mission areas.
       16.8.4.2. Between the pilots, a single hardcopy chart (or a single set of hardcopy charts
       as required) that covers all mission enroute and objective areas will be carried. The pilot
       and copilot may share a single low level/objective area chart during flight. If this option
170                                                             AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


       is used, both the pilot and copilot must participate in pre-mission route analysis using this
       single chart(s).
       16.8.4.3. An overview chart of at least 1:1,000,000 (ONC) scale should be available to
       both the navigator and AMSS.
16.9. Use of Laptop Computers during Flight. Electro-magnetic Interference (EMI) certified
laptop computers and software, such as portable flight planning system (PFPS), are allowed in-
flight IAW AFI 11-202V3, and their use is highly encouraged. Depending on aircraft
modification, these laptops can receive positional data from a portable commercial GPS system
with external/window mounted antenna or from the navigational system data bus. If used
properly, these systems enhance situational awareness (e.g., ―Moving Map,‖ PFPS/
FalconView/TaskView/Threat Overlays, Intel Feeds) and provide an ability to re-plan missions
in-flight.
   16.9.1. These systems do not replace existing navigation equipment, must not be used as the
   sole means of navigation, and must not interfere with the accomplishment of normal duties.
   16.9.2. Each user must have a back-up paper chart immediately available in case use of the
   system is denied.
16.10. Barometric Altimeter Updating. Altimeter update points should be planned for en
route portions of the mission. Sources of update include weather forecast, ground reporting
stations, and crew updates. Crew updating involves the comparison of absolute altitude (radar
altimeter) plus terrain elevation to the pressure altitude when flying over a body of water or flat
terrain. Obtain an updated altimeter setting as close to the objective area as possible. If this is not
possible, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting.
16.11. Radar Altimeter Usage during Tactical Operations.
   16.11.1. Low level Settings. Set radar altimeters no lower than 10% below minimum
   enroute altitude (i.e. minimum setting of 450 feet for 500 foot NVG modified contour and
   180 feet for day threat penetration at 200 feet). NOTE: During modified contour low level
   procedures, regardless of the radar altimeter setting used, if the aircraft is below the desired
   modified contour altitude, a correction to altitude should be made. Do not wait for the low
   light to illuminate to begin a correction.
   16.11.2. Airdrop Settings.
       16.11.2.1. Low Altitude Airdrops. The radar altimeter should be set no lower than 10%
       below drop altitude.
       16.11.2.2. High Altitude Airdrops. Set the radar altimeter at the discretion of the aircraft
       commander.
   16.11.3. Any crewmember noting illumination of the "Low" warning light on the radar
   altimeter will state the word "Low" to indicate this to the pilot flying and the crew.
   16.11.4. The pilot and Navigator will use the same radar altimeter setting. EXCEPTION:
   When conducting airland operations using the Infil/Exfil Checklist.
16.12. Use of TCAS and GCAS during Tactical Operations.
   16.12.1. ETCAS.

       16.12.1.1. ETCAS may be operated in TA only mode during low-level operations.
       16.12.1.2. ETCAS will be operated in TA only mode during airdrop and HAR
       operations.
   16.12.2. GCAS. AUDIO ON/VISUAL OFF or AUDIO OFF/VISUAL ON may be used to
   set the GCAS system to tactical mode.
16.13. Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements. The minimum operating equipment
required for tactical employment events is contained in Table 16.3. Aircrew experience level
and mission factors may dictate greater equipment requirements than those listed.

Section 16B—Enroute Operations

16.15. Minimum IFR En Route Altitude.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                175


   16.15.1. Minimum IFR en route altitude is IAW AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented.
   EXCEPTION: For contingency operations, compute minimum IFR en route altitude by
   adding 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight
   (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NM of the route centerline.
   Round this altitude up to the next 100-foot increment. For routes where the terrain varies
   significantly, a separate minimum IFR en route altitude may be established for route
   segments with similar terrain or obstacle elevations.
   16.15.2. Descent below IFR minimum altitudes, listed above, is only authorized under the
   following conditions:
      16.15.2.1. Intercepting glideslope for an approved IMC SCA, or
      16.15.2.2. Reaching the Drop Zone Entry Point for a MCAD.
      16.15.2.3. Established on an ATC provided minimum radar vectoring altitude available
      from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility.
      16.15.2.4. Established on a published IFR route or instrument approach procedure
      compatible with aircraft navigation systems.
      16.15.2.5. IMC Descent to VFR.
16.16. Low Level Operations. Tactical operations conducted below 3,000 feet AGL under
VFR are considered low level.
   16.16.1. Minimum Equipment Requirements. See Table 16.3
   16.16.2. Weather Minimums. Modified contour low level operations will be conducted in
   VMC. NOTE: This does not preclude the pilot from the VFR filing requirements in AFI
   11-202V3 or applicable ICAO/host nation requirements if operating outside CONUS.
   WARNING: Operation under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is normally an emergency
   procedure during training and exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls
   to the area air traffic control agency. During contingency or combat missions, the necessity
   of flying "comm-out" in IMC must be weighed against terrain clearance capability and the
   increased mid-air potential.
   16.16.3. Lowest Acceptable Altitude (LAA). During training operations, higher weather or
   altitude minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, training considerations or
   crew experience. Lowest altitudes allowed for enroute modified contour low-level
   operations are:
      16.16.3.1. Day. LAA will be 300 feet modified contour above the terrain (except when
      using Threat Penetration Altitude), by visual reference to both the terrain and the radar
      altimeter. Momentary terrain clearance deviations may be expected due to terrain
      variance.
      16.16.3.2. NVG Low-Level. LAA will be 500 feet modified contour above the terrain
      (except when using Threat Penetration Altitude), by visual reference to both the terrain
      and the radar altimeter. Momentary terrain clearance deviations may be expected due to
      terrain variance.
176                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   16.16.4. Simulated Emergencies During Low Level Training. Simulated emergencies may
   be conducted during enroute low-level training on local routes. Aircrew will comply with the
   following restrictions in addition to those listed in Chapter 9.
      16.16.4.1. Restricted to flat or rolling terrain
      16.16.4.2. Simulated emergencies will only be conducted on specific legs identified
      during crew brief.
      16.16.4.3. Do not compound emergencies.
      16.16.4.4. As determined by the instructor pilot, initiate a climb to an intermediate
      altitude, DFA, or MSA. Continue to climb to or maintain required altitude until the
      completion of the simulated emergency.
16.17. Threat Penetration Altitude.
   16.17.1. During combat operations limit the time spent at threat penetration altitude to the
   duration needed to avoid the specific threat.
   16.17.2. Threat penetration altitudes may be flown during training operations.           The
   following restrictions apply:
      16.17.2.1. A mission IP must be in either seat.
      16.17.2.2. Not authorized on unfamiliar routes.
      16.17.2.3. Restricted to flat or rolling terrain.
      16.17.2.4. No "Break" calls or "Hard Turn" calls may be made. "Turn" calls are allowed.
      If a turn requires more than 20 degrees angle of bank, the aircraft will terminate threat
      penetration operations and immediately climb to a normal modified contour profile,
      MSA, or ESA as required.
      16.17.2.5. No simulated emergencies allowed.
      16.17.2.6. LAA is 200 for day VMC operations and 300 feet for NVG operations.
      WARNING: Bank angles are severely restricted below 200 ft AGL. Due to the close
      proximity to the ground, aircrews must be cautious of any descending vector that may
      develop during threat penetration operations.
16.18. NVG Low Level Specific Requirements.
   16.18.1. Lunar Illumination Criteria. There is no minimum illumination requirement to
   conduct NVG modified contour low level operations.
      16.18.1.1. Aircrews will use 0.8 millilux (.00008 lux) effective illumination as a standard
      for low illumination and increased risk mitigation. This roughly equates to 10% lunar
      illumination on a clear night. When effective illumination is below 0.8 millilux, crews
      will obtain squadron CC/DO approval prior to flight, add low illumination as a factor in
      their risk assessment, and mitigate the risk. This may require changing profile, airspeeds,
      or altitudes among many other options.
   16.18.2. Reference Altitudes and Start Climb Points. The navigator will compute reference
   altitudes and start climb points for all NVG low level routes. NVG reference altitude and
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   177


  start climb points will be annotated on navigator and pilot/copilot charts and briefed in the
  route study.
     16.18.2.1. Reference Altitudes. Reference altitude is an altitude designed to provide
     terrain masking and terrain clearance along the planned flight path. Adding the
     appropriate en route AGL (contour) altitude to predicted terrain elevation (e.g., chart,
     DTED) provides the reference altitudes. Base altitudes on the terrain within 1 NM either
     side course centerline or deviation path (planned flight path) based on
     chart/DTED/navigation system accuracy. Computation and frequency of reference
     altitudes should take into account terrain topography turn radius of the aircraft, chart
     deficiencies, accuracy of the navigation system, threat environment, terrain elevation data
     accuracy, aircraft performance and crew experience.
     16.18.2.2. Start Climb Points. Start Climb Points are predetermined points defined on a
     chart at a distance-to-go (DTG) where the aircraft should start a climb to a reference
     altitude based on an obstacle on its flight-path.
         16.18.2.2.1. Start climb points will be computed during mission planning, annotated
         on all charts, and briefed during route study for all significant climbs (when there is a
         terrain differential of 1000 feet or greater over 4 nautical miles or less. This is a
         minimum and rapidly rising terrain must be evaluated for the entire leg). Regardless
         of planned visibility or illumination, tailwind effects must be considered. Continue to
         evaluate planned climb schedule during execution.               One-engine inoperative
         performance must be considered.
         16.18.2.2.2. Start Climb Point Calculations. Calculate start climb points IAW
         AFTTP 3.3-33. Climb rate should normally be based on 1,000 feet per minute.
         Density altitude, aircraft gross weight and tailwinds may require pilots to add distance
         to their start climb points. NOTE: Due to errors in DTED, consider using reported
         DTED accuracy (if available) and applying it to the user-specified buffer altitude
         when computing reference altitudes.
  16.18.3. NVG Enroute and Objective Area Navigation. Accomplish obstacle avoidance at
  night using NVGs, radar, SCNS, IDS/FLIR (some airplanes), and radar altimeter along with
  flying reference altitudes as necessary to ensure terrain clearance. Higher altitudes up to
  MSA may be required. WARNING: Because of the distinct possibility of crewmembers
  experiencing spatial disorientation during NVG low-level flight or low illumination NVG air
  refueling, one pilot should be immediately ready to fly the aircraft should the other pilot
  become disoriented.
     16.18.3.1. The primary source for NVG low-level altitude is visual pilotage. Therefore
     navigators should assume that the aircraft will be at the lowest possible point within the
     corridor for the intended NVG ground track plan and base start climb points there, not
     from the last reference altitude prior to the start climb point. When calculating start climb
     points in this manner, greater terrain differentials will result, which will place start climb
     points further away from critical terrain. This conservative approach will result in less
     aggressive climb profiles, allowing the aircraft to retain a greater amount of energy in
     mountainous terrain.
178                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


       16.18.3.2. Flying below reference altitude directly affects start climb points. Pilots will
       inform the crew any time the aircraft descends below the navigator‘s reference altitude,
       once the reference altitude terrain is called in sight. Navigators must evaluate the impact
       of flying below reference altitudes and realize that start climbs may be required earlier
       than planned due to aircraft altitude. If a higher reference altitude is based on an
       obstruction beyond the flying pilot's line of sight, the navigator will direct a climb at the
       start climb point to the new reference altitude until such time the obstruction becomes
       visible to the flying pilot. At this time, a decision to continue the climb or fly below
       reference altitude can be made. WARNING: If at any time the pilot loses sight of the
       reference altitude controlling terrain, the crew will fly the reference altitudes computed
       by the navigator.
16.19. Low-Level Emergency Procedures. The procedures listed below apply to both training
and contingency operations. EXCEPTION: During combat operations, if a climb to MSA/ESA
will expose the aircraft to greater hazard due to enemy threat detection, the aircraft commander
may climb to a Detection Free Altitude (DFA) or intermediate altitude during a low level
emergency. The decision to use this altitude vice MSA/ESA must be based on a thorough pre-
mission assessment of enemy‘s overall threat detection capability and the nature of the
emergency encountered. NOTE: Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat during
low level flight. EXCEPTION: If performing a planned seat swap for training with an IP in the
seat, climb to a safe altitude.
   16.19.1. Crew Disorientation. If a crew becomes lost or disoriented on a low-level mission,
   immediate steps must be taken to regain the planned flight path.
       16.19.1.1. Start a climb to ESA. Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or a
       positive fix obtained. While higher altitude increases the field of vision and reduces the
       terrain hazard, it may make the airplane more vulnerable. A fix, visual or radar, should be
       found as soon as possible.
       16.19.1.2. After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations. The
       navigators will crosscheck timing and adjust as necessary.
   16.19.2. Pilot Spatial Disorientation or Inoperative NVGs. WARNING: The non-flying
   pilot must be ready to immediately take control of the aircraft if the flying pilot experiences
   spatial disorientation or a malfunction of his/her NVGs.
       16.19.2.1. If either pilot experiences spatial disorientation, start a climb to at least MSA.
       Continue to climb to or maintain at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is
       ready to assume non-flying or flying pilot duties. Low-level operations may be continued
       at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
       16.19.2.2. If either pilot‘s NVGs become inoperative, start a climb to at least MSA.
       Maintain at or above MSA until the NVG malfunction has been resolved. Low level
       operations may be continued at the discretion of the aircraft commander. WARNING:
       NVGs and associated components (battery cords, safety cords, and other hardware) can
       become entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other controls. Any
       interference can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of other critical
       switches or controls. Extreme care must be exercised by pilots during seat changes and
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                     179


       by flight engineers performing duties that involve leaning forward in the seat; i.e.
       exchanging TOLD cards or adjusting fuel panel switches.
   16.19.3. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. Climb to MSA if unable to avoid flight into
   weather conditions that prohibit VMC operations. A further climb to ESA may be required.
   The route may be resumed after VMC is reestablished.
   16.19.4. Aircraft System Failure. When a known or suspected malfunction prevents
   continued safe low level operations, start a climb to at least MSA. Continue to climb to or
   maintain at least MSA until all troubleshooting and/or required flight manual procedures
   have been accomplished. If minimum equipment requirements are met IAW Chapter 4 and
   Table 16.3, low-level operations may be continued at the discretion of the aircraft
   commander. Aircraft not meeting minimum operating equipment requirements of Table
   16.3 will fly at MSA or higher.
   16.19.5. Emergency Climb Procedure. The decision to execute an emergency climb
   should be made as soon as possible and should be considered in cases of, but not limited to,
   certain equipment malfunctions, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather penetration, loss
   of situational awareness, and imminent contact with the terrain. Any crew member may
   initiate an emergency climb by stating ―EMERGENCY CLIMB.‖ See Table 16.4 for
   emergency climb procedure.

Table 16.4. Emergency Climb Procedures.
1. Announce ―emergency climb‖ to the crew.
2. Simultaneously set maximum power on all operating engines and close all bleed air valve
switches.

WARNING: Power settings greater than 19,600 pounds of torque may be required to clear an
obstacle. Torque settings of 19,600 to 21,500 only require a 781A entry and no inspection is
required. Aircraft that experience an over-torque over 23,000 inch-pounds are to immediately
return the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance.

CAUTION: Closing the bleed valves will result in depressurizing the aircraft. Use caution in
areas of high terrain as cabin altitude may exceed 10,000 feet. The onset of hypoxia symptoms
may complicate judgment.

CAUTION: Closing the bleed valves may result in decreased equipment cooling and may
degrade critical component operation.
3. Ensure temperature datum valve switches are in auto. (unless malfunction prevents
compliance).
4. Close ramp and door (if open).
5. For zero flaps (e.g., en route) climb the aircraft at zero flap obstacle clearance speed. For any
flap setting (e.g., airdrop, HAR) set flaps to 50 percent and climb out at 50 percent flap obstacle
clearance speed.
6. Turn away (with consideration for stall margin) from terrain if feasible. If not possible, climb
straight ahead for the maximum climb angle.
180                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


WARNING: If at flaps up obstacle clearance speed and turning is required, additional flaps may
be necessary to avoid an accelerated stall.

WARNING: To prevent a stall, do not slow below obstacle clearance speed. A low altitude stall
has a high probability of resulting in a crash and loss of life.

WARNING: A wings level climb will result in the maximum angle/rate of climb. Any bank
angle during this procedure will result in a lower than possible climb gradient and increases stall
speed.
7. The non-flying pilot will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate.
8. The AMSS should state the MSA. The navigator will monitor terrain (via radar) and call
―CLEAR OF TERRAIN‖ when above all critical terrain. If the straight-ahead flight path vector
will not ensure terrain clearance, the navigator will state optimum heading.
9. When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power, and airspeed for a normal climb out and level off
and return all switches to their normal position.

WARNING: Pilots will ensure sufficient stall margin exists prior to commencing turn.

WARNING: If impact with terrain is imminent, use 100 percent flaps, gear up, at 10 knots
above power off stall speed and crash the aircraft straight ahead.

Section 16C—Terminal Area Operations

16.20. Self-Contained Approaches (SCA). SCA procedures may be used for approaches to
conventional airfields and assault zones, and for either overt or NVG airland operations. SCAs
may be conducted using the tactical Infil/Exfil Checklist procedures or from the normal Descent,
Before Landing Checklist. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements, as
appropriate.
   16.20.1. Weather minimums:
       16.20.1.1. All SCAs will be conducted in VMC unless HQ MAJCOM/A3 approves IMC
       operations. If approved, IMC SCA weather minimums will be no lower than 300 feet
       and 1 SM.
       16.20.1.2. For NIMA-published SCAs, use published minimums but no lower than 300
       feet ceiling and 1 SM visibility.
   16.20.2. Minimum Equipment Requirements. See Table 16.3
   16.20.3. Pre-mission Requirements.
       16.20.3.1. SCA Construction. Construct SCAs IAW the guidance found in AFTTP 3.3-
       33.
           16.20.3.1.1. Chart scale and construction requirements are IAW paragraph 16.8.
           16.20.3.1.2. The navigator will construct an approach plate for the SCA using the AF
           IMT 4118, SCA Planning Form, or an OGV approved planning form.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  181


       16.20.3.2. Plan a minimum 7 NM for a straight-in approach unless prohibited by the
       order of battle. Turning SCAs, dogleg SCAs etc. will be planned and executed IAW
       AFTTP 3.3-33. If an SCA is developed for IMC use, plan a minimum 10 NM straight-in
       approach.
       16.20.3.3. An MSL altitude profile will be planned for all SCAs.
   16.20.4. Missed Approach Point (MAP). For VMC SCAs, the MAP will be at zero distance
   to go on the SCNS at MDA.
   16.20.5. Approach Execution:
       16.20.5.1. General. The navigator will make distance calls at every mile inside 10 miles
       and every half mile inside 3 miles (or as briefed). Each pilot will silently ensure both
       NVG batteries are operational during the En route Checklist.
       16.20.5.2. Inbound to the LZ. Maintain en route profile until descent to MDA. Initiate
       slowdown at the point identified during mission planning. Slow the aircraft to no less
       than 50 percent threshold speed, configure the flaps and gear as airspeed permits, and call
       for the appropriate checklist (SLOWDOWN/BEFORE LANDING portion of the
       INFIL/EXFIL checklist or normal BEFORE LANDING checklist). Call for 100 percent
       flaps as airspeed permits. Ensure 100 percent flaps are set prior to reaching threshold
       speed. NOTE: The IDS is helpful in LZ identification and should be used to scan the LZ
       for obstructions, but it is not intended to be used to fly the entire SCA.
       16.20.5.3. Descent. At glideslope interception, the navigator will state "Begin Descent,"
       and repeat the desired initial descent rate. The navigator will provide glide-path
       advisories with reference to the SCNS, the navigator‘s pressure altimeter, and the radar
       altimeter. These calls will be made at 1/2 nm intervals until reaching the "100 feet" call.
       The navigator will state deviations in excess of 150 feet explicitly. The navigator also
       advises the pilot if the aircraft is correcting to or diverging from glide-path, using the
       term "Rapidly," if appropriate. As a guide, the following criteria may be used for
       glideslope deviation calls:
Slightly above or below..........50 feet
Above or below.....................100 feet
Well above or below .............150 feet
WARNING: Use of a 5 degree glideslope can cause descent rates in excess of 1,000 feet per
minute. Extreme care must be taken to break high descent rates with application of power prior
to touchdown. In no case will a descent below 300 feet AGL be initiated prior to 2 NM to
touchdown. This would cause the glideslope to be too shallow.
NOTE: Do not descend below 300 feet AGL until the LZ environment is identified visually and
confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "ZONE INSIGHT", its
clock position, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.). Both pilots will then
confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for the proper heading.
16.21. NVG Airland Operations.
   16.21.1. General. VMC NVG airland operations will normally be conducted using the
   INFIL/EXFIL checklist. SCA procedures will be used to the maximum extent possible.
   However, other tactical visual approaches may be used if the pilot is appropriately certified,
182                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   mission/training requirements dictate, and the approach is accomplished IAW airland
   operations procedures in AFTTP 3-3.33. NOTE: When using other tactical approaches, the
   pilot will call ―SLOWDOWN NOW‖ initiating the Slowdown/Before Landing Checklist. Do
   not descend below 300 feet AGL until the LZ environment is identified visually and
   confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "ZONE IN SIGHT",
   its clock position, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.). Both pilots will then
   confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for the proper heading.                           The
   navigator/engineer will make standard Infil/Exfil altitude advisory calls on descent. For
   further, guidance see Section II of the flight manual.
   16.21.2. Aircrew Requirements. Pilots and Flight Engineers will be NVG airland qualified;
   Navigator will be SCA qualified.
   16.21.3. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. See paragraph 5.16.3 for normal and
   maximum effort runway/taxiway requirements. See paragraph 9.7. for minimum runway
   required for NVG touch and go operations.
   16.21.4. Minimum Equipment Requirements. See Table 16.3
   16.21.5. A go-around point will be identified during pre-mission planning for all NVG
   airland operations.
   16.21.6. If the aircraft commander determines there is sufficient illumination, landing lights
   may remain off during NVG airland operations.
   16.21.7. Blacked-Out (AMP-4) Runway Operations.
      16.21.7.1. Training operations will be conducted IAW the restrictions and requirements
      of AFI 11-202V3, as supplemented.
   16.21.8. Loss of NVGs.
      16.21.8.1. On final, if either pilot loses use of their NVGs inside 1NM on final, a go-
      around will be executed. Exceptions for contingency operations will be prebriefed. If
      either pilot experiences a malfunction of his/her NVGs during an NVG landing, the non-
      flying pilot must be able to assume control and execute the appropriate action. The
      copilot must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver
      executed.
      16.21.8.2. DELETED.
      16.21.8.3. On the ground, the aircraft commander will determine whether to continue the
      landing rollout or takeoff roll. The copilot must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi
      lights to assist in the maneuver executed.
      16.21.8.4. After takeoff. Continue the climb-out, transfer aircraft control as required, and
      follow the appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs (Start a climb to MSA for
      uncontrolled airfield or follow ATC climb-out if applicable).
16.22. Tactical Approaches. Aircrews will conduct tactical approaches (Overhead, downwind,
random steep, and random shallow) IAW the airland operation procedures found in AFTTP 3.3-
33.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  183


   16.22.1. NVG Tactical Approaches. Tactical recovery certified pilots may conduct NVG
   random steep and random shallow approaches to AMP 1, 2, 3 or 4 marked landing zones.
   16.22.2. Restrictions.
       16.22.2.1. Stall speeds for 45 and 60 degrees of bank (clean) will be checked prior to
       accomplishing random shallow approaches. NOTE: 60-degree bank stall speed is equal
       to 1.4 times wings level stall speed.
       16.22.2.2. When performing tactical approaches, adhere to flight manual maneuvering
       and configuration restrictions.
16.23. Infil/Exfil Operations.
   16.23.1. General. The Infil/Exfil checklist/procedures are typically used to transition from
   the low level to place the aircraft on final approach, properly configured, in a position to
   identify the landing area, complete a landing, conduct a rapid onload or offload (if required),
   and quickly return to low level flying. The Infil/Exfil Checklist is used during tactical
   operations and replaces the normal Descent, Before and After Landing, Before Takeoff, Line
   Up, and After Takeoff Checklists from appropriate flight manual. The checklist can be used
   for day or NVG operations and to make overt and covert/blacked-out landings.
   16.23.2. Aircraft Preparation.
       16.23.2.1. Chemical lights. Attach chemical lights to each emergency exit handle with
       tape in such a way as to allow a small amount of light to shine through. WARNING:
       Chemical lights attached to exit doors and emergency escape hatch handles will remain in
       place until mission completion.
   16.23.3. Loadmaster (LM) Requirements.
       16.23.3.1. Loadmaster Infiltration/Exfiltration Guide. Loadmasters will use the AFTTP
       3-3.33, Attachment 10, Loadmaster Infiltration/Exfiltration Guide to amplify flight
       manual procedures and guidance found in this instruction.
       16.23.3.2. LMs will wear NVGs during blacked-out operations.
       16.23.3.3. LMs will wear NVGs on aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting; however,
       they may be raised when NVG lighting is illuminated.
   16.23.4. Approach to LZ.
       16.23.4.1. Radar Altimeters. Radar altimeters will remain set at en route altitude setting
       until the slowdown. Once the slowdown is initiated, the radar altimeters may be reset
       IAW the flight manual.
       16.23.4.2. Flap Settings. Ensure 100 percent flaps are set prior to reaching threshold
       speed (If 100 percent flap setting used).
   16.23.5. Descent. Do not descend below 300 feet AGL until the LZ environment is
   identified visually and confirmed by both pilots. WARNING: In no case will a descent
   below 300 feet AGL be initiated prior to 2 NM to touchdown. This would cause the
   glideslope to be too shallow.
184                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


       16.23.5.1. Landing lights. Depending on aircraft configuration, flight engineer or copilot
       will extend/turn on the IR or overt landing and taxi lights. At the discretion of the aircraft
       commander, landing lights may be extended when the Landing Light Panel call is made
       during the Slowdown/Before Landing Checklist but left off until the navigator‘s ―200‖
       foot call.
       16.23.5.2. The navigator will call 100, 50, 25 and 10 feet above touchdown.
   16.23.6. Go-Around and Departure Procedures. When executing a go-around or departure,
   the navigator will call out passing 100, 200, and 300 feet AGL. Whether maneuvering for
   another approach or proceeding with the route, plan to fly no lower than enroute LAA unless
   operational requirements dictate other altitudes. During a go-around initiate the Go Around
   Checklist. CAUTION: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation during NVG go-
   arounds and departures.
       16.23.6.1. Immediate Landing Feasible. If an immediate visual approach and landing
       (closed pattern) are feasible, exercise caution in clearing for obstacles. Maneuver the
       aircraft to be 500 feet AGL wings level and configured at approximately a 2 NM final.
       Care must be taken to keep the landing zone insight during this maneuver.
       16.23.6.2. Immediate Landing Not Feasible. If an immediate approach and landing are
       not feasible, maneuver the aircraft to the IP or next waypoint at or above enroute LAA
       unless operational requirements dictate other altitudes. Continue with the alternate plan.
       With an immediate landing not feasible, execute the ―After Takeoff Checklist‖ after the
       completion of the ―Go Around Checklist‖.
   16.23.7. Ground Operations.
       16.23.7.1. See paragraph 5.30.3 for rapid Infil/Exfil ground procedures.            Also see
       AFTTP 3.3.33. for amplifying guidance.
       16.23.7.2. The ―On The Runway Checklist‖ is automatically initiated when the pilot
       clears the ramp and door. During the initial Infil/Exfil brief, the pilot may pre-brief the
       opening of the ramp and door upon reversing of the engines. Opening of the ramp and
       door initiates the ―On The Runway Checklist‖.
   16.23.8. Overt Landings Following NVG Landings. If the sortie will continue with Non-
   NVG VFR traffic patterns, the ―Post Low Level‖ and the ―Touch and Go Landing Checklist‖
   or the ―Infil/Exfil Option Landing Checklist‖ will be accomplished. If only a few patterns are
   planned, the ―Infil/Exfil Option Landing Checklist‖ is quicker and easier to use. If many
   patterns or instrument work is planned, the ―Post Low Level‖ and ―Touch and Go Landing
   Checklist are appropriate.
   16.23.9. Infil/Exfil Option Landing Procedures. Fly the pattern to be wings level on 1
   mile final. Pilots will call the zone in sight as they turn final and navigator/engineer will
   make standard altitude advisory calls on descent. For further, guidance see Section II of the
   flight manual.

Section 16D—Airdrop Procedures

16.24. Airdrop General. This section provides guidance for HC/MC-130 airdrop operations. It
provides parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.33.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   185


   16.24.1. Depending on threat environment, there are generally two airdrop methods used;
   i.e., tactical airdrop and rescue airdrop procedures.
      16.24.1.1. Permissive Environment. The situation will usually allow multiple passes and
      a drop into the wind. In this instance, a jumpmaster directed pararescue/equipment
      deployment or rescue equipment kit deliveries could be used. See Chapter 15 and
      AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130 for specific guidance on specialized rescue airdrops.
      16.24.1.2. Contested Environment. In a tactical situation where the hostile threat is
      unknown or determined to be a factor, low observability is a requirement. A single pass
      over the objective, with minimum time spent in the drop area at altitude and at slower
      airdrop airspeeds, will reduce vulnerability. Navigator-directed tactical airdrops using
      CARP/HARP procedures will be used in these environments. NOTE: Prior to takeoff,
      the pilot will ensure that all crewmembers have reviewed the emergency procedures for
      the proposed airdrop. NOTE: In the event of a malfunction, incident, or off-DZ drop, do
      not de-rig, handle or move items unless required for safety of flight. Any follow-on
      investigation will benefit from seeing the items in the position or state they were in at the
      time of the event. Drop zone malfunctions and off-DZ drops will be reported IAW AFJI
      13-210 as supplemented.
16.25. Airdrop Altitudes and Airspeeds. See AFI 11-231, Computer Air Release Point
Procedures, for specific airdrop altitudes and airspeeds.
16.26. Minimum Drop Zones Size. Refer to AFI 13-217.
16.27. Types of Drop Zones. Refer to AFI 13-217.
16.28. Drop Zone Markings. Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217.
16.29. Airdrop Restrictions.
   16.29.1. Airdrop Weather Minimums. Airdrops will be conducted in day or night VMC.
   EXCEPTION: Certified mission computer airdrop (MCAD) aircrews with AN/APN-241
   radar equipped aircraft are authorized to conduct airdrops in IMC. See AFI 11-2HC-130V1
   for complete qualification/certification requirements. See paragraph 16.37.11 for airdrop
   procedures in IMC. NOTE: MCAD airdrop procedures are currently under development
   and will be incorporated at a later date. Aircrews will use the guidance currently
   implemented in this instruction and interim MAJCOM guidance until full incorporation of
   procedures into this AFI.
   16.29.2. Airdrop wind limitations. Refer to AFI 13-217. NOTE: For wind observations
   whose source is the FMQ-13 Wind Sensor, aircrews will incorporate a plus or minus 4 knots
   accuracy into their decision-making process for flying operations. Aircrews will use the plus
   or minus 4 knot safety factor. The word ―estimate‖ in conjunction with FMQ-13 wind values
   should cue aircrew to use the plus or minus 4 knot safety factor.
   16.29.3. Minimum Aircraft Equipment Required for Airdrop Operations. See Table 16.3
   16.29.4. Drop Zone Surveys. The pilot and navigator will review the DZ survey during
   mission planning.
   16.29.5. Airdrop Communications Procedures. Radio silence procedures will be coordinated
   prior to mission execution.
186                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   16.29.6. Airdrops will be conducted with a minimum of 1 minute separation.
   16.29.7. Minimum En Route Flight Time. Minimum en route flight time from takeoff to
   time over release point, for drops, will be sufficient to safely accomplish all required
   checklists. For airdrops involving personnel, en route time of less than 25 minutes must be
   approved by the jumpmaster.
   16.29.8. Ballistic Requirements. Crews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which
   AFI 11-231 does not list ballistics unless the user provides approved ballistic data or K
   factor. HQ ACC/A3T, Aeronautical Systems Division or US Army Soldier's System Center
   Natick (ASD/ENFC), will approve the ballistics or K factor. This does not apply to formal
   test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load.
   16.29.9. Airdrop Operations.
      16.29.9.1. The SCNS Airdrop/Troop Jump Computer-Manual Select Switch will be set
      to AD/TJ manual for all airdrop operations.
      16.29.9.2. The aircraft will not be configured where the cargo ramp and door and the
      paratroop door(s) are open at the same time. EXCEPTION: Authorized loadmaster-
      directed airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to include trial-line drops, while spotting from
      a single open paratroop door IAW paragraph 15.2.1
      16.29.9.3. If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will
      not be used.
      16.29.9.4. A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door.
      A maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever
      winch.
   16.29.10. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will ensure enough equipment is included to satisfy
   load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of airdrop kits will include cloth-backed
   pressure sensitive tape, masking tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80-
   pound cotton webbing, two G-14 clevises, and adjustable wrench.
   16.29.11. Joint Airdrop Inspection Records. Unless exempted by AFJI 13-210, Joint Airdrop
   Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and Activity Reporting, MAJCOM
   supplements or waivers, a DD Form 1848 will be accomplished prior to all equipment
   airdrops. Completion, retention, and disposition of the form(s) will be in accordance with
   AFJI 13-210, as supplemented. A-7A and A-21 containers rigged as door bundles do not
   require inspections. NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series TOs, Army Field
   Manuals, or Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 350-series manuals require a waiver
   from U.S. Army Quartermaster, Ft Lee, VA. Channel waiver requests through HQ
   ACC/A3TV. EXCEPTION: Waivers are not required for resupply, parabundles, and
   equipment described in this volume.
   16.29.12. Verification of Load Information. The navigator will verify the actual number and
   type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of delivery, and position of loads in the aircraft
   agree with planned CARP data. Recalculate CARPs when required. If an individual load has
   a different type or number of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to
   ensure all loads will land on the DZ. Base drop altitude on the item requiring the highest drop
   altitude.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  187


   16.29.13. Marking Airdrop Loads. The navigator will mark call sign and date on all
   equipment, containers, and standard airdrop training bundles (SATBs). Mark equipment
   loads by order of exit if more than one load is dropped on the same pass. EXCEPTION: If
   more than one CDS bundle is dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container out.
16.30. Airdrop Flight Procedures.
   16.30.1. Airdrop Checklists. Amplified checklists that apply to specific airdrop
   employment procedures are included in Attachment 2. Abbreviated checklists are AFI 11-
   2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2. Checklists may be compressed or completed early if mission
   requirements dictate. Normally, all items of the preceding checklist are to be accomplished
   prior to initiating the next checklist. Avoid the use of the word "GREEN" or "LIGHT" after
   initiation of the slowdown checklist until arriving at the release point.
   16.30.2. Safety Devices. Loadmasters will wear a restraint harness/parachute, helmet, and
   eye protection when performing duties near an open exit in flight. Helmet and eye protection
   will be worn IAW Chapter 6. Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to flight.
      16.30.2.1. Connect and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that will preclude the
      wearer from exiting the aircraft.
      16.30.2.2. Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable
      provided no static lines are attached and an anchor cable stop is positioned and taped at
      FS 737. The center anchor cable support may be used in lieu of the stop if lowered. Do
      not use this configuration(s) if both paratroop doors are open at the same time. Instead,
      connect and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that would preclude the wearer
      from exiting either exit.
      16.30.2.3. As required, disconnect the hook, roll and secure the lifeline to the restraint
      harness after the lifeline has been adjusted.
      16.30.2.4. Connect the lifeline when at, or anticipating movement aft of, FS 677.
      16.30.2.5. If using the personnel restraint system (shuttle system), connect to the side
      opposite the paratroop door used for airdrop. If both paratroop doors are to be opened,
      connect to both sides. For ramp and door airdrops, move the shuttle aft of the A-frame
      after the ramp and door are in the ADS position. Move shuttle forward of the A-frame
      and pin before closing the ramp and door.
      16.30.2.6. The onboard safety personnel will normally provide their own parachute.
      Alternately, at their discretion, they may use a restraint harness. Other personnel required
      to be mobile in the cargo compartment, as determined by the aircraft commander, will be
      provided a restraint harness. EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempted
      from this requirement provided they are not performing primary or backup loadmaster
      duties and will not be moving aft of FS 677. If either of these conditions is not met, a
      restraint harness is required. NOTE: Do not use the flight deck restraint harness for
      airdrops. NOTE: For actual combat missions, wear a restraint harness for drops below
      1000 feet AGL. For drops at or above 1000 feet AGL, parachute wear is recommended.
   16.30.3. Navigating to the Release Point. NOTE: The procedures below are based on using
   tactical airdrop checklist using a navigator directed CARP/HARP delivery method. Release
188                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   point procedures will differ if using VIRS, GMRS, or JMD delivery methods or Search and
   Rescue Deployment Checklist procedures. See paragraph 16.35 for further guidance.
      16.30.3.1. Planning. Beginning with the DZ, memorize PI location, DZ dimensions, 5
      second warning, and prominent DZ features. Plan at least two (preferably three) update
      points for the run-in to ensure proper DZ alignment. The crew will determine if a level,
      ascending or descending slowdown is appropriate for the planned run-in.
      16.30.3.2. The navigator performing the airdrop will prepare an AF Form 4123 or OGV-
      approved equivalent, for each type drop planned
      16.30.3.3. Pilot and Navigator Release Point Procedures. The navigator and pilot will
      position the aircraft upwind to the release point using all available means to include but
      not limited to SCNS and visual techniques and the following pilot/navigator procedures:
         16.30.3.3.1. Airspeed adjustments should be completed prior to the IP or slowdown,
         whichever occurs first.
         16.30.3.3.2. If the IP is visible from a distance and time control permits, overfly the
         IP on run-in heading. Otherwise, fly a radius of turn leg to the DZ. If required, update
         navigation equipment at the IP.
         16.30.3.3.3. After departing the IP, the pilot not flying the aircraft assists the
         navigator in maintaining the desired track inbound by confirming aircraft position
         with the planned run-in update points. The pilot flying the aircraft will fly SCNS
         inbound to the release point or will position the aircraft upwind using visual
         techniques.
         16.30.3.3.4. The navigator will use the SCNS (for MCAD) to position the aircraft
         upwind to the release point. The navigator provides headings that will position the
         aircraft the required distance upwind from centerline track so that large corrections
         will not be required on the final approach to the release point.
         16.30.3.3.5. At slowdown, immediately double the drift used prior to slowdown and
         apply it to the run-in heading. This will keep the aircraft on the upwind side of the PI.
         16.30.3.3.6. The navigator informs the pilot of the expected drift, the heading
         required to parallel the DZ axis, and confirms the drop altitude and airspeed. The
         navigator will update the CARP manually and will update the SCNS (as required) for
         mission computer airdrops (MCAD). A visual airdrop is defined as the pilot holding
         an offset and the navigator calling the drop off the PI using the site angle technique or
         using a timing point.
         16.30.3.3.7. As soon as the DZ is visible and identified by the pilot and navigator,
         they jointly confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The
         pilot then assumes the responsibility for maintaining this offset distance and required
         track. The navigator will pick the timing point, if required, and control the time of
         "green light" and "red light," and continually cross check the offset distance. NOTE:
         Both pilots and navigator will confirm the DZ in sight prior to the "5 SECOND" call.
         16.30.3.3.8. During the final seconds of the approach to the release point, the pilot
         not flying the aircraft places a hand near the jump light switch. Five seconds prior to
         release, the navigator will give a preparatory call of "5 SECONDS." At this call, if the
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                189


        aircraft location is not within precoordinated parameters, a "NO DROP" condition
        exists.
        16.30.3.3.9. At the release point:
            16.30.3.3.9.1. The navigator will state "GREEN LIGHT."
            16.30.3.3.9.2. The pilot not flying the aircraft will turn on the green light and
            verbally calls the light "ON."
        16.30.3.3.10. During the drop:
            16.30.3.3.10.1. The loadmaster will not deploy equipment or personnel until
            hearing and seeing the green light. EXCEPTION: During manual parachute
            flare, streamer, marker smoke, or sea-dye delivery and for rescue airdrops using
            the Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist, the loadmaster may deploy equipment
            on the pilot‘s verbal command.
        16.30.3.3.10.2. The pilot will make any small corrections required to maintain the
        track.
            16.30.3.3.10.3. The navigator will monitor the time to "RED LIGHT‖.
            16.30.3.3.10.4. The loadmaster will advise the pilot when the load is clear, and of
            any delay or malfunction.
  16.30.4. Ramp and Door Operations.
     16.30.4.1. Depending on the tactical situation, the pilot may direct ramp and door
     opening anytime after the Six-Minute Advisory has been completed and 150 KIAS has
     been achieved. After the ramp and door are open, loadmasters are cleared to complete
     their slowdown checks. WARNING: For personnel airdrops, the pilot must be aware of
     paratroopers standing in the back and avoid drastic pitch or bank changes after the Six
     Minute Advisory.
     16.30.4.2. Slowdown Procedures. During airdrop operations, the pilot will perform the
     slowdown maneuver and accomplish the slowdown checklist at a predetermined point
     prior to the release point. A computer position or prebriefed timing procedure may be
     used when an easily identifiable geographical point is not available. Begin slowdown at a
     distance commensurate with proficiency of crew, normally 5 to 7 NM. After the
     navigator calls for the slowdown:
        16.30.4.2.1. DELETED.
        16.30.4.2.2. The pilot retards the throttles toward flight idle (0-1000 inch pounds of
        torque).
        16.30.4.2.3. The pilot not flying or flight engineer (as briefed) lowers the flaps in 10
        percent increments on speed.
        16.30.4.2.4. The non-flying pilot opens the air deflector doors (if required) upon
        slowing below 150 KIAS. For tailgate drops, the flight engineer calls "DOORS" at or
        below 150 KIAS, as part of the checklist. The loadmaster states "CLEAR TO OPEN",
        and the flight engineer opens the cargo door and ramp. For paratroop door drops,
190                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          once air deflector door are called ―OPEN,‖ this automatically clears the loadmaster to
          open the paratroop door.
          16.30.4.2.5. For CDS airdrops, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart in the
          abbreviated checklist only. NOTE: The aircraft must be level at drop altitude and
          airspeed by green light time. EXCEPTION: During personnel airdrops, the aircraft
          must be at or above drop altitude and stable not later than 1 minute out (2 minutes out
          for jumpmaster directed drops) to allow the jumpmaster access to the paratroop door.
          16.30.4.2.6. Complete the Slowdown and One Minute Warning Checklists.
          16.30.4.2.7. Complete the aerial delivery.
   16.30.5. Aircrew No Drop Decisions:
      16.30.5.1. Prior to the "1-MINUTE" call, any crewmember who determines a condition
      exists that could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the aircraft commander. A "NO
      DROP" will be called at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
      16.30.5.2. After the "1-MINUTE" call, any crewmember observing a condition that
      would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "NO DROP" on interphone. The non-flying
      pilot, navigator and loadmaster will immediately acknowledge the "no drop" call. The
      loadmaster will accomplish the applicable no-drop procedures before performing the
      Completion of Drop Checklist. The aircraft commander must ensure the crew is aware of
      what the plan is in the event of a no drop (racetrack, alternate DZ, RTB, etc.) and instruct
      the crew to follow the appropriate procedures.
      16.30.5.3. Checklist may still be in progress after the "ONE MINUTE WARNING." Call
      "NO DROP" if all checklists are not completed by the "5 SECOND" call.
      16.30.5.4. If a "NO DROP" is called after load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not
      planned, restraint will be reapplied.
   16.30.6. Airdrop Malfunction/Emergency Procedures. If a malfunction occurs during an
   airdrop, the loadmaster will immediately notify the pilot and take appropriate action. After all
   appropriate emergency actions are completed; accomplish the ―Completion of Drop
   Checklist‖. Detailed emergency briefings will be conducted between the loadmasters, crew,
   and jumpers. Loadmasters will brief visual and verbal signals and establish coordinated tasks
   for their crew position prior to the first airdrop warning.
   16.30.7. Departure from Drop Zone (Escape). The navigator will call "RED LIGHT" at the
   expiration of the "GREEN LIGHT" time or upon hearing the loadmaster‘s call of "LOAD
   CLEAR," whichever occurs first.
      16.30.7.1. When the red light is turned on, immediately begin the escape maneuver by
      tracking flaps if required, turning to the departure heading, increase airspeed to 140
      KIAS, and attain en route altitude. To facilitate static line retrieval and preclude
      entanglement, do not exceed 140 KIAS until the static lines are retrieved.
      16.30.7.2. Accelerate to 140 KIAS, climb or descend as briefed, and perform the
      Completion of Drop Checklist. NOTE: During combat, static lines that cannot be
      retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed. Close all doors, raise flaps, and
      accelerate to en route airspeed. It is imperative that the aircraft be configured for high
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   191


      speed evasive maneuvers. Therefore, after the static lines have been retrieved or cut, the
      doors and air deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder of the Completion of Drop
      checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time.
   16.30.8. Multiple Passes (Racetrack). Multiple passes will not be made unless directed or
   previously agreed upon by all units involved. If multiple passes are flown, all airdrop
   checklists will be accomplished. Checklists may be compressed during racetracks, but the
   aircraft commander must ensure the loadmaster has adequate time to complete all items
   before the drop is initiated. The One Minute Warning is never compressed and is always
   given on time. EXCEPTION: During pilot directed airdrops, the checklist may be initiated
   at a point commensurate with the available time and type of drop. Doors may remain open at
   the discretion of the aircraft commander.
16.31. Low Altitude Airdrop Positioning (Visual). The following are approved methods of
positioning the aircraft on a final for low level visual airdrops.
   16.31.1. Computed Air Release Point (CARP) Aerial Delivery. The computed air release
   point (CARP) is a mathematical computation based on average parachute ballistics and dead
   reckoning principles. After computing the CARP solution, the navigator plots it on an
   appropriately scaled chart, sketch, diagram, or aerial photograph. Detailed instructions for
   CARP computations and depictions are contained in AFI 11-231. NOTE: Accurate visual
   positioning of the aircraft over the release point is the major difficulty of the CARP system.
   Make corrections to the aircraft track as far out from the CARP as possible to minimize this
   deficiency. To achieve desired drop accuracy, maintain the track during the final approach to
   the CARP and throughout the drop (green light) time.
   16.31.2. Pilot/Loadmaster directed airdrops. Pilot and loadmasters may direct certain
   specialized rescue equipment and freefall equipment deliveries IAW Chapter 15 and AFTTP
   3-3.HC/MC-130.
   16.31.3. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). Airdrops may be made using the visual
   ground marked release system (GMRS). In this system, supported ground forces are
   responsible for computing a release point and providing ground markings (panels or lights).
   The airdrop will be made directly over this marker or abeam a flank marker as determined
   during joint planning. Aircrew procedures are the same as those employed during a standard
   drop except that a pilot may assume the responsibility for calling "5 seconds" and "green
   light." The navigator will compute an in-flight CARP to predict the approximate location of
   the release point and facilitate initial line-up during the run-in to the DZ. See AFI 13-217 for
   markings. NOTE: The user assumes responsibility for airdrop accuracy during GMRS
   drops.
   16.31.4. Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS). VIRS is an airdrop method by which
   ground personnel provide verbal steering guidance to an aircraft and call the release when the
   aircraft arrives over a predetermined point on the ground. VIRS will only be performed by
   qualified and properly trained personnel IAW AFI 13-217.
      16.31.4.1. When this option is selected:
          16.31.4.1.1. The ground party will compute the release point.
192                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          16.31.4.1.2. The ground party will position on the intended release point, provide the
          aircrew with verbal steering guidance and call the release when the aircraft reaches
          the release point.
          16.31.4.1.3. The ground party should use the following terminology:
              16.31.4.1.3.1. "Turn left or right"--directs approximately a half standard rate turn
              unless specified otherwise.
              16.31.4.1.3.2. "Stop turn"--self-explanatory.
              16.31.4.1.3.3. "Standby"--indicates approximately five seconds prior to the
              release point.
              16.31.4.1.3.4. "Execute, execute, execute"--directs release of the load.
          16.31.4.1.4. Upon hearing the term "standby", the navigator will state "5 seconds" on
          the interphone. On the first "execute," the navigator will state "green light."
          16.31.4.1.5. The authentication procedures to be employed will be briefed prior to
          the mission. The procedure should be as simple and short as possible so as not to
          interfere with the approach to the DZ. Based on the limitations of radio equipment
          and terrain, a point will be identified as far out on the approach as possible where
          contact should be first attempted for authentication.
          16.31.4.1.6. The ground party must maintain positive visual contact with the aircraft
          at all times during the inbound approach. If, in a training situation, doubt exists that
          the airdrop can be safely executed, or if the DZ cannot be positively identified by the
          aircrew, a no drop will be called by either the ground party or the aircrew.
   16.31.5. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Airdrops. JMD airdrops require OG/CC or higher
   approval. EXCEPTION: Unilateral PJ airdrops for continuation training. These drops may
   be performed by qualified AF or sister service jumpmasters (or trainees under the supervision
   of qualified personnel), may direct the aircraft to a release point and determine the exit point
   in accordance with the following restrictions and procedures:
      16.31.5.1. JMD airdrops will be conducted using the SEARCH AND RESCUE
      Checklists. See Attachment 2.
      16.31.5.2. Airdrop personnel in VMC only. NOTE: For PJ JMD airdrops of
      ATV/RAMZ packages, crews will use Rescue Airdrop Checklists and either a Fixed,
      Moving, or Crosswind Target Pattern for deployment.
      16.31.5.3. The jumpmaster‘s parent service/user accepts all responsibility for the
      accuracy of the drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment.
      16.31.5.4. In-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures between the
      jumpmaster, loadmaster, and pilot will be coordinated prior to takeoff.
      16.31.5.5. HALO and HAHO operations may be conducted using JMD procedures.
      16.31.5.6. Personnel will not exit the aircraft unless the green light is illuminated.
      16.31.5.7. The navigators will still calculate a CARP or HARP for each drop to back up
      the computations and in-flight directions given by the jumpmaster. Prior to flight, the
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                               193


     aircrew and the jumpmaster will compare predicted release points, resolve any significant
     differences, and agree to a planned slowdown point or time. Navigators will update the
     jumpmaster in-flight on actual wind information and any changes to the crew‘s preflight
     CARP/HARP location.
     16.31.5.8. Standard Voice Terminology. When the jumpmaster provides assistance on
     final approach, use the following standard voice terminology:
        16.31.5.8.1. "Steady" (present course is satisfactory).
        16.31.5.8.2. "Right" (change direction to the right 5 degrees).
        16.31.5.8.3. "Left" (change direction to the left 5 degrees).
        16.31.5.8.4. "Right or left __ degrees" (change direction as indicated). This direction
        will be utilized when directional changes in excess of 5 degrees are desired.
        16.31.5.8.5. "No-drop" (no-drop will be called for unsafe or unknown conditions or
        unsatisfactory positioning over the target).
        16.31.5.8.6. "Load Clear" (jumpers or cargo bundles have cleared the aircraft and the
        pilot is clear to make a turn to begin the next pass and/or observe results of the drop
        just accomplished).
        16.31.5.8.7. Hand Signals. The jumpmaster may use the following hand signals to
        relay course corrections through the safety man: Thumb left/right, indicating 5-degree
        correction; and palm open, fingers pointed toward the cockpit, indicating steady.
     16.31.5.9. Deployment Procedures.
        16.31.5.9.1. No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will
        allow the jumpmaster access to the door to begin the "spotting procedures."
        Jumpmaster duties can be performed from any position in either paratroop door or the
        ramp and door; however, it is recommended that the jumpmaster use the right door
        for right-hand patterns and the left door for left-hand patterns. The jumpmaster, when
        wearing a parachute, will connect the static line to the anchor cable designated for
        use. When wearing an adjusted restraint harness, the jumpmaster will connect to the
        personnel restraint system or to a tie-down ring that would preclude the wearer from
        exiting the aircraft. The jumpmaster visually relays steering signals to the
        loadmaster, who verbally relays this information to the pilot. WARNING: The
        paratroop(s) door and the cargo ramp and door will not be opened at the same time.
        EXCEPTION: Authorized loadmaster-directed airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to
        include trial-line drops, while spotting from a single open paratroop door IAW
        paragraph 15.2.1
        16.31.5.9.2. The pilot will make a "CREW, 1-MINUTE WARNING" call, at which
        time the loadmaster/jumpmaster will announce "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE."
        The loadmaster is responsible for accomplishing all other appropriate checklists,
        overall safety in the cargo compartment, monitoring static lines, etc.
        16.31.5.9.3. Once safety checks are complete, and the pilot determines that all
        conditions are favorable for deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point,
        the pilot states "CLEAR TO JUMP" and the pilot not flying will turn on the green
194                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          light. Jumpers will exit the aircraft upon reaching the jumpmasters identified release
          point. NOTE: The aircrew may turn on the green light once the drop zone has been
          positively identified, but no earlier than 1 minute prior to the navigators release point
          for freefall operations, or 30 seconds for static line operations. If at any time exit of
          jumpers becomes unsafe (aircraft emergency or similar circumstances), the aircrew
          will turn on the red light and the loadmaster will direct the jumpmaster to stop
          remaining parachutists.
      16.31.5.10. After all jumpers have exited; the loadmaster will call ―LOAD CLEAR‖. At
      this point the pilot not flying will turn on the red light.
      16.31.5.11. Aircrew No Drop Decision. If the crew believes the drop will occur outside
      of safe parameters, the words "NO DROP" announced over the interphone by any person
      after the pilot‘s " CREW, 1-MINUTE WARNING " call will terminate deployment
      procedures until the situation is resolved. Upon hearing a "No DROP" call, the pilot not
      flying will turn the red light on, and the pilot not flying, navigator and loadmaster will
      acknowledge the ―NO DROP."
      16.31.5.12. Mixed Procedures. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of
      airdrop method (e.g., GMRS, VIRS) or standard CARP/HARP drops. When JMD drop
      procedures are used, the crew will follow the jumpmaster‘s instructions, while adhering
      to normal safety concerns.
16.32. Water DZs. Water drops can be conducted on marked or unmarked DZs. Refer to AFI
13-217 for further guidance.
16.33. Pararescue JMD Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target Patterns. For PJ JMD
airdrops of ATV/RAMZ/ARC/CRL packages, Pararescue Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target
Patterns will be used running the SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklists. These procedures may
be used for JMD pararescue personnel only drops. Comply with the applicable guidance in
paragraphs 16.31.5., 16.32., 16.34
   16.33.1. Pre-Deployment Evaluation. In a permissive environment, evaluation of the landing
   surface and surrounding obstructions should be accomplished by observation passes.
   Evaluation of the weather should include existing and forecast temperatures, wind direction,
   precipitation, cloud cover, fog, visibility, etc. Wind velocity evaluation will include
   consideration of direction, gusts, and wind shear. The crew should keep the jumpmaster
   advised of current mean altitude winds. The presence of rocks or stumps may impose a lower
   maximum velocity while the presence of trees, unfrozen tundra, or soft snow might permit
   safe jumping at higher velocities.
   16.33.2. General. Pararescuemen (PJ) wearing static line parachutes will normally deploy
   through a single paratroop door or off the cargo ramp (tailgate). The parachute static lines
   will be connected to the anchor cable on the same side the static line retriever is installed. No
   more than 20 parachutists may exit on a single pass using the long cable either from the
   paratroop door or off the ramp. Streamer/spotter chutes will be used prior to JMD PJ
   deployments using Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target
   deployment patterns.
      16.33.2.1. Streamers are 20-foot lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end. The spotter
      chute used is the standard J-1 (12 foot diameter) wind drift determination parachute. The
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   195


     spotter chute weight can be provided by the PJ or a MK-6 Mod 3 smoke. When the MK-6
     Mod 3 is used, the jumpmaster will signal the safetyman/loadmaster when to launch the
     smoke. Immediately upon receiving the signal, the safetyman/loadmaster will
     simultaneously activate and launch the smoke.
     16.33.2.2. The safetyman/loadmaster will assist the jumpmaster in launching the
     streamer/spotter chute and will remain at the door during PJ deployments. The
     jumpmaster, pilot, and navigator will confirm the exit point prior to release. NOTE: For
     low altitude JMD PJ drops, a navigator‘s CARP is not required when using
     streamers/spotter chutes. WARNING: During paratroop door static line personnel drops,
     personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-
     frame, FS 737).
  16.33.3. Deployment Pattern. The normal flight pattern will be a racetrack pattern, with the
  final approach from spotting device to target. NOTE: See AFI 11-231 for detailed guidance
  on Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target deployment patterns.
     16.33.3.1. The pattern will be large enough to allow for heading corrections on final
     approach. The crosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after the spotting device or
     jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target area remain in sight at all times.
     16.33.3.2. The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern.
     16.33.3.3. Aircraft Configuration.
         16.33.3.3.1. Deployment airspeed is 125 KIAS.
         16.33.3.3.2. Set flaps to 50% below 140,000 lbs and 70% at or above 140,000 lbs. If
         use of CDS flap setting is desired, perform a navigator directed release using the
         container delivery system checklist. NOTE: Pararescuemen will not be deployed
         from aircraft with gross weights greater than 155,000 lbs. NOTE: Static line
         deployments at airspeeds above 130 KIAS are prohibited due to parachute limitations.
     16.33.3.4. The jumpmaster must be kept advised of the position of the aircraft in the
     pattern and the aircraft commander must be kept informed of the activities in the rear of
     the aircraft.
  16.33.4. Deployment Procedures. In addition to the deployment procedures listed in
  paragraph 16.31.5.9, the following procedures apply:
     16.33.4.1. Leave the red light on for dry passes and streamer/spotter chute patterns.
     16.33.4.2. On final for live drops, the pilot will make a "CREW, 1-MINUTE
     WARNING" call, CAUTION: For the confined lake or near shore water drops of PJ
     personnel or RAMZ training, do not call " CREW, 1-MINUTE WARNING " until over
     water. Call ―NO DROP ―if the exit point for the RAMZ will be over land. NOTE: The
     deployment pattern may be flown on autopilot
  16.33.5. Post-Deployment. Maintain visual or radio contact with the pararescue team and
  maintain surveillance of the area for possible natural or man-made hazards. After pararescue
  deployment, the aircraft commander will notify the appropriate agencies to ensure required
  team support is provided. Every effort will be expended to ensure that the pararescue team is
  covered by rescue aircraft until the party is assured of surface assistance. Surface assistance
196                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   for land operation is not required as long as sufficient supplies are available. Prior to
   departure of the aircraft from the incident site, resupply schedules, communication schedules,
   supply requirements, and planned actions of the pararescue team will be established by the
   aircraft commander and team leader.
       16.33.6.1. Primary and alternate frequencies, schedules, and an alternate method of
       communication will be established by the mission commander and will be included in the
       mission commander‘s pre-mission brief.
       16.33.6.2. If practicable, the pararescuemen will immediately establish radio contact
       with the drop aircraft upon penetration of the incident site. The team leader will verify the
       predetermined schedule for the next radio contact before the drop aircraft departs the
       area.
       16.33.6.3. In the event the PJ team fails to establish communication at the initial pre-
       briefed time, maximum effort will be made on the next check or the alternate schedule
       until radio contact is established.
       16.33.6.4. If communication cannot be established through the procedures outlined
       above, any other method of communication may be used to relay information to the
       rescue team.
       16.33.6.5. Radio will be used as the primary method of communication. The MK 13
       day/night flares will be the alternate method. When signals for special purposes are
       needed, they may be locally devised.
16.34. Pararescue Deployments to Ships. Many factors affect the decision to deploy PJs to
ships at sea, precluding the establishment of a single procedure that will apply to all situations. In
all cases, thorough preplanning and coordination with the recovery vessel is vital to a safe and
successful operation. The following will provide guidelines and considerations:
   16.34.1. In sea conditions other than calm, it is essential the ship have a motorized launch in
   the water prior to team deployment, unless the PJ team deploys with a Rigging Alternate
   Method Zodiac watercraft. WARNING: The aircrew will prepare an MA-1 sea rescue kit
   for deployment from the cargo ramp as soon as practical following an open water PJ
   deployment (not required for training).
       16.34.1.1. Positioning and maneuvering of the ship, motorized launch, and deployment
       of the MA-1 kit is the ship captain‘s decision. When possible, the aircraft commander
       should advise the ship captain on positioning and maneuvering prior to deployment. The
       crew should determine whether the ship can remain still in the water, whether the ship
       will be steered into the wind or crosswind, and where the launch will be positioned.
   16.34.1.2. The rescue aircraft should deploy the pararescue team to the motorized launch.
   The launch should maintain its position during the deployment pattern. WARNING: The
   crew will make every effort to advise the ship to shut down its propellers anytime a
   pararescuemen is in the water alongside side it.
       16.34.1.3. In the case that a decision is made to deploy the team without the use of a
       motorized launch, it is critical that the method of boarding is verified prior to
       deployment.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                     197


16.35. High Altitude Airdrops. Airdrops conducted above 3,000 feet AGL are considered high
altitude drops. EXCEPTION: RAMZ airdrops at or below 3,500 feet AGL are considered low
altitude drops. PSYOPS drops are governed by paragraph 16.36. and Chapter 17. NOTE: Only
essential personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI
11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, are permitted on mission aircraft for drops
above 10,000 feet MSL.
   16.35.1. High Altitude Airdrop Oxygen Requirements.
       16.35.1.1. A continuous supply of 100 percent oxygen will be used by all personnel
       during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL. Crewmembers will follow
       established MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements. EXCEPTION: Parachutists may
       operate without the supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flight up to 13,000 feet
       MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes per
       sortie. Under circumstances other than these, jumpers will use supplemental oxygen.
       16.35.1.2. When dropping from 18,000 feet MSL or higher, use pre-breathing
       procedures. When the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen
       regulators for all personnel, approved portable oxygen console(s) will be pre-flighted and
       installed in the aircraft. The console(s) will provide enough oxygen regulators for all
       parachutists and crewmembers not accommodated by the normal aircraft system. NOTE:
       If an oxygen console is used, one loadmaster will be stationed aft to perform duties. The
       other loadmaster and Physiology Technician (PT) will be on interphone and normally
       forward of the oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight duties. This arrangement will
       provide a buddy system to check everyone on oxygen.
       16.35.1.3. All airdrops above 25,000 feet MSL require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3 for
       unpressurized flight, from HQ AFFSA/A3O. MA-1 portable oxygen units (with
       serviceable web carrying straps) equipped with A-21 regulators will be provided for each
       person aboard the aircraft except parachutists. WARNING: No personnel will be
       exposed to unpressurized flight at or above 30,000 feet MSL more than three times each
       7 days; in addition, they must have a minimum of 24 hours between exposures.
       16.35.1.4. Pre-breathing requirements. All personnel will pre-breathe 100 percent
       oxygen below 10,000 feet pressure altitude or cabin altitude on any mission scheduled for
       a drop at or above 18,000 feet MSL for times shown in Table 16.5. Pre-breathing will be
       completed before cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL. All personnel will
       remain on 100 percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet. A break in pre-
       breathing requires the pre-breathing period to be restarted, or the airdrop will be restricted
       to below 10,000 feet MSL. When pre-breathing on the ground is required, a launch crew
       may assist the primary crew as needed to assure pre-breathing requirements are met. Pre-
       breathing will be conducted with a personally fitted oxygen mask attached to a helmet or
       approved adjustable head harness. Portable oxygen bottles may not be used for pre-
       breathing. NOTE: Quick don masks are emergency equipment and are not approved for
       pre-breathing or high-altitude operations (at or above 18,000 feet MSL).

*NOTE: Maximum Exposure Time Per Sortie is considered to be any time cabin altitude
exceeds 10,000 feet MSL. Personnel will conduct no more than two oxygen jumps per 24-hour
period that do not require pre-breathing (between 13,000 feet and 18,000 feet MSL) one of
which, in the same 24 hour period, that requires pre-breathing (18,000 feet MSL or above).
(Example: Scenario 1: 2x 17,500 feet MSL or Scenario 2: 1 x 24,999 feet MSL and 1 x 17,500
feet MSL).

       16.35.1.5. The jumpmaster may dictate the use of supplemental oxygen by any or all
       jumpers at altitudes less than those listed. Parachutists transfer from the aircraft oxygen
       system or portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately 1
       minute before green light.
   16.35.2. High Altitude Airdrop USAF Physiology Technician (PT). PTs will support
   high altitude airdrop missions when requested by the mission order, the aircrew, or the user.
       16.35.2.1. At least 1 USAF PT is required per 16 jumpers, up to a maximum of 3 PTs,
       for all airdrops conducted at or above 18,000 feet MSL. Additional PTs will be required
       when PTs need training or a waiver is granted to exceed exposure limitations. NOTE:
       The ACC Command Physiologist for Aerospace Physiology, 1 AMDS/SGPT, 45 Pine
       Street, Langley AFB VA, 23665-2080 may authorize variations to the PT-to-personnel
       ratio.
       16.35.2.2. PT Duties.
           16.35.2.2.1. PTs will fly as crewmembers as stated on aeronautical orders. When
           missions require a PT, the PT will be on interphone at all times. PT flight duty
           stations will be as required to monitor crewmembers, jumpers, and oxygen
           equipment. PTs will:
           16.35.2.2.2. Preflight aircraft supplemental oxygen equipment.
           16.35.2.2.3. Advise and aid loadmasters in positioning and securing oxygen
           equipment.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                              199


         16.35.2.2.4. Brief crew and jumpers prior to the first mission on physiological
         problems that may be encountered, the importance of proper pre-breathing, and any
         special requirements.
         16.35.2.2.5. Advise the PIC, crew, jumpers, and other personnel on use of oxygen
         equipment and on the depressurization schedule.
         16.35.2.2.6. Monitor personnel, aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment, and
         life support equipment.
         16.35.2.2.7. The aircrew or the mission PT will notify HQ USAF/SGPA (DSN 858-
         4654), MAJCOM/SGPA, and appropriate Command Coordinator for Aerospace
         Physiology, of any physiological incident by the most expedient manner.
  16.35.3. High Altitude Mission Requirements.
     16.35.3.1. A pre-mission HARP solution will be calculated based on preflight weather
     and winds.
     16.35.3.2. Briefings. Aircrew will ensure all aspects of HALO/HAHO airdrops are
     discussed in detail at the Pilot-Jumpmaster and Navigator-Jumpmaster briefings. Use the
     pilot-jumpmaster and navigator-jumpmaster briefing guides found in AFI 11-2HC-130V3
     CL-1.
     16.35.3.3. For all HALO/HAHO operations, navigators will provide the jumpmaster with
     a magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance (NM, KM, or meters) from the release
     point to the drop zone.
     16.35.3.4. Navigators will compare their HARP location and calculations with the
     jumpmaster‘s chart and calculations.
     16.35.3.5. In-flight changes to the HARP location or significant wind changes will be
     relayed to the jumpmaster as soon as possible.
     16.35.3.6. The SCNS wind may be used to update preflight HARP winds and to
     determine and update the winds at altitude, provided the SCNS TAS is accurate (within 5
     knots of TAS as determined by TAS check).
     16.35.3.7. The SCNS will be used to assist in properly aligning the aircraft on the
     inbound course.
     16.35.3.8. All available radio aids may be used to assist in locating the HARP but will
     not be relied on as the sole means for release. NOTE: For HALO, positive identification
     of the drop zone area must be confirmed electronically or visually prior to calling the
     release.
     16.35.3.9. Low level flight to the target area with a climb is most desirable for HALO or
     HAHO operations. This will enable the navigators to obtain current winds for updating
     the HARP. High level flights are also possible but the HARP will have to be based on
     preflight winds. The release may be accomplished visually.
     16.35.3.10. High Altitude Emergency Procedures.           If any person experiences
     decompression sickness or unusual pain, the pilot will:
200                                                       AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          16.35.3.10.1. Abort the mission and begin a descent (pressurization and rate of
          descent will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain).
          16.35.3.10.2. Proceed to the nearest base at which qualified medical assistance is
          available. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request a flight surgeon
          and an ambulance to meet the aircraft.
          16.35.3.10.3. MAJCOM/SG and HQ USAF/SGPA will be notified by the most
          expeditious manner of any physiological incident. NOTE: On all training and
          exercise missions, unless prevented by airspace restrictions, update the preflight
          winds at each altitude used to compute the HARP. Obtain these winds as near the DZ
          as possible. NOTE: The aircraft should be at drop altitude, inbound to the HARP
          not later than 6 minutes prior to the HARP. This amount of time is necessary for the
          navigator to update the HARP and to position the aircraft on the correct inbound
          course.
   16.35.4. High Altitude Personnel Drop Procedures. The navigator will compute a high
   altitude release point (HARP) solution for all HALO or HAHO drops unless specific mission
   directives dictate otherwise. Use the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP Checklist.
   NOTE: HALO or HAHO drops may be JMD. Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklist.
      16.35.4.1. Pressurization Scheduling. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet
      until the Twenty Minute Warning and until prebreathing is complete (time for check may
      have to be adjusted). Have cabin altitude equal to the ambient pressure prior to
      completion of the Ten Minute Warning. Repressurization after the drop will be in
      accordance with mission requirements; normally, the cabin altitude should return to
      10,000 feet or below as soon as possible. If any jumpers are still onboard, ensure the
      parachutes automated actuation devices are disabled prior to descending or
      repressurizing.
      16.35.4.2. Drop Configuration.
          16.35.4.2.1. Flaps. Normal configuration is with 50 percent flaps. However, at high
          altitudes, it may be desirable to use less flaps.
          16.35.4.2.2. Airspeed. The jumpmaster will be briefed on the airspeed used.
          16.35.4.2.3. Altitude. Pressure or indicated altitude will be used as the airdrop
          altitude reference.
          16.35.4.2.4. Exits.
             16.35.4.2.4.1. Parachutists will normally exit from the cargo door and ramp. All
             parachutists, with the exception of the jumpmaster, will stand forward of the ramp
             hinge until the One-Minute Warning.
             16.35.4.2.4.2. A paratroop door may be used in lieu of the cargo door and ramp.
             When this is the case, air deflector doors will be opened. All parachutists, except
             jumpmaster, will stand forward of the paratroop door until the One Minute
             Warning. NOTE: Jump platforms must be installed. NOTE: All parachutists,
             including jumpmaster, will exit the aircraft during the green light time.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  201


      16.35.4.3. Communications and Signals. The loadmaster will coordinate the following
      hand signals with the jumpmaster:
          16.35.4.3.1. Time warnings (20-, 10-, 6-, 2-, and 1-minute) may be given to the
          parachutists by the loadmaster pointing at a watch and then indicating with fingers the
          correct warning.
          16.35.4.3.2. The velocity of winds on the DZ will be given by the loadmaster by
          cupping one hand and blowing into it, then indicating with upturned fingers the speed
          of the wind.
          16.35.4.3.3. A no drop will be indicated by passing a hand across the throat.
          16.35.4.3.4. Loadmasters will have pencil and paper available during airdrops for use
          in communicating with parachutists.
16.36. Other Operations:
   16.36.1. PSYOPS Drops (Leaflets). Airdrop and dispersal of large quantities of printed
   materials is possible using prepackaged leaflets. Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to
   the aircraft service ceiling. Use high altitude oxygen requirements as specified in Table 16.4
   Drops require the movement of boxes of various weights from throughout the cargo
   compartment via intermediate rollers (if required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp.
      16.36.1.1. Equipment. In addition to normal aircraft equipment, the following items may
      be required to perform leaflet drops:
          16.36.1.1.1. Parachutes or restraining harnesses must be available for use by all
          personnel working in the cargo compartment. Normally, six are required.
          16.36.1.1.2. A portable oxygen console with a minimum of four regulators and
          output hoses of sufficient length to reach through the entire cargo compartment must
          be available for high altitude airdrops (above 10,000 feet).
          16.36.1.1.3. An interval timer is desirable (alternating red and green jump lights may
          serve for sequencing the drops). WARNING: Aircrew members will not be exposed
          to 30,000 feet MSL more than three times per 7 days and must have a minimum of 24
          hours between exposures. NOTE: Long duration high altitude drops will require the
          aircraft remain open. Consider outside air temperature and clothing requirements
          prior to step.
      16.36.1.2. Aircrew Procedures. Use the Leaflet Airdrop Checklist. Under normal
      circumstances the crew required for leaflet operations consists of a tactical crew plus two
      PTs (for high altitude airdrops) and three additional crew members to act as feeders. The
      senior loadmaster will assign specific positions for activity in the cargo compartment.
          16.36.1.2.1. Drop Configuration/Maneuvering. Configuration is based on desired
          coverage and airframe airspeed limitations. All personnel should be constantly aware
          of the possibility of an emergency break upon encountering a threat.
              16.36.1.2.1.1. Flaps. Flaps are normally set at 50 percent and flap settings should
              not be changed during the drop unless the loadmaster is notified.
              16.36.1.2.1.2. Airspeed. Base KIAS on desired groundspeed. This may range
202                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


              from 130 KIAS to 150 KIAS. Other speed ranges may apply if not dropping of
              the ramp (i.e., cargo door only).
              16.36.1.2.1.3. Static Lines. To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile
              threat is detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be
              stowed after each box goes out. Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe
              operation. Static lines may be cut in an emergency.
16.37. Airdrop Load Information.
   16.37.1. General. This section contains specific information about the actual load to be
   dropped. Both normal and emergency procedures are covered. Loads can exit the aircraft
   from the paratroop doors, cargo ramp and door (tailgate), or flare launcher tubes.
      16.37.1.1. If the aircraft is configured with a static line retriever, static line tailgate drops
      of personnel are authorized. Comply with current training and evaluation directives prior
      to conducting these drops.
      16.37.1.2. If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop, the loadmaster will immediately
      notify the pilot and take appropriate action. After all appropriate emergency actions are
      complete; accomplish the completion of Drop Checklist.
   16.37.2. Combination Drops. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit
   from the aircraft ramp after the deployment of an airdrop load (CDS, Combat Rubber
   Raiding Craft (CRRC), Container Ramp Load, etc.)
      16.37.2.1. The drop altitude will be determined by the item requiring the highest drop
      altitude.
      16.37.2.2. Procedures. In addition to the equipment CARP, the navigator will compute a
      personnel CARP down track from the equipment release point using the computed exit
      time for the equipment drop as the interval between the equipment and personnel CARP.
      Use the same air speed and altitude as for the equipment for this computation. If the
      computed release point will result in any jumper landing within 150 yards of any
      boundary of the DZ, inform the jumpmaster. Release the equipment at the equipment
      CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear.
   16.37.3. Personnel Drops. Comply with current training and evaluation directives prior to
   conducting these drops. The guidance below is specific to low altitude personnel airdrops.
   See paragraph 16.35.4 for high altitude personnel airdrops requirements and procedures.
   NOTE: If the aircraft is configured with a static line retriever, static line personnel drops are
   authorized.
      16.37.3.1. Briefings. Aircrew will ensure all aspects of personnel airdrops are discussed
      in detail at the Pilot-Jumpmaster and Navigator-Jumpmaster briefings. Use the pilot-
      jumpmaster and navigator-jumpmaster briefing guides found in AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-
      1.
      16.37.3.2. Aircrew Procedures.         Use the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP
      Checklist.
      16.37.3.3. Drop Configuration. The aircrew loadmaster will ensure the configuration of
      the aircraft anchor cables and seats are consistent with the number of personnel to be
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  203


     airdropped. During aircraft preflight, the loadmaster will ensure that all seats have a
     serviceable retaining strap attached. Fit seats without a serviceable retaining strap with a
     suitable length of type III nylon, pre-measured for sufficient length to secure the seat in a
     raised position to the seat back support frame. For single pass drops, ensure that
     parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the seat protrudes into the
     aisle. On multiple passes, the number of parachutists to be dropped on that pass
     determines the number of seats raised. Airborne, personnel will raise and secure or lower
     seats as required under the supervision and instruction of the aircrew loadmaster.
        16.37.3.3.1. Flaps. Configuration is with 50 percent flaps.
        16.37.3.3.2. Airspeed. The jumpmaster will be briefed on the airspeed used.
        16.37.3.3.3. Altitude. Pressure will be used as the airdrop altitude reference.
        16.37.3.3.4. Exits. Low altitude personnel drops are normally accomplished from the
        paratroop doors. NOTE: Tailgate drops are those drops during which parachutists
        exit from the aircraft ramp. Low Tailgate drops are approved for STT, PJ, Air Force
        Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Specialists, Army Special Forces, Navy
        SEALS, paratroopers equipped for arctic airdrop, other US and allied special
        operations personnel, US Army Quartermaster Center and School, Yuma Proving
        Ground Airborne Test Force, and units for which a combination drop is their normal
        method of deployment.
     16.37.3.4. Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control.
        16.37.3.4.1. At completion of the Slowdown Checklist, the loadmaster will allow the
        jumpmaster access to the paratroop door or ramp no later than (NLT) 1 minute prior
        to jump.
        16.37.3.4.2. For jumpmaster-directed airdrops using the Search and Rescue Airdrop
        Checklist, after Pre-Deployment checks are complete, the loadmaster will allow the
        jumpmaster access to paratroop door or ramp NLT 2 minutes prior to the jump.
        16.37.3.4.3. The loadmaster will then take position in such a manner as to provide
        maximum maneuverability for the jumpmaster and safety NCOs to perform their
        duties, and to prevent interference with exiting jumpers. Upon seeing the red jump
        lights illuminate, the loadmaster will notify the jumpmaster or safety personnel of the
        red light condition. The loadmaster will take no further action to stop any of the
        remaining parachutists. The loadmaster will count (if possible) any parachutists that
        exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.
        16.37.3.4.4. Control of the paratroop door/cargo ramp will revert back to the
        loadmaster after all parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been
        stopped by the jumpmaster or safety NCO and cleared from the paratroop door/cargo
        ramp area.
        16.37.3.4.5. For multiple passes (i.e., racetracks), after assuming control of the
        paratroop door/cargo ramp from the jumpmaster, the loadmaster(s) will maintain
        control of the doors/cargo ramp until completion of subsequent Slowdown Checklists.
        WARNING: Do not attempt to physically stop or hinder jumpers from exiting the
        aircraft if jumpers continue to exit after "red light". WARNING: During airdrops,
204                                                           AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


         personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports
         (A-frame, FS 737). Ensure all personnel aft of FS 677 are secured to the aircraft or
         have a static line connected prior to opening the ramp and door/troop door.
         HALO/HAHO personnel must be configured and ready to jump.
      16.37.3.5. Aircraft Emergency during Personnel Drops. When an aircraft emergency
      occurs during or after the time the parachutists stand-up and hookup, the following
      procedures will apply:
         16.37.3.5.1. Under Acceptable Conditions:
             16.37.3.5.1.1. Maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the parachutists to
             evacuate the aircraft. The minimum acceptable altitude is 400 feet AGL for static
             line deployments and 1,000 feet AGL for personnel freefall deployments. If the
             jump must be made at airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS, advise parachutists of the
             airspeed and altitude.
             16.37.3.5.1.2. Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the prebriefed signals for
             preparation and bailout.
         16.37.3.5.2. Under Unacceptable Conditions. When conditions are not acceptable for
         aircraft evacuation or drop is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures will
         apply:
             16.37.3.5.2.1. The red light will be turned "ON" and will remain on until exit
             doors are closed.
             16.37.3.5.2.2. The pilot will advise the loadmaster, who in turn will advise the
             jumpmaster, to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten their
             safety belts.
      16.37.3.6. Fouled Parachutist Procedures. The jumpmaster or safety is responsible to
      observe the fouled parachutist and recommend whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist
      free. If all parachutists have exited and there is no jumpmaster on board, this
      responsibility rests with the loadmaster. The recommendation is relayed, by the
      loadmaster, to the pilot who makes the final decision whether to retrieve or cut the
      parachutist free. The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist‘s static line
      on the pilot‘s command. When a parachutist is observed to be fouled during a paratroop
      door exit, the first priority is to retrieve, regardless if the parachutist is conscious or
      unconscious. If the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, the
      parachutist will be cut free. For a tailgate exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist
      free if the parachutist indicates consciousness. If the parachutist is unconscious, does not
      signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line,
      implement emergency retrieval procedures.
         16.37.3.6.1. The jumpmaster stops remaining parachutists and the loadmaster notifies
         the pilot of a fouled parachutist.
         16.37.3.6.2. Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist, the pilot should lower the
         landing gear and configure the aircraft flap setting to 100 percent flaps (paratroop
         door exits only). WARNING: If a parachutist becomes fouled during missions when
         the aircraft is operating with a high gross weight or is flying in a high density altitude
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                205


        environment, the pilot may elect to maintain flaps at 50 percent, landing gear up, and
        slow to Minimum Operating Speed (MOS) in lieu of the standard procedure. NOTE:
        Compute MOS using power off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degrees
        of bank plus 5 knots. This information will be posted on the operational data form
        prior to all static line paratroop door deployments.
        16.37.3.6.3. The pilot maintains at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the
        type parachute being used, and avoids flying over or upwind of water or built up
        areas. EXCEPTION: If the parachutist is equipped for a water drop, the pilot should
        avoid flying over land. CAUTION: If possible, the pilot will avoid turning the
        aircraft in the direction of the fouled parachutist. Turning into the parachutist often
        starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possibility of injury
        to the fouled parachutist.
        16.37.3.6.4. The copilot turns on the red light.
        16.37.3.6.5. The parachutist indicates consciousness and that the reserve parachute is
        ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve parachute.
        16.37.3.6.6. If the pilot‘s decision is to cut the parachutist free, the parachutist‘s
        static line will be cut by the loadmaster on the pilot‘s command.
        16.37.3.6.7. If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, refer to expanded checklist
        and AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2 for procedures.
  16.37.4. Door Bundle Airdrops.
     16.37.4.1. General A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds (excluding the
     weight of the parachutes) are referred to as "door bundles" and are dropped from the
     aircraft through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the
     PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP or SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklist. Loads
     weighing more than 350 pounds require two trained designated pushers to assist the
     loadmaster/jumpmaster in pushing loads from the aircraft. Door bundles may be dropped
     independently or with personnel and are limited to one bundle per exit used. When
     dropped with personnel, the bundle is the first object to exit the aircraft. Remove
     restraints and position the bundle in the paratroop door or on the ramp prior to
     completion of the slowdown checklist (EXCEPTION: If the jumpmaster needs the
     paratroop door for spotting, place the door bundle as close as possible to the paratroop
     door). If jumpers are to follow the door bundle, the user is responsible for ejecting the
     bundle out the troop door or off the ramp. Maintain positive control of all door bundles
     exiting out the cargo ramp. To maintain positive control of door bundles exiting over the
     ramp, it may be necessary to secure the forward end of the bundle to a suitable floor
     tiedown ring with 550 cord or suitable substitute. This tie is to prevent premature release
     of the bundle and will be cut by the loadmaster at the release point.
        16.37.4.1.1. Door bundles dropped from the paratroop doors will be rigged with non-
        breakaway static lines. The dimensions, including the parachute, must not exceed 48
        inches by 30 inches by 66 inches unless authorized in a specific T.O. When the
        container is placed in the door for airdrop, place the largest dimension in the vertical
        or upright position.
206                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


          16.37.4.1.2. Door bundles followed by paratroopers dropped from the ramp and door
          or paratroop door(s) will be rigged with a T-10 parachute (converted for cargo) or
          parachute equipped with breakaway static lines (per TO 13C7-1-11). Also, bundles
          rigged for a ramp exit are equipped with a skid board compatible with the center
          roller conveyors. NOTE: If no parachutists are to be dropped after the door bundles,
          non-breakaway static lines will be used. Anchor cable stops will be positioned as
          depicted in TO 1C-130A-9 for CDS airdrops.
      16.37.4.2. During unilateral single-ship airdrop training, door bundles will not exit
      aircraft after a paratrooper has jumped. NOTE: During joint training, a combat or
      contingency operation, the user determines door bundle requirements and order of exit
      from any or all personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation.
      16.37.4.3. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP for the
      first paratrooper exiting after the bundle and compute an additional CARP for the door
      bundle to ensure that it will impact on the DZ. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP,
      followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is the only
      object dropped, base the CARP on the bundle.
   16.37.5. Container Ramp Loads (CRL)/Ramp Bundle. Container ramp loads may consist of
   A-series containers (e.g. RAMZ bundle, double A-22, single A-22) or loads rigged on
   combat expendable platforms (e.g. ATV, motorcycle) rigged for airdrop from the cargo ramp
   or floor. CRLs are individually restrained with a length of Type VIII nylon webbing (release
   gate) routed through ramp/floor tiedown rings and secured to the container webbing on the
   forward and aft side. At the release point the loadmaster manually cuts the release gate,
   allowing the bundle to exit from the aircraft. Ramp bundles must be rigged IAW T.O. 13C7-
   series rigging manuals. The total weight of the bundle will not exceed 2335 pounds. Loads to
   be followed by parachutists will be rigged with breakaway static lines, unless specified in
   specific rigging directive. All remaining restraint will be removed prior to the completion of
   the 10 minute checklist (EXCEPTION: Forward restraint for CRLs rigged on the ramp may
   be removed after the cargo ramp and door are in the ADS position and prior to the
   completion of the slowdown checklist). The bundle may be followed by personnel. These
   procedures may be accomplished from either side of the ramp or from the centerline. Specific
   aircraft preparation and rigging procedures are contained in T.O.1C-130A-9, Section VII.
   NOTE: Due to aircraft configuration, the maximum number of CRLs that can be airdropped
   on one pass in the HC/MC-130 is two. When dropping two all-terrain-vehicles (ATV) rigged
   as CRLs, one CRL will be rigged on the ramp and one will be rigged on the cargo floor.
   When mission requirements dictate dropping more than two CRLs, they must be rigged in A-
   series containers, using CDS procedures in Section VII of TO 1C-130A-9, and dropped using
   the CDS checklist.
      16.37.5.1. Aircrew Procedures. Use the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP
      Checklist (CDS Flap settings may be used if desired). Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE
      AIRDROP CHECKLIST for PJD RAMZ/ATV CRL airdrops.
      16.37.5.2. Aircraft configuration. For single CRL drops use 50 percent flap setting or
      CDS flap setting as required. Use 50 percent flap setting for dual CRL drops. NOTE:
      50 percent flaps results in a flat deck angle ensuring the aft bundle does not move and
      gives the loadmaster time to cut both gates and push the bundle(s). The Pararescue team
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                207


     simultaneously follows the bundle. At no time will the deck angle be nose down.
     NOTE: Since CRL is usually airdropped in conjunction with a Pararescue team, success
     of this airdrop depends on the ability to airdrop a Pararescue team as close as possible to
     the CRL(s) (single/multiple) on the ground.
     16.37.5.3. CARP Calculations. When CRLs are dropped with personnel, compute the
     CARP for the first paratrooper exiting after the bundle. Compute an additional CARP for
     the door bundle to ensure that it will impact within the DZ boundaries. Release the
     bundle at the personnel CARP, followed by the parachutists. NOTE: For dual CRL
     drops, personnel exit time is computed from the time the forward bundle (bundle resting
     on the cargo floor) exits the aircraft. Crews must be aware that the exit time will be
     longer for multiple CRL drops and factor this into usable drop-zone time. NOTE: If the
     load is rigged on the ramp, recommend using a 2 second exit time for 50 percent flaps.
     Otherwise, interpolate exit time using data listed in AFI 11-231, Table 9.19.
     16.37.5.4. Loadmaster Procedures. The procedures listed below are for use with the
     PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENTAIRDROP Checklist.
        16.37.5.4.1. Aircraft Preparation. Prepare the aircraft IAW TO 1C-130A-9,
        Sections VIIA and VIIC.
            16.37.5.4.1.1. Use two rollers under each bundle.
            16.37.5.4.1.2. Remove and stow all other rollers to allow a clear path of travel for
            the loadmasters and jumpers.
            16.37.5.4.1.3. Loadmaster will use restraint harnesses when dropping using these
            procedures
        16.37.5.4.2. After loading. Rig the bundle(s), IAW TO 1C-130A-9, Section VIIC.
            16.37.5.4.2.1. For a CRL bundle resting on the floor, position the 8/7-cord static
            line safety tie on the aft left (HC-130)/right (MC-130) side of the bundle if the
            jumpers are using static line parachutes
            16.37.5.4.2.2. For a CRL bundle resting on the floor, position the 8/7-cord static
            line safety tie on, on the aft right (HC-130)/ left (MC-130) side of the bundle if
            the jumpers are using free fall parachutes.
        16.37.5.4.3. Ten Minute Checklist.
            16.37.5.4.3.1. Before completion of the TEN-MINUTE Checklist, if dropping
            two CRLs, the loadmasters may remove all the restraint from the CRL resting on
            the floor and all the restraint, except the forward restraint strap, on the CRL
            positioned on the ramp. The forward restraint will be removed after the ramp is in
            the horizontal position, prior to the completion of the SLOWDOWN Checklist.
            16.37.5.4.3.2. If the drop is aborted, reapply all the bundles restraint.
        16.37.5.4.4. One-Minute Checklist.
            16.37.5.4.4.1. The jumpers are cleared to line up along side of the CRL resting on
            the floor but will not move aft of FS 737 or behind the forward CRL static line,
            which ever is more restrictive.
208                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


             16.37.5.4.4.2. At the navigator‘s ―5-second‖ call, the loadmasters will move into
             position to cut the bundles Type VIII gates. One loadmaster will be in position to
             cut the aft bundle while the other loadmaster will be in position to cut the forward
             bundle.
          16.37.5.4.5. Green Light.
             16.37.5.4.5.1. After hearing and seeing green light, the loadmaster will cut the
             gate of the aft bundle (bundle resting on the ramp) with a V-blade knife (the
             bundle may begin to exit depending on deck angle) and quickly move forward to
             assist in pushing the forward bundle (resting on the cargo floor).
             16.37.5.4.5.2. Once the loadmaster is forward of all bundles and clear of all the
             static lines, the second loadmaster will cut the forward CRL gate.
             16.37.5.4.5.3. After both gates have been cut the loadmasters will push the
             bundles out together as quickly as possible. The loadmasters should be prepared
             to exert extra force on the bundles once they contact each other.
             16.37.5.4.5.4. The jumpers are clear to follow once the forward bundle has
             crossed FS 737.
      16.37.5.5. Emergency Procedures. Follow either CDS emergency procedures or fouled
      parachutist procedures as required.
   16.37.6. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB). The 15-pound standard airdrop training
   bundle may be dropped to simulate personnel or equipment. SATBs will be assembled and
   have an identification tag attached in accordance with T.O. 13C7-1-11. SATBs will not be
   rigged with a breakaway static line.
      16.37.6.1. Aircrew Procedures. Conduct SATB missions at the altitude and airspeed
      specified for the drop being simulated. Use the applicable airdrop checklist for the type
      airdrop simulated.
      16.37.6.2. Emergency Procedures. If a training bundle is outside the aircraft and fails to
      separate, make no attempt to retrieve it. Cut the bundle loose over the prebriefed salvo
      area or DZ. When simulating an airdrop using the cargo ramp and door, a hung bundle
      could become wedged in the aircraft elevator during turns. If possible, cut the static line
      prior to making a turn.
   16.37.7. Free Fall Airdrops. The delivery of certain types of supplies, such as bulk food
   products or clothing, can be accomplished without the use of parachutes.
      16.37.7.1. Aircrew Procedures.  Use either the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT or
      SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklist. EXCEPTION: Refer to Chapter 15 and AFTTP
      3-3.HC/MC-130 for guidance on rescue equipment (MA-1 kit, parabundle, or freefall)
      airdrops.
      16.37.7.2. Minimum Drop Altitudes. Daylight drops will be made at 150 feet AGL and
      night drops no lower than 500 feet AGL.
      16.37.7.3. Drift Effect. For free-fall airdrops, wind drift need not be considered.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  209


     16.37.7.4. DZ size. DZ size will be determined by the trajectory of the items being
     dropped. As a rule, DZ length required equals the altitude of the aircraft over the release
     point plus a safety margin of 100 feet added to each end. Applying this rule, when
     dropping from 200 feet AGL, the required length will be 200 feet (altitude) plus 200 feet
     (safety margin) or 400 feet total. Additional crewmembers may be needed to eject the
     load.
  16.37.8. Container Delivery System (CDS). The CDS is designed to airdrop up to five
  individual A-22 containers, single stick, from Rescue HC/MC-130 without a dual rail cargo
  handling system (intermediate rollers or skate wheels are required). The system may also be
  used to airdrop A-7, A-21, double A-22, and A-23 containers and loads rigged on combat
  expendable platforms. The weight of each container and type parachute used should be IAW
  T.O. 13C7-1-11, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment—Rigging Containers and Field Manual
  10-501, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging Containers. Containers can be rigged
  and dropped one at a time or up to five in a single stick. Use normal CDS rigging procedures
  outlined in Chapter 7, T.O. 1C-130A-9, with the following exceptions: the release gate for
  single containers, multiple containers rigged in a single stick configuration or combat
  expendable platforms that do not exceed 3500 pounds, may be rigged using Type VIII nylon.
  For loads between 3100 pounds and 3500 pounds the release gate will be rigged using one
  turn double Type VIII nylon. For single stick container loads that exceed 3500 pounds use
  Type XXVI nylon. Multiple container releases exceeding 3500 pounds require standard
  rigging and release with a static line retriever as outlined in Chapter 7, T.O. 1C-130A-9.
  After the release gate is cut, the airdrop load exits the aircraft by gravity force. CAUTION:
  Standard tiedown procedures contained in, T.O. 1C-130A-9 will be used to secure airdrop
  loads in the aircraft. Because a buffer stop assembly cannot be installed, the normal
  maximum total container weight is 5000 pounds. When the total rigged weight of the airdrop
  load exceeds 5000 pounds, MAJCOM/A3T approval is required.
     16.37.8.1. Aircrew Procedures. Compute a CARP and use the CDS Checklist.
     16.37.8.2. Flap Settings. Accomplish the slowdown initially setting flaps to 50 percent.
     As the airspeed decreases to drop airspeed, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart
     located in AFI 11-2HC-130 CL-1.             NOTE: The CDS flap setting will give an
     approximate 6 to 8 degree nose-high attitude. Maintain this attitude and level flight
     throughout the drop. NOTE: When dropping SATBs or 1-5 bundles, it is recommended
     that aircraft gross weight be no less than 104,000 pounds. If the drop must be made, use
     zero percent flaps and expect longer than normal exit time. At gross weights above
     104,000 pounds use the flap setting obtained from the 1-5 bundle line. WARNING: The
     aircraft will tend to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft. This pitch must be anticipated
     and controlled to allow no more than two or three degrees additional pitch. Do not over
     control to the point that negative G forces are encountered while the load is exiting the
     aircraft, as this increases exit time or may stop load movement. NOTE: Manual CDS
     gate cuts are authorized for all Rescue HC/MC-130 series aircraft. Loadmasters may
     manually cut the CDS release gate for all single stick container loads that do not exceed
     5000 pounds total rigged weight. The following procedures and definitions further
     explain and clarify limitations.
     16.37.8.3. Normal System Release. The normal system release method utilizes normal
     rigging of the static line retriever and guillotine knife to cut/release the CDS gate. The
210                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


      CDS gate is cut by activating the static line retriever. Refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9 for
      specific rigging procedures. A subsequent drop will prevent the use of the static line
      retriever and requires an alternate method of gate release. Alternate methods of cutting
      the release gate are described below:
         16.37.8.3.1. Manual System Release. This method is performed by the loadmaster
         pulling down sharply on a tiedown strap looped over the static line retriever cable.
         Loadmasters will delay three seconds after ―Green Light‖ is called before performing
         a manual system release. This method can only be used when authorized by the
         mission commander.
         16.37.8.3.2. Manual Gate Cut. This method is performed by using a knife or V-blade
         knife to cut/release the CDS gate. Loadmasters will manually cut the CDS release
         gate upon hearing and seeing ―Green Light‖ during the execution of the CDS airdrop
         checklist. All single stick container loads that do not exceed 5000 pounds may be
         released using the manual gate cut method.
         16.37.8.3.3. Manual Combat Cut. This method is performed by using a knife or V-
         blade knife to cut/release the CDS gate regardless of the amount/configuration of
         CDS on board. It is intended to be used only in combat and only after receiving
         authorization from the mission commander. This method allows loadmasters to scan
         for threats more efficiently prior to and immediately after the drop. Mission
         commanders should carefully consider crew experience prior to authorizing this
         procedure and extreme caution should be used.
      16.37.8.4. When the loadmaster calls ―LOAD CLEAR‖, the flaps will be reset to 50
      percent.
      16.37.8.5. Combination Airdrops. During combination CDS drops:
         16.37.8.5.1. The jumpers will line up forward of the alternate forward barrier at the
         10-minute warning.
         16.37.8.5.2. After hearing and seeing green light, one loadmaster will cut the release
         gate manually or via the static line retriever.
         16.37.8.5.3. The other loadmaster will immediately lower the forward barrier as the
         loads begins to exit from the aircraft allowing the PJs to exit directly behind the CDS
         loads.
      16.37.8.6. CDS Emergency Procedures. If the release gate fails to cut or the load fails
      to exit. The loadmaster will take the following corrective actions:
         16.37.8.6.1. Notify the pilot by stating, ―MALFUNCTION,‖ with a brief description
         of the problem.
         16.37.8.6.2. Alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load.
         16.37.8.6.3. Raise the aft anchor cable supports (if required).
         16.37.8.6.4. Clear the ramp and door to close. WARNING: When notified of a
         malfunction, extend additional flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose
         down attitude until the ramp and door are closed and the load is secured. Maintain
         drop airspeed and AGL altitude (if possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  211


          or built up areas. WARNING: When the cargo ramp and door cannot be closed from
          the cockpit, the loadmaster secures the load for aft movement. Ensure the lifeline is
          attached to a tiedown ring no further aft than FS 677 prior to proceeding aft to operate
          the cargo ramp and door controls. CAUTION: If the load is jammed in the ramp
          area, the loadmaster will notify the engineer to stop closing action when the cargo
          door is released from the uplocks. After the load is secured and the ramp area is clear,
          the loadmaster will close the ramp and door from the aft control panel (if possible).
          16.37.8.6.5. Secure the load for landing
          16.37.8.6.6. After completing the CDS MALFUNCTION Checklist, perform the
          COMPLETION OF AIRDROP checklist.
   16.37.9. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Drop. The raiding craft is normally an
   inflated, 16 foot rubber boat mounted on a specially constructed expendable platform.
   Equipment and supplies (including outboard motor, fuel, and other supplies) are secured
   inside the boat. The platform, weighted with sandbags, sinks when it is cut away from the
   boat in the water. Total rigged weight is approximately 2000 pounds. The recovery parachute
   is a G-12D/E deployed by a 15 foot pilot chute packed in a T-10 deployment bag.
      16.37.9.1. Aircrew Procedures. Use the CDS Checklist. One CRRC with up to 19
      personnel or 2 (stacked) CRRC with 18 personnel can be safely airdropped on one pass.
      Compute a CARP, unless mission directives dictate otherwise. NOTE: CDS is a special
      qualification for HC-130 and CSAR MC-130 Loadmasters and an instructor certification
      for pilots and navigators. Do not use the CDS checklist or procedures unless the aircrew
      is appropriately qualified/certified.
      16.37.9.2. The following will apply when dropping two CRRCs on one pass:
          16.37.9.2.1. The forward release gate must be manually cut by the loadmaster.
          16.37.9.2.2. The second loadmaster must be positioned in the paratroop door prior to
          completion of the ten-minute warning.
      16.37.9.3. Training and Exercises. One or more recovery boats will be in position to
      recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or
      more from the DZ axis. The navigators can confirm the release point and the offset
      distance from the boat visually or by using radar returns.
      16.37.9.4. DZ Axis. If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (+ or -
      30 degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised if this
      cannot be complied with.
      16.37.9.5. Limitations. Use Table 16.6 for CRRC wind and sea state limitations for
      training.
      16.37.9.6. Emergency Procedures. Follow either CDS emergency procedures or fouled
      parachutist procedures as required.

   16.37.10. Rigging, Alternate Method, Zodiac/All-Terrain Vehicle (RAMZ/ATV) Airdrops.
   The RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470 combat rubber raiding craft with a 35
   horsepower outboard engine rigged for low velocity airdrop from any C-130 aircraft. The
   RAMZ engine is configured in a plywood box and is secured in a standard A-22 container
   using two modified T-10C parachutes. When rigged for deployment, the RAMZ package
   weighs between 600 and 1,000 pounds. The ATV is rigged IAW Army Field Manual 10-500-
   77, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging Motorcycles, and Air Force Technical Order
   13C7-55-1, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment--Rigging Motorcycles. ATVs are rigged on
   combat expendable platforms and dropped using G-12E cargo parachutes equipped with 15
   ft. extraction (deployment) parachute packed in T-10 deployment bag.
      16.37.10.1. Employment. Parachutists may exit the aircraft using HALO/HAHO or static
      line procedures.
      16.37.10.2. DZ Axis. If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (+ or –
      30 degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised when
      this cannot be complied with.
      16.37.10.3. Aircraft Preparation. The aircraft will be configured IAW AFI 11-2HC-
      130V3, Addenda A. The RAMZ/ATV package will be delivered to the aircraft fully
      rigged and prepared for loading on the aircraft. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft
      preparation, rigging the release gate, attaching the static line, and securing the package in
      the aircraft.
          16.37.10.3.1. RAMZ/ATV Preflight. Prior to flight, the loadmaster will ensure that
          no fuel is leaking from the RAMZ/ATV bundle. A leaking bundle will not be loaded
          aboard the aircraft or will be downloaded if already aboard. The fuel bladders have a
          tendency to emit fumes. If one or more RAMZ/ATV is loaded aboard the aircraft the
          day prior to flight, there may be noticeable fumes in the aircraft the following day.
          The fumes may be decreased or eliminated by venting the aircraft overnight. One
          technique is to close both paratroop doors onto the extended jump platforms and
          secure them with tie down straps. If the RAMZ/ATV is emitting fumes and the
          aircraft must temporarily remain pressurized, taping the urinal covers open may
          reduce or eliminate the fumes. WARNING: If flammable fumes are present,
          unnecessary electrical equipment/switches will not be turned on or off until the fumes
          are eliminated. Use 100 percent oxygen and accomplish the Smoke and Fume
          Elimination Checklist as appropriate. WARNING: Only 15-foot static lines will be
          used on the RAMZ cargo parachutes. A 12-foot static line extended to 15 feet will not
          be used. If personnel are to follow immediately after the RAMZ, their static lines will
          also be 15 feet. NOTE: A maximum of three RAMZ/ATV bundles can be rigged on
          the Rescue HC/MC-130 when the aircraft internal fuel tanks are installed. When
          using CRL procedures, a maximum of 2 RAMZ/ATV bundles can be rigged on the
          Rescue HC/MC-130. WARNING: When rigging two RAMZ bundles on the cargo
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   213


        ramp, use extreme care to ensure the aircraft CG remains within tolerances.
        CAUTION: For RAMZ deployments at night, two illumination parachute flares will
        be loaded in the flare launcher tubes or be immediately available for manual
        deployment prior to starting the pre-slowdown checklist. If used, the flare launcher
        must remain "deactivated" and "safe" until personnel and equipment have deployed
        and are a safe distance from the aircraft. NOTE: When loaded aboard the aircraft,
        the vertical restraint tie down strap on the RAMZ will be secured in such a manner
        that it is not placed over any fuel bladder, just tight enough to take the slack out of the
        strap. The vertical strap acts as a backup to the 5,000-pound gate.
        16.37.10.3.2. Airplanes with Static Line Retriever. Position the left (HC-130) or right
        (MC-130) anchor cable stop at FS 893 and tape. The left/right anchor cable will be
        utilized for attachment of both the container and the personnel static lines.
        WARNING: Static lines for both RAMZ/ATV and parachutists will be hooked to the
        same anchor cable. No more than 20 static lines may be airdropped on a single pass
        (i.e., one RAMZ/ATV and 19 jumpers, two RAMZ/ATV and 18 jumpers, etc.).
        16.37.10.3.3. Airplanes without Static Line Retriever. Install and tape anchor cable
        stop at FS 749 for single cable use. RAMZ/ATV static lines will be attached to this
        cable. WARNING: Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will not jump
        from airplanes without an operational static line retriever.
        16.37.10.3.4. Skid boards must be a minimum of 48 by 48 inches.
     16.37.10.4. Deployment Altitudes.
        16.37.10.4.1. The minimum deployment altitude will be 3,000 feet AWL/AGL when
        the PJs exit using non-static line deployed parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used
        for training.
        16.37.10.4.2. For operational missions, minimum altitude with non-static line
        deployed a parachute is 2,500 feet AWL/AGL.
        16.37.10.4.3. The minimum deployment altitude for training or non-combat single-
        pass combination air drops of RAMZ/ATV and PJs exiting with static lines will be
        800 feet AWL/AGL. NOTE: The RAMZ/ATV and PJs will be deployed from the
        same altitude.
     16.37.10.5. Deployment Methods. The following are approved methods of deploying
     RAMZ/ATV packages.
        16.37.10.5.1. CRL procedures. Single pass navigator directed deployment. Use the
        PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP Checklist and procedures in paragraph
        16.37.5
        16.37.10.5.2. CDS procedures. Single pass navigator directed deployment. Use the
        procedures in paragraph 16.37.8
        16.37.10.5.3. Search and Rescue Airdrop Checklist. Use JMD procedures with 50 or
        70% flaps (based on gross weight). Jumpers may exit on the same pass as equipment
        or on subsequent passes using fix target/moving target procedures. See paragraph
        16.33 for pararescue JMD Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target Pattern procedures.
214                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


         NOTE: For JMD RAMZ/ATV drops, a navigator‘s CARP/HARP is not required
         when using streamers/spotter chutes.
      16.37.10.6. Deployment Procedures. In addition to the deployment procedures required
      by the specific method of delivery being used, the following procedures apply:
         16.37.10.6.1. Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will attach their static
         lines to the same anchor cable to which the RAMZ/ATV static lines are attached or
         jump on a subsequent pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are
         retrieved.
         16.37.10.6.2. Military freefall parachutists may exit from the aircraft ramp on the
         same pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved or cut, or
         exit on a subsequent pass using Fixed/Moving target PJD procedures, as appropriate.
         If dropping from the paratroop door on the subsequent pass, complete the Post-
         Deployment Checklist, and initiate the Pre-Deployment Checklist.
         16.37.10.6.3. For JMD drops, at the pilot‘s "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY" call, the
         jumpmaster will be on either side of the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft
         end. Additional jumpers will be forward of the RAMZ/ATV. The loadmaster will be
         positioned to remove aft restraint and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times.
         At the "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY," the jumpmaster will be alerted, the load
         release gate is checked, and the aft restraint is removed.
         16.37.10.6.4. The loadmaster will relay "Safety Checks Complete" to the pilot if the
         jumpmaster has already gone off interphone. The pilot not flying will turn on the
         green light, indicating to the jumpmaster that conditions are satisfactory for the
         airdrop.
         16.37.10.6.5. The jumpmaster will determine the exit point and deploy prior to
         receiving a "No-drop" notification or seeing the red light on. The loadmaster will
         relay to the pilot all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster. The jumpmaster will
         signal for the loadmaster to cut the release gate. WARNING: If a "No-drop" is
         called and the RAMZ/ATV is held in place by only the release gate, all personnel will
         move forward of the load, except the loadmaster and the jumpmaster who will
         monitor the RAMZ/ATV for possible shifting and secure as necessary. WARNING:
         If the RAMZ/ATV exits the aircraft but fails to properly deploy, the static lines will
         be cut immediately. CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to
         allow the nylon strap to pull free through floor tie down rings.
      16.37.10.7. Completion of Drop.
         16.37.10.7.1. During JMD airdrops, post-deployment checks can be deferred until
         completion of the last drop. However, crews will accomplish applicable steps of the
         Post-Deployment Checklist and re-accomplish the Pre-Deployment Checklist, as
         required, when necessary to change the aircraft or door configuration.
         16.37.10.7.2. For navigator directed releases. Accelerate to 140 KIAS, climb or
         descend as briefed, and perform the Completion of Drop Checklist.
      16.37.10.8. Training and Exercises. One or more safety recovery boats will be in
      position to recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                   215


      400 yards or more from the DZ axis. The navigators can confirm the release point and the
      offset distance from the boat visually or by using radar returns.
      16.37.10.9. Limitations. During training, use Table 16.7 for RAMZ wind and sea state
      limitations. Limitations for operational or contingency missions will be determined by the
      jumpmaster, in coordination with the aircraft commander.
      16.37.10.10. Emergency Procedures. Follow either the CDS emergency procedures or
      fouled parachutist procedures as required.

      16.37.11.1. Descending Slowdown. At slowdown, upon reaching 140 KIAS, descend to
      drop altitude. Start descent using 140 KIAS and 1,000 feet per minute until reaching
      drop altitude. Do not initiate descent until the following conditions are met:
          16.37.11.1.1. Position is positively identified and at or past the DZ entry point.
          16.37.11.1.2. The aircraft is within 3 NMs of DZ run-in course centerline.
          WARNING: Analyze pre-drop gross weight to determine if obstructions can be
          cleared with one engine inoperative. If obstruction clearance cannot be met reduce
          aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape course, or increase drop altitude.
          NOTE: Do not attempt IMC airdrops in areas of thunderstorm activity, heavy
          precipitation, or during icing conditions.
   16.37.12. Joint Precision Airdrop Delivery System (JPADS). JPADS airdrop procedures
   are currently under development and will be incorporated at a later date. NOTE: Aircrews
   will use interim MAJCOM guidance until incorporation of procedures into this instruction.

                         HOT REFUELING/FARP OPERATIONS

Section 17A—Hot Refueling

17.1. General. For aircrews, basic hot refueling is the transfer of fuel (refueling or defueling)
with one or more engines running at sites where all required equipment is provided. Hot
refueling certified Aircrew may refuel/defuel at fixed-sites, refuel/defuel with approved fuel
trucks and receive fuel from a fixed-wing tanker at FARP sites. Tanker FARP operations also
falls under the hot refueling umbrella and may be performed by FARP certified aircrew. See
Section 17B for FARP specific guidance. Aircrews may conduct hot refueling operations under
NVG conditions. A comprehensive mission briefing and strict compliance with these procedures
will ensure an expeditious and safe refueling operation. The guidance in this section
supplements the procedures outlined in TO 00-25-172, AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling
Point (FARP) Operations, AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130, and checklists. This chapter applies to all
CSAR HC/MC-130 weapon systems. Request for deviations will be coordinated through HQ
ACC/A3TV. Prior to conducting hot refueling operations, ensure:
   17.1.1. The weapon system and support equipment involved are approved for hot refueling
   IAW TO 00-25-172.
   17.1.2. Air Force hot refueling sites are approved IAW AFI 11-235 or meet the requirements
   of TO 00-25- 172.
   17.1.3. Fire protection equipment is available IAW AFI 11-235 or meets the requirements of
   TO 00-25-172.
   17.1.4. Personnel performing hot refueling operations will have a thorough knowledge of
   T.O. 00-25-172, specifically section II (Electrostatic Hazards), section III (Bonding), and
   section VII (Combat or Contingency Operations). Personnel operating refueling equipment
   during blacked-out operations must be Night Vision Goggle (NVG) qualified.
   17.1.5. All Air Force personnel involved with hot refueling operations will be trained IAW
   appropriate command directives.
   17.1.6. Refuel operations at Air Force hot refueling sites will not be conducted within 200
   feet of aircraft parking areas, 50 feet of taxing aircraft, and 200 feet of inhabited or
   uninhabited buildings.
17.2. Terms. The following terms are unique to hot refueling operations:
   17.2.1. Wet Wing Refueling. Engines not running (power cart, GTC, or APU used). The
   same checklist and procedures apply as for hot refueling.
   17.2.2. Tanker Operations. The act of providing fuel to a receiver source at a hot refueling
   site.
   17.2.3. Receiver Operations. The act of receiving fuel at a hot refueling site.
   17.2.4. Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ). The area within 50 feet of a pressurized fuel
   carrying component and 25 feet around fuel vent outlets of an aircraft.
218                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   17.2.5. Rearming. The upload of munitions on the receiver aircraft.
17.3. Planning Factors: Planners must be aware of factors which limit hot refueling
employment and should consider the following when including a hot refueling option in an
exercise or contingency:
   17.3.1. Passengers. Personnel and equipment may be off-loaded or on-loaded in conjunction
   with refueling operations. Personnel movement on or off the aircraft should be monitored to
   maintain accountability in case of an emergency.
   17.3.2. Hot refueling sites. Depending on the sister service or host nation there can be
   several different types of hot refueling sites. Some of the different types of sites are as
   follows:
      17.3.2.1. Forward Area Refueling Equipment (FARE).             Forward area refueling
      equipment sites are normally setup by the Army using blivets to refuel aircraft. Hot
      refueling qualified crews may conduct refueling /defueling operation at these sites.
      17.3.2.2. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP). Forward area refueling point sites are
      normally established for aircraft to aircraft refueling. Hot refueling qualified crews may
      conduct receiver operations at these sites. NOTE: Refueling trucks may conduct
      refueling/defueling operations to a single aircraft at FARP sites.
      17.3.2.3. Hot Refueling Site. Hot refueling site is a generic term used for a site that
      refuels/defuels aircraft with engines running from a fix source or a fuel truck. Hot
      refueling qualified crews may conduct operations at these sites. WARNING: All hot
      refueling sites will have a current site survey and meet the minimum unobstructed egress
      distance required by the survey to ensure the aircraft can taxi from the site in the event of
      an emergency. If the egress distance is less than the required minimum or the egress area
      is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform refueling/defueling in a cold
      environment only.
   17.3.3. Planners must verify equipment at intended Hot Refueling location is approved for
   use in hot refueling operations. Refer to T.O. 00-25-172, T.O. 37A9-7-2-1, Operation,
   Maintenance, and Illustrated Parts Breakdown—Forward Area Manifold Cart, PN 87940
   and the System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA) for approved equipment.
17.4. Crew Duties and Responsibilities. Only current and certified crewmembers will be
allowed to occupy a primary crew position on hot refueling missions. EXCEPTION: Aircrew
in certification upgrade may occupy a primary crew position under the supervision of an
instructor. Normally these missions will be conducted with a mission crew compliment.
   17.4.1. The minimum crew required to conduct hot refueling operations will be as follows:
      17.4.1.1. Pilot – 2.
      17.4.1.2. Flight engineer – 1.
      17.4.1.3. Loadmaster -1. NOTE: The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will remain on
      the flight deck in the event of an emergency taxi, i.e. moving the aircraft. These crew
      positions are the minimum required to fly the aircraft.
   17.4.2. Aircraft Commander (AC). The AC is responsible for the overall safety of the crew
   and the aircraft hot refueling operations. The AC relies on the Loadmaster to announce any
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  219


   unusual situations and to recommend the best course of action. The AC ensures the crew is
   briefed IAW this instruction prior to commencing hot refueling operations. The aircraft
   commander will:
      17.4.2.1. Ensure approval has been granted by the proper authority prior to conducting
      hot refueling operations.
      17.4.2.2. Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities.
      17.4.2.3. Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking action.
      Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay hot refueling operations.
      17.4.2.4. Analyze planned hot refueling area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances.
      17.4.2.5. Determine fuel requirements to include estimated onload and offload.
   17.4.3. Flight engineer (FE): The flight engineer will:
      17.4.3.1. Read and ensure compliance with the hot refueling checklist.
      17.4.3.2. Control fuel distribution and the SPR drain pump on UARRSI modified
      aircraft.
      17.4.3.3. Coordinate fuel distribution with the loadmaster on Non-UARRSI aircraft.
   17.4.4. Loadmaster (LM). The LM is responsible for supervising fuel servicing operations.
   The loadmaster will:
      17.4.4.1. Ensure compliance with all safety procedures.
      17.4.4.2. Immediately inform the pilot and advise the crew on recommended course of
      action, in the event of a hazardous situation/emergency.
      17.4.4.3. Ensure all required equipment is on board prior to and after hot refueling
      operations.
      17.4.4.4. Operate the ramp and door or paratroop door as required.
      17.4.4.5. Complete the hot brake/hung flare check prior to commencing hot refueling
      operations.
      17.4.4.6. Ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures.
      17.4.4.7. Operate the SPR panel and control fuel distribution with coordination from the
      flight engineer. EXCEPTION: On UARRSI modified aircraft the flight engineer will
      control fuel distribution.
      17.4.4.8. Perform leak check at SPR panel.
      17.4.4.9. Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are aboard.
17.5. Hot refueling Equipment. The hot refueling mission requires specific equipment and
inspections prior to commencing operations. Only equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO
37A9-7-2-1, and in the system safety engineering analysis (SSEA) shall be used. This
equipment is unique in that it provides for an internal bond that is not provided for with
conventional refueling equipment. If unapproved equipment is used, the refueling operation
must be accomplished without engines running (cold refueling).
220                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   17.5.1. Those personnel who will have direct contact with fueling operations during hot
   refueling will have the following:
       17.5.1.1. Spare flight gloves.
       17.5.1.2. Extra flight suit or change of clothing, including flight boots.
       17.5.1.3. Full canteen, to be carried on your person.
       17.5.1.4. Sealable water and fuel resistant garment bag to store fuel soaked clothing.
       17.5.1.5. NVGs with spare battery (as required).
       17.5.1.6. Dust goggles (as required).
       17.5.1.7. Survival vest (as required).
       17.5.1.8. Overt/IR chemlights (as required).
       17.5.1.9. IR compatible flashlight (as required).
       17.5.1.10. Cloth Tape - For NVG operations, position sufficient layers of cloth tape on
       the refueling panel light. For those aircraft so equipped, tape the dump pump light as
       well. Taping these lights is required to reduce the amount of light, not to eliminate the
       light (Not required for NVIS modified aircraft).
17.6. Weather Requirements. For training operations and exercises, stop fuel servicing when
high winds or reduced visibility caused by blowing rain, snow, or sand exists or when an
electrical storm is within a 5 mile radius of the hot refueling site. Contact the local weather
agency for observations and/or forecasts for potential mission impacting weather phenomena.
17.7. Safety. Because of the inherent dangers with the ground refueling and rearming of
aircraft, safety cannot be overemphasized. Safety is the responsibility of all personnel and is
considered before, during, and after all refueling operations. Any person observing an unsafe
situation, practice, or procedure should immediately inform all personnel, and all refueling and
rearming operations will immediately stop until the unsafe condition can be eliminated.
   17.7.1. Safety guidance. Hot refueling aircraft have been tailored to perform this unique and
   risky operation. Each aircraft and the refueling equipment involved in the operation was
   subjected to a System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA), which includes; a failure
   mode/effects criticality assessments, and operating/support hazard analysis. This process
   considers the weapon system, support equipment and the personnel interface. Overall, the
   system safety approach minimizes the hazards associated with this operation, reducing them
   to an acceptable level.
       17.7.1.1. Electrostatic discharge. Energy levels associated with electrostatic discharge
       are several times the energy required to ignite fuel vapors. A charge of static electricity
       can accumulate from fuel flowing through piping, hoses, couplers, and nozzles.
       Operating aircraft engines, rotor blades, and propeller blades also generate high static
       electricity voltages. The normal activity of personnel involved in refueling operations
       can generate static electricity on their clothing. Humidity greatly affects static electricity
       characteristics, the lower the humidity, the higher electrostatic potential. Under low
       humidity conditions, flight suits can produce a static charge of sufficient potential to
       cause a discharge. Anti-static finishes are not permanent and are gradually removed by
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 221


     laundering or dry cleaning. In addition, anti-static finishes are not effective in low
     humidity conditions or at low temperatures. To equalize these charges and reduce the
     possibility of sparks, aircraft and refueling equipment are bonded to each other. The
     electrical bonding of refueling servicing equipment and aircraft is a critical item because
     aircraft are not normally grounded for this operation.
     17.7.1.2. If a ground is not available at a FOL or remote site, aircraft will be bonded to
     servicing equipment during actual servicing. Bonding will be accomplished by inserting
     the bonding plug into the receiver aircraft‘s external receptacle prior to any other action.
     17.7.1.3. In the event of static discharge, forward the following data to HQ
     AFSOC/DOTW following all hot refueling operations: type aircraft involved, OAT, dew
     point, humidity, engines running / low speed / shutdown, taxiway / runway surface,
     indication of discharge, and sequence followed when bonding / grounding.
  17.7.2. Fire Protection:
     17.7.2.1. Personnel involved in servicing operations will be trained in portable fire
     extinguishers and installed equipment fire suppression system operations.
     17.7.2.2. Fire protection equipment is available IAW AFI 11-235 and/or meets the
     requirements of TO 00-25-172.
     17.7.2.3. DELETED.
  17.7.3. Heat exhaustion and carbon monoxide inhalation. Heat exhaustion and carbon
  monoxide inhalation, although not serious problems are two factors that can affect a crews
  ability to perform at their peak. You can suffer heat exhaustion or minor burns from the heat
  of the engines combined with wind conditions. You may also inhale carbon monoxide from
  the engine exhausts. The following are suggestions of how to minimize the effects of heat
  and carbon monoxide if the tactical situation will permit:
     17.7.3.1. Keep drinking water available, and drink large quantities of water to help
     prevent dehydration.
     17.7.3.2. Raising the aircraft flaps may reduce the exhaust being placed on the
     loadmaster. Using the aircraft engine oil cooler augmentation (if available) may reduce
     the exhaust behind the aircraft. Wind direction, temperature, location and environment
     are all factors to be considered.
  17.7.4. Uses of 100 percent nylon garments. The wear of Gortex ® or equivalent (The use
  of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or
  service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force) is authorized for
  aircraft servicing with JP-5/8/10, Jet-A, and diesel fuel (including mixed fuel criteria). .
  Personnel will not wear Gortex within 50-feet when servicing aircraft with JP-4 or ground
  servicing with Mogas.
  17.7.5. General Ordnance Procedures. Aircraft may be hot refueled with live ordnance
  aboard, however upload/download of ordnance and refueling of aircraft will normally be
  conducted as separate operations; a separate area should be established at least 300 feet from
  the hot refueling site. During combat or contingency operations, concurrent refueling and
  upload/download of ordnance may be authorized when, in the judgment of the mission
222                                                         AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   commander, operational necessity and benefits of reducing ground time outweigh the risks
   involved.
17.8. Electronic Emissions:
   17.8.1. Inertial navigational systems (INS or INU) may remain energized.
   17.8.2. Restrictions
       17.8.2.1. Radar, radar altimeters, doppler or DVS, and ECM equipment will not be
       operated within the refueling area.
       17.8.2.2. Any hand-held radios used within the FSSZ must be intrinsically safe.
       17.8.2.3. HF radio transmissions are not allowed within the FSSZ during refueling
       operations.
   17.8.3. Internal Communications. During ground operations, communications can be
   difficult due to aircraft noise levels. Interphone discipline is essential so emergency calls
   may be relayed clearly. NOTE: All unnecessary voice communication is prohibited for
   safety reasons. Voice communication contact between the loadmaster and cockpit will be
   maintained at all times. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster does not have to maintain interphone
   contact while positioning/repositioning refueling equipment, but will be on interphone any
   time the refueling nozzle is connected to the aircraft and the switches on the SPR panel are in
   a position other than off or closed.
17.9. Aircraft Marshaling:
   17.9.1. When CCT/STS are responsible for primary air traffic control of an airfield, they will
   marshal and control all aircraft movement into the hot refueling site. If CCT/STS are not
   available, all aircraft are responsible for self marshaling into the hot refueling site.
   17.9.2. Aircraft commanders must ensure marshaling procedures are thoroughly prebriefed
   between all agencies involved prior to hot refueling operations. These procedures must be
   strictly adhered to at all times, to ensure all safety requirements are met.
17.10. Emergency Procedures. Hot Refueling/FARP Emergency procedures are published in
the amplified checklist and abbreviated checklist. They will be reviewed by all crewmembers
and briefed by the AC prior to commencing hot refueling operations. All personnel, including
ground controllers, will know the ground evacuation plans. Stop all hot refueling operations
immediately when a leak, unsafe condition, or system malfunction occurs. Correct the
deficiency before resuming hot refueling operations.
17.11. Checklists. Amplified Hot Refueling/FARP checklists are published in Attachment 2.
Checklists are applicable to those aircraft equipped with and without the UARRSI modification.
Items (i.e. aircraft systems, checklist items, crew positions) in the checklist which are not
applicable to a unit‘s particular weapon system may be lined out in pencil.

Section 17B—FARP Specific Guidance

17.12. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP). The following paragraphs provide general
guidelines for HC-130 FARP operations, in preplanned and contingency operations. The HC-
130 can conduct single point FARP operations. The scope of flight operations in the FARP area
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                       223


should include, but not be limited to individual aircraft, sections, or divisions of aircraft requiring
refueling. The guidance in this section supplements the procedures in TO 00-25-172, Ground
Servicing and Static Grounding/Bonding; TO 37A9-7-2-1, Operations Maintenance and
Illustrated Parts Breakdown FAM Cart; AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations;
and AFFTP 3-3.HC/MC-130. All guidance and restrictions applicable to Hot Refueling are
applicable to FARP, unless stated otherwise in this AFI or other referenced publications.
Deviations from the procedures contained in this chapter must be approved by MAJCOM/A3.
   17.12.1. ACC Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) is a tactical aircraft-to-aircraft ground
   refueling operation that can be performed by HC-130 with engines running to a fixed-/rotary-
   wing aircraft or fuel bladders/vehicles. FARP may be used to extend the combat radius/loiter
   time of receiver aircraft. FARP is normally conducted at night in austere environments with
   engines running and includes fuel transfer from aircraft wing/Benson tanks through the
   single-point refueling panel to receiver fixed or rotary-wing aircraft single point refueling
   panel (if applicable). All equipment and personnel required to set-up the FARP site are
   assigned to the tanker aircraft.
   17.12.2. Ensure the FARP site is approved IAW AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point
   Operations, and meets the requirements of TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing and Static
   Grounding/Bonding.
   17.12.3. Ensure fire protection equipment is available IAW AFI 11-235 and meets the
   requirements of TO 00-25-172.
   17.12.4. Ensure all Air Force personnel involved are trained IAW appropriate command
   directives.
   17.12.5. Maintenance of FARP Equipment for ACC Units. Refer to AFI 11-235 and
   T.O. 37A9-7-2-1.
17.13. FARP Crew Complement. Only certified and current crewmembers will occupy a
primary crew position during FARP operations. Exception: Crewmembers in training under the
supervision of a current and qualified instructor. Normally these missions will be conducted
with a NVG tactical/operational crew. The minimum crew required to deploy and operate a
FARP will be as follows:
   17.13.1. Pilot – 2 (only the AC is required to be FARP certified)
   17.13.2. Flight engineer – 1
   17.13.3. Navigator – 1
   17.13.4. Hot Refueling Supervisor (Loadmaster) – 1
   17.13.5. Panel Operator (Loadmaster) 1
   17.13.6. Hose Deployment Personnel (AMSS/ Loadmaster) - one per refueling point
17.14. Crew Duties and Responsibilities. NOTE: The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will
remain on the flight deck in the event of an emergency taxi, i.e. moving the aircraft. Attachment
2 of this chapter details the specific procedures for hose deployment and FARP site set-up.
   17.14.1. Aircraft Commander (AC). The aircraft commander is responsible for the overall
   crew and safe accomplishment of FARP operations.
224                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   17.14.2. Hose Deployment Personnel (HDP). Properly trained Aircrew AMSS (1A3XX)
   or Loadmasters (1A2XX) will perform HDP in lieu of Air Force fuels personnel (AFSC
   2FOXl) and will be include d in the FARP to deploy/redeploy fuel hoses. Minimum HDPs
   will be one person for each receiver point. The personnel designated as HDPs will deploy
   hoses from the aircraft and set up the refueling points. *WARNING: HDPs will not be used
   to marshal aircraft. NOTE: For the HC-130 to conduct FARP operations without an HDP
   trained USAF fuels personnel (AFSC 2FOXI) as part of the crew compliment, the receiver
   aircraft must deplane a crew member to connect the refueling nozzle and refuel the aircraft.
   LM and AMSS certified as HDP are not authorized to perform these duties.
   17.14.3. Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) Duties:
      17.14.3.1. The HRS is responsible for supervising fuel servicing operations.
      17.14.3.2. Ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures.
      17.14.3.3. Has a thorough knowledge of all equipment and systems and how they
      operate. HRS will also be PO certified.

      17.14.3.5. Has a thorough knowledge of and follows the sequential steps for each
      operation.
      17.14.3.6. The HRS will brief who will operate the ramp and door, paratroop door, and
      canary slides/ground loading ramps. The HRS, upon landing and after clearance from the
      pilot, will open the cargo ramp and door to 12 inches above horizontal position. Upon
      clearance from the pilot to offload the HRS will lower the cargo ramp to the ground. The
      HRS will exit the aircraft through the ramp and door to perform the hot brake /hung flare
      checks and to clear personnel off the aircraft to establish the FARP site. NOTE: During
      hose deployment, the HRS will assist the HDP deploying the hoses.
      17.14.3.7. Instructs the PO when to dispense or shutoff fuel flow by interphone or hand
      signals, monitors for fuel leaks and periodically scans the tanker wings. The HRS will be
      positioned so as to have an unobstructed view of the entire operation.
      17.14.3.8. In the event of a hazardous situation/emergency, the HRS will immediately
      inform the pilot and advise the crew on recommended course of action.
      17.14.3.9. The HRS assists with the tear down of the FARP equipment upon completion,
      the PO will assumes primary interphone contact.
   17.14.4. Panel Operator (PO) (Tanker operations) duties:
      17.14.4.1. Will operate the SPR panel. The flight engineer will control the fuel
      distribution by use of dump pumps. The PO will also be HRS qualified.
      17.14.4.2. The PO will open the right paratroop door.
      17.14.4.3. The PO will position an inter-phone cord near the right paratroop door.
      17.14.4.4. Upon clearance from the HRS, the PO and HDP will exit the aircraft and
      deploy the tanker end of the refueling hose towards the SPR panel. WARNING:
      Bonding will be accomplished by inserting the bonding plug from the refueling nozzle
      into the aircraft‘s external receptacle prior to any other action.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                  225


       17.14.4.5. The PO connects the SPR nozzle to the SPR receptacle IAW applicable
       directives, and monitors the refueling hose to prevent HDP from possibly damaging the
       hose/connector. Once hose layout is complete, position fire extinguisher and water
       container next to the SPR panel. The PO connects to the prepositioned inter-phone cord.
       17.14.4.6. The right paratroop door will remain open during hot refueling operations.
       CAUTION: In the event the aircraft must depart immediately, the PO will shut down the
       SPR panel using the offload valve only and disconnect the SPR nozzle.
       17.14.4.7. Perform leak check at SPR panel.
       17.14.4.8. The PO assumes primary interphone contact when the HRS assists the HDPs
       in evacuating hoses/tear down.
       17.14.4.9. To drain the residual fuel from the refueling hoses, pressure will be relieved
       from the refueling hose IAW applicable directives.
       17.14.4.10. Setup the SPR panel IAW applicable directives. EXCEPTION: On UARRSI
       modified aircraft the FE will control the SPR drain pump.
       17.14.4.11. After all hoses have been rolled/stowed to the low (suction) side of the
       pump, turn the pump off and disconnect the hose. The 10‘ section can be evacuated by
       use of the SPR drain pump and holding the hose over head. Some residual fuel will
       remain in this section of hose. The PO turns off the refueling panel and disconnects the
       SPR nozzle IAW applicable directives.
       17.14.4.12. Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are aboard.
17.15. Hose Deployment from FARP sled or Aircraft Floor/Ramp. WARNING: Refueling
hoses will only be pulled from over the shoulder while running/walking forward, not backwards.
CAUTION: While deploying hoses, after sufficient resistance is met, lay down hoses and return
to the aircraft for another length. Repeat this step as necessary until positioning is complete.
Minimize the dragging of connections/valves to prevent damage.
   17.15.1. HDP/HRSs will walk the length of the hoses back to the aircraft checking for kinks,
   twists, and dry break positions.
   17.15.2. After walking the hoses, the HDPs will notify the HRS with a thumbs up signal that
   the line check is complete. HDPs will return to the aircraft for the fire extinguishers and
   water containers and return to the refueling nozzle end. Position a fire extinguisher at the
   refueling point. Position water canister at 200‘ dry break connection. The HDP will wait for
   fuel pressurization to the points.
   17.15.3. When the hoses are pressurized, perform leak check.
   17.15.4. HDPs will remain at the refueling point to act as fire guard after passing the
   refueling nozzle to the receiver crewmember. WARNING: HDPs will not be used to
   marshal aircraft IAW AFI 11-235. WARNING: Bonding will be accomplished by inserting
   the bonding plug from the refueling nozzle into the aircraft‘s external receptacle prior to any
   other action.
   17.15.5. After the completion of FARP, the HDPs will position themselves at the refueling
   point to drain the hose. Stretch hoses to their full length, starting at the receiver SPR/CCR
   nozzle, and attach the squeegee, to squeegee that segment of hose. After squeeging the length
226                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


   of hose and reaching a connection, evacuate fuel from hose by briefly opening the valve, then
   close both sides of the valve and disconnect hose. Install dust caps. Stow/Roll that segment
   of hose. Repeat steps for each section of hose. Return hoses to the FARP sled or aircraft
   floor. NOTE: Squeegees should be used to drain hoses. When squeegees are not available,
   walking and rolling the hoses will suffice as an alternate method of draining. This alternate
   method will leave more residual fuel in the hoses and will increase tear down time. When
   reaching the fittings, raise the hose and let fuel drain from the fitting into the next hose, close
   both valves while in raised position.
   17.15.6. Two personnel are required to drain each section of hose. One installs and pulls the
   squeegee, and the other holds the hose. The person holding the hose will then start rolling the
   hose.
17.16. Typical Single Point FARP Configuration. The single point FARP set-up will be
configured on the aircraft ramp for ease and rapid deployment. Required support/safety
equipment will be configured near the right paratroop door for convenient access by the PO. See
Figures 1.1 and 1.2 for typical set-up. NOTE: FARP equipment weights are contained in AFI
11-2HC-130V3, Addenda A.

airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. The permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e., number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. Aircraft commanders are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the
customs inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be
imposed on the aircraft commander for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)

will have completed briefing and aircraft preflight inspection prior to station time. Normally,
station time will be 30 minutes prior to takeoff time.
Station Time (Airborne)—A specified time when parachutists will be seated in the aircraft with
seat belts fastened. This time normally will be 5 minutes prior to Air Force station time.
Suitable Airfield—Normally, suitable airfields are those which meet weather, fuel, and runway
(Chapter 6) requirements and are within 50 NM of flight plan course centerline.
Tactical Control (TACON)—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or
commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                 239

                               RELEASE POINT CHECKLIST

                    LOADMASTER PERSONNEL / EQUIPMENT AIRDROP

NOTE: Standard safety precautions apply when conducting airdrops. Keep working area clear,
monitor interphone cords to prevent entanglement, and secure loose objects, etc. If
requested/prebriefed, observe jumpers exit and assist jumpmaster/jumper as required. If
requested by the jumpmaster during high altitude MFF airdrops, the navigator will state ―15
seconds‖ when fifteen seconds prior to arrival at the release point. Five seconds prior to arrival
at the release point, the navigator will state "5 Seconds.‖ If all preceding checks are not
complete by the "5 Seconds" call, a "No Drop" will be called.

1. "GREEN LIGHT"                                                            (N)

WARNING: No person will be aft of the package during gate cut and deployment. If the CRL
exists the aircraft, but fails to properly deploy (hangs up), the static lines will be cut immediately.

CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free
through floor tiedown rings.

NOTE: This signals that they are clear to follow the load. When jumpers use freefall
parachutes, they will not deploy until after the loadmaster retrieves the CRL static
lines/parachute D-bags. It may take up to 20 seconds for all equipment and personnel to exit the
aircraft.

NOTE: If the load dropped does not have a gate, omit the ―Gate Released‖ call.

                    LOADMASTER PERSONNEL / EQUIPMENT AIRDROP

NOTE: This checklist will be initiated at the "Red Light" or "No Drop" call.

1. Static Line(s) – Retrieved/Cut

CAUTION: Before retrieving static lines, allow a few seconds for the lines to wrap together.

NOTE: An immediate turn after ―Load Clear‖ may cause static lines to become entangled on the
side of the aircraft.

2. Aft Anchor Cable Support(s) – Raised (As required)

3. Restraint Shuttle (Some airplanes) – Positioned

WARNING: The shuttle must be moved forward of the center anchor cable support before

WARNING: The loadmasters will ensure that the life line is attached to a point that will
preclude exiting the aircraft, prior to proceeding aft to operate the cargo door and ramp controls.

CAUTION: The loadmaster will close the cargo door and ramp from the aft control panel as
soon as the area is clear of all obstructions.

NOTE: Visually check the ramp and door locks after closing.

5. Drop Checks - "COMPLETE"                                                  (LM)(E)

NOTE: Loadmasters will run the AIRDROP CLEANUP Checklist immediately following
completion of this checklist.
A2.5. Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures. During combat, cut static lines which cannot
be retrieved. On other than combat missions, if the static line retriever fails during retrieval and
more than 10 static lines are to be retrieved from the paratroop door, manually retrieve the static
lines by using a 5,000 lb tie-down strap.
   A2.5.1. Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures (Paratroop Door)
   1. Secure the hook end to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to permit static
lines to enter completely into the aircraft.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                    257


  2. Insert the other end of the strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines.

  3. Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft. Loadmasters may require
assistance to pull the strap forward.
   A2.5.2. Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures (Ramp and Door)
NOTE: If the static line retriever fails following a combination/tailgate drop, use the following
procedures using the Prusik Knot:

Figure A2.1. Prusik Knot.




1. Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop. Loop the cord
around the static line retriever winch cable. Use a minimum of three wraps around the retriever
cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.
2. Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping. Attach the hook
end of a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap into the loop‘s end and pull in the static lines. The 1/2-inch
tubular nylon cord will remain locked in place under tension.
3. More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable using the
Prusik Knot to facilitate static line retrieval. The Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the
cable as required. The knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly with a minimum of three
turns (more wraps equal more friction), and tension is applied.
4. To prevent cutting the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord with the hook on the 5,000 lb. tie-down
strap, a carabineer may be attached to the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached
to carabineer.
A2.6. Fouled/Towed Parachutist Procedures.
   A2.6.1. General.
258                                                            AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


       A2.6.1.1. If the parachutist is fouled during a paratroop door exit, the first priority is to
       retrieve, whether the parachutist is conscious or unconscious. If the parachutist cannot be
       retrieved and indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be cut free.
       A2.6.1.2. For a ramp exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist
       indicates consciousness. If the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be
       observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency
       retrieval procedures.
WARNING: There is not an effective or consistently reliable means to manually retrieve a
fouled parachutist from either the paratroop door or ramp and door. Manual retrieval techniques
will vary, depending upon the scenario, and should be exercised with extreme caution.
       A2.6.1.3. Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist, the pilot should lower the landing
gear and configure the aircraft flap setting to 100 percent flaps (paratroop door exits only).

WARNING: If a parachutist becomes fouled during missions when the aircraft is operating with
a high gross weight or is flying in a high density altitude environment, the pilot may elect to
maintain flaps at 50 percent, landing gear up, and slow to Minimum Operating Speed (MOS) in
lieu of the standard procedure.

NOTE: Compute MOS using power off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degrees of
bank plus 5 knots. This information will be posted on the operational data form prior to all static
line paratroop door
deployments.
       A2.6.1.4. The pilot maintains at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type
       parachute
being used, and avoids flying over or upwind of water or built up areas. EXCEPTION:
If the parachutist is equipped for a water drop, the pilot should avoid flying over land.

CAUTION: If possible, the pilot will avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the fouled
parachutist. Turning into the parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and
poses an increased possibility of injury.
   A2.6.2. Fouled        Parachutist       Checklist. FOULED/TOWED                PARACHUTIST
   CHECKLIST
1. Jumpmaster Notified – To stop remaining parachutists

2. Pilot Notified – "FOULED/TOWED PARACHUTIST‖                                (LM)

3. Red/NVG Airdrop Caution Lights – Confirmed on

4. Parachutists Condition – ―PARACHUTIST RELEASED‖ OR "INDICATES
 CONSCIOUS / UNCONSCIOUS"                        (LM)

NOTE: The jumpmaster/safety observer is responsible for watching the fouled parachutist to
determine how the parachutist is entangled. If being towed by anything other than the static line,
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                      259


the jumpmaster or safety will attempt to free the parachutist. If being towed by the static line,
the jumpmaster/ safety observer will recommend to the pilot, through the loadmaster, whether to
retrieve or cut the parachutist free. If all parachutists have exited and there is no safety on board,
this responsibility rests with the loadmaster. The pilot makes the final decision whether to
retrieve or cut the parachutist free. The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist‘s
static line on the pilot‘s command.

NOTE: The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that a reserve parachute is ready by
maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve.

5. [Paratroop Door Only] Static Line – Cut on pilot's command or Retrieve Parachutist

  a. If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, implement emergency retrieval procedures.

       (1) TRPS/5,000 pound tiedown strap – Installed

       (2) Jump platforms – Folded in

        (3) Retrieve parachutist

WARNING: During retrieval, all possible action will be taken to ensure that the parachutist does
not slip back at anytime. This does not preclude unwinding the retriever to reset the slip clutch id
necessary. All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and the line of travel of the
static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved to the door area.

NOTE: It may be necessary to stop retrieval to manually pull the D-bags through the retriever
assist strap (RAS) or over the 5,000 pound tiedown strap.

NOTE: Once the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled, slightly unwind the
retriever so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. The jump platform may be extended
once the parachutist is in the door area.

6. [Ramp and Door Only] Static Line – Cut on pilot's command or Retrieve Parachutist

NOTE: It may be necessary to partially rewind the retriever cable to reach the static line for
cutting.

  a. If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, implement emergency retrieval procedures.

CAUTION: If the parachutist is oscillating, stop the retriever momentarily until the parachutist
is stabilized, then continue retrieval. Repeat stopping as necessary.

       (1) Strap – Installed

       (2) Retrieve parachutist

7. Status of Parachutist – ―RELEASED/RETRIEVED‖                               (LM)

8. ―MALFUNCTION CHECKLIST COMPLETE‖                                             (LM)

9. Perform Completion of Drop Checklist
    A2.6.3. Paratroop Door Emergency Parachutist Retrieval Procedures. NOTES:
There are three methods of retrieval for towed parachutist from the left/right paratroop door of
the HC/MC-130 aircraft. The primary retrieval is the Towed Paratrooper Retrieval System
(TPRS). The secondary method is with the paratroop retrieval bar for aircraft equipped with this
system. The third method is to rig a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap in the paratroop door prior to
retrieval.

The maximum allowable weight for a towed paratrooper, without the TPRS, for paratroop door
exit is 250 pounds. The limit is 400 pounds when utilizing TPRS (does not apply to combat or
actual contingency missions). Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions.
Use of the Retrieval Sling Assembly without the roller assembly is authorized for retrieving
static lines only. The Retrieval Sling Assembly together with the Roller Assembly will be used
for retrieval of a towed parachutist.
        A2.6.3.1. Towed Parachutist Retrieval System (TPRS): 1. Install retriever assist
        strap (RAS/roller system) around static line(s) under retriever sling assembly ensuring
        quick-snap fittings are re-connected between "A" frame center anchor cable support and
        anchor cable stop at FS 770 on outboard anchor cable.
  2. Install retriever sling assembly around parachutist static line(s) and pull sling loop tight
with retrieval sling hook.

  3. Fold in jump platform and initiate retrieval.

        a. If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the static line
retriever winch, engage static line retriever winch until it slips. If the retriever clutch slips prior
to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove the cause of the
overload, slightly unwind the static line retriever winch to reset the winch‘s slip clutch, and
continue retrieval operation.

WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not
slip back at any time. This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip
clutch, if necessary.

      b. Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass through
the RAS.

  4. As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close
and secure paratroop door.

        a. If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner
of the paratroop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS.
The primary loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip. The secondary
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                      261


loadmaster (if available) or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes D-bags through
the RAS.

WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the
static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.

       b. After D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough
forward so as not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.

       c. As the parachutist is pulled up to the paratroop door, swing parachutist into the aircraft
by hand, close and lock paratroop door.

  5. After retrieving the parachutist, reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the landing gear, and
accomplish the completion of drop checklist.
       A2.6.3.2. Paratroop Retrieval Bar: 1. Install the parachutist retrieval bar in the
       paratroop door. One end of the bar is inserted in the retaining bracket on the aft portion of
       the door frame. The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and inserted on the
       forward portion on the door frame.
  2. Fold in the jump platform.

  3. Using the static line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the bar.

  4. The loadmaster initiates retrieval using the static line retriever winch.

WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not
slip back at any time. This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip
clutch, if necessary.

       a. Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass over the
paratroop retrieval bar.

  5. As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand.

        a. If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner
of the paratroop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the opening
between the retrieval bar and the paratroop door. The primary loadmaster maintains control of
the static line retriever pistol grip. The secondary loadmaster (if available) or safety
observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes the D-bags through the opening.

WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the
static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.
Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as
not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.

NOTE: When the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster/safety
observer/jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the static line
so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.

    6. After retrieving the parachutist accomplish the completion of drop checklist.
         A2.6.3.3. 5,000 lb. Tie-down Strap:
    1. The loadmaster folds the jump platform in.

   2. Install a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap across the paratroop door by threading the hook end of the
strap behind the one-inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door under all static lines,
and behind the one-inch tubular brace at FS 700. Secure the hook end of the tie-down strap to a
tie-down ring forward of FS 700 and ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring aft of FS 737.
Remove as much slack as possible.

WARNING: Use extreme caution when routing 5,000 lb. strap over the oxygen regulators
located at FS 740 left and right side.

  3. Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional slack in the tie-
down strap by using the ratchet.

    4. Follow the procedures as indicated in the paratroop retrieval bar method starting with Step
3
     A2.6.4. [Cargo     Ramp    and   Door]    Emergency      Parachutist    Retrieval
     Procedures. WARNING: The maximum weight of parachutists dropped off the ramp
     during training is 325 pounds. Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight
     restrictions.
NOTE: It will be necessary to partially retrieve the static line with the static line retriever to
reach the line for cutting. If the parachutist does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition
exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures.
         A2.6.4.1. Aircraft Not Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings: 1. Thread the
         hook end of a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap, front to rear, around the right vertical support
         member at FS 840 approximately 5 1/2 feet above the ramp in the ADS position.
    2. Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut.

  3. Run the ratchet end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the left
vertical -support member at FS 840.

   4. Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring
forward of FS 840. Ratchet the strap until taut.

  5. Using the static line retriever retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is
pulled up to the ramp, bring parachutist into the aircraft by hand under the strap.
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                        263


WARNING: The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist. A wildly oscillating
parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first. If the parachutist is oscillating violently,
it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize,
then continue with the retrieval. Repeat these stops continually, if required.

NOTE: After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the
jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension
on the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.

  6. After retrieving the parachutist, accomplish the completion of drop checklist.

CAUTION: For aircraft equipped with ramp air deflectors, after the jumper has been
successfully retrieved and secured, remove the 5000 pound strap prior to closing the aft cargo
door and ramp. Failure to do so will cause the ramp air deflectors to contact the strap causing
damage to the aircraft or the strap to break.
        A2.6.4.2. Aircraft Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tie-down Rings: 1. Attach hook
        end of the pre-positioned 5,000-pound tie-down strap facing forward to the tie-down ring
        on the side of the aircraft from which the parachutist is being towed. Attach the ratchet
        end of the tie-down strap to the opposite tie-down ring and ratchet until two turns of
        webbing are around the spindle and strap is taut.
  2. Emergency retrieval tie-down strap will be pre-measured and excess taped prior to takeoff.
S-fold the excess strap and tape near the ratchet end of the strap with pressure-sensitive tape.
Pre-measure strap so with both ends connected to the tie-down rings and two wraps around the
spindle, the excess strap remains securely taped. Pre-position strap so that it is accessible if
needed prior to take-off.

  3. Using the static-line retriever retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is
pulled up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand underneath the strap.

WARNING: The last five feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist. A wildly
oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first. If the parachutist is oscillating
violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to
stabilize, then continue with the retrieval. Repeat these stops continually, if required.

NOTE: After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the
jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension
in the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.

NOTES:

The pilot will initiate this checklist by briefing the pattern and delivery to be flown.

If the Pre-Search/Deployment Checklist has already been accomplished and the aircraft
configuration will not be changed for the delivery pattern, e.g., flap settings and/or doors, rescue
equipment drops can commence immediately.

On each pattern flown, the pilot should call downwind, turning base, turning final, and the type
of deployment pattern being flown (e.g. ―Turning base for MA-1 kit,‖ ―Turning final for
parabundle‖). The loadmaster will acknowledge the pilot‘s calls for situational awareness and
crew coordination.

This checklist will be used for jumpmaster directed (JMD) airdrops and pararescue deployment
(PJD)/equipment airdrops utilizing the fixed, moving, and crosswind target patterns. The pilot
will initiate this checklist by calling for the "Personnel Deployment Checklist."


No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster
access to the door to begin "spotting procedures." When the jumpmaster is off interphone, the
loadmaster will relay all visual corrections given by the jumpmaster to the pilot. The
jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door; however, the aircraft ramp and
paratroop door(s) will not be opened simultaneously during personnel airdrops.

4. "CREW, ONE-MINUTE WARNING"                                                (P)
WARNING: If any crewmember calls "No Drop" after the "One Minute Warning" call, no
deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist will be re-initiated. Upon
hearing a "No Drop" call, the pilot not flying will turn the red light on and, along with the
loadmaster, acknowledge the "No Drop." For a RAMZ/ATV bundle "No Drop," avoid abrupt
maneuvers and make all turns as level as possible as the equipment is restrained by the release
gate only at this point.

5. "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"                                                  (LM/JM)
NOTE: Pararescuemen or jumpmaster will run their Safety Checks; the loadmaster is
responsible for accomplishing all other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo
compartment. When either the loadmaster or jumpmaster responds "Safety Check Complete,"
this indicates that both the personnel/ equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed
on all jumpers exiting on this pass.

6. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                           (P)
NOTE: When the pilot responds "Clear To Jump," this indicates that all conditions are favorable
for personnel deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point.

7. Green Light – "ON"                                                        (P/CP)
NOTE: The pilot not flying will turn on the green light. Perform this step for live passes only.
For streamer/spotter or observations, leave the red light turned on.

8. Fly streamer to Target (As required)                                      (P)
NOTE: When using PJ JMD Fixed or Moving Target Patterns, make minor heading changes to
pass over spotter chute and the target on a direct line. Establish Drift Correction Prior to passing
over the Spotter Chute. The JM will reverse count over the target.

9. Fly JM Directed Course (As required)                                        (P)

10. Release jumpers and/or equipment                                           (JM)
NOTES:

At the completion of the reverse count (PJ fixed or moving target pattern only) or when the
aircraft is in a direct line with the target and spotter chute (PJ crosswind target pattern drop), the
jumpmaster will release the jumpers and/or equipment.

       (5) Buddy Checks – Complete

WARNING: The "High Altitude Checks" will initially be called "Complete" during the Pre-
search/Pre-Deployment Checklist and prior to reaching a cabin altitude of 10,000 feet. The
checks will be silently re-accomplished every 5,000 feet above a 10,000-foot cabin altitude.
When above 20,000-foot cabin altitude, accomplish this check every 15 minutes. Above 30,000
feet, accomplish every 5 minutes.

NOTE: If an oxygen console is used, the loadmaster(s) will be stationed aft of it to perform in-
flight duties. The Physiology Technician (PT) will be on interphone and normally forward of the
oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight duties. This arrangement will provide a buddy
system to check everyone on oxygen. Loadmasters and physiological crewmembers will brief
verbal and visual signals that will be used throughout the mission.

NOTE: If climbing above 10,000 feet MSL, all personnel will don their helmet, mask, and set
oxygen regulators to 100 percent. Parachutists may operate without the supplemental oxygen
during unpressurized flight up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet
MSL does not exceed 30 minutes per sortie. Under circumstances other than these, jumpers will
use supplemental oxygen. When supplemental oxygen is required for parachutists, a check of
the oxygen console, connections, pressure, and quantity is required. The loadmaster will confirm
that the cargo compartment crewmembers have completed this action by receiving a thumb up
indication from each person.

22. Red Lights – On/Checked (Personnel Deployment Only)

23. Bundle Restraint Straps – Removed

CAUTION: The loadmaster will be positioned to remove aft restraint and to observe equipment
and jumpers at all times.

NOTE: Forward restraint strap may remain in place until the ramp is in the ADS position.

NOTE: If an extended search is conducted with the ramp in the ADS position, the aft restraint
strap may remain installed until the Equipment Deployment Checklist is initiated.

24. Air Deflectors (As required) – "OPEN"                                 (P/CP)

NOTE: Once air deflectors are called open by the pilot or copilot, this automatically clears the
loadmaster to open the paratroop door(s).

25. ―PARATROOP DOOR(S), OPEN AND LOCKED‖ (As required) (LM)

WARNING: If an air deflector door fails to open, do not open the respective paratroop door.
Notify the pilot of the problem.
288                                                          AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007


WARNING: Under no circumstances will a paratroop door and the ramp and door be open at
the same time when parachutists are involved. If the bundle/equipment dropped from the ramp
requires spotting procedures from an open paratroop door, ensure life lines are properly adjusted
for both exits.

NOTE: The loadmaster will ensure all personnel are aware the doors are going to be opened.

WARNING: Paratroop doors will be opened only by the loadmaster(s). After opening and
locking, the safety pin will be installed.

WARNING: Any time the paratroop doors are lowered, the jump platform will be retracted and
the door lowered completely.

26. Ramp and Door (As Required) –

  a. "CLEAR TO OPEN"                                                        (P)(LM)

  b. "OPENED AND LOCKED"                                                    (LM)

  c. "INDICATES OPEN"                                                       (E)

WARNING: If the cargo door and ramp fail to operate normally or when mission dictates, the
loadmaster may operate them from the aft control panel upon clearance from the pilot. Ensure
the restraint harness life-line is attached to a point to preclude exiting the aircraft prior to
proceeding aft to operate the cargo door and ramp controls.

CAUTION: Ensure the aft anchor cable supports are raised and the cargo door and ramp area is
clear prior to giving the "Clear To Open" call.

NOTES:

The loadmaster will ensure all personnel are aware the doors are going to be opened.

The flight engineer will open the ramp and door at 150 KIAS after receiving clearance to open
from the loadmaster and will report "Indicates Open" when the door and ramp light illuminate.

During tailgate exits, all parachutists with the exception of the jumpmaster will remain forward
of the ramp hinge until the One-Minute Warning.

27. Anchor Cable Support(s) – Lowered (As required)

WARNING: Remove the anchor cable from retaining clips and do not secure the anchor cable in
the center anchor cable support for personnel/RAMZ/ATV/Container Ramp Load (CRL) tailgate

WARNING: [Paratroop door exits] Loadmasters will not position themselves under the center
anchor cable support.

WARNING: Parachutist are cleared to line up along side of the forward most CRL but will not
move aft of FS 737 or the forward load static line, whichever is more restrictive. For floor
loaded CRL, parachutist will not move aft until the load crosses FS 737 on exit.

NOTE: All parachutists with the exception of the jumpmaster/safety will remain forward of the
ramp hinge until after the One-Minute Warning.

29. Pre-Search/Deployment Checks – "COMPLETE"                                  (LM)(E)

WARNING: If the drop is aborted after completion of the Pre-Deployment Checks, the
loadmaster will ensure the aft anchor cable supports are raised prior to requesting the closure of
the ramp and door.

NOTE: Jumpers may move aft of the ramp hinge at jumpmasters discretion after the one-minute
warning is called.

4. Load Release Gate – Checked

5. Aft Restraint – Removed (As required)

WARNING: Upon hearing a "No Drop" call, the pilot not flying will turn the red light on and,
along with the loadmaster, acknowledge the "No Drop." If the CRL is held in place by only the
release gate strap, all personnel on the cargo ramp will move forward of forward most load,
except the loadmaster and jumpmaster who will monitor the CRL for possible shifting and secure
as necessary.

6. "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"                                                (LM/JM)

WARNING: Jumpmasters will run their Safety Checklist. The loadmaster is responsible for
accomplishing all other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo compartment.
When either the loadmaster or jumpmaster responds "Safety Check Complete," this indicates that
both the personnel/equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed on all jumpers
exiting on this pass.

WARNING: Each jumper will be responsible for monitoring their own static line.
(EXCEPTION: The loadmaster will hold the jumpmaster‘s static line if the jumpmaster is
exiting from a paratroop door on this pass). The loadmaster will monitor the jumpmaster‘s static
line at all times unless preparing the CRL or equipment for deployment. Jumpmasters will
remove their reserve parachute and connect their static line clip to their parachute harness (the
static line will not be connected to the anchor cable) prior to spotting from the aft edge of the
ramp. An aircraft personnel restraint cable will be connected to D-ring on the jumpmaster‘s
parachute.

WARNING: During paratroop door static line drops, personnel will not position themselves
directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737). Personnel in the cargo
compartment during tailgate drops will not position themselves below the static line retriever
cable while the cargo ramp and door are open.

7. "CLEAR TO JUMP"                                                         (P)
AFI11-2HC-130V3 30 JUNE 2007                                                                     291



NOTES: After hearing "Clear to Jump", the loadmaster will alert the jumpmaster and relay all
visual corrections given by the jumpmaster to the pilot. The pilot not flying will turn on the
green light.

WARNING: When the pilot responds "Clear to Jump," this indicates that all conditions are
favorable for personnel deployment. If any crewmember calls "NO DROP" after the "One-
Minute Warning" call, no deployment will be made and the deployment phase of the checklist
will be reinitiated.

8. Green Light – "ON"                                                         (P)

9. ―GATE RELEASED‖ (or state condition) (As required)                         (LM)

WARNING: Before cutting the gate, the loadmaster will ensure the jumpmaster has moved
forward of the CRL package. No person will be aft of the package during gate cut and
deployment. If the CRL exists the aircraft, but fails to properly deploy (hangs up), the static lines
will be cut immediately.

CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free
through floor tiedown rings.

NOTE: The jumpmaster will signal the loadmaster to cut the release gate strap. If jumpers are
tailgating, this signals that they are clear to follow the load. When jumpers use freefall
parachutes, they will not deploy until after the loadmaster retrieves the CRL static
lines/parachute D-bags. It may take up to 20 seconds for all equipment and personnel to exit the
aircraft.

10. "LOAD CLEAR" (or state condition)                                         (LM)

11. "RED LIGHT"                                                               (N)

NOTE: The navigator will call for the red light to be turned on upon hearing the "LOAD
CLEAR" call or upon reaching the end of the usable DZ length.

12. ―ON‖                                                                      (P/CP)

13. Jumpmaster/Safety – Notify (If required)

NOTE: If personnel drops are complete or if the aircraft or door configuration will be changed,
the pilot will call for the POST-DEPLOYMENT Checklist. If additional drops are planned,
continue with the racetrack patterns and PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT Checklist. Deploy
additional jumpers using the drop heading and count established by the jumpmaster. Disregard
the spotter chute.

A2.21. FARP / Hot Refueling Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are not an
exact science. Common sense and sound judgment should prevail. However, crews should
follow guidelines during hot refueling operations. Remember that the LM, HRS and PO is the
eyes and ears of the crew during all hot refueling operations. Escape routes should be
established for each aircraft in the event of an emergency. The escape route should be depicted
on the hot refueling site survey and must be reviewed prior to the mission. Crews must monitor
radios to ensure they receive any evacuation call and must be ready to break radio silence and
notify other participants in the event they experience an emergency.
