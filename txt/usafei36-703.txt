This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-7, Employee and Labor
Management Relations. This instruction provides general guidelines for the rating of job
applicant qualifications when filling non-United States (US) citizen appropriated and non-
appropriated fund positions of US Air Forces or serviced organizations in Germany. It contains
general qualification standards and qualification standards for supervisory positions, leader and
foreman positions. It serves to implement basic requirements contained in the Collective Tariff
Agreement of 16 December 1966 for the Employees of the Sending States Forces in the Federal
Republic of Germany (CTA II), as amended. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
changes the title from Qualification Standards for Non-US Citizens in Germany to Qualification
Standards for Non-US Positions in Germany; it incorporates new definitions of and substantial
changes to the Education and Training (E&T) levels, experience, and other qualification
requirements, and updates information throughout the document.
1. Policy. Non-US positions are to be filled with competent applicants on the basis of their
2                                                      USAFEI 36-703 3 DECEMBER 2008

qualifications to perform the job in terms of education and training, as well as experience, skills
and abilities, and without regard to such factors as ethnic origin, sex, religion or world view,
disability, age or sexual identity.
2. Assessment of Qualification. To ensure a fair and consistent requirements level for similar
positions or groups of positions, qualification standards are to be applied as outlined in this
Instruction. The purpose of these qualification standards is to identify applicants who are likely
to perform successfully on the job and those who are unlikely to do so. The standards are
designed to determine an applicant’s minimum qualification for a particular position. They are
not intended to rank applicants, identify the best suitable candidate for the position to be filled, or
otherwise substitute for a careful analysis of an applicant’s knowledge, skills, and abilities.
USAFE Form 260, Record of Qualifications (NON-US) will be used to screen and document the
applicant’s qualification against the requirements of the position for which considered, and to
document deviations from standard qualification requirements. Qualification records of all
applicants will be filed in the job folder, prepared for each position announcement, and destroyed
when superseded, obsolete, or no longer needed. Upon appointment of an applicant to a specific
position, the respective USAFE Form 260 will be filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF).
Qualification records of employees under reduction-in-force (RIF) must be kept with all other
RIF documents in the active or inactive OPF or RIF-placement file.
3. Education and Training (E&T) Levels.
    3.1. Education and Training levels are patterned after the German education system. E&T
    levels appraise and define formal education and occupational training creditable as minimum
    qualification. Creditable E&T must have been completed successfully with an appropriate
    certificate or diploma. The following six E&T levels have been established:

     authority of the state (Land) where the applicant is residing.

   CTA II does not specifically prescribe qualification requirements (paragraph 6.below).

Table 4.2. Pay Categories Experience Requirements.

    * Creditable experience is defined by pay categories as follows:

    Salary Schedule C-3 through C-5a: Creditable experience includes any type of work or
    activity of an applicant that has provided the basic knowledge, skills and abilities needed to
    successfully perform the major tasks of the position for which considered.

    Salary Schedule C-6 through C-7a: Creditable experience must reflect the particular
    knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the position and must be in the same or in a
    similar line of work as the job for which considered. The predominant experience must have
    been gained at a comparable level of difficulty to the position to be filled and must be
    directly related to the position.

    Salary Schedule C- 8 and above: Creditable experience is work at a high level of
    responsibility in a closely related professional field that is in the same line of work of the
    position to be filled. The experience must reflect in-depth technical knowledge, sound
    judgment, personal initiative, and the ability to make independent decisions.

    As a rule one year of creditable experience must have been gained at one level below the
    grade for which considered.

    Substitution of E&T Levels. For positions up to and including the C-7a level, E&T levels
    III and IV may be substituted by additional experience as follows:

    Level III: 2 years; applicant must meet E&T level II

    Level IV: 3 years, if applicant meets E&T level II, or 2 years if applicant meets E&T level III

    Substitution of the E&T level is not possible for positions at the C-8 level and above.


5. Specific Qualification Standards.
      5.1. Specific qualification standards establish particular education, training and experience
      requirements for positions in certain occupational series for which the general qualification
      standard is not likely to produce qualified candidates. These standards normally require
      higher E&T levels and, in most cases, job-related education and experience. Specific
      qualification standards may be developed locally as needed.
6. Qualification Requirements for Salary Positions Prescribed by CTA II.
      6.1. Salary schedules and positions identified below are subject to qualification requirements
      prescribed by the CTA II. Accordingly, qualification requirements in the CTA II must be
      used when appraising and rating an applicant’s qualification to fill positions subject to these
      schedules.
USAFEI 36-703 3 DECEMBER 2008                                                                     7
