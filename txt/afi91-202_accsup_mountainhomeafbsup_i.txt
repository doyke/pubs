                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. The Mishap Prevention Process. Air Force host and tenant safety offices are responsible
for implementing the Air Force Safety Program. Any interorganization and interservice
agreements will be addressed in the Host/Tenant Support Agreement. The host safety office
implements mishap prevention programs and processes for all Air Force units and programs on
base unless otherwise outlined in a Host/Tenant Support Agreement. Safety staffs at all levels
assist with implementation and integration of operational risk management into all Air Force
operations and missions.
1.2. Determining Standards. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals,
with the host safety office‘s help, identify rules, criteria, procedures, Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA), Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire
Protection, and Health (AFOSH), explosive safety, or other safety standards that could help
eliminate unsafe acts or conditions that cause mishaps.
1.3. Applying Standards. Applying sound standards is basic to preventing mishaps. All Air
Force units must apply standards by observing these fundamental principles:
1.3. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB)Applying Standards. Compliance with the 366 FW USR
Guide and all governing safety directives is mandatory for establishing a unit mishap prevention
program.
   1.3.1. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals must all contribute to
   the mishap prevention program. An effective program depends on individuals integrating
   mishap prevention at every functional level and being responsible for complying with
   applicable safety standards.
   1.3.2. Units must establish specific procedures (for example, inspections) to ensure that all
   personnel and activities comply with the program standards.
   1.3.3. Every level of command is responsible for compliance with applicable safety
   standards.
1.4. Hazard Controls:
   1.4.1. Identifying Hazards. The primary responsibility for identifying workplace hazards,
   to include equipment and environmental situations that place workers, equipment, or
   facilities at risk, rests with the individual. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors,
   and individuals identify hazards by evaluating the work environment and job tasks. Safety,
   environmental, and medical staffs and fire-protection personnel provide technical assistance.
   1.4.2. Determining Hazard Abatement Action. The proper way to eliminate a particular
   hazard is often difficult to determine, and alternatives are limited by time and cost. After
   considering all factors, choose the alternative that contributes the most to overall mission
   accomplishment. Consider these three categories of corrective actions:
       1.4.2.1. Planning and Engineering. Use risk management processes during the planning,
       design, and execution phases to eliminate hazards as early as possible when they will
 10              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


       have the least cost and operational impact on the program. Continually review plans,
       specifications, and drawings to identify and eliminate hazards until the equipment or
       facility is operating. Eliminate hazards identified after an item is deployed by modifying
       the item or installing protective devices or guards. The supervisor, with safety staff help,
       completes a job safety analysis (JSA) and operational hazard analysis (OHA) to ensure
       worker, equipment, and work environment compatibility. Procedures for JSA and OHA
       are contained in the Supervisors Safety Training (SST) handbooks, AFOSH Standard 91-
       31, Personal Protective Equipment, and AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and
       Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH).
       1.4.2.2. Procedural Actions. Develop procedures or restrictions to minimize risk if
       planning or engineering actions cannot be used to eliminate hazards. If necessary,
       impose restrictions such as operational limits, frequent inspections, protective equipment,
       or stopping the operation until corrective action is taken.
       1.4.2.3. Personnel Actions. People work more safely and effectively when properly
       trained and motivated. Supervisors must keep their people involved in risk management.
       AFI 91-213, Operational Risk Management, outlines the basic tenets and processes of
       risk management. Operational risk management is a systematic process of detecting,
       assessing and controlling measures to enhance total organizational performance.
   1.4.3. Taking Action. Commanders protect national resources, both human and material,
   and have the authority to take action in implementing safety measures.
       1.4.3.1. Functional managers correct hazards in their areas of responsibility.
       1.4.3.2. The safety office helps functional managers and commanders determine needed
       corrective actions and provide the commander with follow-up support until the hazard is
       eliminated or changes are in place.
1.5. Notifying Other Affected Units and Agencies. Relay hazard and mishap information to
other units and agencies with similar missions or equipment according to AFI 91-204,
Investigating and Reporting US Air Force Mishaps. AFI 91-204 and Chapter 4 and Chapter 5
of this instruction explain what information to relay and what communication systems to use.
Mishap prevention data is worthless unless people who need the information get it. No one
cannot afford to have mishaps caused by problems already known and solved by other units.
1.6. Program Responsibilities:
   1.6.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) makes policy and gives
   guidance to ensure that technical and engineering criteria for developing and acquiring Air
   Force systems, facilities, and equipment conform with OSHA, AFOSH, and explosive safety
   standards and other safety criteria.
   1.6.2. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower Reserve Affairs, Installations,
   and Environment) makes policy, approves policy, and gives guidance to ensure that Air
   Force programs and operations conform with OSHA, AFOSH, and explosive safety
   standards and other safety criteria.
   1.6.3. The Deputy Chief of Staff Installations and Logistics:
       1.6.3.1. Ensures that logistics and maintenance procedures, operations, and technical
       publications meet all safety standards and criteria.

  1.6.7. MAJCOM, FOA, NGB, and DRU commanders direct the development of programs
  that implement the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program that meet the needs of the
  organizations.
  1.6.7. (ACC) The diversity of ACC units makes it impractical to provide specific program
  guidance to every level of command. Except where noted, the contents of this supplement
  apply to organizations having an authorized primary duty safety function. Direct reporting
  units (DRUs), numbered air forces (NAFs), the primary subordinate unit (PSU), wings, and
  centers will decide the appropriate mishap prevention elements needed and publish defining
  guidance as required to have a viable safety program in geographically separated units
  (GSUs).

                                             Chapter 2

                                THE SAFETY ORGANIZATION

2.1. Safety Staff. One staff element should manage each organization's safety program. The
safety staff will perform and/or assists risk assessment of wing mission, contingency exercises,
and operations. In addition, the staff will review and help develop emergency plans and
procedures to include, but not limited to, SAFE HAVEN, SAFE CONVOY, HAZMAT and
disaster response required by AFI 32-4001 or AFI 32-4002, and when required by law (Clean Air
Act), or accidental release risk management programs for explosives. The chief of safety must
answer directly to the commander. Full-time safety personnel must be qualified, trained to
manage safety programs, and able to function at the staff level. Use the Air Force Manpower
Standard (AFMS) 106A to determine the required size of the safety staff. In units without an
authorized safety position, the commander must appoint a collateral duty safety individual to
perform the safety functions. All requests for manpower changes to safety office personnel will
be coordinated with the applicable MAJCOM/SE office before submission to the local
management engineering team. Do not assign full-time safety personnel additional duties that
are not directly associated with the job duties described in the 91-series directives and their
supplements.
2.1. (ACC)Safety Staff. In order to attain ACC goals in reducing mishaps, safety staffs must be
manned by highly qualified personnel who have displayed the highest degree of professionalism.
Primary duty safety personnel will not be assigned duties not directly associated with the job
elements described by AFI 91-202, as supplemented. Safety duty exposes personnel to a broad
spectrum of unit operations and support. As such, it is an exceptional mentoring tour of duty for
individuals on a leadership track. It is desirable to offer tours in safety, of fixed length, for those
officers and NCOs demonstrating superior performance and exceptional growth potential. Safety
is not a separate career field, except for enlisted and civilian ground safety personnel, but is an
extension of other functional areas. Failure to appoint a USR does not relieve the unit
commander of responsibility to comply with this directive. A copy of the appointment letter will
be provided to the wing, center, or group safety office, which will provide training to the
appointed USR.
   2.1.1. Chief of Safety. Supervises the mishap prevention program for the commander. The
   chief of safety must be qualified in the primary mission of the unit. Assigned individuals
   must complete the Chief of Safety Course (WCIP05B). For example, in units with an
   operational primary flying mission, the chief of safety must be a rated officer, qualified and
   current in a unit mission aircraft. In a space satellite control unit the chief of safety must
   have experience in the satellite operations.
   2.1.1. (ACC) The HQ ACC Chief of Safety and NAF/DRU Chief's of Safety will be rated
   officers with recent flying experience. The tour for officers assigned to chief of safety duty at
   wing or NAF/DRU level should be a maximum of 2 years. Chiefs of Safety for units with a
   flying operation and flight safety officers (FSOs) assigned to UMD FSO positions will be
   qualified in the Unit Equipped (UE) aircraft at the basic mission capable (BMC) level at a
   minimum. PSU organizations are exempt from this requirement. Wing, Center, and Group
   Chiefs of Safety must have demonstrated superior performance, exceptional growth potential,
   and possess outstanding managerial and leadership abilities. They must be currently on the
18             AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


  flying squadron commander‘s list, have been on the flying squadron commander‘s list at the
  time of appointment as Chief of Safety, or must have previously been a flying squadron
  commander. Wing commanders will request approval from COMACC through HQ ACC/SE
  and HQ ACC/DP for entry of officers who do not meet the above criteria. Chiefs of Safety
  should have a minimum on-station retainability of 18 months from date of selection. Advice
  on retainability should be obtained from HQ ACC/DPAO prior to making a selection. Chiefs
  of Safety will notify NAF/SE and HQ ACC/SE of new primary duty FSO assignment using
  e-mail or memorandum. The unit commander will indorse a letter of notification; e-mail
  notifications should reflect that the CC has personally approved the selection.
 2.1.2. Flight Safety Officer (FSO). Full-time FSOs are assigned to authorized unit
 positions by the AFMS. FSOs at squadron and wing level must be current in a unit mission
 aircraft. FSOs in higher headquarters positions should be rated officers with experience in
 headquarters-managed mission aircraft. Full-time FSOs must complete the Flight Safety
 Officer Course (WCIP05A) and should fill the position for a minimum of 2 to 3 years..
 Commanders of flying units without an authorized flight safety officer (FSO) will appoint a
 collateral duty FSO.
 2.1.2. (ACC) Flight Safety Officers (FSOs) at ACC and NAF headquarters will be rated
 officers with recent flight experience. In units with multi-place aircraft, either the Chief of
 Safety or the FSO must be a pilot. FSOs must possess a record reflecting exemplary flying
 skills and aptitude for proactive safety program management. Safety staff experience is a
 positive asset in the selection of officers as unit commanders. FSOs occupying wing unit
 manning document (UMD) positions will be rated officers on unconditional flying status and
 will maintain at least basic mission capable (BMC) status in the primary authorized aircraft
 (PAA) (rated as instructors in training wings). The majority of the time in this position
 should be spent performing safety duties. FSOs assigned to squadron safety UMD positions
 will be qualified in the unit-equipped (UE) aircraft at the combat mission ready (CMR) level
 or as an IP/IN for training squadrons. Officer performance reports should ensure that officers
 performing these duties obtain full recognition for their accomplishments. Squadron
 commanders should receive inputs from the Wing Chief of Safety for OPRs of squadron-
 assigned FSOs. Commanders should avoid frequent personnel turnover in the wing and
 squadron FSO positions. Advice on retainability may be obtained from HQ ACC/DPAR
 prior to making a selection. Unit commanders will notify NAF, PSU, and HQ ACC/SE of
 new Chief of Safety appointments using e-mail or memorandum.
     2.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) FSOs assigned to safety UMD positions at the wing and
     squadron level will attend the FSO (WCIPO5C) course and may attend the ACC Flight
     Safety Program Management (FSPM) course. Additional duty FSOs (ADFSOs) not in
     safety UMD positions should attend FSPM, and they may attend AMIC or the FSO
     course, if training slots are available. Attending this training will enable ADFSOs to
     assist squadron-assigned and wing FSOs, but receiving AMIC and FSPM does not
     qualify an individual to fill a safety UMD position at the wing or squadron level.
  2.1.3. Ground Safety Managers (GSM). Full-time GSMs are assigned to positions
  authorized by the AFMS. Assigned individuals must complete the Ground Safety
  Management Course (WCIP05D) and the Advanced Occupational Safety Course at the
  earliest opportunity after being assigned as a GSM.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                         19


   2.1.4. Weapons Safety Managers (WSM). The AFMS authorizes full-time Weapons
   Safety positions in units. WSMs must be qualified in their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
   or civil service equivalent in the maintenance or operation of nuclear weapons, missiles, or
   non-nuclear munitions. Full-time WSMs must complete the Air Education and Training
   Command (AETC) Weapons Safety Course. Persons selected as WSMs should be at least a
   7-level in their specialty code.
   2.1.4. (ACC)      Enlisted Wing Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) should be a senior NCO
   serving in the 2W or 2M career fields. The tour for WSM‘s should be at least two years. To
   meet the demands of AEF taskings for weapons safety, all weapons safety personnel should
   be worldwide deployable.
   2.1.5. System Safety Officers, Managers, and Engineers. Some commands and staff
   agencies are authorized system safety positions. Individuals in these positions must complete
   the System Safety Management Course or the System Safety Analysis Course according to
   their particular job requirements.
   2.1.6. Space Safety Personnel. Units performing orbital or launch missions are authorized
   space safety positions. These positions at squadron and wing level must be experienced in
   the unit‘s mission and be trained as outlined in Chapter 11.
   2.1.7. Flight Safety NCO (FSNCO). The FSNCO is an integral part of the flight safety
   program and reports directly to the chief of safety or FSO. The FSNCO must have
   maintenance or aircrew experience with the unit-assigned aircraft type or be a career safety
   person. Once appointed, individuals should complete the Flight Safety NCO and Jet Engine
   Mishap Investigation Courses.
   2.1.8. Career Safety Personnel. The Air Force has an enlisted career field (AFSC 1S0X1)
   and a civilian career field (GM/GS-018, Occupational Safety and Health Manager or
   Specialist, and GM/GS-803, Safety Engineer). These career safety personnel are assigned to
   positions authorized by the UMD. The enlisted safety career program is described in
   AFMAN 36-2108, Airman Classification. The civilian safety career program is described in
   AFI 36-601, Civilian Career Program Management. See Attachment 2 for the enlisted
   career program.
2.2. Organizing the Program. The same prevention techniques apply to all disciplines. In
organizing the safety staff:
   2.2.1. Ensure that safety staffs manage the mishap prevention program and report directly to
   the MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, or installation commander.
   2.2.2. Consolidate all safety disciplines under a single manager.
      2.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Flight Safety Organization. Flight safety functions will be
      organized as follows (not applicable to AWFC and PSU organizations):
          2.2.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Flight Safety Officers. It is desired that the wing Chief of
          Safety and FSO be qualified in different mission aircraft in units with more than one
          type aircraft. Each flying squadron will appoint a Squadron Assigned FSO (SAFSO)
          from existing squadron resources. Squadrons will request training quotas through
          wing safety as soon as individuals are identified to fill SAFSO positions. SAFSOs
          will not fill a wing UMD FSO position, but will assist the wing Chief of Flight Safety
20          AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


     in the overall management of the flight safety program. However, the primary duty of
     the SAFSO is to manage the squadron's internal flight safety program as directed by
     the Squadron Commander. Each squadron should attempt to appoint an Additional
     Duty FSO (ADFSO) to assist in managing the internal squadron flight safety program
     and to function in the absence of the SAFSO. Commanders may elect to designate an
     Additional Duty FSNCO (ADFSNCO), in lieu of ADFSO, if rated officer manning is
     insufficient. A person designated as a squadron ADFSNCO will be either a qualified
     crewmember or a maintainer. Units may use local discretion in using assigned
     SAFSOs and ADFSOs to ensure squadron and wing flight safety programs are
     effectively and efficiently managed. Using SAFSOs in roles other than those
     specified in this supplement will be approved in writing by the DRU/NAF Chief of
     Safety, as appropriate. Paragraph 2.1.2 of this supplement still applies. SAFSOs and
     ADFSOs will maintain CMR status in operational squadrons. SAFSOs will be rated
     by the assigned unit Squadron Commander. The wing Chief of Safety will provide
     periodic inputs to the squadron commander and may complete an AF Form 77,
     Supplemental Evaluation Sheet, to assist the squadron commander in completing a
     comprehensive officer performance report. SAFSOs will be required to support
     aircraft mishap investigations and will also be required to support their assigned
     squadron's TDYs and exercise deployments. All FSOs will be exempt from full-time
     additional duties not directly related to flying IAW AFI 11-MDS, Vol 1, Chapter 1,
     Aircrew Utilization Policy. Additionally, SAFSOs should not be assigned any of the
     following full-time flying related additional duties listed in that publication unless
     absolutely necessary and justified in writing to the NAF/DRU safety office (does not
     apply to ADFSOs):
        2.2.2.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Weapons and tactics officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Programmer.
        2.2.2.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Mobility/contingency plans officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) Training officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.5. (Added-ACC) Squadron standardization officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.6. (Added-ACC) Squadron life support officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.7. (Added-ACC) Intelligence officer.
        2.2.2.1.1.8. (Added-ACC) Electronic combat officer.
     2.2.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Flight Safety NCOs. Each wing and applicable PSU
     organization will have a flight safety NCO (FSNCO). FSNCOs will meet the skill and
     knowledge requirements of AFMAN 36-2108 and the STS/JQS appropriate for their
     AFSC. Proficiency training will be primarily obtained through attendance at local TD
     courses and OJT. The purpose of the FSNCO is to provide a source of maintenance
     expertise just as the FSO is a source of operational expertise. As for officers, this is a
     career mentoring position exposing the individual to the entire spectrum of flying
     operations, maintenance, and support. Suggested areas of utilization for the FSNCO
     include:
        2.2.2.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Liaison with maintenance flight safety function.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                              21


              2.2.2.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Investigating selected Class C mishaps as determined
              by the Chief of Safety or the Chief of Flight Safety and IAW AFI 91-204.
              2.2.2.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) Coordinating quality deficiency report program with
              QA.
              2.2.2.1.2.4. (Added-ACC) Coordinating the trend analysis program.
              2.2.2.1.2.5. (Added-ACC) Accompanying QA on annual inspections of logistics
              units.
              2.2.2.1.2.6. (Added-ACC) Assisting in annual and spot inspections.
              2.2.2.1.2.7. (Added-ACC) Monitoring areas listed in AFI 91-202, paragraph 7.5
              2.2.2.1.2.8. (Added-ACC) FSNCOs will normally perform FSNCO duties for a
              minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 3 years, then return to other duties unless
              they are selected to continue filling a safety position. Units will establish duties to
              take advantage of the FSNCO's expertise rather than employing them in purely
              administrative functions.
2.3. Managing the Program. Commanders must establish a management strategy that:
   2.3.1. Ensures that functional managers and supervisors (rather than the safety staff) take
   corrective action for deficiencies.
   2.3.2. Minimizes administrative tasks, details, and augmentation duties not directly
   associated with safety.
   2.3.3. Involves the safety staff in appropriate meetings, conferences, and councils.
   2.3.4. Integrates safety into all operations and missions of the wing‘s organizations.
   2.3.5. Emphasizes risk management.
   2.3.6. Emphasizes accountability.
2.4. Safety Office Equipment. When setting up equipment requirements consider these
elements:
   2.4.1. Vehicles and Communication. The safety staff must be mobile to do its job. In
   flying units, missile units, and units operating a test range, the staff must have the use of a
   two-way radio-equipped vehicle. Any radio net, appropriate to the mission, that allows the
   vehicle to move freely around the airfield or missile complex is acceptable.
   2.4.2. Tables of Allowance (TA). These TAs list items that safety offices use:
      2.4.2.1. TA 006, Organizational and Administrative Equipment.
      2.4.2.2. TA 009, Small Computer Systems. As a minimum, each full-time safety staff
      office should have: a 486 computer (or faster), with CD-ROM read capability and a
      laptop with portable CD-ROM suitable for reading Air Force publications for use by
      mishap investigation boards and using software compatible with Microsoft products (the
      Air Force standard). As part of the safety office‘s computer support, to include the
      assigned laptop, it is highly recommend to have direct access to the Internet and World
      Wide Web.

       2.4.2.8. TA 660, Equipment Allowances for Non-Weapon Systems Communications
       Requirements.
   2.4.3. Mishap Investigation Kits. Each MAJCOM determines the need for and the contents
   of investigation kits. A recommended list of contents is in AFP 127-1, US Air Force Guide
   to Mishap Investigations, Chapter 2. Safety staffs with host base responsibilities will
   maintain a mishap response and investigation kit sufficient to meet initial response and
   interim safety investigation board requirements.
   2.4.3. (ACC)       Kits will be maintained by each wing or center flight safety office as
   applicable. A suggested kit is the Mishap Investigation Kit, NSN 5180-00-903-1049 -- this is
   a depot-funded item.
2.5. Office Administration:
   2.5.1. ALSAFECOM Messages. Handle and distribute these messages as described in
   Chapter 5.
   2.5.2. Mishap, Safety Inspection, and Hazard Reports. Maintain and dispose of all
   reports created or received according to AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, AFI 37-
   138, Records Disposition - Responsibilities and Procedures, and AFMAN 37-139, Records
   Disposition Schedule.
2.6. Publications Library. Air Force safety offices normally establish a publications library.
When a master publication library and technical order library are readily available, the safety
office needs to maintain only those publications that specifically apply to the safety program.
   2.6.1. Documents may be hard copy or in electronic format. The library should include:
       2.6.1.1. DoD standards and handbooks.
       2.6.1.2. Air Force policy directives, instructions, pamphlets, and TOs.
       2.6.1.3. AFOSH standards.
       2.6.1.4. Copies of AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety, AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec, and AFSP 91-3,
       Nuclear Surety and Weapons Safety Journal.
       2.6.1.5. Pertinent National Fire Protection Association and American National Standard
       Institute standards.
       2.6.1.6. Federal and military specifications and standards, OSHA, National Institute of
       Occupational Safety and Health, National Safety Council, and commercial publications.
   2.6.2. The DoD Index of Specifications and Standards (DoDISS) lists Federal and military
   specifications and standards. Acquire publications that you cannot obtain through the
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                         23


   supporting Publications Distribution Office (PDO) or Technical Order Distribution Office
   through the supporting library.
   2.6.3. The safety office advises the unit commander on how many magazines their units will
   need and ensures that they receive adequate distribution through the PDO or customer
   account representatives. AFI 37-160, Vol 7, Air Force Publications and Forms Management
   Programs--Publications Libraries and Sets, outlines responsibilities for keeping this type of
   library.
2.7. Air Force Councils and Committees. Safety councils and committees provide forums for
discussing safety problems and keeping commanders, functional managers, and supervisors
informed on the status of the mishap prevention program. This allows for more proactive
involvement at all functional levels in mishap prevention and hazard identification.
   2.7.1. The wing or unit commander determines the need, frequency, agenda, and participants
   for all safety councils and committees except those required by public law. Commanders can
   form safety councils and committees at any level to focus group attention on safety or health
   problems. Any council or committee must satisfy a specific need and may not duplicate an
   existing management function.
   2.7.2. The occupational safety and health council is required by law and is convened
   according to AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire
   Protection, and Health Program.
   2.7.3. (Added-ACC) Each base conducting flight operations should have a flight safety
   council (FSC) or equivalent. The FSC is a forum for open and proactive discussion of flight
   safety issues in an integrated, multidisciplinary fashion. The FSC will advise the commander
   on flight safety related matters and recommend actions for identified areas of concern. The
   FSC should meet at least once per half year and may meet in conjunction with the quarterly
   safety council.
2.8. Non-US Air Force Councils and Committees. The Air Force supports federal, state, and
local safety councils and committees and encourages safety staffs to take part in them.
2.9. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. The Air Force
operates several ranges established under DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base.
Operation of these MRTFB ranges carries with it specific responsibilities for public safety. The
overall goal of the range safety program is to ensure safety consistent with operational
requirements, which includes the prevention of test objects, space launch vehicles, or their
hazardous effects from violating established limits. MAJCOMs will establish safety policy for
MRTFB activities. The wing commander of the unit operating the MRTFB is considered the
activity commander. Under the direction of the MAJCOM concerned, the activity commander
will:
2.9. (ACC)Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. Safety policy
for the MRTFB activities will be developed by the range safety function at each range using
DODD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base; AFI 13-212, Vol I, Weapons Ranges; AFI
13-212, Vol II, Weapons Range Management; and AFI 13-212, Vol III, Hazard Methodology
and Weapon Safety Footprints. This safety policy will be published in local instructions and
supplements.
24              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


  2.9.1. Ensure safety is consistent with operational requirements. Risk should be quantified
  and acceptable limits established. Additional risk should be accepted at an appropriate level.
  2.9.2. Establish safety requirements and ensure all range users are in compliance.
  2.9.3. Establish allowable ground and flight safety conditions and take appropriate action to
  ensure that test articles do not violate the conditions. Where the reliability of the test object
  is not established, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure it will not endanger the
  public or their property.

                                           Chapter 3

 SAFETY INSPECTION, EVALUATION, ASSESSMENT, STAFF ASSISTANCE, AND
                          MONITORING

3.1. Safety Inspection. Safety inspections help identify hazards and measure compliance with
safety program requirements outlined in this instruction and AFI 91-301. Through inspections,
the safety staff helps the commander determine the condition of work areas, the safety of work
practices, the degree of compliance with safety and health standards, and the degree of
compliance with safety program requirements. For GSUs, if the host base safety office conducts
the facilities inspection annually, the GSU will forward a copy of the report to the MAJCOM
parent wing. The safety staff and functional managers will ensure qualified inspectors inspect:
   All Air Force facilities and work areas once within a year, except as otherwise directed.
   High interest areas will be designated in writing and ―
                                                         spot‖ inspected monthly.
   At least 20 percent of unmanned missile launch facilities once a year. Select these launch
facilities to ensure that a representative segment of the unit's assets is inspected annually.
   3.1.1. Administrative areas. Collateral duty, task-qualified safety personnel may conduct
   these inspections when the safety staff determines the mishap potential is minimal. The base
   safety staff develops specific provisions for meeting inspection requirements and conducts
   over-the-shoulder assessments of the collateral-duty personnel to ensure that their safety
   inspections are sound.
   3.1.2. Non-Administrative areas. Functional managers, and supervisors inspect all work
   areas periodically, through spot inspections. The Chief of Safety will determine the
   frequency of spot inspections and ensure activities that operate around-the-clock are
   adequately surveyed at times other than normal duty hours.
   3.1.3. Safety Inspection Responsibilities. The host safety staff inspects units that do not
   have an authorized, full-time safety position in a particular discipline. The host performs the
   required annual inspection for those safety areas:
       3.1.3.1. Unless a host-tenant agreement requires otherwise, the parent or gaining unit or
       command inspects units not supported by an Air Force base.
       3.1.3.2. If their mishap potential is low, remotely located units of approximately 25
       people or less may not need an annual inspection by a safety staff. In these cases, the
       MAJCOM determines other provisions for meeting annual inspection requirements.
   3.1.4. Safety Inspection Procedures:
       3.1.4.1. Scheduling Inspections. Safety staffs may designate inspections as "prior-
       notice" or "no-notice." Annual flight, ground, and weapons inspections should be
       conducted jointly when possible. Also, when possible, combine safety inspections with
       other inspections to reduce the number of inspections a unit receives.
       3.1.4.1. (ACC)        Schedule inspections so they do not exceed 12 months from prior
       inspection dates. Annual flight, ground, and weapons inspections should be conducted
       jointly when possible. Formal ground safety inspections of nonindustrial areas may
 26               AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


       exceed 12 months if all areas are covered through use of spot inspections within a 12-
       month period. Spot inspections performed in lieu of formal ground safety inspections will
       be documented.
       3.1.4.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FW/SEF (Flight Safety) will conduct an
       annual inspection/evaluation of the flight safety program. Retain the last annual
       inspection on file. It is the unit commander and flight safety officer‘s responsibility to
       ensure corrective actions fix the discrepancy noted during the inspection. Record all
       follow-up and closure dates on your inspection report.
       3.1.4.2. Personal Consultations. Inspectors must consult with workplace personnel and
       their union representatives on matters affecting their safety and health and give them the
       opportunity to identify unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, equipment, and
       practices. Conduct such consultations privately and do not identify employees who want
       to remain anonymous. Be careful not to offer anyone a formal grant of confidentiality.
       3.1.4.3. Inspection Checklists. Use inspection checklists, especially for items common
       to several units or facilities. Make checklists available to the supervisors of the activities
       slated for inspection.
       3.1.4.4. Safety Inspection Reports. Report annual inspections in writing. Send formal
       reports to the unit commander, the supervisor, and functional manager. In tenant units,
       send a copy of the report to the parent safety office. These reports must contain:
       3.1.4.4. (ACC)          ACC Form 5, Safety Inspection Report, is optional.
           3.1.4.4.1. The unit, activity, or work area inspected.
           3.1.4.4.2. The date of the inspection.
           3.1.4.4.3. A description of any hazards or unsafe work practices, noted with
           reference.
           3.1.4.4.4. Causes of deficiencies and hazards noted.
           3.1.4.4.5. Recommendations for corrective action.
           3.1.4.4.6. Risk assessment codes (RAC) for identified hazards, where applicable.
           3.1.4.4.7. Management and supervisory support compliance.
       3.1.4.5. Follow-up actions. Use spot inspections and follow-up reporting to ensure
       corrective action is taken and the hazards are mitigated.
3.2. Safety Program Evaluation. At least once every three years, qualified safety personnel
must evaluate the safety program management of each organization at wing or installation level
and higher.
3.2. (ACC)      Safety Program Evaluation. Safety Program Management Evaluations (PMEs)
will be conducted on a scheduled basis, once every 3 years, for each organization that has at least
one full-time safety person. PMEs will be conducted simultaneously with ACC Environmental,
Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment Management Programs
(ESOHCAMPs) except for ACC tenants on other MAJCOM bases.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                        27


  3.2.1. Command Units--Wing Level and Above. The higher headquarters evaluates the
  safety program management of organizations at or above the wing level as required by
  OSHA. Conduct evaluations with prior notice.
  3.2.1. (ACC)       HQ ACC will evaluate NAFs, DRUs, and wings/centers/units. Team
  composition will consist of members from HQ ACC/SE or if necessary, augmentation from
  NAF-level personnel. The AIA/IG will evaluate PSU organizations via the UCI process
  using the ACC PME Checklist; HQ ACC will assist as necessary.
  3.2.2. Evaluation Scope. Safety program management evaluations address the areas of
  command and functional manager support, compliance with program directives, and the
  effectiveness of mishap prevention programs.
  3.2.2. (ACC)       Evaluators will conduct PMEs in accordance with the ACC PME
  procedures guide. PMEs will be conducted using the ACC PME Checklist, the checklist can
  be obtained on the HQ ACC/SE website. Note: This checklist is not all-inclusive and
  compliance with all governing instructions and publications is mandatory.
     3.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) A five-tier rating system consists of the grades: Outstanding,
     Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal and Unsatisfactory. Inspection team chiefs may assign
     ratings that accurately reflect observed performance regardless of statistical outcomes.
     Specific criteria are designed as a guide and are not a substitute for the judgment of the
     inspector. However, when ratings differ significantly from established criteria, the
     rational should be explained. Individual discipline PME ratings defined as follows:
        3.2.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) OUTSTANDING: Far exceeds mission requirements
        indicated in the areas of operation or performance. This is demonstrated when
        procedures and activities are carried out in a far superior manner. Programs and
        resources are efficiently managed and demonstrate exceptional merit with minimal
        deficiencies. (85% or more of the major program elements rated outstanding).
        3.2.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) EXCELLENT: Exceeds mission requirements indicated
        in the areas of operation or performance. This is demonstrated when procedures and
        activities are carried out in a superior manner. Programs and resources are efficiently
        managed and are relatively free of discrepancies. (75% of major program elements
        rated excellent or above).
        3.2.2.1.3. (Added-ACC) SATISFACTORY: Meets                 mission       requirements
        indicated in the areas of operation or performance. This is demonstrated when
        procedures and activities are effectively and competently carried out. (65% of major
        program elements rated satisfactory or above).
        3.2.2.1.4. (Added-ACC) MARGINAL: Does not meet mission requirements
        indicated in the areas of operation or performance. Procedures and activities are not
        carried out in an efficient manner. Deficiencies exist that impede or limit mission
        accomplishment. (55% or more of major program elements rated marginal or below).
        3.2.2.1.5. (Added-ACC) UNSATIFACTORY: Does                  not     meet    mission
        requirements indicated in the areas of operation or performance. Procedures and
        activities are not carried out in an adequate manner. Resources and programs are not
        adequately managed. Significant deficiencies exist that preclude or seriously limit
 28              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


          mission accomplishment. (45% or more of major program elements are rated as
          unsatisfactory).
      3.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Overall PME Ratings defined as follows:
          3.2.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) OUTSTANDING – Two or more disciplines rated as
          outstanding and no discipline rated lower than excellent.
          3.2.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) EXCELLENT – Two or more disciplines rated as
          excellent or higher and no discipline rated lower than satisfactory.
          3.2.2.2.3. (Added-ACC) SATISFACTORY – Any combination of ratings not
          meeting the criteria of the other categories provided no more than two areas are rated
          marginal or below.
          3.2.2.2.4. (Added-ACC) MARGINAL – Two or more disciplines rated marginal
          and no discipline rated higher than excellent.
          3.2.2.2.5. (Added-ACC) UNSATISFACTORY – Two or more disciplines rated
          unsatisfactory and no discipline rated higher than excellent.
          3.2.2.2.6. (Added-ACC) Note: Combinations of ratings not addressed in the
          guidelines above will be assessed and rated by the team chief on a case by case basis.
          3.2.2.2.7. (Added-ACC) Note: Major program element ratings will be determined
          by applying the same standard as above to sub-areas within that major element.
   3.2.3. Evaluation Reports. Prepare a written report for each evaluation. Send a copy of the
   report to the commander and safety staff of the organization evaluated.
   3.2.3. (ACC)         Evaluation reports will identify those areas that did not meet standards.
   Reports will be provided to NAF, PSU, DRU, or wing/center/unit commanders, as
   applicable, and Chief of Safety. Follow-up reporting will be accomplished using a suspense
   of 90 days from the date of the evaluation report as the initial response-by-date for the
   evaluated NAF, PSU, DRU, wing/unit to reply back to HQ ACC/SE. Subsequent responses
   will be at 60-day intervals until closed by HQ ACC/SE.
3.3. Assessments. Qualified safety personnel periodically assess the safety program
management of each organization below wing level as required by DoD and this instruction..
These assessments should cover all safety disciplines. You may conduct assessments in
conjunction with the annual safety inspection. Conduct assessments with prior notice.
3.3. (ACC)     Assessments. Assessments will be conducted annually.
   3.3.1. Wings and groups with GSUs, Detachments, or Operating Locations (OL) will
   perform a safety program assessment of each activity at intervals not to exceed 3 years.
   Include a safety inspection as part of the safety program assessment of the activity.
   3.3.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FW/SE evaluates the following program areas
   during these assessments:
      3.3.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Commander support and involvement in
      mishap prevention.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                      29

 30               AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


3.4. Staff Assistance. Safety staffs at all command levels visit subordinate units when
problems, deficiencies, or special subjects require on-scene assistance. Visits may also be
necessary when units implement new missions, equipment, or programs that impact mishap
prevention programs. The objective is to help develop solutions, not to inspect or evaluate. Give
a report to the visited unit's commander, if requested. Do not require replies unless the action
started during the visit needs monitoring by the higher headquarters safety staff or requires
further staff action above the level of the visited unit. The staff assistance visit program is
designed to provide a high degree of flexibility in determining which units to visit and the
functional safety areas involved. The purpose of staff assistance program is to provide assistance
to unit safety personnel by reviewing their management and administrative procedures for
effectiveness and providing recommendations for improvement.
3.4. (ACC)      Staff Assistance. Safety staff assistance visits (SAVs) will be conducted on a
requested, scheduled, or no-notice basis at NAF/PSU/DRU CC discretion. SAVs will not be
conducted within 90 days of a scheduled ACC PME. When SAVs are conducted on a scheduled
basis procedures will be developed addressing their frequency, and scope. The following two
exceptions apply.
   3.4.1. (Added-ACC) NAFs, PSU, or active units should conduct SAVs to ACC-gained
   units for which they have advisory responsibility. Visits will be scheduled when, in the
   opinion of the advisory unit and the unit concerned, the visit would be beneficial in
   improving safety program effectiveness.
   3.4.2. (Added-ACC) Nuclear surety staff assistance visits (NSSAVs) are a HQ ACC
   responsibility and are conducted per guidance in AFI 91-101_ACC SUP 1.
3.5. Contract Monitoring. If safety personnel are required to conduct a safety quality
assurance evaluations (QAE) function, QAE training is required locally through Base
Contracting. NOTE: AF Safety personnel must not put anything in a contract that establishes a
requirement for the Air Force to protect contractor employees or their equipment. Likewise, do
not include anything in inspection or surveillance programs to give the perception that the Air
Force is supervising or observing contractor personnel to provide for their personal safety or to
ensure the safety of their equipment. Requirements for protection of the general public may be
included, (for example, barriers around trenches). Air Force safety personnel must avoid taking
actions that put them in direct control of a work site or contractor employees. If an Air Force
inspector notices a potential OSHA violation, he/she should report the hazard to the contracting
officer, who can remind the contractor of the obligation under the contract to comply with all
pertinent regulations. Unless there is imminent danger, Air Force personnel (other than a
contracting officer) should avoid reporting safety violations directly to the contractor. Similarly,
Air Force personnel should not perform safety inspections of worksites and contract Statements
of work (SOW) should not require Air Force inspections.
3.6. High Interest Areas. These areas have the greatest risk to life or property damage, have
experienced repeated mishaps, or in the judgment of the appropriate (ground, flight, weapons, or
space) safety discipline requires added monitoring. These inspections may be no-notice or
scheduled and the MAJCOM, Numbered AF, and/or host installation safety office establishes the
documentation requirements.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                          31


3.7. Monitoring. Monitoring is a continuous, informal surveillance of operations to ensure
adequate control of hazards and compliance with safety program objectives. Spot inspections and
surveillance are ways to fulfill this requirement.
   3.7.1. Spot Inspections. Spot inspections are no-notice to check the day-to-day safety and
   health of an organization, workcenter, facility, etc. The MAJCOM, Numbered AF, and/or
   host installation safety office establishes documentation requirements for spot inspections.
   Minimum documentation will include date, inspector‘s name, organization or activity
   inspected, unit point of contact, and a brief description of what was observed, if there
   was/was not a discrepancy and of the status (open/closed).
       3.7.1.1. (Added-ACC) Chiefs of Safety will determine the frequency of spot
       inspections and ensure activities, which operate around the clock, are adequately
       surveyed at times other than normal duty hours. Spot inspections will be documented on
       a locally developed spot inspection log.
       3.7.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Spot and special inspections conducted by 366
       FW/SEG (Ground Safety) are IAW AFI 91-202, and as prescribed elsewhere in this
       instruction, or more frequently as directed by 366 FW/CC (Commander).
       3.7.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Flight Safety Spot Inspection Program.
       The safety spot inspection program provides a means for the safety representative to
       periodically assess the health of the unit‘s safety program. Inspection areas include, but
       not limited to those listed in AFI 91-202, Chapter 7. Spot inspections are informal and
       often unscheduled.
          3.7.1.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Document spot inspections in a log
          maintained in the Flight Safety Program Book IAW AFI 91-202, Chapter 3.
          Document what was good with the program as well as the discrepancies.
          Discrepancies not corrected on the spot are followed up within 30 days. Document
          follow-up inspections until discrepancies are corrected.
       3.7.1.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Weapons Safety Spot Inspection Program.
       The safety spot inspection program provides a means for the safety representative to
       periodically assess the health of the wing or unit‘s safety program.
          3.7.1.3.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Frequency of spot inspections.
          Accomplish a minimum of one spot inspection per month of applicable areas (or
          more often as commander-directed).
          3.7.1.3.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Ensure activities operating around
          the clock are adequately surveyed at times other than normal duty hours.
   3.7.2. Surveillance. Surveillance is a monitoring tool that can also assist in checking the
   day-to-day activities of an organization. No documentation is necessary for surveillance
   unless unsafe conditions or practices are noted and corrective action cannot be made without
   written notification. The following is a partial list of operations and areas that should be
   routinely checked.
       3.7.2.1. Aircraft ground handling and parking.
       3.7.2.2. Fuel servicing; hot refueling, integrated combat turnarounds, and concurrent
       servicing.

4.3. Reporting Procedures:
   4.3.1. Report hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is
   eliminated on the spot, no further action is required unless it applies to other similar
   operations or to other units or agencies.
       4.3.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) 366 FW/CP (Command Post) will develop
       procedures in local operating instructions or checklists to immediately notify 366 FW/SE
       of all flight-related mishaps (including foreign object damage (FOD) incidents and
       nondamaging bird strikes) occurring in the local area, as well as off-station flight mishaps
       reported to 366 FW/CP involving AF aircrews or aircraft.
       4.3.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Following a flight-related mishap, aircraft
       commanders will immediately complete the 366 FW In Flight Emergency (IFE)/Mishap
       Form, or locally developed equivalent, and provide it to their flight safety officer (FSO)
       and 366 FW/SE at the earliest opportunity (within the same flight duty period, crew duty
       day permitting).
       4.3.1.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Notify 366 FW/SE of all potentially
       reportable mishaps within 24 hours of occurrence.

  4.3.3. Report hazards that cannot be eliminated immediately to the safety office by AF Form
  457, USAF Hazard Report (HR), by telephone or in person. Reports can be submitted
  anonymously.
  4.3.4. The safety staff investigates the HR. The investigator discusses the HR with the
  member who submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and
  other parties involved to validate the hazard and determine the best interim control and
  corrective action.
  4.3.5. If the hazard is validated:
     4.3.5.1. The investigator assigns a RAC, a HR control number, and monitors corrective
     action until complete.
     4.3.5.2. The investigator completes the HR's Part II, "Summary of Investigation," and
     sends it promptly to the individual responsible for making sure corrective action is
     completed and the hazard eliminated or controlled.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                            35


       4.3.5.3. The responsible individual completes Part II, "Action Taken," within 10 working
       days and returns the HR to the safety office for monitoring.
       4.3.5.4. The investigator tells the originator (if known) about the corrective action and
       conducts follow-up reviews until the action is completed. The investigator informs the
       originator (if known), about the completed action within 10 workdays after the report is
       closed.
   4.3.6. If the HR response is not satisfactory to the reporting member, the member may
   submit a reevaluation request according to AFI 91-301.
   4.3.7. HRs that generate an AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan, may be closed and
   corrective action monitored through the hazard abatement process. See AFI 91-301 for
   further action required for AF Form 3 processing.
4.4. Additional Reporting Procedures:
   4.4.1. Transient personnel unable to report a hazard at a base where it is found, submits the
   HR to the next Air Force base they visit, or to the safety office at their home base. That
   safety office sends the report to the responsible base safety offices.
   4.4.2. The safety office sends reports on hazards that cannot be corrected at the local level to
   the agencies that can take appropriate action.
   4.4.3. Tenant personnel send hazard reports involving activities for which the host is
   responsible to the host base safety office for processing.
   4.4.4. Send hazard reports by message if they require urgent action. Send messages to the
   safety office at the headquarters where action can be taken. List units with similar equipment
   as information addressees.
   4.4.5. Persons identifying hazards involving weather forecasting must submit hazard reports
   as soon as possible to ensure that records are not destroyed. Promptly after landing, aircraft
   commanders advise the appropriate facility providing air weather services of their intention
   to submit a hazard report. If necessary, notify these facilities by message.
   4.4.6. Base safety offices send hazard reports that involve other military services, foreign
   nations, or agencies outside the Air Force to HQ USAF/SE, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland AFB
   NM 87117-5670 and to the affected Air Force units and their chain of command as
   information addressees. AF Form 130 should be submitted to HQ AFCIC/ITIA, 1250 AF
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330 for a Report Control Symbol control number assignment.
4.5. Promoting the Program. The unit‘s commander ensures the AF Form 457 is available to
all unit personnel. The base safety office will maintain a small quantity of the forms to help
ensure availability by base personnel. The safety office must respond promptly (within 10
working days) to the reporting member on their findings, status of the AF Form 457, and any
recommendations.

                                           Chapter 5

            MISHAP PREVENTION INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

5.1. Information Protection. Analyzing and distributing mishap prevention information are
key elements in mishap prevention. All safety mishap reports, except Class A and B ―       8-hour‖
messages, are "For Official Use Only" (FOUO). For FOUO handling procedures, see AFI 37-
131, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program. Some safety mishap reports require
additional handling restrictions as privileged reports. See AFI 91-204 for further information and
handling restrictions.
   5.1.1. Privileged and FOUO controls protect the parts of the report that personnel provided
   in confidence or conclusions investigators derived from those parts. Use mishap reports only
   for mishap prevention and limit access to these reports. The safety staff must brief everyone
   with access to privileged safety or privacy act information on the proper handling procedures
   annually. See AFI 91-204 for more information.
   5.1.2. To provide wider dissemination, sanitize mishap information by removing the parts
   that make it privileged. AFI 91-204 describes the method for sanitizing privileged reports.
5.2. Action Information:
   5.2.1. Mishap Reports. Send reports of Air Force mishaps as directed by AFI 91-204.
   Many of these reports have recommendations needing urgent action by some addressees.
   Consider mishap reports to be action documents.
       5.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) HAP, Class C and Class B Flight Mishaps. Each unit safety
       office is responsible for tracking their unit‘s mishaps to closure. Closure occurs when all
       recommendations from the subject mishap are closed (this includes recommendations
       with a local OPR and those recommendations with OPRs outside local channels). Report
       status of recommendations to NAF/SE semiannually. NAF/SE and AWFC will in-turn
       provide a semiannual report by MDS of all open and closed recommendations to HQ
       ACC/SE. In the case of Class A and B flight mishaps conducted via formal investigation
       and report, HQ ACC/SE will track recommendations to closure.
   5.2.2. ALSAFECOM Messages. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE) uses the
   ALSAFECOM message to rapidly distribute critical safety information. HQ USAF/SE sends
   these messages to each MAJCOM commander and director (or chief) of safety. The
   messages convey mishap prevention data and often require action to eliminate hazards.
   5.2.3. After receiving an ALSAFECOM message, each director or chief of safety:
       5.2.3.1. Reviews the message and sends it to the agencies and units that need to take
       action.
       5.2.3.2. Keeps a file of ALSAFECOM messages that are applicable to the unit.
       5.2.3.3. Annotates the message to show its distribution and the actions the unit takes in
       response to the reported hazard or mishap.
5.3. Advisory Information:
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                          37


  5.3.1. Recurring Publications. The AFSC, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Air Force
  Reserve, and Air National Guard may produce recurring publications providing education
  and training in mishap prevention.
     5.3.1.1. Purpose and Scope. The goal of these documents is to prevent mishaps in
     operating and maintaining aircraft and associated equipment and facilities, storing and
     handling explosives, conducting industrial operations, operating government and
     privately owned vehicles, and participating in off-duty sports and recreation. The
     publications also provide educational information on implementing OSHA standards and
     in establishing and maintaining nuclear surety and environmental safety programs.
     5.3.1.2. Air Force military members and civilian employees, including Air Force
     Reserve and Air National Guard units and members, are the primary audience of special
     publications. The secondary audience is other DoD and non-DoD personnel supporting
     Air Force missions. A one-for-one safety publication exchange is authorized with
     foreign militaries where such action clearly supports mishap prevention purposes and is
     in the US Government‘s best interest. This exchange of information provides an open
     forum for mishap prevention ideas and programs.
     5.3.1.3. The Commander, AFSC, will issue recurring publications pertaining to the entire
     Air Force mishap prevention program. MAJCOMs, Air Force Reserve, and Air National
     Guard may issue recurring publications pertaining to mishap prevention in their unique
     missions.
     5.3.1.4. Operating Policies. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for each
     document will determine the number of pages and frequency of publication.
         5.3.1.4.1. Each OPR will act as its own reviewing authority for document contents.
         5.3.1.4.2. Each OPR will establish a distribution ratio to control distribution of
         recurring publications. Publication Distribution Offices (PDOs) will distribute the
         publications to organizations at Air Force installations. The OPR will make
         distribution to units without a PDO by the most economical means.
  5.3.2. Periodic Summaries. HQ AFSC sends periodic mishap summaries to the MAJCOM
  safety staffs. These summaries include recent mishap experience, mishap statistics, analyses
  of current problem areas, and proposed changes in safety policy. Regular summaries
  include:
     5.3.2.1. Blue Four News. HQ AFSC/SEF sends monthly Blue Four News messages to
     safety offices throughout the Air Force, summarizing the previous month's Class A flight
     mishaps and commenting on the trends that the mishaps indicate. This summary is to be
     controlled as a ―privileged‖ report since dates, times, and mishap specifics.
     5.3.2.2. How Goes It in Ground Safety. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as
     needed basis but not less than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices and the Army
     and Naval Safety Centers to provide updates on ground safety issues and activities.
     5.3.2.3. Hurtline and OUCH. These HQ AFSC/SEG quarterly messages provide a
     summary and analysis of Air Force Class A, B, and C mishaps for all Air Force Safety
     offices.
 38              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


      5.3.2.4. Ground Safety Spotlight. This HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as
      needed basis but not less than quarterly to all Air Force offices to provide safety interest
      items from recent mishaps, injuries, compensation cost data, or resource protection needs.
      5.3.2.5. OSHA Chronicles. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis
      but not less than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices to provide information on
      OSHA visits to Air Force installations giving a synopsis of findings and citations to
      prevent reoccurrence.
      5.3.2.6. AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety. Focuses on all aspects of flying safety to include
      mishap investigations, the wildlife hazard reduction (BASH) program, as well as
      command-generated articles and mishap prevention concerns.
      5.3.2.7. AFSP 91-3, Nuclear Surety and Weapons Safety Journal. HQ AFSC/SEW
      writes articles focusing on all aspects of weapons and space safety as well as nuclear
      surety. In every issue of this journal, HQ AFSC/SEW discusses conventional and nuclear
      weapon mishap trends and potential methods of prevention.
      5.3.2.8. AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec. Focuses on all aspects of ground safety to include
      mishap investigations as well as command-generated articles and mishap prevention
      concerns.
   5.3.3. MAJCOM Publications. MAJCOMs should publish either a safety magazine,
   newsletter, or safety kit to aid in the dissemination of command-specific safety information.
      5.3.3.1. (Added-ACC) ACCSP 91-1, The Combat Edge, is the principal safety
      education medium in the ACC program. It addresses all safety functional areas and
      presents monthly, quarterly, and annual award summaries. Units are strongly encouraged
      to submit worthy award nominations, articles, anecdotes, etc.
      5.3.3.2. (Added-ACC) Two Plus Four News: HQ ACC/SEG sends this message on a
      quarterly basis (within present fiscal year) summarizing the previous Class A mishaps.
5.4. Methods of Distribution. Select an appropriate distribution method by considering your
content, time available, and audience. Some suggested methods of distributing advisory
information are:
   5.4.1. Periodic safety meetings.
   5.4.2. Supervisor safety briefings.
   5.4.3. Base newspapers and bulletins.
   5.4.4. Safety publications.
   5.4.5. AFSC or MAJCOM publications.
NOTE:         The MAJCOM chief of safety decides whether to distribute summaries to
subordinate units.


   5.4.6. (Added-ACC) Flying safety meetings.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                          39


       5.4.6.1. (Added-ACC) Note: Each wing will conduct pilot and crew member flying
       safety meetings quarterly. The wing FSO will ensure the wing flight surgeon or a suitably
       qualified aerospace physiologist briefs human performance topics at each meeting.
5.5. Mishap Analysis Programs. Full-time safety staffs at all levels should develop locally
oriented mishap analysis programs to evaluate mishap statistics and identify trends. Managers
develop local programs to formulate intervention efforts by determining the root causes for
mishaps. When setting up an analysis program:
5.5. (ACC) Mishap Analysis Programs. NAF SEG, SEF, SEW, DRU and PSUs will
develop analysis programs. Include trends identified from mishap reports, and SAV visits.
   5.5.1. Identify successes or problem areas and trends, measure safety program effectiveness,
   and guide prevention actions.
   5.5.2. Make sure that the program is flexible enough to allow for additional changes.
   5.5.3. Some healthy prevention programs are characterized by large numbers of reports
   (indicating safety awareness on the part of submitters), while others may see few or no
   reports (including a safe operating environment)
5.6. Standard Mishap Rates. Safety staffs at the MAJCOM level and above can compute the
standard rates for their organization. Care must be taken to ensure the statistic validity of the
rates. Information on mishap rates can be obtained by calling AFSC/SEC. The Air Force Safety
Center uses standardized rates for
5.6. (ACC) Standard Mishap Rates. HQ ACC/SE will use the formula listed in paragraphs
5.6.1 through 5.6.4.2 (Added) for calculating mishap rates. These may differ greatly from the
methods used by the Air Force Safety Center and other MAJCOMs for determining their
composite rates. This must be kept in mind when trying to compare rates with other units outside
ACC.
   5.6.1. Flight mishaps
   5.6.1. (ACC)        Compute flight mishaps per 100,000 flying hours.
   5.6.2. Federal Employee‘s Compensation Act Lost Time Injury/Illnesses
   5.6.3. On-Duty Ground Mishaps
   5.6.3. (ACC)        The formulas below are for calculating on-duty ground mishap rates. The
   168 hours is based on one worker's average exposure time on-duty each month.
       5.6.3.1. (Added-ACC) Military Disabling Injury (MDI) Rate: # of injuries x 200,000
       divided by military strength x 168 hrs.
       5.6.3.2. (Added-ACC) Military Fatal Rate: # of fatals x 200,000 divided by military
       strength x 168 hrs.
       5.6.3.3. (Added-ACC) Civilian Disabling Injury (CDI) Rate: # of injuries x 200,000
       divided by civilian strength x 168 hrs.
       5.6.3.4. (Added-ACC) Civilian Fatal Rate: # of fatals x 200,000 divided by civilian
       strength x 168 hrs.
 40              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


      5.6.3.5. (Added-ACC) Added) Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) Rate: # GMV
      mishaps divided by miles x 1,000,000.
   5.6.4. Off-duty Ground Mishap
   5.6.4. (ACC)        The formulas below are for calculating off-duty military rates. The 312
   hours is based on one military member's off-duty time, minus 8 hours sleep.
      5.6.4.1. (Added-ACC) Off-Duty MDI Rate: # injuries x 200,000 divided by military
      strength x 312 hrs.
      5.6.4.2. (Added-ACC) Off-Duty Military Fatal Rate: # fatals x 200,000 divided by
      military strength x 312 hrs.
   5.6.5. Combined On- and Off-duty Mishap
5.7. Mishap Prevention Analysis Methods. One way to approach analysis is to divide it into
two broad functions: monitor and study. The monitor function is an ongoing task, while the
study function is a specific effort directed to a particular problem.
   5.7.1. Monitor Function. In this method, the safety staff selects categories of raw data and
   reviews them regularly in the form of tabulations or rates. The object is to identify trends
   and problem areas. Selection of the areas to be monitored depends on the available data and
   the needs of the organization. Mishap reports are a good place to start, but other areas should
   not be overlooked. Some other categories that may be appropriate for analysis are:
      5.7.1.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Reports
      5.7.1.2. High Accident Potential (HAP)
      5.7.1.3. Deficiency Reports
      5.7.1.4. Inspection/Assessment Reports
      5.7.1.5. Foreign Object Damage Reports
      5.7.1.6. First-Aid Injury Reports
      5.7.1.7. Maintenance Logs or Reports
   5.7.2. Study Function. This process requires a much more detailed examination of a
   problem area. There are no specific ground rules on how to do it; the nature of the problem
   and the data available tend to dictate the way to go. First, it is best to draft an objective
   statement that describes the problem and limits the study. An example is: ―    Determine why
   ‗X‘ is increasing.‖ Next identifying factors and data that affect the problem. Then develop a
   plan on how these factors and data area going to be collected, tabulated, compared, plotted,
   and calculated. Finally, collect the data, analyze it, and come up with conclusions that
   answer the objective statement. Without conclusions, the study is of no value.
      5.7.2.1. Limitations:
          5.7.2.1.1. Availability of Data. The type and depth of analysis that can be done at
          each level depends on the amount of data available. As a rule, small amounts of data
          cause large changes in rates and trends which can be misleading. To get large
          amounts of data, it is often better to add the exposure of several small units or to use
          data for a longer period of time. Another method is to add near mishaps to the
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                            41


           reportable ones. This not only expands the data base but it often gives a better picture
           of the root causes. For example, when analyzing operational injuries, look at all the
           injuries that occurred on the job, not just the reportable ones.
           5.7.2.1.2. Rates. Mishap rates are often misused because the limitations are not
           considered. Rates do not reflect responsibility for mishaps. By themselves, rates do
           not measure or reflect all the factors that influence exposure. They should not be
           used as the sole basis for determining the success of prevention efforts. Any raw data
           (aircraft tire failures, for example) can be divided by an exposure (number of
           landings) to give a rate. That, in itself, has no value unless it can be compared to
           other like rates or computed often to set a trend. Rates can also be misleading if the
           exposure is small or if the mishaps considered have little in common.
           5.7.2.1.3. Tabulations. Tabulations normally do not reflect trends because exposure
           is not considered. Tabulated data plotted per unit of time, such as number of injuries
           each month, can show a trend graphically. Trends derived in this way must be used
           with caution because the exposure factor may not be accurate. The number of
           injuries per month, for example, might be meaningless if population, mission,
           emphasis on treatment, or disability compensation rules change.
           5.7.2.1.4. Trends. When the data base is small, a few mishaps can cause large
           changes in rates and make it difficult to determine trends. To get large amounts of
           data, it is often necessary to add the data from several units or weapons systems. The
           resulting trends may be mathematically accurate but might not apply to any specific
           system. To set trends, it is best to use the most data available, defined in the
           narrowest way possible. There are several recognized ways of smoothing large
           clumps in rates to establish a reasonably valid trend. One way is to carry rates
           cumulatively for a period of 12 months rather than by calendar year. Starting rates at
           zero each year works well at the Air Force and MAJCOM level but may not at lower
           levels.
5.8. Use of Analysis Data. The purpose of analysis is to help prevent mishaps. Present
conclusions drawn in a useful format to the people who can use them directly in their prevention
programs. The data should also be available to other organizations with like equipment or
problems. After taking corrective actions, follow-up analysis may be done to measure the
effectiveness of these actions.
5.9. Metrics.
5.9. (ACC) Metrics. Units within ACC may develop metrics as required for local use. ACC
Safety does not require any metric reporting by safety offices.
   5.9.1. Mishap metrics (calculated as a number of successful events against some kind of total
   event exposure) are an effective way to compare the actions and accomplishments of your
   unit. Comparisons between other organizations or MAJCOMs may be misleading based on
   differences in operations, environment, equipment, or other variables. The metrics used by
   the safety community to this point have focused on results - the number of mishaps
   experienced over time relative to exposure. While this ―
                                                          bottom line‖ information is useful, it
   is incomplete. A mishap rate alone cannot explain the most critical information needed by
   commanders--feedback proving that a particular effort caused the result. In most safety
42              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


  offices today, we are pleased when the mishap rate is down, but we cannot satisfactorily
  explain why. When the mishap rate is up, we tend to choose short-term solutions to this long
  term-problem. The answer to the metrics dilemma is to decide on a set of safety performance
  measurements that precede mishap data and have a reasonable expectation of positively
  impacting the mishap rate.
 5.9.2. Most quality-based assessment programs advise against the use of ―
                                                                         negative metrics.‖
 The appropriate use of metrics is particularly important within the safety function, since
 some use of negative indicators is unavoidable (see AFPD 91-2). While each mishap
 represents a ― failure to prevent,‖ there is currently no corresponding way of measuring
 ―successful prevention.‖
 5.9.3. Hazardous air traffic reports (Chapter 7), hazard reports (Chapter 4), high accident
 potential, inspections and assessments (Chapter 3), and other reports submitted as a part of
 the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program under this instruction and AFI 91-204 are integral
 to the success of our overall safety program. Significant numbers of such reports may
 indicate a developing adverse trend, while even a single Class C mishap report or hazard
 report could identify the potential for a far more serious loss. Accordingly, maximum
 reporting is an essential element of successful prevention and risk assessment and must in no
 way be discouraged. Therefore, the use of numbers of safety reports of any type as a metric
 is prohibited.
  5.9.4. Safety knowledge is one type of such data. Measuring safety knowledge is a good
  performance measurement that should be tracked with metrics. Poor judgment is a leading
  cause of Air Force reportable mishaps. In order to improve judgment decisions, individuals
  must have adequate knowledge and the right attitude (Good judgment = knowledge +
  attitude). Unit commanders and supervisors can positively influence their personnel by
  ensuring everyone maintains a high degree of safety knowledge. The level of safety
  knowledge can be measured by using surveys or tests, thus commanders and supervisors
  reinforce the desired behavior. Individuals should be periodically surveyed for on and off-
  duty knowledge of basic safety principles, or job related safety standards. The safety
  knowledge areas that could be surveyed or tested:
     5.9.4.1. Seldom performed tasks such as emergency procedures
     5.9.4.2. Tasks that have a history of high mishap frequency
     5.9.4.3. Critical tasks where failure or mishap could jeopardize the mission
     5.9.4.4. Point-in-time, safety-related job knowledge could be displayed on a bar chart.
     5.9.4.5. Trend data for a particular AFSC could be displayed on a line or a control chart
     to observe the trend data over time.
  5.9.5. Feedback to safety-related behavior is essential. Below are three other potential
  metrics for measuring safety and hazard abatement.
     5.9.5.1. One such feedback mechanism is to link safety performance feedback to
     leadership requirements by identifying safety requirements as a stand-alone scoring item
     on feedback and performance reports. This metric would show leadership support for
     risk reduction management support and will increase the safety knowledge of the
     leadership and the individuals.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                       43


    5.9.5.2. The second possible metric would be to establish a metric that tracks letters of
    commendation, letters of admonishment, letters of counseling (positive and negative),
    letters of reprimand, and Article 15 actions for safety-related actions. This metric would
    show the units culture concerning safety-related activities.
    5.9.5.3. The last potential metric would be to track the cycle time for abatement actions.
    This would show the commander‘s support for reducing the hazards in the unit by
    showing leaderships willingness to apply O&M dollars to abate hazards. Potential
    measurements can be:
       5.9.5.3.1. The number of days, months, or years that pass between problem
       recognition and problem resolution is clearly measurable. When measured and
       displayed, the information will display to the leadership the numbers of days that pass
       before significant safety problems are resolved.
       5.9.5.3.2. At the end of each reporting period, the major command could request
       closure time of all risk assessment code (RAC) items 1-4 assigned throughout the
       year. Risk assessment data to the RAC 4 level is meaningful since it shows a
       squadron leaderships resolve to fix the problem even the minor problems while RAC
       1-3 are usually controlled by resources beyond the squadron financial and manpower
       capabilities.

mishap investigation board members. Positions and qualification requirements are in AFI 91-
204. MAJCOMs determine the most effective interval and mode of training.
7.6. (ACC) Each person identified to serve as a potential board member will be trained within
1 month. Training will be conducted by a formal school trained FSO. Previous members of
 52                 AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


mishap boards should be used to contribute lessons and techniques that they learned. Training
may use any combination of personal briefings and written or audiovisual materials. Refresher
training should be given annually to review AFI 91-204 requirements and update previously
trained individuals on new rules, techniques, or lessons learned. Recommend a review of
applicable portions of the mishap response plan and the contents of the investigation kit during
this training. Any of the above formats may be used. Note: Board Presidents Training.
NAF/DRU safety offices will ensure their units' schedule all prospective Board Presidents for
AFSC SIB/AIB President‘s training as soon as possible.
7.7. US Air Force Hazard Reporting (HR) and Hazardous Air Traffic Reporting (HATR)
Programs RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602. The FSO investigates HRs according to Chapter 4 and
HATRs according to Attachment 3.
7.7. (ACC) Send flight safety crosstell messages (via AIG 9409) to applicable units that may
benefit from certain HRs or HATRs.
7.8. Aero Club Operations. The host unit commander appoints a FSO as an advisor to the base
Aero Club. If the host unit does not have an assigned FSO, the commander obtains the
assistance of a tenant unit FSO to provide safety assistance to the Aero Club. If there is no FSO
available, the commander appoints a member of the ground safety staff. The host safety office
reports Aero Club mishaps according to AFI 91-204, AFI 34-217, Air Force Aero Club
Program, and 49 CFR, chapter VIII, National Transportation Safety Board, part 830, as
appropriate. The Chief of Safety for the installation possessing the Aero Club aircraft will use
the procedures in AFI 91-204 chapters 7 and 11 for reporting these mishaps and will determine
the safety personnel who will investigate the mishap. For mishap prevention purposes, all Aero
Club aircraft are considered appropriated fund assets. All reports will be forwarded to HQ
AFSC/SEF and HQ AFSVA/SVPAR. Any Air Force investigation conducted under AFI 91-204
fulfills the Air Force mishap reporting requirements of AFI 34-217 and shall not take precedence
over or interfere with civil aviation authorities or agencies investigating a non-Air Force aircraft
mishap.
7.9. Airfield Maintenance and Construction. FSOs and FSNCOs monitor routine airfield
maintenance and major construction projects. On major construction projects, the FSO reviews
the initial plan for compliance with AFJMAN 32-1013, Airfield and Heliport Planning and
Design, (formerly AFR 86-14), and attends the preconstruction conference or briefing to
consider if it will effect unit operations. Consider these factors:
7.9. (ACC) FSOs and FSNCOs, with the Airfield Manager will review airfield waivers,
exemptions, and deviations annually.
      7.9.1. The inspection of areas before use.
   7.9.2. The impact of maintenance and construction on daily flying schedule and emergency
   situations.
   7.9.3. The communications between the tower and contractor and the availability of the
   contracting agent.

   7.9.8. Explosive safety criteria.
   7.9.9. The potential impact of construction on wildlife hazards to airfield operations.
7.10. Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Units with flying programs must
establish a MACA program. The unit safety office is responsible for its administration. The
FSO works closely with the MAJCOM-determined OPR and other interested parties such as the
Chief Air Traffic Control Operations Officer (CATCO), the Airfield Operations Flight
Commander (AOF/CC), the airspace manager, and the local Flight Standards District Officer
(FSDO), to establish a comprehensive MACA program. Tailor the MACA program to meet
local needs. Consider these key objectives when developing a MACA program:
7.10. (ACC) The unit safety office will coordinate with the airfield operations flight
commander and other agencies to establish a MACA program IAW this AFI 91-204 and AFI 13-
203.
   7.10.1. Ensure the free flow of MACA information between host and tenant organizations,
   effective communication between base and local airport managers and fixed base operators,
   and actively support the HATR Program.
   7.10.2. Provide educational programs to increase the use of available radar services among
   civil aircraft.
   7.10.3. Use the resources and services of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FSDO
   accident prevention specialists.
   7.10.4. Develop appropriate maps and graphics showing the base radar services and routes.
   Distribute the maps to all civil airlines and pilots, base fixed operators, airports and other
   flying operations that use the surrounding airspace.
   7.10.5. Establish procedures to control VFR aircraft and minimize the air-traffic hazards.
   7.10.6. Deconflict MTRs as much as possible and acquaint the flying public with the
   location, configuration, speeds, and altitudes of the base MTR and military operating areas
   through military and FAA personnel.
   7.10.7. Ensure that arrival and departure routes (including stereo routes and profile descents)
   minimize conflicts with runway traffic, nearby airfields, and local flying areas.
   7.10.8. Evaluate the midair collision potential with civil airlines and work with operators of
   nearby airfields to reduce risk and minimize the hazards.
   7.10.9. Develop a MACA pamphlet.
   7.10.10. Units may combine MACA programs with other military organizations in a 50-mile
   range of their base. This will require more coordination efforts but will result in a better
   product to be used by the area‘s civilian population.
7.11. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. Includes all wildlife aircraft strike
hazards.

 56              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


       7.11.1.5. (Added-ACC) Units will coordinate with airfield management on bird/animal
       wildlife scare and depredation responsibilities. If determined safety personnel will
       perform these duties, they must be trained by qualified personnel on the use of bird scare
       ammunition and associated equipment. License and storage of the assets must conform to
       requirements listed in AFMAN 91-201.
   7.11.2. Base Level BASH Program. Hose Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National
   Guard, installations with flying operations must establish a BASH program. The BASH
   program will include all tenant flying units. The BASH program requires complete
   documentation of local wildlife hazards, effects on missions and possible solutions. Tenant
   units located on an airfield that is not hosted by the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air
   National Guard will establish a BASH program with the host activity (civilian airport, Naval
   Air Station, Federal airfield, etc.). The BASH program will document coordination with the
   host activity on reducing wildlife hazards.
       7.11.2.1. The host flight safety office will establish the BASH plan, to include, defining
       the nature and extent of wildlife hazards and implementation of the plan. Plan
       implementation may require environmental controls and changes to bird dispersal
       techniques and operational procedures. Cooperative agreements for managing fish and
       wildlife resources require coordination with state and Federal conservation agencies prior
       to implementation.
       7.11.2.2. BASH programs at overseas locations depend on host nation support and
       regulations. MAJCOMs will evaluate those plans to ensure the spirit of AFI 91-202 is
       complied with to the maximum extent possible.
       7.11.2.3. Grass Height. Mow airfield to maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and
       14 inches. Each installation BHWG will establish airfield mowing zone boundaries.
       Installations located in arid climates where growing grass is difficult may develop natural
       vegetation on the airfield to limit attractiveness to wildlife. These situations require
       comprehensive vegetation/wildlife hazard management and will be reviewed individually
       by AFSC/SEFW for approval. MAJCOM safety offices may request a waiver to grass
       height restrictions from AFSC/SEFW.
       7.11.2.4. Obtain additional information on wildlife strike hazard reduction from
       AFPAM 91-212, BASH Management Techniques and on wildlife strike reporting from
       AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.

7.12. Other Activities Related to Flight Safety. The FSO attends Air Traffic Control Board
meetings,     Foreign    Object     Damage     Prevention  Committee      meetings,    and
Standardization/Evaluation and Training review meetings.
7.12. (ACC) Flight Safety Councils. The FSC is chaired by the installation commander or
by the commander's designee and is a forum for airing flight and flight-related safety issues.
   7.12.1. (Added-ACC) Membership should include the Chief of Safety, all FSOs and
   squadron senior operations/maintenance officers, Chief of Stan/Eval, airfield operations
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                           57


   officer, fire protection and rescue chief, Director of Base Medical Services (or designee), the
   senior aerospace medicine physician (or senior SME flight surgeon for ACC tenant units),
   base civil engineer, life support superintendent, senior representatives from the support and
   logistics groups, weather, and other senior officials deemed necessary to conduct the business
   of the council. ACC units that are tenants on other MAJCOM installations are encouraged to
   participate in equivalent host unit forums. However, if the host does not have an equivalent,
   the FSC should be conducted to provide a vehicle for formally identifying flight safety
   concerns to the host and higher headquarters. Ensure members are briefed on safety-
   privileged information, if applicable.
   7.12.2. (Added-ACC) The wing FSO should ensure distribution of an agenda, with
   provisions for additions in advance, and publication of council meeting minutes. The council
   chairperson approves the minutes. All council members receive copies of the minutes. OPRs
   are identified for items requiring action. Ensure all privileged information is marked
   appropriately.
   7.12.3. (Added-ACC) FSC communications stay within Air Force channels. Areas for
   discussion should primarily include those that will benefit from the inputs of the assembled
   functional experts and which may require cross-functional coordination to act upon. This
   may include, as appropriate:
      7.12.3.1. (Added-ACC) Response to aircraft in-flight emergencies/crash recovery.
      7.12.3.2. (Added-ACC) Human performance issues; flight and maintenance/ground
      environment.
      7.12.3.3. (Added-ACC) Pilot, aircrew, controller, airfield management, and maintainer
      needs and interface.
      7.12.3.4. (Added-ACC) Commencement and accommodation of new operational flying
      requirements (e.g., night operations, NVGs).
      7.12.3.5. (Added-ACC) Impact of base maintenance and construction on flying.
      7.12.3.6. (Added-ACC) Disaster/HAZMAT response.
      7.12.3.7. (Added-ACC) Airfield conditions.
      7.12.3.8. (Added-ACC) Life support and training programs.
      7.12.3.9. (Added-ACC) Status of open/closed mishap recommendations.
      7.12.3.10. (Added-ACC) Air Traffic Control operations/procedures.
   7.12.4. (Added-ACC) Submit report of current status of unit open/closed mishap
   recommendations to NAF/SE as soon as possible following council meeting or semiannually
   if no meeting is held.
7.13. (Added-ACC) Operational/Training Squadron Flight Safety Program:
   7.13.1. (Added-ACC) The squadron commander will maintain overall supervision of the
   squadron flight safety program. SAFSOs represent an extension of the wing flight safety
   program at the squadron level. In addition to managing the squadron flight safety program,
   these individuals should assist in carrying out all normal wing safety duties. Unit
   commanders will select a qualified rated officer and/or NCO as ADFSO and/or ADFSNCO
 58              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


   to assist in managing the unit internal safety program. The ADFSO/ADFSNCO will also
   assist the SAFSO in investigating minor incidents, DRs, and in accomplishing necessary
   safety related duties. Units possessing aircraft with enlisted crew positions should also
   consider appointing an enlisted crewmember as ADFSNCO to assist in the flight safety
   program.
   7.13.2. (Added-ACC) The SAFSO assists the wing FSO with the wing program when able.
   It is therefore expected that the ADFSO will be assigned the majority of the following
   actions, however, it is recognized that missions and manning vary between units. The

                                      GROUND SAFETY

8.1. Program Management. This chapter contains the minimum requirements for safety
offices at all command levels. Ground safety mishap prevention efforts include both on- and off-
duty activities.
   8.1.1. Each installation ground safety manager oversees and implements a total base safety
   program.
   8.1.2. Wing subordinate units and tenant organizations implement a program that supports
   the installation program.
   8.1.3. Host safety offices may not impose host command-unique requirements on tenant
   units unless specified in the host-tenant agreement. Tenant units without full-time qualified
   safety authorizations and with fewer than 400 people receive the same safety services as
   wing subordinate units. For tenant units greater than 400 people that don't have their own
   full-time safety personnel specify safety support through the host-tenant agreement.
   8.1.4. Ground safety managers will use AFPD 91-series, other AFI 91-series and applicable
   federal, state, and AF guidance to establish the installation ground safety program.
   8.1.5. (Added-ACC) Ensure development of unit ground safety management or continuity
   books.
8.2. Host Ground Safety Staff Responsibilities:
   8.2.1. Ensure mishaps are investigated and reported in accordance with AFI 91-204.

   occupational safety, industrial safety, contractual safety requirements, sports and recreation
   safety, and traffic safety.
       8.2.2.1. Operational safety includes performing and/or assisting in operational risk
       assessments of wing mission, contingency exercises, and deployment operations.
       8.2.2.2. Occupational safety includes assisting supervisors perform JSAs and OHAs;
       report organizational compliance with OSHA, DoD, and AF safety requirements.
       8.2.2.3. Traffic safety includes both government and privately motor vehicles. As safe
       vehicle operation is a basic responsibility of the vehicle operator, installation safety staff
       will be responsible to ensure operators are properly educated. Safety personnel will work
       with installation security police, civil engineers, and transportation personnel to provide a
       well-rounded education program. Safety personnel will also be responsible to ensure the
       requirements of DoDI 6055.4 are being met.
       8.2.2.4. Sports and Recreation mishap prevention programs are the primary
       responsibility of the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Office. They will monitor on-base
       and Air Force-sponsored off-base sports facilities and activities. Civil engineer, medical,
       and safety staffs will provide assistance and technical guidance. Additionally, safety
       personnel will provide sports and recreational safety education materials and conduct
       inspections of sports and recreation facilities.
 60               AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001

       resources.
   8.3.2. Tenant units with full-time qualified safety personnel carry out all program elements
   not performed by the host and conduct their own assessments, inspections, and mishap
   investigation. Safety staffs do not evaluate their own programs.
8.4. Safety Standards. The Air Force publishes industrial and general ground safety standards
as AFOSH standards, which implement OSHA standards. Area-specific instructions and
technical data include other ground safety criteria. When AFOSH standards or safety criteria do
not cover a situation, use non-Air Force standards, including professional safety and health
standards, national consensus standards, and other Federal agency standards. MAJCOMs in
coordination with HQ AFSC will determine what operations and activities are considered
military unique where full OSHA compliance may not be capable. (NOTE: AFOSH standards
are primarily for functional manager, supervisor, and employee use to ensure the safety of their
operations.)
8.5. (Added-ACC) Industrial Safety Training Programs. Safety personnel assigned to units
with aircraft who have responsibilities to inspect units with a flying mission will attend TD or
AMQP familiarization training courses, when available, during their first 6 months of
assignment. Training conducted by the maintenance training flight may be used to satisfy this
requirement, but it must be documented.

                                              Chapter 9

                                       SYSTEM SAFETY

9.1. System Safety Principles. System safety disciplines apply engineering and management
principles, criteria, and techniques throughout the life cycle of a system within the constraints of
operational effectiveness, schedule, and costs. The degree of safety achieved in a system is
directly dependent upon government and contractor management emphasis.
   9.1.1. System safety is an inherent element of system design and is essential to supporting
   system requirements. Successful system safety efforts depend on clearly defined safety
   objectives and system requirements.
   9.1.2. System safety must be a planned, integrated, comprehensive effort employing both
   engineering and management resources.
   9.1.3. Follow this order of precedence to satisfy system safety requirements and resolve
   identified hazards according to Military Standard (MIL-STD)-882, System Safety
   Requirements:
       9.1.3.1. Design for minimum risk.
       9.1.3.2. Incorporate safety devices.
       9.1.3.3. Provide warning devices.
       9.1.3.4. Develop procedures and training.
NOTE:          The degree of safety achieved in a system id directly dependent upon government
and contractor management emphasis


9.2. System Safety Program Requirements:
   9.2.1. System safety engineering is an element of the systems engineering function and a
   part of the mishap prevention program. System safety programs must meet the requirements
   of the latest revision of MIL-STD-882 or Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Data Pacs. MIL-
   STD-882 has been deemed acquisition reform compliant by the Defense Standardization
   Improvement Council and shall be used on all applicable programs.
   9.2.2. Program managers must ensure that system safety engineering is an integral part of the
   systems engineering process and receives proper management attention. Program managers
   must provide direct lines of communication to the system safety staff to receive timely
   information on identified hazards that have high mishap potential.
   9.2.3. Management must ensure that safety offices monitor program requirements to identify
   and correct hazards throughout the operational life of a system or facility to ensure hazards
   are identified through operational experience, mission changes, environmental effects, or
   system modification. Management must also ensure that safety staffs identify and control all
   hazards associated with decommissioning or disposal of a system.
   9.2.4. Program safety offices must clearly define and document risk acceptance authority
   during life-cycle system decisions. ―Unacceptable‖ residual hazards (as defined by MIL-
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                          65


   STD-882C, appendix A, figure 2) can only be accepted by the Air Force Acquisition
   Executive (AFAE). ―   Undesirable‖ residual hazards (same reference) can only be accepted
   by the program executive officer (PEO), designated acquisition commander (DAC), or
   equivalent. In the case of a PEO program having an imbedded DAC sub-program (i.e.,
   aircraft engine) which involves an unacceptable risk at the system (e.g., aircraft) level, the
   DAC will coordinate on the document and forward it to the PEO for approval, or for
   coordination and submittal to the AFAE, as applicable. For each unresolved "unacceptable"
   or "undesirable" hazard, the PM will prepare a written residual risk assessment or acceptance
   document describing the residual hazard and assessing its overall risk. This document will
   be coordinated through the center or laboratory safety office and the MAJCOM Safety
   Directorate. The AFAE, PEO, or DAC will show his/her acceptance of the residual hazard
   by counter-signing the prepared document.
   9.2.5. Requesting proposals and invitations during a bid for system acquisitions (including
   test, maintenance and support, modification, and training equipment), you must include
   detailed and appropriate tailoring of the system safety tasks as outlined in MIL-STD-882.
   9.2.6. Each MAJCOM appoints a trained system safety manager to act as the point of
   contact to facilitate system safety matters.
9.3. Responsibilities:
   9.3.1. SAF/AQ Program Executive Officer (PEO):
       9.3.1.1. Furnishes safety risk assessments to the System Acquisition Review Council.
       9.3.1.2. Informs the Air Force Acquisition Executive (AFAE) of any significant residual
       hazards and associated program risks.
       9.3.1.3. Reviews all uncontrolled catastrophic and critical hazards before releasing
       programs to the next milestone phase.
       9.3.1.4. Accepts residual risks that the program manager is not authorized to accept and
       sends risks beyond PEO authority to the AFAE.
       9.3.1.5. Ensures a system safety program according to MIL-STD-882 is required for all
       programs.

   9.4.4. The US Air Force NNMSB may act as the SSG for all non-nuclear munitions.
   9.4.5. The program manager will be responsible for preparing minutes of SSG meetings and
   distributing them to SSG members and attendees 30 days after the meeting. SSG minutes
   shall be sent to HQ AFSC and the owning command. If a SSG is not held on a major
   program within a year of the previous meeting from the last one an explanatory letter shall be
   sent toHQ AF/SESC.
9.5. Non-developmental Items. These items, formerly known as commercial-off-the-shelf
(COTS) acquisitions, require system safety programs to review usage history, verify intended use
similarities, evaluate differences, and plan for adequate safety evaluation for all Air Force-unique
modifications or changes in use. For example, Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) certification
requirements are incrementally implemented and may not apply to all models or year groups of
similar aircraft. Operations from military fields and or with military support equipment provide
unique hazard opportunities that may not have been considered in the original design. Exercise
care in accepting FAA certification as a sufficient indication for safety of the design.
9.6. Risk Assessment and Management. Accomplish an appropriate assessment/analysis of
the safety and operational risks associated with all modification proposals and acquisition and
development efforts. Program safety offices must ensure all necessary engineering and design
data is produced and maintained to adequately document the risk decisions made, the design
changes incorporated to reduce or eliminate hazards and any residual risks and hazards left in the
system. Residual hazards and risk accepted and signed off by the appropriate authorities should
be thoroughly documented and periodically reviewed by using and developing commands. This
ensures that risk assessments are still appropriate and for available possible correction as part of
a later modification or redesign.
   9.6.1. Express risk as:
       9.6.1.1. Loss over a period of time.
       9.6.1.2. Loss over a number of events.
       9.6.1.3. Losses for a given population.
   9.6.2. Assess risk by determining:
       9.6.2.1. Recurrent hazards.
       9.6.2.2. Frequency of mishaps.
       9.6.2.3. Severity of mishaps.
       9.6.2.4. Exposure.
       9.6.2.5. Corrective actions that can eliminate mishaps or reduce risk.
(NOTE: See MIL-STD-882 for an explanation of the mishap-risk index method.)


9.7. SSEA. The SSEA program evaluates and approves new operations previously prohibited
due to the perceived risks. (Examples include hot pit refueling, integrated combat turn around
[ICT], and concurrent servicing.)
70              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


  9.7.1. SSEA of a proposed operation is performed by a highly qualified team under
  controlled conditions. The team conducts actual demonstrations and analysis of the
  operation to validate overall risk assessment and recommend actions. The SSEA team is
  normally chaired by the AFMC System Safety Office and includes experts from the
  developing, supporting, and operational commands.
  9.7.2. A using command requests a SSEA in writing to HQ AFMC/SES and informs HQ
  AFSC. Requests must include:
     9.7.2.1. A complete description of the proposed operation.
     9.7.2.2. Justification for accepting the increased risk.
     9.7.2.3. Recommended location and dates for the SSEA demonstrations.
     9.7.2.4. Identification of other DoD, Government, or foreign agencies that might be
     involved.
  9.7.3. The SSEA team reports the results of the analysis, including operational concepts,
  system descriptions, risk assessments, hazard analyses, descriptions of the demonstrations,
  and conclusions and recommendations.

                                    WEAPONS SAFETY

10.1. Weapons Safety Program Management. The weapons safety program comprises three
disciplines: explosives safety, missile safety, and nuclear surety.
   10.1.1. Units at and above squadron level with an explosives, missile, or nuclear mission
   must have a weapons safety program.
   10.1.1. (ACC)       Each unit will appoint an additional duty weapons safety manager
   (ADWSM) to administer the program. The primary role for the ADWSM/NCO is to work
   with the WSM on items that affect the unit and keep the commander informed. Sections
   below the squadron level employing, handling, destroying, transporting, maintaining, storing,
   installing, or removing missiles, explosives, chemical or nuclear weapons are encouraged to
   appoint a representative to assist the unit ADWSM. NAF/SEW will ensure NAF unique
   training (if applicable) is provided to weapons safety personnel and that personnel within
   their NAF are properly trained. Note: The two items left off, are site planning and mishap
   tracking. These should be covered in AFI 91-201 and AFI 91-204 respectively.
   10.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) The safety management program and the management
   book provide an effective way of organizing the administrative elements of the weapons
   safety program. Use the safety management program as the primary source for
   documentation and the management book as a backup. The management book should be
   neat and purged of outdated material.
   10.1.2. The host coordinates weapons safety for the entire base. Tenant units implement
   mission unique mishap prevention programs where the host does not have a mission in that
   area. Tenant units must coordinate any additional program functions with the host to avoid
   duplication.
   10.1.2. (MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Unit ADWSRs will ensure their applicable unit
   commander reviews the unit‘s weapons safety program upon assuming duties, and quarterly
   thereafter.
      10.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Ensure all required personnel receive weapons safety training.
      10.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Prepare weapons safety inspection checklists unless provided
      by HQ ACC.

          10.4.12.8.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Observe the way individuals
          handle, transport, maintain, operate and store explosives or missiles. This should
          comprise the bulk of the spot inspection program. In the work centers, check safety
          bulletin boards, safety briefings and general safety knowledge of personnel.
          10.4.12.8.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Check equipment, explosives,
          missiles, operating and storage areas used in handling these items and the condition of
          the items while in storage. Check licensed explosives facilities for adherence to
          justification letter and license limitations.
          10.4.12.8.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Training and education is a very
          important element of each weapons safety program. Training will include the unit
          commander and all personnel that work with explosives.
          10.4.12.8.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Unit ADWSR will ensure weapons
          safety training is accomplished through program monitoring.        The safety
          representative can provide the training or the commander may designate another
          trainer(s) to perform this function.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                           77


          10.4.12.8.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Each unit is required to produce an
          explosive/missile safety lesson plan tailored to the particular unit‘s needs. Applicable
          publications and technical directives should be consulted to ensure required elements
          are included. The lesson plan will contain a section for briefing lessons learned from
          safety education, publicity and cross feed information provided by 366 FW/SEW.
          Obtain 366 FW/SEW approval of the lesson plan and any changes prior to
          implementation.
          10.4.12.8.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Tailor tests for explosives/missile
          safety training to the lesson plan. Develop at least two distinctively different tests.
          Anyone failing to achieve a passing score of 80 percent will review the missed
          questions and re-test with the second test.
          10.4.12.8.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Documentation                   proves    the
          individual was trained on a specific date. Proper documentation of training is
          necessary to ensure it is retrievable for numerous audits conducted throughout the
          year.
          10.4.12.8.9. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Quarterly ADWSR meetings. 366
          FW/SEW will conduct a quarterly meeting with all unit ADWSRs. Utilize these
          meetings to pass information on a particular safety topic, discuss local safety trends,
          lessons learned and answer questions.
10.5. Explosives Safety Program Requirements. Units that maintain explosives must:
   10.5.1. With the assistance of base civil engineering and safety, submit explosive site plans
   according to AFMAN 91-201. The unit safety office is the OPR for all explosive site plans.

10.6. Missile Safety. Missile systems include ground-launched or air-launched systems and
subscale remotely piloted vehicles and subscale drones. The aerospace vehicle, ground support
and operational equipment, personnel, and the operational environment are all sources of
mishaps. Typically, missile launch operations will be conducted from a Major Range Test
Facility Base (MRTFB) range and will comply with DoDD 3200.11 MRTFB range safety
requirements as described in section 2.10.
10.6. (ACC) Missile safety program will be incorporated within respective areas of explosives
safety or nuclear surety programs.
10.7. Nuclear Surety. The goal of the nuclear surety program is to ensure that the Air Force
designs, maintains, transports, stores, and uses nuclear weapons with maximum safety, consistent
with operational requirements. AFI 91-101 contains nuclear surety program requirements.
10.8. Munitions Rapid Response Team. Hill AFB‘s Munitions Rapid Response Team is
manned with personnel knowledgeable in conventional munitions areas. This team is available
to support MAJCOMs and units whenever they have a conventional weapons mishap or problem.
They can be activated to respond within 24 to 48 hours. See Attachment 4, paragraph A4.6 for
specific guidance.
10.9. Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB). The DDESB is a joint board
of the DoD. It is subject to the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense,
under the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Environmental Security). The board consists of a
chairperson and an officer (colonel or above) from each of the military departments. In addition,
each military department must designate an alternate. Within the Air Force, HQ USAF/SE
provides the primary and alternate members. The DDESB establishes DoD explosives safety
policy and conducts surveys of DoD installations and furnishes a report to the installation
commander. Answer these reports through channels to HQ USAF/SE. See DoD 6055-.9-STD,
The DoD Explosives Safety Board, for further discussion of the DDESB and activities.
10.10. Weapons Safety Training.
   10.10.1. The MAJCOM weapons safety office must provide MAJCOM-unique training to
   their wing and NAF weapons safety personnel. MAJCOMs must ensure all weapons safety
   personnel in their command are properly trained. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units
   develop standardized local lesson plans if intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are
   not provided. Nuclear surety training requirements are listed in AFI 91-101.
   10.10.2. The base or unit weapons safety manager conducts this training, which augments
   the job training provided by the supervisor. The weapons safety staff evaluates and monitors
   unit weapons safety, approves lesson plans and reviews them annually. All personnel
   (supervisory and nonsupervisory) who operate, handle, transport, maintain, load, or dispose
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                            79


   of missiles, explosives, or nuclear weapons must receive initial weapons safety training
   before performing any of those tasks. Conduct recurring training annually thereafter, not
   later than the end of the month in which the initial training was conducted. Tailor the
   weapons safety training given to an individual to the specific duties and weapons systems.
   EXCEPTION: People who store and/or handle only the following are exempt from initial
   and refresher training: (a) Small arms ammunition, including cartridge-actuated tools in
   quantity-distance class/division 1.4; (b) Other class/division 1.4 items in their packaged
   configuration only. Personnel who will unpack and handle unpacked items still require
   training; (c) Document destroyers; (d) Small tear gas items (such as grenades); (e) Aircraft
   and facility fire extinguisher cartridges.
   10.10.3. (Added-ACC) Weapons safety training conducted during other formalized training
   such as Weapons Academics, Munitions Maintenance Training Program, etc., may satisfy
   requirements for training if lesson plans used have been approved by the WSM. Qualified
   instructors may augment the WSM for this training.
       10.10.3.1. (Added-ACC) Weapons safety training for TO 11A-1-33, Handling and
       Maintenance of Explosives Loaded Aircraft, will be provided to all personnel who may
       be dispatched to work on explosives loaded aircraft. This training is required initially and
       annually (not later than the end of the month in which the initial training was conducted)
       thereafter. The training will include how to identify armed aircraft and a familiarization
       of the hazards involved when working on or around explosives loaded aircraft.
       10.10.3.2. (Added-ACC) Overdue individuals will not perform any explosives or
       weapons related duty until training requirements are satisfied.
       10.10.3.3. (Added-ACC) Lesson plans and tests:
          10.10.3.3.1. (Added-ACC) The lesson plan for weapons safety training will be
          developed by the unit and will include work center peculiarities. Units will work with
          the wing safety office in preparation of the lesson plan. Any lesson plan changes or
          additions made by the OPR after approval must be coordinated with the wing safety
          office. Nuclear surety lesson plans require wing safety office approval as prescribed
          by AFI 91-101_ACC SUP 1. The WSM will review each lesson plan prior to
          implementation and annually thereafter. The WSM will also develop a training
          program, with lesson plans, for training of ADWSM.
          10.10.3.3.2. (Added-ACC) Tests will be prepared by the OPR and coordinated with
          the wing safety office. Individuals receiving weapons safety training must be given a
          closed book test at the conclusion of each training session. Test failures will receive
          immediate corrective training (classroom or self-study) and retest. The minimum
          number of test questions will be determined by training program objectives. The
          minimum passing grade is 80 percent. At least two distinctly different tests must be
          available and used. Change 25% of questions on primary and alternate test annually.
          The same questions rearranged, or with the multiple choices rearranged, are not
          considered ― distinctively different.‖
10.11. Explosive Safety Council. This council, chaired by AFSC, is composed of the chiefs of
weapons safety, or their representatives, from each MAJCOM. The council discusses matters of
 80             AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


mutual concern that cross MAJCOM lines. The council must hold periodic meetings, generally
following other meetings in which most representatives are already present.

                                           Chapter 11

                                       SPACE SAFETY

11.1. Space Safety Program Management. All units conducting space-related missions must
have a comprehensive space safety program.
11.2. Space Safety Program. Space safety consists of two elements: launch safety and orbital
safety. All units must tailor their space safety program to meet their mission requirements.
Space systems range from unique space support equipment to large boosters and satellites.
Launches, ground support and operational equipment, personnel, and the operational
environment are all sources of potential mishaps. Safe operations within the space environment
are only possible if positive mishap prevention programs are established and faithfully followed.
   11.2.1. Launch Safety. Modern launch vehicles operated by the Air Force have huge
   explosive potential, are unpiloted, and significantly less reliable than aircraft. Launch
   operations require a comprehensive safety program to ensure safe operations. The launch
   safety program covers activities associated with the ground handling, launching, and
   preorbital operations of space systems. It also includes activities connected with the
   deployment, operation, reentry, and recovery (if required) of test vehicles or payloads that
   don't attain orbit (either planned or unplanned). Failure to follow all range and ground safety
   requirements could cause a launch mishap. NOTE: Missile safety programs cover
   intercontinental ballistic missile test launches.
       11.2.1.1. Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Range Safety. Typically, launch
       operations will be conducted from an MRTFB range and will comply with DoDD
       3200.11 MRTFB range safety requirements as described in section 2.10.
       11.2.1.2. Launch Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to
       minimize the risk of collisions with other satellites or space debris during launch.
       11.2.1.3. Mission Flight Control. Space launch operators will have adequate measures in
       place to ensure complete control over launch vehicles at all times. The surrounding
       public will not be exposed to undue risk.
   11.2.2. Orbital Safety. The extremely high cost of orbital assets and irrecoverable nature of
   orbital operations makes orbital mishap prevention a critical component of orbital systems.
   The orbital safety program covers activities, after orbital insertion, associated with testing
   and operating space vehicles in orbit or deep space, including reentry, recovery and disposal.
   Orbital safety begins in the earliest phases of a program when considerations of this section
   must be incorporated in the design phase. Safety of orbital system is the responsibility of the
   owner or operator. Orbital safety programs should cover, at a minimum, the following areas:
       11.2.2.1. Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to minimize the
       risk of on-orbit collisions with other satellites or space debris. Collision avoidance should
       include maintaining separation of functional and non-functional space objects through
       coordinated launch window management, accurate tracking and orbital element set
       updating; and coordination of planned orbit changes and evasive maneuvering to preserve
       operational space systems and to avoid the generation of additional space debris
 82              AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


       11.2.2.2. Directed Energy Clearing House. Programs or experiments using directed
       energy, either ground or space-based, shall take appropriate action to minimize hazards or
       interference with spacecraft or the general public and property on the earth‘s surface or in
       the atmosphere.
       11.2.2.3. Orbital Debris Minimization. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize
       the generation of orbital debris during and after their service life.
          11.2.2.3.1. Booster disposal. Space vehicle boosters should be designed and planned
          to minimize hazards to future vehicles and the ground when their mission is complete.
          At a minimum vehicles should reenter the atmosphere or be moved into a disposal
          orbit at the end of its useful life where they will be less likely to interfere with
          operational spacecraft.
          11.2.2.3.2. Orbital vehicle end-of-life safing. Vehicles should safely reenter the
          atmosphere or be moved into a disposal orbit at the end of its useful life where it will
          be less likely to interfere with operational spacecraft. End-of-life safing actions for
          systems disposed of in space include, but are not limited to: venting all pressure
          vessels, safing batteries, safing any remaining ordnance systems and turning off any
          transmitters.
       11.2.2.4. Space Environment. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize damage
       due to natural phenomena such as meteoroids, solar radiation, spacecraft charging and
       high energy cosmic radiation, solar flares, etc.
11.3. Space Safety Training. MAJCOMs must ensure that space safety offices provide
adequate training to all individuals involved in space operations. Tailor safety training to
particular systems and the individual's specific duties. MAJCOMs must ensure that lesson plans
are developed to implement intermediate or MAJCOM guidance.
   11.3.1. Space Safety Managers (SSM), Orbital Safety Officers (OSO), and Space
   System Safety Engineer Training. Space safety personnel in these positions should have
   received the Introduction to Space Safety Course, and the Launch or Orbital Safety
   Management course appropriate to their unit mission and be experienced in the unit
   mission. Training should also include system safety analysis or system safety
   management courses, as well as orientation to the applicable areas of space safety
   covered under paragraph 11.2. above. Additional mission-specific training should be
   specified by the MAJCOM or unit.
   11.3.2. Launch Safety Training. Launch safety training augments the job training provided
   by the supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in
   addition to job training. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit launch safety,
   approves lesson plans and reviews them annually. All personnel (supervisory and
   nonsupervisory) who operate, handle, transport, maintain, or monitor space launch systems
   must receive initial launch safety training before performing any of those tasks. Conduct
   recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial
   training was conducted. Tailor the launch safety training given to an individual to the
   specific duties and launch systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop
   standardized local lesson plans if intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not
   provided. Launch safety training may be given by USRs or qualified unit personnel.
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                         83


   11.3.3. Orbital Safety Training. Orbital safety training augments the job training provided
   by the supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in
   addition to job training. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit orbital safety,
   approves lesson plans and reviews them annually. All personnel (supervisory and
   nonsupervisory) who operate maintain, or monitor orbital systems must receive initial orbital
   safety training before performing any of those tasks. Conduct recurring training annually
   thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial training was conducted.
   Tailor the orbital safety training given to an individual to the specific duties and orbital
   systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized local lesson plans if
   intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Orbital safety training may
   be given by USRs or qualified unit personnel.
11.4. Space Safety Council. This council, chaired by AFSC, is composed of the chiefs of space
safety, or their representatives, from each MAJCOM. The council discusses matters of mutual
concern that cross MAJCOM lines. The council must hold periodic meetings, generally
following other meetings in which most representatives are already present.
11.5. Space Nuclear Surety. The space nuclear surety program ensures that radioactive sources
and nuclear power systems used in space are designed, developed, built, maintained, stored,
handled, launched, and used (including final disposition) with the maximum safety and security
consistent with operational requirements. AFI 91-110 for nuclear safety review and launch
approval requirements and procedures for the use of nuclear powered system and radioactive

professional safety force. Standardized interviewing ensures an effective ground safety program.
Complete safety specialty descriptions are in AFMAN 36-2108.
A2.2. USAF Retraining Advisory Notes. USAF Retraining Advisory notes 410, 411, and 412
apply to the safety career field.
   A2.2.1. Note 410--Base Level OPR Requirement. The OPR functionally responsible for
   this AFSC must conduct a personal interview to evaluate entry qualifications that cannot be
   verified from personnel records or by other means. Send interview results to HQ AFSC/SER
   with the member's application or attach a statement that no OPR is available in the immediate
   locale.
   A2.2.2. Note 411. Certification by the commander or staff agency head assigned
   responsibility for the retraining in AFSC must accompany the application.
   A2.2.3. Note 412--MAJCOM OPR Requirement. The MAJCOM OPR functionally
   responsible for this AFSC must review the application and furnish a recommendation to
   MAJCOM training officials to help evaluate whether approving the request is in the best
   interest of the US Air Force and the member. NOTE: For more information on US Air
   Force training advisory notes, contact the base personnel formal training section.

                                     MISHAP RESPONSE

A4.1. General. Pre-mishap response planning by safety staffs must address appropriate
participation in all base-level responses, including:
   A4.1.1. Major Accidents
   A4.1.2. Hazardous materials accidents
   A4.1.3. Natural disasters
   A4.1.4. Nuclear weapons accidents
   A4.1.5. Conventional Munitions Incidents
A4.2. Base OPlan 32-1. The basic response planning document is Base OPlan 32-1. It consists
of separate annexes for Major Peacetime Accidents (Annex A), Natural Disasters (Annex B),
Enemy Attack (Annex C), and Distribution (Annex A). The host safety office should be
reflected in Annex Z and supported by tenants as locally required. A ― Safety‖ tab is required for
Annexes A and B; since losses due to hostile action are not investigated as safety mishaps, safety
personnel normally support Annex C activities only at the request of the installation commander.
A4.3. Planning Factors (All Accidents/Incidents/Unusual Occurrences).
   A4.3.1. Disaster Response Force (DRF).
       A4.3.1.1. The DRF is made up of the Disaster Control Group (DCG), the base command
       post, unit control centers, and specialized teams. If organizational manning permits, the
       host safety office should plan to establish a ―   unit control center‖ to coordinate safety
       activities between the accident scene and the supporting installation. If manning does not
       permit a separate safety unit control center, the safety staff must be reachable through the
       base command post.
       A4.3.1.2. Upon notification of a major peacetime accident, the safety staff typically
       begins to assemble an interim safety investigation board (SIB) in accordance with AFI
       91-204. This process should be kept separate from participation in the DRF or Disaster
       Control Group (see below) if possible. If manning permits, the interim SIB should
       assemble at a location away from the accident scene until the interim SIB members can
       be assigned to specific tasks.
   A4.3.2. Disaster Control Group (DCG). The DCG responds to peacetime major accidents
   and natural disasters to provide on-scene command and control of USAF military resources
   and functional expertise. Normally, the DCG consists of the following members: (see AFI
   32-4001 for more details).
       A4.3.2.1. On-Scene Commander (OSC)
       A4.3.2.2. Civil Engineer
       A4.3.2.3. Fire Department
       A4.3.2.4. Security Police
       A4.3.2.5. Medical Representative
AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001                                       105


       A4.3.2.6. Bioenvironmental Engineer
       A4.3.2.7. Maintenance
       A4.3.2.8. Munitions
       A4.3.2.9. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
       A4.3.2.10. Staff Judge Advocate
       A4.3.2.11. Services
       A4.3.2.12. Public Affairs
       A4.3.2.13. Communications-Computers
       A4.3.2.14. Safety
       A4.3.2.15. Weather. Ideally, the safety representative to the DCG should not be
       responsible for assembling the interim SIB.
A4.4. Source Documents for Specific Planning Criteria. The two primary sources of detailed
planning guidance for safety staffs are AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, and
AFP 127-1, USAF Guide to Mishap Investigation. The former contains an ―     Accident Response
Checklist‖ for DCG safety representative and guidance for developing a unit control center
checklist; the latter describes specialized equipment requirements and an expanded set of tasks
for interim SIB members.
A4.5. Safety Response to Other than Major Peacetime Accidents. Some mishaps may not
warrant a full activation of the DRF. However, the safety staff may need some DCG elements to
support investigation of these less severe incidents, such as Combat Camera or Civil
Engineering Specialists. Each safety staff should consult with their supporting base readiness
flight (disaster preparedness function) to determine how to formally provide for partial DCG
support when the full DRF is not activated.
A4.6. Munitions Rapid Response Team. OO-ALC/LIW has developed a conventional
munitions rapid response team to support Air Force units throughout the world anytime a
munitions incident occurs. This team is made up of experts (engineers, equipment specialists,
program managers, and safety personnel) from the conventional weapons and munitions
programs. These personnel are able to travel anywhere in the world within 24 to 48 hours to
assist in determining the cause of a failure. If your MAJCOM or unit has an incident, and this
team‘s help is desired, contact OO-ALC/LIW to request support by calling DSN 777-5156, 5053,
5055, or 4865 during duty hours. If after duty hours contact Hill AFB Command Post at DSN
777-3007 or Commercial (801) 777-3007.

                          WEAPONS SAFETY MANNING PLAN

A5.1. Requirement. It is critical for the Air Force to recruit strong performers into Weapons
Safety. Weapons Safety positions are filled by 2WXXX and 2MXXX NCOs using a Special
Experience Identifier (SEI). Most assigned individuals will be assigned to Weapons Safety only
once, for a two to three year period, in their career. Superior performers may be assigned two or
more times in increasingly challenging Weapons Safety positions. It is therefore essential that
candidates be fast learning, highly motivated individuals.
A5.2. Recruitment. The above requirement makes it necessary for individuals in the safety
office to actively recruit, whenever possible, when they are in units with the appropriate AFSCs.
Also, the Chief of Safety should be in close contact with the Logistics Group and appropriate
squadron commanders identifying well suited candidates. Wing staff experience, the ability to
work both flight line and munitions storage issues, and an opportunity to broaden an individuals
experience by learning the safety discipline, are all reasons for an individual to volunteer for
Weapons Safety. The communicative skills and wide range of responsibilities inherent in the
position are all desirable abilities for a potential senior NCO to have.
A5.3. Selection Process. When an individual volunteers to be assigned to Weapons Safety they
should go to the Safety office on the base they are assigned and be interviewed by the Chief of
Safety. The Chief of Safety, using the interview process in Attachment 2 of this AFI, will tailor
the process for Weapons Safety, working closely with the Chief of Weapons Safety. Names of
candidates who are well suited for assignment will be forwarded by the Chief of Safety to the
MPF. The MPF will then notify AFPC of the individuals eligibility and desires. Prior to
assignment if possible, the MAJCOM will send the individual TDY to the Weapons Safety
school. If possible the TDY should be accomplished in conjunction with the PCS.
A5.4. SEI Assignment. All individuals assigned to Weapons Safety must be trained within 90
days after assignment to Weapons Safety. If an individual arrives at the safety office without
training, work with the MAJCOM to immediately assign the individual to training. Upon
completion of training and six months in the assignment, generate SEI certification paperwork.
At that time the Chief of Safety, in coordination with the individual and the Chief of Weapons
Safety, will award the SEI to individuals who have demonstrated the skills needed to be assigned
to a more challenging Weapons Safety assignment. This is highly desirable, since many
assignments are at higher headquarters positions.

                 COMMANDER'S UNIT GROUND SAFETY PROGRAM

A9.1. (ACC)             (Added) Commander's Unit Ground Safety Program. The ACC
Ground Safety Program depends upon effective commander and unit ground safety programs.
The commander's safety program will allow for direct control and management of squadrons and
units within the organization. Since the majority of hazard abatement actions are the direct
responsibility of the functional manager, it is logical to provide the ground safety program from
the commander level down to the individual. It is also suggested that a commander's safety
council be established to emphasize and promote the safety program. The commander's support
of the unit's mishap prevention program will enhance combat capability and readiness
preparedness.
A9.2. (ACC)           (Added) Unit Responsibilities and Activities:
   A9.2.1. (ACC) (Added) The unit commander will maintain overall responsibility for the
   unit ground safety program. To assist in program management, the commander will:
       A9.2.1.1. (ACC)        (Added) Select an officer, NCO, or civilian knowledgeable in the
       mission and activities of the unit and who has a minimum of 1-year retainability at the
       time of selection. Selection will be made by letter with a copy sent to the ground safety
       office and another retained in the unit Ground Safety Management and Continuity Book.
       For units with multiple operations/activities or locations, commanders may appoint
       ground safety representatives who will be responsible to the unit ground safety
       representative for management of the ground safety program within their area of
       responsibility.
       A9.2.1.2. (ACC)       (Added) Release unit ground safety personnel to attend training
       and meetings as specified in this instruction.

       and AFI 91-301 are scheduled and attend.
       A9.2.1.6. (ACC)        (Added) Obtain a briefing on AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational
       and Environmental Safety, Fire Prevention, and Health (AFOSH) Program, and
       implement it in the unit (See Attachment 7 (Added)).
   A9.2.2. (ACC)      (Added) Unit ground safety personnel will accomplish the following:
       A9.2.2.1. (ACC)       (Added) Upon appointment, attend training scheduled by the
       ground safety office.
       A9.2.2.2. (ACC)       (Added) Brief the commander monthly on the status of the ground
       safety program. The briefing should be informal and may also include key members of
       the organization. The purpose of the briefing is to update the commander on the unit's
114             AFI91-202_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 5 OCTOBER 2001


      mishap experience, inspection results, education activities, and the pros and cons of the
      overall mishap prevention program.
      A9.2.2.3. (ACC)        (Added) Conduct safety self-inspections IAW AFI 91-202 or as
      determined by the local ground safety office. Units will maintain self-inspection reports
      in their unit management book. If discrepancies are identified that cannot be corrected at
      unit level, they will be forwarded to wing safety for resolution. Checklists provided by
      the ground safety office will be used as a guide during unit inspections.
      A9.2.2.4. (ACC)        (Added) Conduct an aggressive hazard reporting program as
      directed by Chapter 4 of this instruction. Ensure AF Forms 457, USAF Hazard Report,
      and instructions for their use are readily available to all personnel. Attaching this form
      and instructions to bulletin boards is one means of accomplishing this requirement.
      A9.2.2.5. (ACC)     (Added) Disseminate mishap prevention information such as
      mishap summaries, bulletins, messages, special subjects for inspection, seasonal safety
      programs, etc.

      A9.2.2.9. (ACC)       (Added) Establish written internal ground mishap reporting
      procedures. Notify the ground safety office of all unit ground mishaps.
      A9.2.2.10. (ACC) (Added) Unit Safety Representatives (USRs). Commanders and
      functional area managers not authorized full-time safety personnel will appoint collateral
      duty USRs to assist them in implementing the safety program within their organizations.
      Failure to appoint a USR does not relieve the unit commander of responsibility to comply
      with this directive. A copy of the appointment letter will be provided to the wing, center,
      or group safety office, which will provide training. Ground Safety Management and
      Continuity Books provide unit ground safety personnel with a one-source continuity
      document for records retention. The unit safety person will review the contents of the
      book each quarter to eliminate outdated material. If retention of an item is questionable,
      ask your local safety staff for guidance.
  A9.2.3. (ACC) (Added) The ground safety office will assist in the formulation of unit
  books and ensure composition is adequate and standardized throughout the wing/base.
      A9.2.3.1. (ACC)        (Added) The Ground Safety Management and Continuity Book is
      a reference file containing copies of official records filed in another location IAW
      AFMAN 37-139. If the official file is readily accessible, a copy need not be placed in the
