1. Program Objectives. The objective of the Little Rock AFB FOD/DOP program is to prevent
a negative impact on mission safety and AF resources through training, promoting awareness,
and enforcing FOD/DOP discipline in all aspects of aircraft operations on Little Rock AFB.
2. FOD Prevention.
     2.1. FOD prevention is the responsibility of all personnel working in, on, around, or
     traveling through areas near aircraft, munitions, aerospace ground equipment (AGE), engines
     or components. Personnel working in or transiting the aforementioned areas will comply with
     this instruction.
        2.1.1. Practice good housekeeping and hardware accountability at all times. Use parts
        bags at all times and attach to the associated component or area as applicable. Use
        attached tag to indicate types and totals of items inside and aircraft/equipment ID. Plastic
        “Ziploc” type bags are authorized as parts bags, provided they have a listing included on
        paper or have the contents annotated on the package with permanent ink. Locally
        produced part accountability kits are also authorized to account for component hardware
        (e.g., engine mount bolt kit).
        2.1.2. Hardware, shop stock, and work order residue control. Account for hardware, shop
        stock, and work order residue at all times while performing maintenance on and around
        aircraft, engines, and support equipment.
        2.1.3. Streamers and test equipment. Use “REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT” streamers on
        ground wires and any external cover(s) applied to the aircraft on the ground. Test
        equipment will have receptacles capped and cable ends protected with a cap/plug or bag
        when not in use.
            2.1.3.1. Cap and plug all disconnected aircraft/engine lines and electrical connectors ,
            unless immediately reconnected.
        2.1.4. Clothing restrictions. Hats are not authorized on the flight line or in engine test cell
        areas unless approved for medical reasons by an official waiver. If waivered, hats will
        have a chin strap, worn under the chin at all times. Authorized winter caps are approved
        for wear on the flight line or in engine test cell areas during cold weather. Remove all
        hats within 50 feet of an operating engine intake or within an operating engine’s
        exhaust/propeller blast area, unless secured to head by headsets, chin strap, etc. All
        personnel performing ground observer duties in engine test cell areas or during man-on-
        stand leak checks must clear pockets of foreign objects (pens, pencils, etc.) prior to
        engine operation.
        2.1.5. Metal boxcar seals (NSN 5340-00-081-3381) are prohibited from use in any
        aircraft maintenance area. Use the plastic seal (NSN 5340-01-244-1596) to secure aircraft
        and containers.
        2.1.6. Flight deck FOD inspections. Accomplish and document a flight deck FOD
        prevention inspection on AFTO 781A prior to flight. Pay particular attention to foreign,
        loose, or missing items (light lenses, covers, bulbs, and hardware) on all instrument,
        control, and circuit breaker panels. Areas around seat tracks, flight control inputs, and
        openings in the throttle quadrant and floor.
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-140 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          3


     2.1.7. Immediately install throttle quadrant covers after each flight and keep installed
     while the aircraft is on the ground, to include sealed spare and training aircraft. When
     removed to accomplish an engine run or maintenance in the throttle quadrant area,
     immediately re-install covers after area is not in use.
     2.1.8. Use FOD stickers on FOD containers and are available at the 19 AW/314AW
     FOD offices.
        2.1.8.1. Empty all FOD containers when full or at the end of each shift, whichever
        comes first.
  2.2. Wing-level FOD walks are conducted once a week. Maximum participation is required
  for wing-level FOD walks. Attendance is taken and reported weekly to Group/Wing
  leadership and quarterly at the FOD committee meeting. The following will attend Wing
  FOD walks: 19 AMXS, 19 MXG/QA, 19 EMS, 19 CMS, 19 LRS, 314 AMXS, 314
  MXG/QA, 41 AS, 48 AS, 50 AS, 53 AS, 61 AS and 62 AS. The 41 AS, 48 AS, 50 AS, 53
  AS, 61 AS, and 62 AS will provide operations personnel for FOD walks based upon
  operations tempo and deployment schedule.
     2.2.1. FOD walk procedures. Wing FOD walks require a minimum of 60; with a target of
     80 participants to assemble for each wing-level FOD walk. Personnel will assemble prior
     to FOD walk for roll call and a safety briefing. If the minimum number of participants is
     not reached, or if the that day falls on a holiday, the FOD is be rescheduled for the next
     duty day. Personnel will assemble at flight line parking spots Alpha 1 and Mike 1, at a
     time dependant on mission requirements, to maximize participation. The FOD walk is
     conducted in two phases; rows A-M and M-W. For safety reasons the FOD walk
     supervisor has ultimate authority in controlling procession of the line and personnel will
     disperse evenly as directed. Movement is at a slow pace, paying special attention to
     ground points, expansion joints, and cracks in pavement.
     2.2.2. Inclement weather procedures. FOD walks are cancelled or terminated during
     inclement weather (i.e., heavy fog (near zero visibility)), severe temperatures, or when
     the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) announces inclement weather warnings.
     2.2.3. Maintenance units will conduct FOD walks around individual aircraft after
     completion of any maintenance on, near, or around the aircraft, and after blocking out.
     The alternative procedure is for units to assemble a structured line once a day in their area
     and conduct a FOD walk, either method is acceptable.
  2.3. Towed FOD sweepers and airfield sweeper vehicles. Towed sweepers and sweeper
  vehicles are used for base FOD prevention efforts.
     2.3.1. The unit FOD representative or CTK will notify the applicable FOD office when a
     sweeper goes down for maintenance. Borrow sweepers from another unit to sweep
     required areas, which is credited to the unit pulling it. Only towed, non-metallic, rotating
     brush type sweepers are authorized for use on the aircraft parking ramp by 19 AW or 314
     AW units.
     2.3.2. The following outlines the units/flights responsibilities for maintaining a FOD
     sweeper program. 19 AMXS/Knights, 314 AMXS/Blue, 314 AMXS/Gold, 19
     EMS/AGE, 19 AMXS/Dragons, and 19 MOS/TA. The “FOD BOSS” brand towed FOD

       sweeper is utilized twice a week in the areas nearest to their respective area of
       responsibility. Don not pull the FOD sweeper on the same day as the wing level FOD
       walk to ensure full effectiveness of the program. Focus additional attention on parking
       spots recently vacated by aircraft. After days of inclement weather it is recommended that
       the FOD sweeper be pulled to ensure a FOD free ramp. The unit/flight FOD monitors are
       responsible for managing this program at the squadron level.
       2.3.3. Units will maintain a FOD sweeper sign out log. This log will contain the
       applicable sweeper operator manual and a general purpose form to track usage. As a
       minimum, the general-purpose form will contain the following information: name and
       rank, organization, date, time, and rows pulled.
       2.3.4. Use any available vehicle to pull the FOD sweeper so long as good coverage of the
       ramp is achieved. To prevent damage to the FOD sweeper, backing of the vehicle is
       prohibited with the FOD sweeper installed.
       2.3.5. Coordinate areas requiring airfield sweepers through the airfield manager.
    2.4. Airfield inspection and monitoring.
       2.4.1. Representatives from 19 OSS/OSAA, 19 CES, 19 AW/SE, and the 19 AW/CVF
       will attend and conduct a monthly ramp inspection. The 19 AW/CVF or 19 OSS/OSAA
       will document the inspections of damaged pavement, flight line construction, and other
       FOD hazards in or near aircraft parking ramps, taxiways, and access roads.
       2.4.2. Results of these inspections are tracked on a locally developed worksheet and
       briefed monthly to 19 AW/CV at a minimum and quarterly at the FOD committee
       meeting.
    2.5. Engine/propeller maintenance. Aircraft engine/propeller maintenance is a FO/FOD
    critical area. All personnel will exercise caution when performing maintenance in these areas.
    Strict tool and hardware control practices are enforced during engine/propeller and
    GTC/APU maintenance.
       2.5.1. Do not remove covers (e.g., engine inlet, pitot tube(s), and protective covers) prior
       to flight until an engine intake and exhaust inspection is accomplished and install within
       1 hour following engine shutdown or upon completion of the -6 Inspection, whichever
       comes first. Engine inlet covers are installed prior to any maintenance performed on the
       engine/propeller forward of the engine firewall. Inspect all covers after any severe
       weather condition to ensure serviceability and inventory. These requirements are also
       applicable to all training aircraft.
       2.5.2. (C-130J/ AE2100D3 only) . Engine blade damage. Upon discovery of blade
       damage, annotate AFTO form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document on
       a red diagonal. A propulsion 7-Level (2A671) or field level engineering expert will
       determine if the damage is outside the limits identified in the applicable job guide or
       technical data. Blade blending is not authorized on the AE2100D3 engines.
           2.5.2.1. (C-130E/H/T56-7/15 only) . Engine blade damage. Upon discovery of
           blade damage, annotate AFTO form 781A, on a red diagonal and notify the MOC,
           respective QA and/or FOD offices prior to any rework of blades.
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-140 25 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        5


         2.5.2.2. (C-130E/H/T56-7/15 only) . When blending is required; measure the
         damage using a borescope. At this time, the original discrepancy will be upgraded to
         a Red-X symbol.
         2.5.2.3. (C-130E/H/T56-7/15 only) . A propulsion 7-Level (2A671) will determine
         if damage is repairable/non-repairable by conducting a thorough visual inspection of
         the engine inlet, 5th and 10th stages, and turbine exhaust areas. Contact Air Force or
         field-level engineering experts to assist in determining repair limitations, if needed.
         2.5.2.4. (C-130E/H/T56-7/15 only) . Blade blending (installed and uninstalled
         engines, other than minor nicks and scratches). Follow the guidance in AFI 21-101
         and complete the LRAFB Form 140, Blade Blending Worksheet , or approved work
         package tracking sheet (uninstalled engines only) and forward by e-mail to the
         applicable 19 AW/314 AW FOD monitors and faxed to the engine management
         branch (EMB).
         2.5.2.5. When damage is blended or been previously blended with no rework
         required, the applicable areas are coated/recoated with blue layout dye and annotated
         in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
     2.5.3. Wear AF Form 1199, Restricted Area Badge, and passes IAW AFI 21-101. Secure
     the badge by passing a cord through the hole, using a metal clip, or using a arm/neck
     lanyard, to prevent loss.
  2.6. Vehicles. Vehicles are potential FO/FOD hazards. Maintain all vehicles FO-free at all
  times. Check vehicles, tires, and magnetic FOD bars for cleanliness prior to use, at the
  beginning of each shift. If the vehicle requires an AF Form 1800 or 1807, annotate the
  vehicle FOD inspection in the “Others” section. If the vehicle goes onto a public access road
  or leaves the paved surface, re-inspect the tires and FOD bar at the marked FOD check points
  on the Flightline Drive access roads. Vehicles that are not used daily on the flightline will
  conduct tire FOD checks each time the vehicle enters the ECP. Vehicles involved in an actual
  emergency response are exempt from these tire checks. During hours of darkness, use a
  bright flashlight for this inspection.
     2.6.1. FOD containers are required on forklifts and grove cranes that operate on the flight
     line. FOD bags and pouches are authorized for use in place of metal FOD containers.
     2.6.2. Magnetic FOD bars are highly recommended on all dispatch/expediter vehicles.
     Vehicles exempt from this requirement are as follows: Crash/recovery vehicles,
     mules/golf carts, tow vehicles, grove crane, forklifts, security forces vehicles, other
     special purpose vehicles, to include temporary vehicles due to maintenance being
     performed, and any vehicles not operated frequently on the flight line.
     2.6.3. Due to safety concerns, install magnetic FOD bars on the back bumper of vehicles.
     Vehicles equipped with magnetic FOD bars on the front will have the bar moved to the
     back bumper through attrition.
     2.6.4. GSA leased vehicles. Use FOD bars on GSA leased vehicles. Special paperwork
     or authorization is not required provided original holes in bumpers or frames are used.
     Any drilling requires prior authorization from GSA program coordinators.
 6                                          LITTLEROCKAFBI21-140 25 SEPTEMBER 2012


            2.6.4.1. Install FOD bars approximately 3”- 5” off the ground. Remove all FOD bars
            prior to turn in to vehicle maintenance and reinstalled immediately upon return.
     2.7. Prevention is the proactive approach and primary goal to eliminating FOD. Detection is
     the reactive approach and the secondary goal of eliminating FOD.
        2.7.1. Prevention methods include, but are not limited to, good housekeeping, use of
        FOD bags, new and used hardware control, proper use and labeling of parts bags, picking
        up items as they are dropped, and use of caps, plugs, and covers.
        2.7.2. Detection methods include, but are not limited to, use of magnetic FOD bars on
        vehicles, FOD walks, FOD sweepers, FOD bosses, post maintenance FOD inspections,
        and engine intake and exhaust inspections.
     2.8. Since everyone plays a role in FOD prevention, they have the right/duty to suggest new
     and innovative ideas on prevention and detection methods, as well as, improvements to the
     FOD program. Submit these ideas to your respective Wing FOD monitor.
3. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP).
     3.1. DOP is the responsibility of all aircraft operators and maintainers.
        3.1.1. Accomplish DOP inspections prior to flight and after all maintenance actions are
        completed. Inspect AETC aircraft IAW LCL-314AW-17, Dropped Object Prevention.
        Inspect AMC aircraft IAW LCL-19MXG-002, Dropped Object Prevention Program
        (DOPP) 7- level Panel Inspection. Document these DOP inspections on AFTO 781A
        using a Red dash symbol.
        3.1.2. When an aircraft lands and a pre-flight or thru-flight is not required, a DOP
        inspection is not required before the next flight. However, if maintenance was performed,
        an item was removed or replaced, or routine servicing was completed, as a minimum,
        inspect the immediate area where the task was performed to ensure security using the
        applicable DOP inspection steps. Document this follow-up inspection in the AFTO
        Forms 781A as a limited DOP inspection on a Red dash symbol and include the areas
        inspected in the corrective action block.
4. Reporting and Investigations.
     4.1. When a FOD or dropped object incident is discovered, unit supervision will
     immediately notify the MOC. The MOC will notify the applicable 19 AW/314 AW
     FOD/DOP monitors and QA offices. Impound aircraft/engine as required IAW AFI 21-101
     and applicable operating instructions.
        4.1.1. The respective 19 AW/314 AW FOD/DOP offices will accomplish all FOD and
        dropped object investigations. The unit discovering the incident will complete LRAFB
        Form 80, Cost Estimate Worksheet and LRAFB Form 74, Dropped Object Informational
        Worksheet. Submit cost estimate and information worksheets the next duty day to the
        applicable 19 AW/314 AW FOD/DOP offices. This time allotment ensures timely
        reporting to headquarters as required per AFI 21-101 and MAJCOM supplements. When
        possible, interview crewmembers prior to leaving debrief. Consult the Air force Safety
        Center website at http://afsafety.af.mil/ “Hourly Labor Rates” chart for current rates.

      available) within 5 working days to the 19 MXG/QA or 314 MXG/QA, as applicable.
      4.1.4. Units will support investigating officials as requested.
      4.1.5. For compressor FOD investigations where the impacting item is not easily
      identifiable, use the privately contracted forensic metal sampling process from Failure
      Analysis Service Technology or “FAST” sampling. This will be at the request of the
      owning Wing or the applicable FOD monitor; however, the Wing is responsible for the
      cost of this service (approximately $1,800).
5. Training.
   5.1. Initial FOD prevention training for aircraft maintenance personnel will be conducted
   during maintenance orientation briefing and will include results from previous FOD/DOP
   investigations.
   5.2. Recurring FOD/DOP prevention training for aircraft maintenance personnel will be
   conducted during maintenance block training.
   5.3. Unit and flight FOD/DOP representatives will receive training on requirements
   associated with their position from the applicable FOD/DOP monitor.
6. FOD/DOP Program Management.
   6.1. The 19 AW/314 AW FOD/DOP monitor will perform duties of the 19 MXG/314 MXG
