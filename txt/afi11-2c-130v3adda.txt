                                            POLICY

1.1. Sound Judgment. Instructions in this AFI are mandatory and provide the best possible
operating instructions under most circumstances, but cannot account for every possible situation
that a crewmember may encounter during contingency operations. During these times, the
loadmaster must use his/her sound judgment and operational risk management to meet mission
demands.
1.2. General. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment configuration, standard
equipment, and location of such equipment aboard the C-130E(H)/H/(K)H/(L)H and WC-130H
aircraft. In order to meet HQ AF guidance toward conserving fuel, equipment will be removed
to reduce the aircraft weight In Accordance With (IAW) Tables 2.1., 2.2., and 2.3. Aircraft will
not have tool boxes larger than the standard crew chief tool box, nor large garbage cans onboard
the aircraft. Some C-130 aircraft have additional approved equipment installed that may affect
configuring the aircraft as listed. For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an
average time annotated and number of personnel to configure the airplane. The times quoted are
approximate figures and are configuration times only. They do not include de-configuration
times. (For example, to reconfigure from a P-1 configuration, 92 sidewall and center aisle seats
to a C-1 configuration (clean floor) requires more than one-half hour for one person, which is the
time allocated to configure a C-1 configuration.
1.3. Responsibility. Operational plans must consider the most appropriate configuration that
satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to
change. USAF units performing services on the C-130 aircraft (i.e., maintenance, aerial port,
and aircrew flight equipment) are responsible for configuring the aircraft IAW this instruction
and as outlined in mission directives, to include the stowage/installation of the equipment IAW
the configuration and equipment tables. Maintenance personnel will ensure all required and
mission specific equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements according
to Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Some equipment listed in Table 2.2 is roll on/roll off equipment controlled
by unit designated personnel (i.e. CDS/EPJS kits, etc.). Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
personnel will ensure all life sustaining equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission
requirements according to Table 2.3. Before home station departure, maintenance personnel are
responsible for configuring the aircraft (including modifications) to meet mission requirements
in accordance with Figures 3-1 thru 3-30. For the CP-2 through CP-5 configurations, the
sidewall seats will be stowed to facilitate preflight of the dual rails and then lowered by aircrew
with maintenance assistance. After departure from home station, the aircrew will accomplish all
configurations with assistance by maintenance/aerial port personnel if available. Aircrew
personnel, during preflight, will ensure required mission equipment has been provided and is
properly installed. When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time,
the loadmaster will assist in the completion of the configuration, after accomplishing required
pre-departure duties (i.e., preflight, loading, etc.). Loadmasters have overall responsibility for
configuration management and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft.
1.4. Standard Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to C-130 cargo
compartment configurations. The number that identifies the configuration capability will follow
8                                                    AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA 13 AUGUST 2009


the letter code (i.e., TAC-2). Standard codes for items listed in Table 2.2., Mission Specific
Equipment, are listed in Attachment 2. Use the codes when equipment is required for a specific
mission type.
    1.4.1. A* - Armor Equipped Aircraft
    1.4.2. AE - Aeromedical Evacuation
    1.4.3. C - Cargo
    1.4.4. CP - Cargo and Passengers
    1.4.5. P - Passengers
    1.4.6. TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop
    1.4.7. TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo
    1.4.8. WX - Weather
    1.4.9. NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration
1.5. Modifications . Configuration codes of this instruction may require modifications for a
specific mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to
ensure maximum flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive
will identify the basic configuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy the
mission requirement. For example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters
than available in configuration AE-1. Consult the appropriate configuration charts to determine
at what location the desired additional litters can be installed and which seats must be removed.
Indicate in the mission directive, by position (left or right, and number) which seats are to be
deleted and (by alphabetical position) the litter tier provisions to be installed; i.e., configuration
AE-1(Mod), remove seats 12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D.
1.6. Weight and Balance. Configuration equipment and necessary supply changes affect
aircraft weight and balance. To standardize equipment and the location of the equipment, items
shown in Table 2.1 will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft
except for maintenance and inspection. Equipment listed in Tables 2.2 and 2.3 will be added as
necessary and entered in references 5, 6, or 7 of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
Form F-Transport/Tactical. DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.
When the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of Mean Aerodynamic Chord
(MAC) zero fuel. NOTE: The addition of aircraft defensive systems, armor, and other
modifications produces an extreme forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load
center of balance within the range of F.S. 550 to F.S. 575.
1.7. Revisions . To recommend changes, conflicts, suggestions, or recommendations to
departmental publications, use the AF Form 847 and route it through the publishing channels to
the OPR for the publication.
1.8. Aircraft Configuration Waivers and Supplements. Follow waiver protocol in AFI 11-
2C-130, Volume 3. MAJCOMs forward approved requests to HQ AMC/A3V.
AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA 13 AUGUST 2009                                                                     9


                                              Chapter 2

                           CONSOLIDATED EQUIPMENT TABLES

2.1. General . Configure all models of C-130 aircraft with the equipment listed in Table 2.1.,
Required Equipment. Items listed in Table 2.2., Mission Specific Equipment, are added, as
necessary, to attain a specific configuration/comply with mission directives. Configure with
standard quantities of aircrew flight equipment (AFE) IAW Table 2.3., Aircraft Installed Aircrew
Flight Equipment Configuration.
   2.1.1. During aircraft contingency/deployment generations, it is imperative aircraft deploy
   with the full complement of AFE. This equipment must be at forward operating locations to
   allow maximum mission flexibility when aircraft are away from home station. In the event
   installed AFE inspection dates expire while the aircraft is on alert status or away from
   operating location, place these items in the AF Form 781A on a red dash until the aircraft
   goes off alert or returns to operating location. When aircraft is released from alert or returns
   to operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-1.
2.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment Aircraft Transfer Requirements. When transferring aircraft;
position life sustaining equipment IAW permanent transfer configuration. Losing unit will
contact the gaining organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed
AFE and inspection records. The gaining organization will conduct an acceptance inspection
and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective
MAJCOM IAW TO 00-20-1. Without documented coordination and approval, do not transfer
aircraft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization must make up any
shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
2.3. Aircrew Flight Equipment Life Sustaining Equipment Overhead Racks. Handle AFE
with care to avoid damage to this life sustaining equipment. AFE life sustaining equipment will
always be placed in the overhead racks, unless stowed elsewhere for airplane CG limitations for
all airplanes. The primary purpose of all overhead racks is for AFE life sustaining equipment.
Other items of equipment placed in the overhead racks must not interfere with AFE life
sustaining equipment and be easily secured. Oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids will not be
placed on the rack when AFE life sustaining equipment is installed.
2.4. Aircraft Returning From Off station. To minimize AFE reconfiguration time upon return
from off station operations, crewmembers must return parachutes, kits, and AFE life sustaining
equipment to their primary position after each mission. Upon return from off station operations,
AFE personnel will ensure the aircraft is returned to local training configuration at earliest
opportunity not to exceed five work days. Maintenance personnel will ensure any mission specific
equipment is removed from the aircraft at earliest opportunity not to exceed five work days. The
five work day rule does not apply if the aircraft will not be flown during that period. In this case the
aircraft will be in the proper configuration prior to next flight. All added equipment will be removed;
under no circumstances will an aircraft be flown in a partial configuration . EXCEPTION: 109
OG/CC with concurrence of theater commander may tailor the equipment onboard LC-130
aircraft for polar missions. EXCEPTION: OG/CCs with aircraft considered ―Restricted‖ due to
center wing box cracks may remove equipment onboard to maximize local training requirements.
Any removed equipment must be placed back onboard the aircraft before departing home station
for a scheduled mission that may require the equipment.

NOTES:
1. One EPOS per passenger/patient will be available regardless of planned flight altitude.
EPOS do not have to be stationed at each seat, they may be placed throughout the cabin/cargo
area so that any passenger/patient has quick access to oxygen regardless of where they are
should loss of pressurization occur.
2. One attached to the inboard seat belt mount of flight deck lower bunk and two stowed on
parachute rack.
3. Required for overwater flights. When parachutes are carried LPU-10/P quantities will
match parachutes. LPU-10/Ps are designed to integrate with AFE used by aircrew personnel.
A/C LPUs are not compatible and shall not be used with parachutes, survival vest, ABA, and
Aircrew Eye Respiratory Protection System (AERPS).
4. Four PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment.
5. Only required on contingency missions.
6. Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees north or below 60 degrees
south (IAW federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135, Part 135.98, Operations in the Polar
Area and FAR Part 121, Appendix P, Requirements for ETOPS and Polar Operations) will
configure the aircraft with the appropriate quantity of anti-exposure suits prior to mission
execution.
7. Preposition parachutes during contingency missions with hostilities and hazardous
functional/acceptance check flights. When carried, aircraft will have one parachute per
crewmember. Each crewmember will wear or fit and have readily accessible for bailout. ML-4
kits are required only for overwater flights when parachutes are carried.

                                              Chapter 3

     FLOOR PLANS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA

3.1. General . This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan
format and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment.
3.2. Configuration . Although modifications to the basic configurations are authorized to meet
special requirements, the following factors should be considered.
     3.2.1. Single sidewall seats shall not be used unless connected to a double sidewall seat
     (except for specific configurations). Seats are numbered for identification and will be
     referred to as sidewall seat 1-left/1-right or center aisle seat 1-left/1-right, etc. To allow
     unrestricted access to the flight deck and/or crew entrance door, seats 1-left and 2-left, will
     be stowed when they are not needed to accomplish a specific mission.
     3.2.2. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
     palletized, netted cargo. This does not apply to palletized, netted cargo supplemented with
     chains or chain bridle assemblies. When palletized or non-palletized cargo is secured with
     aircraft tie down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION: When carrying
     litters, 30-inch spacing will always be maintained regardless of cargo type or restraint used.
     3.2.3. The normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches; however, spacing will be as mission
     dictates. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch
     spacing.
     3.2.4. The height of cargo in pallet position one may be restricted if overhead equipment
     racks are installed which protrude into the cargo area. This restriction will be 76 inches and
     will begin at the inboard side of the dual rails and extend inboard for 12 inches. This
     restriction could be on either or both sides of the aircraft.
     3.2.5. For flight, the weight limit on the aircraft ramp is limited to 4,664 pounds of palletized
     cargo in pallet position six, including the weight of pallet and nets, or 4,824 pounds floor
     loaded cargo (ramp intermediate conveyors removed and stowed forward of ramp). See T.O.
     1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Manual, for other restrictions.
     3.2.6. Changes in configuration may affect the overall aircraft center of gravity (CG).
     NOTE: The addition of aircraft defensive systems, armor, and other modifications produces
     an extreme forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load center of balance
     within the range of F.S. 550 to F.S. 575.
     3.2.7. To allow access to aft latrine facilities, a 20-inch clear area is required on the forward
     left or right side of a pallet in position six (C-130H, 83-0486 and up have the latrine facilities
     on the right side). A safety aisle is required in pallet positions one (AMP only), three, four,
     and six. (Para 4.2.3 and Figure 4.1)
     3.2.8. Parachutes will be carried as required IAW Table 2.3. When passengers/troops are
     carried with parachutes onboard, up to four seats will not be available in the cargo
     compartment.
AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA 13 AUGUST 2009                                                                   19


   3.2.9. Portable cargo winches will only be carried on combat/contingency missions unless
   tasked by mission requirements. Trashcans, other than the integral refuse containers, will not
   be carried (except on WC-130 airplanes).
   3.2.10. Location of dual rail locks and seat stanchions is provided in Table 4.4 for load
   planning information.
   3.2.11. For aeromedical evacuation (AE) configurations, the final litter equipment
   configuration and aeromedical evacuation crewmember (AECM) seating will be determined
   by the Medical Crew Director (MCD) and Charge Medical Technician (CMT). AECM seat
   locations may vary in the cargo compartment based on patient/cabin observation
   requirements. Overhead equipment racks, missile defense system modifications, AMP
   mission processors, and secure voice communications system will decrease litter capacity in
   the litter tiers adjacent to their installation. Six seats are required for AECMs/loadmaster. For
   all AE configurations, the seats are numbered for identification from the front to the rear and
   will be referred to as seat 1-left, or seat 1-right, etc. Litter tiers are identified alphabetically
   and litter spaces identified numerically from the lowest (1) to the highest (5). On litter tier
   configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses indicates the total litters per tier. For
   AE configurations, roller conveyers will be removed from the area where litters and seats are
   rigged. They will be stowed on top of restraint rail assemblies, (and/or under center aisle
   seats for some configurations) and forward of the troop doors, except for those required for
   the baggage pallet. EXCEPTION: If no other option is available but to stow conveyors in
   the troop door area, stack them no more than two high. Available seating may be limited by
   AE equipment, which may be secured in unused seats if floor space is limited. Portable
   therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) must be stowed so as not to come into contact with fuels
   or hydraulic fluids. NOTE: Five oxygen walk around bottles/PBEs will be available for AE
   personnel on AE configurations.

   3.3.1. Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.
   Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as
   determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations. EXAMPLE: Sidewall litter spaces may
   not be available due to installation of aircraft equipment.
   3.3.2. Consideration should be given to cargo size to allow adequate legroom for passengers
   when loading rolling stock next to passengers. For cargo width up to 76 inches, passengers
   can be seated on both sides of the cargo; for cargo widths 77-96 inches, passengers can be
   seated on one side of the cargo if the cargo is offset to one side; and for cargo widths 97
   inches or greater, no passengers can be seated next to the cargo. For pallet positions three and
   four (wheel well): for cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers can be seated on both sides;
   for cargo widths 53-72 inches, passengers can be seated on one side of the cargo if the cargo
   is offset; and for cargo widths 73 inches and greater, no passengers can be seated next to the
   cargo.
   3.3.3. Drawings in this chapter are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft
   locations. Clear space depicted forward of center aisle seat number one and aft of seat
   number 20 on TAP-1 configuration is unusable.

     3.3.4. Seat totals listed in the various configurations include those seats designated for
     aircrew loadmasters.
3.4. Troop Life Preserver . When paratroopers are configured to jump near or over large
bodies of water; the service being airdropped will furnish required life preservers. Life preservers
indicated in the applicable configurations will only be provided for emergency ditching
operations when paratroopers are not configured with their own.
3.5. Crew/Passenger/Troop Drinking Water. Each basic configuration provides for an
adequate amount of drinking water. For example, a two-gallon water container will always be
provided; and for missions requiring more water IAW with Table 5.5, additional containers are
available. Table 5.5 is provided to assist in determining minimum water quantities. The gallon
amounts are based off of 16 oz per person up to six hours and 8 oz every three hours thereafter.
The table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to cause mission
delay or refusal to airlift passengers. At no time will a mission be flown with no water aboard.
NOTE: When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water source is
unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission.
3.6. Configuration Floor Plans. Configuration floor plans are depicted on Figure 3.1 through

                                     REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains information to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that ensures the
following emergency exits and safety aisles are available:
   4.2.1. Equipment will not be positioned in a manner that obstructs the side emergency
   escape hatches. An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid
   evacuation. Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered to be an
   obstruction.
   4.2.2. One unobstructed emergency exit will be available for each 20 passengers/troops.
   (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
   egress.)
   4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisleway will be maintained in
   the pallet positions one (C-130 AMP only) three, four (wheel well) and six (ramp area) to
   provide access to emergency exits. In pallet positions one, three and four, the aisleway will
   be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will
   begin at the cargo floor or dual rail outboard frame. The dual rail outboard frame provides
   eight inches of the 14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1.). Tiedown
   equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an
   obstruction. In pallet position six (ramp area) the aisleway will be a minimum of eight inches
   beginning at the outboard edge of the dual rail outboard frame. The aisleway should
   normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisleway is placed on the right side of the
   aircraft, clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained. Additionally, access to
   aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the forward left or right side of cargo
   loaded on the ramp. On C-130 E(H), and H (prior to 83-0486) the clear area must be on the
   left side of the pallet. On C-130H (83-0486 and up) the clear area must be on the right side
   of the pallet.
   4.2.4. If the aisleway requirement in paragraph 4.2.3. cannot be achieved on missions
   carrying crew only or mission-essential personnel (MEP) authorized by operations order/plan
   or DIRMOBFOR, then an aisleway will be maintained in pallet positions one (C-130 AMP
   only), three and four (wheel well) that provides a minimum of 14 inches between the outer
   edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above the
   floor/pallet/platform or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the
   aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform (Figure 4.2).
   MAJCOM A3/DO is authorized to waive this requirement based on MAJCOM Stan/Eval
   evaluation and recommendation.
   4.2.5. During airdrop missions, loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to
   accomplish tactical checklists.
   4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to
   the rear of the aircraft. Cargo in Chapter 6 of T.O. 1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require
   a waiver.

5.1. Introduction . This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD
Form 365-4 (Weight and Balance Clearance Form F). The DD Form 365-4 will be computed
manually, or with the approved C-130 Automated Form F (AFF) program. All entries and
signatures must be legible.
5.2. Load Planning . The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the
loaded aircraft will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating
condition. Consideration must also be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and
emergency jettisoning. Math, charts contained in T.O. 1C-130E-5, Basic Weight Checklist and
Loading Data, the C-130 AFF program and aircraft load adjuster (slipstick) are tools which may
be used for load planning. When the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of
Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) zero fuel.
5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to Transport Forms F using simplified
moments. Entries on the form may be either typed, handwritten, or computer entered (See C-130

Table 5.1. C-130 E/H Limiting Wing Fuel Tables.


1. This table may be used to determine the maximum limiting wing fuel ACL for a given fuel load when
in primary or secondary fuel management. Table weights are expressed in thousands. When using this
chart, round off takeoff and landing fuel to the lowest thousand pounds, subtract the remaining fuel from
the charted base weight to arrive at the corrected base weight. The following example is provided:
Takeoff fuel is 25,800 pounds, round off fuel to 25,000, at 25,000 pounds of fuel chart base weight is
130,000, subtract remaining fuel, 800 pounds, corrected base fuel weight is 129,200 pounds. Use this
procedure for both takeoff and landing fuel. Enter the most restrictive weight in the fuel block in the
limitations column.
2. Both takeoff and landing conditions must be calculated. The most restrictive will be used on the
Form F.
NOTE: This chart may be used under normal operations. If for any reason the aircraft gross weight is
restricted, operating at overload gross weights, or the fuel balance is not IAW the primary/secondary
fuel charts, then the appropriate charts in T.O. 1C-130X-1, Section V, must be used to determine ACL.
NOTE: Refer to T.O. 1C-130X-1, Section V for the definitions of primary and secondary fuel
management.
