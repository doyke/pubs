                                                 Chapter 1

                                 THE PHOENIX RAVEN PROGRAM

1.1. General. The PHOENIX RAVEN (PR) Program is designed to ensure adequate protection for AMC
aircraft transiting airfields where security is unknown or deemed inadequate to counter local threats.

1.2. Concept of Operations. Teams of two to four specially trained and equipped Security Forces per-
sonnel will deploy as Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) on AMC missions designated by the
AMC Threat Working Group (AMC TWG) as RAVEN required locations (RRL). The PR teams will
deter, detect, and counter threats to AMC personnel and aircraft by performing close-in aircraft security;
advising aircrews on force protection measures; accomplishing airfield assessments to document existing
security measures and vulnerabilities and assist aircrew members in the performance of their duties, when
not performing PR duties. The PR teams should be considered for all types of AMC airlift missions (Pro-
tection Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) including contingencies, exercises, or deployments.
    1.2.1. Airlift and tanker aircraft transiting airfields at en route locations are designated as Protection
    Level 3 resources by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Pro-
    gram. AMC aircraft should maintain this priority or higher. Resources designated Protection Level 3
    are provided a level of security resulting in a reasonable degree of deterrence to espionage or hostile
    acts directed against them. Failing deterrence, the level of security must provide the ability to detect a
    hostile force and limit the damage done to the resource.

1.3. Mission Tasking Process.
    1.3.1. The AMC TWG recommends PR teams accompany Protection Level 1, 2, 3, and 4 AMC air-
    craft. The AMC TWG determines the minimum PR team size required to perform the mission based
    upon threats, mission duration, and ground times.
       1.3.1.1. KC-10 and C-5 airlift missions will have a three person PR team assigned. A four person
       PR team will be assigned to all 1800 Series, SECDEF (if requested) support missions, Noncomba-
       tant Evacuation Operations (NEO), and humanitarian relief operations unless directed otherwise
       by HQ AMC/SFOX.
    1.3.2. TACC planners will identify and task PHOENIX RAVEN requirements for AMC missions
    IAW paragraph 3.1. of this instruction.
    1.3.3. Wing/Operations Group mission planners inform the wing TWGs, aircraft commanders (AC),
    and the security forces squadron (SFS) commander of the PR tasking.
    1.3.4. The SFS commander directs formation of a PR team to complete the mission through the unit’s
    Raven program manager (RPM).
    1.3.5. The PR team leader for the mission contacts the AC and begins planning for the protection of
    the aircraft and crew during the mission. The AC places PR members on aircrew orders as MEGP.

1.4. Force Protection Processes.
    1.4.1. Prior to departing for a mission, PR team members research the threats posed to AMC opera-
    tions and existing force protection measures at each mission location. Refer to Attachment 2, PHOE-
    NIX RAVEN Pre-deployment Checklist, to aid in identifying sources of information.
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                                  5


  1.4.2. Prior to departure, the PR team leader, in conjunction with Intelligence and Air Force Office of
  Special Investigations (AFOSI) representatives, conducts a PHOENIX RAVEN aircrew pre-deploy-
  ment briefing in accordance with Attachment 4. The briefing highlights potential threats, force pro-
  tection measures in place at all scheduled stops, measures to reduce susceptibility to terrorist and
  criminal attack, and billeting security. The PR team provides copies of JS Guide 5260, Service Mem-
  ber’s Personal Protection Guide: A Self-Help Handbook to Combating Terrorism, to all aircrew mem-
  bers, as needed.
  1.4.3. At every location, the PR team provides close-in security for the aircraft. They continue to do
  so until the PR team leader assesses security provided by the airfield security forces is adequate to
  protect the aircraft and crew from local threats (except at Raven required locations, PR team will
  maintain a presence at these airfields unless the AC gains TACC approval for removal of the PR
  team). The PR team leader may depart the immediate vicinity of the aircraft to accomplish an assess-
  ment and security coordination. All aircrew members must remain in the immediate vicinity of the air-
  craft, unless official duties require otherwise, until security procedures are established for the mission
  by the PR team leader and approved by the AC. Aircrew members must assist the PR team in observ-
  ing approaches to the aircraft during any separations between the PR team leader and the other PR
  members.
  1.4.4. After making an initial assessment of security, the PR team leader, in consultation with the AC,
  coordinates the use of available resources, to include airfield security forces, to enact security mea-
  sures to combat the specific threats posed to the aircraft and crew. As a minimum, the level of protec-
  tion for the aircraft must be equivalent to or better than requirements in AFI 31-101 for Protection
  Level 3 resources.
  1.4.5. At locations where security is deemed adequate (other than Raven required locations), the AC
  may direct the PR team to assist the aircrew with their duties. The AC may also permit the PR team
  members to depart the immediate vicinity of the aircraft to perform a more in-depth airfield security
  survey or coordinate billeting security matters with host nation and embassy personnel.
     1.4.5.1. After completing security coordination and prior to entering crew rest, the PR team leader
     arranges to store all weapons and ammunition in a secure Department of Defense (DoD), US
     embassy, US Security Assistance (SA) Organization, or NATO armory. If these facilities are not
     available, PR teams store weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft in a locked container. Sug-
     gest securing weapons in a locked container that is properly secured to the aircraft.
  1.4.6. At locations where security is not adequate and at Raven required locations, two-person PR
  teams establish close-in security and remain with the aircraft at all times, unless otherwise directed by
  the AC. If the PR team is removed, the AC must inform TACC of the decision to remove the PR team,
  and the justification for doing so through a mission reporting input at the earliest possible opportunity.
  The PR team leader will immediately inform AMC/SFOX of the AC’s decision to remove them from
  the aircraft at DSN: 576-2950 or through the TACC at DSN: 576-1705 / Commercial: (618)256-1705
  or 1-800-AIR-MOBL.
     1.4.6.1. Based upon the local threat, PR team size and ground time, the PR team leader establishes
     a duty rotation. If prudent, one PR member may provide close-in security while other team mem-
     bers sleep on board or in the immediate vicinity of the posted sentry. If three or more PR team
     members are available and local threats do not dictate using a team larger than two to implement
     close-in security, the team leader may establish a rotation to allow members to depart the airfield
6                                                                         AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002


       and billet with the aircrew IAW AMCI 11-208. PR team members on two-person teams may sep-
       arate for short periods of time to facilitate hygiene breaks provided they maintain constant radio
       contact.
       1.4.6.2. PR teams take actions to protect assigned aircraft and aircrew personnel to the greatest
       extent of their abilities.
       1.4.6.3. PR team members will not be required to perform duties that detract from their primary
       mission of protecting the aircraft.
       1.4.6.4. The PR team leader or AC may direct PR team members to depart the aircraft and aban-
       don close-in security when extreme weather conditions threaten their well being. If this occurs, the
       AC must immediately contact the TACC to explain changes to the security status. Close-in secu-
       rity must return to the aircraft as soon as it is safe to do so.

1.5. Legal Considerations and Use of Force.
    1.5.1. US military aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities. When cleared to overfly or land in foreign
    territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are exempt from duties and taxation and
    immune from search, seizure, inspection (including customs and safety inspections) and other exer-
    cise of jurisdiction by the host nation. Aircraft commanders and PR team members may not authorize
    the search, seizure, inspection or other exercise of jurisdiction by foreign authorities unless directed
    by the appropriate service headquarters of the local US Embassy.
       1.5.1.1. If foreign government or military officials attempt to force their way aboard US aircraft,
       PR teams should not physically restrain them unless they attempt to harm DoD personnel or prop-
       erty. The PR team will contact the AC and local US embassy personnel immediately.
       1.5.1.2. If foreign nationals who are not military or governmental officials attempt to enter a US
       aircraft without permission, PR team members may use appropriate physical force to resist. If this
       situation arises, PR team members contact the AC and local US embassy personnel immediately.
    1.5.2. In general, whether inside or outside the aircraft, PR team members may use force according to
    AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and CJCSI 3121.01, Standing Rules of
    Engagement for U.S. Forces to protect US resources and personnel.
    1.5.3. Inside the aircraft, an area of US sovereignty, PR team members may apprehend and prevent
    the escape of a person who has committed an offense. Outside the aircraft, PR team members may not
    seek to apprehend or prevent the escape of a foreign national. This is considered a local law enforce-
    ment function and the responsibility of the host nation. PR team members should seek the assistance
    of host nation personnel in order to apprehend or prevent the escape of a foreign national who has
    injured or threatened to injure US personnel or equipment on the aircraft.
    1.5.4. PR team members must adhere to limitations relating to the wear of the uniform and arming
    restrictions outlined in the DoD 4500.54G, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG),
    Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), and Memorandums of Understanding. PR team members will
    be armed with a handgun throughout the entire mission and should wear it outside the flight suit to
    allow for quick access (at host nation OCONUS airfields or RRL, follow arming procedures listed in
    1.5.4.1.). They will adhere to all restrictions concerning the wear of their handgun while transiting air-
    fields in the Continental United States (CONUS) and at all overseas locations (OCONUS) to include
    the use of expanding hollow point bullets (EHPB). This allows the PR team to provide adequate
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                                     7


   close-in security for the aircraft and aircrew at all airfields transited rather than just the Raven
   Required Location.
      1.5.4.1. At RRL and Non-NATO OCONUS airfields, PR team members will keep the weapons
      inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals even if the FCG allows them to be carried
      outside the aircraft. They should be placed near the hatches where they can be readily available
      should their use be warranted (proximate threat presents itself). If weapons are removed from the
      aircraft to neutralize a threat, they should be returned to the aircraft as soon as possible. If a staged
      operation is being conducted and the weapons will be carried outside the aircraft, HQ AMC/SFOX
      will be the focal point to coordinate weapon permits with the embassy of the host nation.
          1.5.4.1.1. Given that the threat to Air Force assets can change quickly, there may be situations
          (local rioting, bombings, etc.) that warrant the removal of the weapons from the aircraft at a
          deployed airfield. In situations other than an immediate hostile threat to Air Force assets, the
          PR team leader will contact the embassy representative (Defense Attache Officer [DAO],
          Regional Security Officer [RSO], etc.) for authorization to remove weapons from the aircraft.
          The PR team leader will also contact the on-call Security Forces Threat Working Group repre-
          sentative, as soon as possible, to provide a detailed briefing of the current conditions by calling
          the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) at DSN: 576-1705, commercial: (618) 256-1705, or
          toll-free: 1-800-AIR-MOBL.
   1.5.5. If a foreign national approaches a PR team member to request political asylum or temporary
   refuge from a PR team member during sentry duty they will not allow them entry to the interior of the
   aircraft. Refer all requests of this nature to the AC for resolution according to AFI 51-704, Handling
   Requests for Political Asylum and Temporary Refuge.

1.6. Medical Force Protection Considerations.
   1.6.1. PR teams are escorting aircraft into geographic areas with patterns of infectious disease and
   systems for public health, sanitation, and medical care which may be quite different from those they
   are used to in CONUS and Europe. PR team leaders must be aware of the specific medical force pro-
   tection considerations both at the mission destination and enroute. Failure to exert all practicable
   efforts to prevent disease may result in mission-ineffective team members. Lack of knowledge of
   where safe and acceptable medical care can be obtained at all points along the mission and at planned
   alternative diversion locations could result in delayed care to injured or seriously ill team members.
   PR team leaders must also know how to contact aeromedical evacuation assets for medical extraction
   of team members requiring such evacuation. Unless medical personnel are attached to the PR team,
   the level of care generally available to team members will be Self-Aid and Buddy Care (SABC). PR
   team leaders are responsible for assuring that all team members have current training in SABC.
   1.6.2. All USAF MTF’s have embedded Public Health and Readiness functions. Together, the person-
   nel at those functions can obtain current information from Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center
   (AFMIC), Embassy, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding endemic dis-
   eases, prevention strategies, and sources of medical care enroute which meet basic U.S. safety stan-
   dards.
   1.6.3. All PR team members are individually responsible for obtaining needed disease-prevention

   tions issued. Additionally, all team members are responsible for returning to Public Health

    post-deployment for follow-up. PR team leaders must have a deliberate strategy to remind all team
    members to take their medications as prescribed while enroute and, if needed, following return from
    the deployed location.
    1.6.4. If a PR team member experiences a sudden, severe illness at the deployed location or enroute,
    which exceeds the capability of treatment by SABC or that provided by medical personnel accompa-
    nying the team, the AC will be asked to query the Global Patient Movement Requirements Center
    (GPMRC) via the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). A Physician is available on the GPMRC
    staff on a 24-hour basis for consultation and to help in assuring that the most appropriate medical
    assistance is provided to team members, worldwide.

     2.2.12. SFS commanders must certify through an official memorandum that any member nominated
     for the PHOENIX RAVEN Certification Course has completed and meets the requirements of the
     PHOENIX RAVEN Fitness Test (PRFT), as outlined in Attachment 3. Two PRFTs will be conducted
     prior to the class start date. The first test must be no sooner than 45 days prior to class start date and
     the commanders will send the results of the test to HQ AMC/SFXT NLT 30 days prior to class start
     date. The second PRFT will be administered 7 duty days prior to the class start date and personally
     observed by the SFS commander with the results of this test also being forwarded to HQ AMC/SFXT
     on that same day with the SFS commander’s signature on the memorandum. If a candidate is disen-
     rolled from the course because of unacceptable physical conditioning, the unit will be required to
     reimburse all TDY expenditures to HQ AMC/SFXR. ANG personnel will be required to have a letter
     of Physical Fitness certification on file from the unit commander. Funding, which is provided by
     ANG/DOF, for attendance at the PR Certification Course will be reimbursed by the ANG unit for each
     member who fails to complete the course due to other than medical reasons. ANG/SF Commanders
     will certify PRFT two UTA’s prior to course start date.
     2.2.13. Members must graduate from the PHOENIX RAVEN Certification Course conducted by the
     421st Ground Combat Readiness Squadron at the Air Mobility Warfare Center (AMWC) to be consid-
     ered certified to perform PR duties. Training at the AMWC is documented on the AF Form 797, Job
     Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. PR members will maintain their certifica-
     tion by completing all of the annual training requirements listed in AMCI 31-104 and an annual stan-
     dardized evaluation.
     2.2.14. Raven Credentials. Upon graduation, the HQ AMC Director of Security Forces issues AMC
     Form 1031, SF (RAVEN) Credential to Security Forces members performing PHOENIX RAVEN
     duties. Once the form is issued, PR members will handcarry AMC Form 1031 at all times when in the
     performance of RAVEN duties. The AMC form 1031, SF (RAVEN) Credential, will be issued until
     replaced by a digital imaging system card. Issue of the SF (RAVEN) Credential is recorded using a
     localized tracking document.
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                                  11


       2.2.14.1. If the form is lost or stolen, the bearer must immediately notify HQ AMC/SF through
       official channels and provide a written memorandum detailing the circumstance concerning the
       loss within 24 hours. In the event circumstances such as flight delays or transit operations delay
       official reporting requirements, the member will notify their assigned unit at the earliest opportu-
       nity.
       2.2.14.2. Destroy withdrawn credentials upon PCA or PCS unless RAVEN duties will be per-
       formed at the gaining unit. Document destruction on AF Form 310, Document Receipt and
       Destruction Certificate, and maintain accountability records. Note: The Chief of Security Forces
       may present a RAVEN his or her credential as a retirement memento; however, the credential must
       be marked as “INVALID” in red letters and HQ AMC/SF must be notified.

2.3. Annual Training Program. All certified PR members must complete annual training requirements
identified on AF Form 797. The standards are developed by the HQ AMC Directorate of Security Forces.
The RPM designs the unit training program based upon local duty schedules. The RPM may appoint any
certified PR member to act as trainer for another PR equal to or junior in grade. The unit training section
can accomplish any core SF tasks training contained on the PR AF FM 797.

2.4. Annual Evaluation Program. PR personnel must successfully complete an annual evaluation con-
ducted by their RPM or deputy RPM to maintain certification. Members are considered certified for one
year upon graduation from the PHOENIX RAVEN Certification Course. In order to complete successful
recertification the RPM ensures the member completes the following evaluation:
   2.4.1. Successfully completes the PR fitness test.
   2.4.2. Successfully completes a written test provided by HQ AMC/SFXT with a minimum passing
   score of 80 %.
   2.4.3. Successfully completes an oral exam conducted by the RPM or deputy RPM (oral questions
   provided by HQ AMC/SFXT).
   2.4.4. Successfully completes at least two practical scenario evaluations. During this portion of the
   evaluation the evaluated member acts as a close-in sentry for a deployed aircraft. The RPM devises a
   minimum of three scenarios, in which persons posing as foreign nationals or aircrew members
   approach the sentry, and test the member’s ability to apply the force continuum. One scenario must
   require the use of simulated deadly force. One scenario must require the member to demonstrate his or
   her ability to defend themselves and their aircraft against a perpetrator in a physical confrontation that
   requires less than deadly force, and one scenario must require the sentry to resolve the situation with-
   out using physical force.
   2.4.5. Successfully completing a check ride. During this portion of the evaluation the RPM or deputy
   RPM accompanies the member on an actual PR mission. The member acts as the PR team leader and
   the RPM or deputy RPM evaluates the member’s ability to successfully apply their PR checklists, as
   outlined in Attachment 2, throughout the entire mission. The check ride may take place any time
   within six months prior to the member’s required recertification date. In the event the RPM cannot
   schedule a check ride because a mission is not available in the required time period, the RPM must
   ensure the member successfully completes all other portions of the evaluation. The RPM certifies the
   member via the AF Form 797 and must include a letter in the member’s training record indicating a
   mission was not available for a check ride. Conduct check rides when missions become available.
12                                                                        AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002


     2.4.6. Decertify PR team members who fail to meet minimum standards of knowledge and perfor-
     mance in any area of the evaluation. The RPM may administer a reevaluation of any deficient area and
     may certify the evaluated member upon successfully completing the reevaluation.
     2.4.7. The RPM documents the results of all phases of the annual evaluation for each RAVEN certi-
     fied unit member. The RPM briefs the unit commander on the results of the evaluation. The RPM
     maintains a copy of the annual evaluation documentation in each certified RAVEN member’s training
     record and one copy in the unit RAVEN program continuity book. The RPM, or appointed trainer,
     completes the member’s AF Form 797 to denote proficiency for all skills upon successfully complet-
     ing the annual training program and annual evaluation.
     2.4.8. RPM annual evaluation will be accomplished separate from the other PR members. The SFS
     commander must certify the RPM by accomplishing a letter outlining the overall competency level of
     the RPM and the results of his/her written and oral tests; as well as, the PRFT test results. The overall
     continuity of the unit’s program will also be part of the RPM’s evaluation. RPM must also complete at
     least one PR mission annually.

2.5. Decertification. SFS commanders should decertify members from performing PR duties when a
member demonstrates, through substandard duty performance or through involvement in incidents requir-
ing disciplinary action, that they do not possess the maturity or competence to function in the program.
The ultimate decision to send a member on a PR mission rests with the commander in consultation with
the RPM.
     2.5.1. PR certified members from HQ AMC/SF and the 421 GCRS routinely accompany PR missions
     to evaluate program effectiveness. Evaluating PR members is not the primary purpose of these mis-
     sions; however, staff members may decertify any PR member from performing duties if they fail to
     demonstrate adherence to the training standards of the program throughout the observed mission. If
     this occurs, the staff member provides a letter to the individual’s unit commander explaining the rea-
     sons for de-certification. The RPM may recertify the member to perform duties after successfully
     completing another evaluation in accordance with this instruction.
     2.5.2. SFS commanders will notify HQ AMC/SFOX whenever a PR member is decertified. Actions
     surrounding the decertification and recertification will be outlined in the notification to HQ AMC/
     SFOX. If a PR member is decertified pending criminal/non-judicial punishment, notify HQ AMC/
     SFOX once the administrative/legal process is complete. Depending upon the severity of the incident,
     the PR member may be removed from the Raven program and permanently decertified by HQ AMC/
     SF. ANG SFS commanders will notify ANG/DOF whenever a PR member is decertified. Depending
     upon the reasons for the decertification, ANG/DOF will notify HQ AMC/SFOX to request that the
     member be removed permanently from the PR program.
     2.5.3. The Director of Security Forces, HQ AMC, is the waiver authority for any of the above listed
     annual training requirements and standardized evaluation procedures. Decisions will be based on
     operational mission requirements.

2.6. The PHOENIX RAVEN Apprentice Program. SFS commanders identify potential candidates for
PR certification as PR Apprentices (PRAs). PRAs may accompany PR missions at the discretion of SFS
commanders and RPMs. PRAs must meet all personnel screening factors identified in paragraph 2.2. and
must meet requirements identified in paragraphs 2.4.1. and 2.4.4. through 2.4.7. PRAs may perform any
PR duties as long as they are supervised by a certified PR member. PRAs must comply as a PR member
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                              13


with this instruction while performing PR duties. When missions are identified as requiring three or four
PR members, PRAs may satisfy the requirement as the third and fourth members of the PR team, as long
as there are two certified PR members including the PR team leader assigned to the mission. Any excep-
tions to these procedures must be approved by HQ AMC/SFOX.

2.7. Equipment.

        (helmet bag, b-4 bags, headsets, etc.) That will assist them in performing their duties as Mission
        Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). PR members may wear the SF beret at CONUS airfields,
        DoD installations, and NATO bases while performing pr duties, but they must wear the flight cap
        when transiting all other OCONUS airfields. The approved raven aircrew name patch for wear on
        the flight suit/jacket is the raven PR cloth patch with the embroidered SF shield with rank/name
        and raven number.

              HEADQUARTERS AIR MOBILITY COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). The appropriate TACC office planning the AMC mission
is responsible for ensuring that PR requirements are identified to tasked wings during mission planning.
(OPR: XOG, XOO, XOP, AND XOC).
     3.1.1. AMC missions requiring ravens are determined by the TWG non-raven required list or are
     identified individually by TWG mission risk analysis. The TWG non-raven required list is published
     on the AMC/IN website (force protection airfield products/amc raven policy). SIPR NET
     HTTP://WWW.AMCIN.SCOTT.AF.SMIL.MIL/HOMEIE.ASP., or can be obtained by contact-
     ing the TWG or AMC/SFOG. XOC/XOO/XOG/XOP planners will task PR requirements as follows.
        3.1.1.1. Utilizing the non-raven required list, mission (XOO/XOP) planners will enter a “leg”
        remark on the Form 59 in GDSS stating “phoenix raven required for XXXX” (ICAO LOCA-
        TION). this “leg” remark should be entered on the last departure leg prior to the PR required loca-
        tion. Mission (XOG) planners will enter a “mission” remark on the Form 59 in GDSS stating
        “phoenix raven team required/ravens supplied by local SFS or contact AMC/SF AT 779-0638/
        0005”. This remark in GDSS serves as the wing’s formal tasking of a PR requirement.
        3.1.1.2. Short notice missions: for missions added less than 72 hrs prior to launch, the XOC/XOG/
        XOO/XOP planner entering the mission into ADANS/CAMPS/GDSS will enter a “mission”
        remark on the Form 59 in GDSS stating “phoenix raven team required/ravens supplied by local
        SFS or contact AMC/SF AT 779-0638/0005.
        3.1.1.3. Planners will include PR on diplomatic clearance requests submitted to TACC/XOCZ
        Flight Planning Division.
     3.1.2. Utilizing the non-raven required list, XOC East and West cells will conduct a daily check of the
     “station workload” for ICAO’S identified as raven required locations and enter a “leg remark” on the
     form 59 IAW PARAGRAPH 3.1.1.1. above. If the departure into a PR location will happen within the
     next 72 HRS, and the leg remark was not previously entered, it’s possible that the PR requirement is
     new and a PR team has not been assigned. East/West cell will forward this mission number and mis-
     sion leg affected to AMC/SFOG contingency cell at the following; E-MAIL:
     mailto:AMCSFOGOPS@SCOTT.AF.MIL or AMC/SF at 779-0638/FAX 779-0286. AMC/SFOG
     will ensure a PR team is assigned to the mission.
     3.1.3. XOCZ Diplomatic Clearance Division planners will include notification that PR members will
     be on the aircraft when sending the official message requesting diplomatic clearance to the embassy of
     the country involved. This notification is not a personnel clearance request, but instead serves as an
     initial notice to the embassy to expect coordination requests from the aircraft commander or PR team
     members.
     3.1.4. With a TWG recommendation, TACC/CC is the waiver authority for removing a PR team from
     a mission transiting a Raven Required Location.

3.2. HQ AMC Threat Working Group (TWG). The OPR is HQ AMC/IN.
     3.2.1. The AMC TWG recommends where and when PR teams are required on AMC missions.
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                               17


   3.2.2. The AMC TWG provides threat assessments and physical security updates to PR teams prior to
   mission departure through INTELINK-S database.
   3.2.3. The AMC TWG performs risk assessments based on all source intelligence and other informa-
   tion derived in part from operations requiring PR team support. These risk assessments are entered
   into the INTELINK-S database and disseminated to all AMC units and operations worldwide.

3.3. Directorate of Security Forces (SF). The OPR is HQ AMC/SFOX.
   3.3.1. Ensures mission planners responsible for each mission requiring a PHOENIX RAVEN team
   include tasking comments on the GDSS Form 59.
   3.3.2. Ensures security forces squadrons tasked to provide PR team support are aware of tasking
   requirements. If the PR mission is canceled or re-routed to a Non-RRL, PR members are returned to
   homestation or assigned to another PR required mission.
   3.3.3. Serves as the primary interface between PR teams and all HQ AMC agencies.
   3.3.4. Ensures appropriate guidance is provided to unit commanders and RPMs to ensure effective
   unit PR programs.
   3.3.5. Provides all specialized equipment, as identified in paragraph 2.7., to support unit PR pro-
   grams.
      3.3.5.1. Provides funds reimbursement to SF units that incurred unfunded costs to move PR teams
      from homestation to support PR missions at a distant location or another installation per funding
      guidance issued by HQ AMC/FMB. This reimbursement can be requested from HQ AMC/SFXR
      after PR members receive their settled travel vouchers.
   3.3.6. Is the approving authority for all PR evaluation and training products used to certify and train
   PR members in the PHOENIX RAVEN Certification Course. HQ AMC/SFXT approves the annual
   training plan and evaluation process requirements that are used to maintain the PR member’s certifi-
   cation.
   3.3.7. Sends risk and security assessment products to unit RPM for locations that the TWG has not

                                  PHOENIX RAVEN FITNESS TEST

A3.1. PHOENIX RAVEN Members. All PHOENIX RAVEN members and candidates must take the
PHOENIX RAVEN Fitness Test (PRFT) regardless of their age. The PRFT is a three-event physical per-
formance evaluation used to assess muscular endurance and cardiorespiratory fitness. Performance on the
PRFT is strongly linked to the member’s ability to do fitness-related tasks.

A3.2. Commander’s Responsibility. Commanders are responsible for ensuring their PHOENIX
RAVEN members are physically fit. The PRFT is administered prior to a candidate’s nomination to attend
the PHOENIX RAVEN Certification Course and annually as part of the PHOENIX RAVEN recurring
certification and training program. Table A3.1. outlines the minimum fitness level for all PHOENIX
RAVEN members.

A3.3. Administering the PRFT. The PRFT must be administered properly and to standard in order to
accurately evaluate a member’s physical fitness and to be fair to all members. Individuals are not autho-
rized to administer the PRFT to themselves for the purpose of attendance at the PHOENIX RAVEN Cer-
tification Course or annual recurring certification and training evaluations.
     A3.3.1. The RPM at the test site must have this attachment on hand. The supervisor of each event
     must have the event instructions and a means to record the results of each member’s test. Two stop
     watches are needed for each event test. Members should wear appropriate clothing for physical train-
     ing such as shorts, T-shirts, socks, and running shoes. Anything that gives a member an unfair advan-
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                                                     31


  tage is prohibited during the PRFT. Items such as elastic bandages will be removed unless prescribed
  by medical personnel. The only exception are gloves that may be worn in cold weather.
  A3.3.2. The test site should be fairly flat and free of debris. It should have a soft, flat, dry area for per-
  forming push-ups and sit-ups. A flat, 2-mile running course with a solid surface and no more than a
  three-percent grade. A quarter-mile running track may be used to conduct PRFT.
  A3.3.3. The test sequence is push-ups, sit-ups, and 2-mile run. The order of events cannot be changed.
  Members should be allowed no less than 10 minutes, but no more than 20 minutes, to recover between
  events.
  A3.3.4. Have member read the following instructions prior to administering the evaluations.
      A3.3.4.1. Push-ups. “The push-up event measures the endurance of the chest, shoulder, and tri-
      ceps muscles. On the command “get set,” assume the front leaning rest position by placing your
      hands where they are comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart.
      Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command ‘‘go,”
      begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until
      your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, return to the starting position by raising
      your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally
      straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. If you fail to keep your body
      generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the
      ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count and the scorer will repeat
      the number of the last correctly completed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups
      correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and explain to you what your mistakes were.
      You will then be sent to the end of the line to be re-tested. After the first ten push-ups have been
      performed and counted, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly per-
      formed push-ups will not be counted. An altered front leaning rest position is the only authorized
      rest position. That is you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you
      may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight
      with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause
      in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or
      foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or
      feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. You will have
      two minutes in which to do as many push-ups as you can. Watch this demonstration.” (The exer-
      cise is then demonstrated.) “Do you have any questions?”
      A3.3.4.2. Sit-ups. “The sit-up event measures the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor mus-
      cles. On the command “get set,” assume the starting position by lying on your back with your
      knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another per-
      son will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is
      authorized. The heel is the only part of your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your
      fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the backs of your hands must touch the ground.
      Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command “go,” begin raising your upper
      body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your
      neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position,
      lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands,
      arms or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state
      the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not be counted if you fail to
32                                                                      AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002


     reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow
     your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed
     a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last cor-
     rectly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in
     the down position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort,
     to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull
     or push yourself up to the rest position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so your
     performance will be terminated. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.
     Watch this demonstration.” (The exercise is then demonstrated.) “Do you have any questions?”
     A3.3.4.3. Two-mile run. “The two mile run is used to assess your aerobic fitness and your leg
     muscles’ endurance. You must complete the run without any physical help. At the start, all mem-
     bers will line up behind the starting line. On the command “go,” the clock will start. You will
     begin running at your own pace. To run the required two miles, you must complete (describe the
     number of laps, start and finish points, and course layout). You are being tested on your ability to
     complete the 2-mile course in the shortest time possible. Although walking is authorized, it is
     strongly discouraged. If you are physically helped in any way (for example, pulled, pushed,
     picked up, and/or carried) or leave the designated running course for any reason, you will be dis-
     qualified. (Another member may pace a member during the 2-mile run.) As long as there is no
     physical contact with the paced member and it does not physically hinder other members taking
     the test. Cheering or calling out the elapsed time is also permitted. After finishing the run, go to the
     cool-down and stretching area. Do not stay near the scorers or the finish line as it may interfere
     with the testing. Do you have any questions?”

            IC 02-01 AMCI 31-104, PHOENIX RAVEN PROGRAM, 1 AUGUST 2000
25 February 2002
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This Interim change (IC) CY 2002 adds paragraph 2.2.14. and provides guidance concerning the Phoenix
Raven Credential. In order to facilitate movement and provide a valid identification process during tran-
sit, graduates of the PHOENIX RAVEN course will be issued AMC Form 1031, SF (RAVEN) Credential,
for use while performing official RAVEN duties. An (*) indicates a revision since the last edition.
2.2.14. Raven Credentials. Upon graduation, the HQ AMC Director of Security Forces issues AMC
Form 1031, SF (RAVEN) Credential to Security Forces members performing PHOENIX RAVEN duties.
Once the form is issued, PR members will handcarry AMC Form 1031 at all times when in the perfor-
mance of RAVEN duties. The AMC form 1031, SF (RAVEN) Credential, will be issued until replaced by
a digital imaging system card. Issue of the SF (RAVEN) Credential is recorded using a localized tracking
document.
2.2.14.1. If the form is lost or stolen, the bearer must immediately notify HQ AMC/SF through official
channels and provide a written memorandum detailing the circumstance concerning the loss within 24
hours. In the event circumstances such as flight delays or transit operations delay official reporting
requirements, the member will notify their assigned unit at the earliest opportunity.
2.2.14.2. Destroy withdrawn credentials upon PCA or PCS unless RAVEN duties will be performed at the
gaining unit. Document destruction on AF Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate, and
maintain accountability records. Note: The Chief of Security Forces may present a RAVEN his or her cre-
dential as a retirement memento; however, the credential must be marked as “INVALID” in red letters and
HQ AMC/SF must be notified.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This Interim change (IC) 02-02 changes paragraphs 2.7.1.1., 3.1., 3.1.1., 3.1.1.1., 3.1.1.2., and 3.1.2. Adds
Figure 2.1. Phoenix Rave Aircrew Patch Exhibit. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision since the last edition.
2.7.1.1. Security forces personnel wear the flight suit while performing phoenix raven duties according to
AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. The battle dress uniform or other
uniform of the day will be worn when not performing official raven duties. Each PR member is authorized
three flight suits, one flight jacket for each season (winter and summer), and two pairs of flight gloves.
They are authorized to procure other aircrew type items (helmet bag, b-4 bags, headsets, etc.) That will
assist them in performing their duties as Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). PR members may
wear the SF beret at CONUS airfields, DoD installations, and NATO bases while performing pr duties,
but they must wear the flight cap when transiting all other OCONUS airfields. The approved raven air-
crew name patch for wear on the flight suit/jacket is the raven PR cloth patch with the embroidered SF
shield with rank/name and raven number.
3.1. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). The appropriate TACC office planning the AMC mission is
responsible for ensuring that PR requirements are identified to tasked wings during mission planning.
(OPR: XOG, XOO, XOP, AND XOC).
3.1.1. AMC missions requiring ravens are determined by the TWG non-raven required list or are identi-
fied individually by TWG mission risk analysis. The TWG non-raven required list is published on the
AMC/IN website (force protection airfield products/amc raven policy). SIPR NET
HTTP://WWW.AMCIN.SCOTT.AF.SMIL.MIL/HOMEIE.ASP., or can be obtained by contacting the
TWG or AMC/SFOG. XOC/XOO/XOG/XOP planners will task PR requirements as follows.
3.1.1.1. Utilizing the non-raven required list, mission (XOO/XOP) planners will enter a “leg” remark on
the Form 59 in GDSS stating “phoenix raven required for XXXX” (ICAO LOCATION). this “leg”
remark should be entered on the last departure leg prior to the PR required location. Mission (XOG) plan-
ners will enter a “mission” remark on the Form 59 in GDSS stating “phoenix raven team required/ravens
supplied by local SFS or contact AMC/SF AT 779-0638/0005”. This remark in GDSS serves as the wing’s
formal tasking of a PR requirement.
3.1.1.2. Short notice missions: for missions added less than 72 hrs prior to launch, the XOC/XOG/XOO/
XOP planner entering the mission into ADANS/CAMPS/GDSS will enter a “mission” remark on the
Form 59 in GDSS stating “phoenix raven team required/ravens supplied by local SFS or contact AMC/SF
AT 779-0638/0005.
3.1.1.3. Planners will include PR on diplomatic clearance requests submitted to TACC/XOCZ Flight
Planning Division.
3.1.2. Utilizing the non-raven required list, XOC East and West cells will conduct a daily check of the
“station workload” for ICAO’S identified as raven required locations and enter a “leg remark” on the
form 59 IAW PARAGRAPH 3.1.1.1. above. If the departure into a PR location will happen within the
next 72 HRS, and the leg remark was not previously entered, it’s possible that the PR requirement is new
and a PR team has not been assigned. East/West cell will forward this mission number and mission leg
AMCI31-104 7 AUGUST 2002                                                           45
