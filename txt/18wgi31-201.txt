This instruction implements AFPD 31-2, Law Enforcement. The Air Force must provide safe and secure
living and working conditions for its members and their families. The Kadena Disciplinary Action Pro-
gram (KDAP) is intended to provide standardized disciplinary services, and procedures for dealing with
civilian misconduct on Kadena Air Base (AB). This instruction applies to all family members and civil-
ians subject to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), regardless of service affiliation, while on Kadena
AB and all other Air Force installations and facilities on Okinawa, Japan. These facilities include Kadena
Marina, Okuma Joint Services Recreation Facility, and all government military family housing areas.
Additionally, this instruction applies to all individuals residing on Kadena AB. It does not apply to the
Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Several revisions reflecting the organizational change to the Mission Support Group have been made.
Additional revisions more accurately reflect the authority of the KDAP presiding authority and an update
to the KDAP process/procedures. New or revised material is indicated by an a bar (|).


1. General. The SOFA governs jurisdiction of all criminal offenses committed in Japan by family mem-
bers of armed forces personnel, Department of Defense employees, and contractors (DODDS included).
The SOFA also governs jurisdiction of all criminal offenses committed in Japan by DoD civilian employ-
ees and contractors. Base policy is also set by the 18 WG/CC and 18 MSG/CC (through base policy let-
ters). Additionally, acts of misconduct by family members and civilians are subject to a wide range of
administrative sanctions under the provisions of this instruction and base policy letters, regardless of any
action taken by Japanese authorities. Failure by Japanese authorities to pursue jurisdiction against depen-
dents of service members, DoD civilian employees, and contractors, or against civilian employees and
contractors themselves, will not preclude action under this instruction. The KDAP is the direct responsi-
bility of the Commander, 18th Mission Support Group, (18 MSG/CC). Its objectives are as follows:
2                                                                          18WGI31-201 5 JUNE 2006


    1.1. Maintain good order and discipline in the Kadena AB community.
    1.2. Protect the well being of all personnel residing on Kadena AB.
    1.3. Screen all acts of civilian misconduct and facilitate standardized management of all cases when
    involvement by KDAP staff is deemed appropriate.
    1.4. Prevent further misconduct through an aggressive program of standard disciplinary action.
    1.5. Whenever possible, effectively utilize base resources to provide individuals and families with the
    best possible referral and assistance services.
    1.6. Misconduct refers to the following:
       1.6.1. Conduct committed on any military installation on Okinawa, Japan, which, if committed in
       the US, violates US Federal Law.
       1.6.2. Violations of Japanese law committed on Okinawa, Japan.
       1.6.3. Violations of Air Force 18th Wing instructions and policies relating to dependent or civil-
       ian conduct.
       1.6.4. Any conduct determined by the presiding authority, which negatively impacts good order
       and discipline in the Kadena AB community.

2. KDAP - Program Management and Responsibilities.
    2.1. The KDAP is the office of primary responsibility for the management of all civilian and depen-
    dent misconduct on Kadena AB. Individuals assigned to the program serve as the primary advisor,
    point of contact, and operational and administrative managers for this program.
    2.2. The Deputy Commander, 18th Mission Support Group (18 MSG/CDB), or his/her designee,
    serves as the presiding authority during KDAP hearings, makes all findings of fact, and directs all
    punishment actions based on the preponderance of evidence. The 18 MSG/CDB or his/her appointed
    designee (KDAP Hearing Officers) is authorized to suspend, revoke, or terminate privileges granted
    to family members, DoD civilian employees, and contractors by virtue of employment, contract, or
    military service subject to applicable laws and instructions. Sponsors may be financially liable for
    family member actions and/or could lose base housing privileges.
    2.3. The Commander, 18th Mission Support Group, directs activities of the KDAP to achieve the
    objectives stated above and serves as appeal authority on all action taken under authority of the KDAP
    with the exception of action taken by the 18 WG/CC.
    2.4. The Commander, 18th Wing, is the sole authority for barment of individuals from Kadena AB
    and all Air Force installations and facilities on Okinawa, Japan.

3. KDAP Procedures.
    3.1. The KDAP staff (KDAP Hearing Officers, KDAP Director, Judge Advocate, Family Advocacy,
    and Security Forces support) will be responsible for screening all acts of dependent and civilian mis-
    conduct. This will be accomplished through a daily review of the security forces blotters and from
    pending investigations, when available. The KDAP Director will obtain appropriate police and inves-
    tigative agency reports. After initial screening, the KDAP Director will make recommendations to the
18WGI31-201 5 JUNE 2006                                                                                  3


  18 MSG/CDB who will determine whether the case should be referred to a hearing, be conducted
  paperwork only, or coordinated with another agency for disposition.
     3.1.1. The KDAP Director will establish a case file on individuals involved in misconduct. Mis-
     conduct case files will contain all pertinent identification data, correspondence, and police reports.
     All original information entered into the case file will remain a permanent part of the case file.
     3.1.2. The KDAP Director will coordinate with the following organizations prior to the hearing
     date:
        3.1.2.1. Sponsorâ€™s unit of assignment (commander, first sergeant, and/or supervisor).
        3.1.2.2. Department of Defense Dependents Schools (when incident involves school-age
        dependent).
        3.1.2.3. Life Skills and/or Family Advocacy.
        3.1.2.4. Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.
        3.1.2.5. After initial coordination has been conducted by the KDAP Director, a paperwork
        only notification or hearing date will be established.
     3.1.3. The 18 MSG/CDB or his/her designee and KDAP Director can recommend a paper only
     hearing if the offender has confessed to the offense, where all pertinent information is available, or
     the preponderance of evidence would enable a Hearing Officer as the presiding authority to deter-
     mine appropriate administrative adjudication for cases of civilian and dependent misconduct.
        3.1.3.1. The KDAP Hearing Officer as the presiding authority will then impose appropriate
        punishment up to recommending suspended barment. If barment is recommended, the case
        will be documented as a KDAP case and if barment is justified, the Hearing Officer will staff
        paperwork for the 18 WG/CC review and action. (If barment action is recommended/staffed
        by WG/JA for civilians/dependents, then KDAP coordination is only required.)
        3.1.3.2. The sponsor and dependent will be presented with a memorandum of disciplinary
        action. The memorandum of disciplinary action will be signed by the sponsor and offender and
        will be provided with a copy. If the sponsor picks up the memorandum without the offender
        being present, the offender will return a signed copy of the paperwork within two weeks.
     3.1.4. Punishment options available to the KDAP Hearing Officer when the case is paperwork
     only include the same items mentioned in section 3.2.3. below.
  3.2. KDAP hearings.
     3.2.1. The KDAP hearings will be held as directed by the 18 MSG/CDB. The KDAP Hearing
     Officer is the presiding authority to determine appropriate administrative adjudication for cases of
     civilian and dependent misconduct.
        3.2.1.1. The 18 WG/JA will appoint a legal representative to serve as advisor to the KDAP
        Hearing Officer when required. A KDAP legal advisor should be present during all KDAP
        hearings. The primary purpose of the JA advisor is to pass information to 18 WG/JA on
        KDAP actions and support the Hearing Officer with legal issues if required.
        3.2.1.2. Attendance at KDAP hearings will be mandatory for the following individuals
        involved in the case:
4                                                                        18WGI31-201 5 JUNE 2006

          3.2.2.2. The alleged offender will have an opportunity to make a brief presentation.

          alleged offender committed the offense.
          3.2.2.4. The KDAP Hearing Officer as the presiding authority will then impose appropriate
          punishment, or if barment is recommended, will advise the offender that a recommendation to
          the 18 WG/CC to bar the offender from all Air Force installations on Okinawa will be made.
          3.2.2.5. The sponsor and dependent will be presented with a memorandum of disciplinary
          action. The memorandum of disciplinary action will be signed by the sponsor and offender

4. Kadena Youth Monitor Program. A disciplinary option available to the presiding authority in cases
involving dependents 10-17 years of age who commit serious or repeated acts of misconduct.
   4.1. Objective: The Kadena Youth Monitor Program is established to provide a means of rehabilita-
   tion for youth who are involved in misconduct. Juveniles enrolled in the program must successfully
   complete all requirements, or they will be subject to further sanctions as determined by the presiding
   authority. Enrollment in the Kadena Youth Monitor Program will be for a 6-month period.

       4.2.1. Work with appropriate community agencies to locate and identify potential areas to per-
       form community service.

       randum are being met.
       4.2.3. Recommend barment and termination of a juvenile's enrollment in the program for engag-
       ing in further acts of misconduct or for failure to comply with the requirements stipulated in the
       action memorandum.

   all actions imposed by the KDAP.
   5.4. When the 18 WG/CC orders that an offender be barred, there is no appeal if the case has been
   staffed through the KDAP hearing process. If the Hearing Official recommends barment to the 18
   WG/CC, the offender/sponsor has 5 days to request an appeal and provide any additional information
   for the 18 WG/CC review. The 18 MSG/CC will review the case prior to going to the 18 WG/CC.
   Any barment action taken by the 18 WG/CC that is outside of KDAP channels, can be reviewed by
   KDAP at the request of the 18 WG/CC.
   5.5. The KDAP staff will not release police reports or reports of investigation. Individuals requesting
   this documentation are directed to the appropriate offices of primary responsibility.
6                                                                             18WGI31-201 5 JUNE 2006

cess. Alleged offenders are not entitled to have legal counsel present during the hearing or for an appeal.

paring for the hearing or for an appeal.

    7.2. Sponsors will acknowledge receipt of the barment memorandum by signing the endorsement
    block.
