                                            Chapter 1

      SECURITY FORCES ROLE IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

1.1. Planning. Security Forces cannot afford to wait until disaster strikes before taking action to
protect resources and personnel. Security Forces personnel must be able to initially respond and
cope with any situation that might occur. The Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
(CEMP) 10-2, Major Accidents, Natural Disasters, Enemy CBRNE Attacks & Terrorist use of
CBRNE, outlines the necessary actions to cope with on and off base emergencies and disasters.
Because of the probability that Security Forces will be the first on scene, it is important that
Security Forces personnel become familiar with the terms, duties and responsibilities associated
with the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS).
   1.1.1. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
   Operations, and the CEMP 10-2 contain specific guidance on the categories of EM planning.
   Security Forces must coordinate with the Defense Force Commander (DFC), EM office, and
   installation Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) to ensure that the various installation plans are
   mutually supportive and are consolidated to the greatest degree possible.
   1.1.2. Plans must be coordinated through all tasked agencies and should be coordinated with
   all units/agencies on the installation to eliminate redundancies in planning and operational
   response capability. Special attention must be given to any memoranda of agreement or
   mutual aid agreements with civil authorities to ensure roles are clearly defined.
   1.1.3. Personnel and equipment accountability during an incident response is critical and
   must be addressed in the planning stages. Security Forces will be responsible for personnel
   accountability at the Entry Control Point (ECP) of an incident site and procedures must be
   clearly defined in plans. Some additional Security Forces specific planning factors to
   consider are:
       1.1.3.1. Post changes and how they will be conducted to ensure a smooth transition
       during prolonged incidents.
       1.1.3.2. Possible Force Protection Condition (FPCON) manning increases.
       1.1.3.3. Protection Level (PL) security mission impacts.
       1.1.3.4. Identify Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) available and required to continue
       the mission. Determine if Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) is available on the
       installation and will it be effective based on the CBRNE/HAZMAT involved.
       1.1.3.5. Determine how many Security Forces personnel may be involved and what their
       equipment requirements are to conduct the mission.
       1.1.3.6. Determine what Security Forces vehicles may be involved and if there will be
       shortages within the unit or installation. Determine if the Logistics Readiness Squadron
       (LRS) is able to support any additional vehicle requirements. Consider vehicle marking
       and emergency equipment requirements, if feasible.
   1.1.4. Military Working Dog (MWD) planning factors:
6                                                     AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


       1.1.4.1. In some CBRNE/HAZMAT incidents, the MWD may succumb to the materials
       or agents involved.
       1.1.4.2. Before a MWD team processes through a Decontamination Corridor, pre-
       planning and training must take place. Competent authority will follow guidelines set
       forth in AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program and AFMAN 31-219, The USAF
       Military Working Dog Program.
       1.1.4.3. The MWD Kennel Master and trainer will schedule familiarization training with
       the Fire and Emergency Service (FES) HAZMAT and/or Contamination Control Area
       (CCA) decontamination teams for their MWD teams. This training will familiarize the
       MWD with the sights, sounds and smells of the decontamination equipment, and learn
       that FES and CCA personnel, dressed in fire bunker suits, PPE or IPE with full face
       masks and air tanks do not present a threat to them.
       1.1.4.4. Progressive training should include the handler decontaminating the MWD by
       local decontamination processes including the MWD being soaped down, as if being
       shampooed and rinsed off.
       1.1.4.5. The Kennel Master must discuss with the installation FES HAZMAT Branch
       Officer any possible MWD issues, i.e., decontamination equipment for MWD, control
       poles or spare set of control equipment stored in HAZMAT vehicle or trailer.
       1.1.4.6. In CBRNE High Threat Areas (HTA) and Medium Threat Areas (MTA), the
       Kennel Master must plan for MWD safety when collective protective kennels are not
       available.
       1.1.4.7. MWD Team Decontamination: MWD Team decontamination procedures are
       covered in FM 4-02.18.
    1.1.5. Resiliency. To reinforce the Airman Resiliency program we must include the
    philosophy throughout all phases of planning, response, and recovery operations. Effective
    planning must include mentally preparing the base populace for the anticipated physical and
    mental reactions during high risk and stressful situations. These skills will arm personnel
    with solid coping techniques, which will assist them throughout the incident. Finally, by
    building and implementing resiliency into the program from start to finish we will decrease
    the impact these situations can have on our Airmen and reduce the overall recovery time. At
    a minimum, training must be incorporated into all exercises where exposure to traumatic
    stress, mass casualties, or high risk to first responders and emergency responders is
    anticipated.
       1.1.5.1. Instilling resiliency building opportunities in our training is critical to ensuring
       our first responders have the mental toughness to anticipate, react, respond, and recover
       from high stress situations.
       1.1.5.2. Reinforcement and assessment of skills in reality based scenarios/exercises is
       critical to building resiliency in our first responders.
           1.1.5.2.1. When planning training, make your scenarios as realistic as safely possible.
           Inclusion of trauma and chaos such as realistic simulated injuries and sound effects
           effectively conditions our brains to deal with real-life situations.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     7


           1.1.5.2.2. Consider vigorous physical training for all first responders immediately
           prior to the training scenario to simulate elevated heart rate and other physiological
           impacts.
           1.1.5.2.3. The Trauma Stress Response (TSR) team can be activated by the Wing
           Commander IAW AFI 44-153, Traumatic Stress Response. The TSR team will
           provide TSR services to enhance resilience to potentially traumatic events. Exercising
           the resiliency component of high-risk incidents is a critical part of assessing
           readiness.
1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. General EM responsibilities are outlined in AFI 10-2501 and AFI 31-201 and further
   defined in installation-level plans.
   1.2.2. The Initial Response Base (IRB) is the nearest military installation having a disaster
   response capability, regardless of size, to a major accident involving DOD resources. The Air
   Force IRB responds unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM, theater, or Air Force
   Service Watch Cell (AFSWC). Specific actions are included in AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN
   10-2504, Air Force Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural
   Disasters.
   1.2.3. Nuclear Weapons Incident. Installations must provide initial response to incidents
   involving nuclear weapons and must control the scene until relieved by higher authority. For
   Security Forces specific responsibilities for response to incidents involving nuclear weapons,
   refer to DoD 3150.8-M, Nuclear Weapon Accident Response Procedures (NARP) and DOD
   S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V1, (S) The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Security Manual
   (U).
   1.2.4. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). As the AFI 10-2501 designated Office of
   Primary Responsibility (OPR) for Public Safety and Security, Security Forces play a critical
   role in the Emergency Operations Center. The Security Forces EOC representative for on-
   base accidents/incidents will:
       1.2.4.1. Report as directed to the EOC and immediately conduct communications checks
       with the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)/Emergency Communications Center
       (ECC).
       1.2.4.2. Obtain the plotted location of the cordon, ECP and staging area as directed by
       the Incident Commander (IC).
       1.2.4.3. Obtain the incident grid location from the BDOC/ECC.
       1.2.4.4. Report possible hazards and required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to
       responding Security Forces and inform BDOC/ECC via any communication means.
       1.2.4.5. Monitor evacuation of affected buildings inside the cordon and report status to
       the EOC Director.
   1.2.5. The Security Forces EOC representative for off-base accidents/incidents will:
       1.2.5.1. Identify the initial IC and inform initial security response unit(s) to report to the
       IC, if not already accomplished.

       1.2.5.2. Request assistance from civilian law enforcement agencies via locally developed
       procedures.
       1.2.5.3. Obtain the ECP grid coordinates and notify EOC to provide the information.
       1.2.5.4. Coordinate required Security Forces follow-on units and monitor the following
       actions:
           1.2.5.4.1. Security Forces units report to convoy assembly area and check in as
           described in the installation‘s CEMP 10-2.
           1.2.5.4.2. The Posting NCO checks security elements for equipment, maps, and
           clothing.
           1.2.5.4.3. The Posting NCO briefs all convoy drivers on road conditions and any
           identified or potential threats.
           1.2.5.4.4. The senior ranking Security Forces member designates a specific Security
           Forces vehicle to lead the convoy.
           1.2.5.4.5. Follow-on units make contact with the Security Forces units at the scene.
           1.2.5.4.6. Follow-on units have materials to erect cordon perimeter.
           1.2.5.4.7. Follow-on units have National Defense Area (NDA) signs as described in
           AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
           1.2.5.4.8. Participate in the preparation of the recovery plan.
           1.2.5.4.9. Facilitate relocation of the ECP, if required by the IC.
    1.2.6. BDOC/ECC Actions:
       1.2.6.1. Plot incident site on map or installation common operating picture.
       1.2.6.2. Dispatch first responders and emergency responders.
       1.2.6.3. Maintain contact with the IC, first responders and emergency responders.
       1.2.6.4. Accomplish appropriate checklist(s).
       1.2.6.5. Keep Security Forces EOC representative up to date on incident site resource
       requests.
       1.2.6.6. Keep BDOC staff informed of the incident status.
    1.2.7. Establishing Cordon and ECP Locations. Each incident site must be cordoned and an
    ECP established. Some incidents will require an evacuation. The type of incident,
    amount/type of materials involved, and weather conditions are some factors that will
    influence the size of the cordon. The cordon size is determined by the IC and will be based
    on the area affected by the incident and any requirement for additional resources within the
    cordon area.
       1.2.7.1. Cordon. A cordon surrounds the accident area where controls are established to
       keep emergency responders safe and preclude unauthorized entry. Cordon sizes vary and
       will be decided by the IC or be predetermined by local guidance. Cordons typically
       consist of military personnel and/or physical barriers that keep personnel out of the area
       affected by the incident. The goal of the cordon is prevent contamination and/or injury to
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               9


     both the personnel manning the cordon and the personnel they are keeping from the
     scene.
     1.2.7.2. The ECP location is established by the IC and initially located upwind or
     crosswind if upwind is not available, on the perimeter of the cordon, within a 90-degree
     arc on either side of the current surface wind.
         1.2.7.2.1. The ECP must be clearly marked for easy recognition by responding
         forces. At night, vehicle, flood or similar lights should illuminate the ECP.
         1.2.7.2.2. The ECP may be relocated to enhance entry and exit control procedures.
         1.2.7.2.3. When conditions (i.e. inclement weather) arise and relocation is not
         feasible, personnel manning ECPs and cordon/traffic control points should shelter in
         place or seek the closest cover/protection available.
  1.2.8. Evacuation. If required, all nonessential personnel must be directed to evacuate the
  accident scene in an upwind or crosswind direction towards a point designated by the IC.
     1.2.8.1. Removal of aircraft, missiles and other equipment requiring specialized actions
     is the responsibility of maintenance forces.
     1.2.8.2. Personnel evacuating the area should remove equipment, vehicles and material
     from the danger area.
     1.2.8.3. Priorities for evacuation are:
         1.2.8.3.1. Injured personnel.
         1.2.8.3.2. Endangered personnel.
         1.2.8.3.3. PL resources.
         1.2.8.3.4. Equipment carrying hazardous material.
         1.2.8.3.5. High-value or mission essential equipment.
         1.2.8.3.6. Fatalities.
  1.2.9. Release of Information. This term applies to public affairs material, of any
  means/medium for mass communications that is prepared for distribution, to disseminate
  facts or news to the public. It is also the act of disseminating information to the public.
  Release of information also includes release of records through the Freedom of Information
  Act (FOIA) as required by Title 5 United States Code, Section 552, and outlined in AF
  Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. At an accident
  scene or situation, Security Forces refer all questions to the Public Affairs Office.
     1.2.9.1. Air Force Policy. Air Force policy is to keep the public informed, on a timely
     basis, of unclassified information concerning Air Force activities, whether favorable or
     unfavorable.
     1.2.9.2. The Installation Public Affairs (PA) Officer will promptly release unclassified
     information about Air Force accidents or mission aircraft. This must be released
     promptly to news media representatives and recognized news gathering agencies.
     Written FOIA requests must be processed through the installation FOIA manager as
     outlined in AF Supplement to DoD Regulation 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302. Public

       affairs will coordinate releases of information with the installation Staff Judge Advocate
       (SJA).
   1.2.10. Control of Photography. Refer to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures.
   1.2.11. Responsibilities in Foreign Areas.
       1.2.11.1. The Department of State, in cooperation with the Agency for International
       Development, is responsible for determining US participation in conducting disaster
       relief operations in overseas locations.
       1.2.11.2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have provided instructions regarding the use of
       military resources in such operations to the commanders of unified commands for foreign
       areas.
       1.2.11.3. Air Force installation commanders in these areas must include guidance and
       procedures necessary to ensure prompt and effective response to the requirements of the
       unified command commander in their CEMP 10-2.
   1.2.12. Civil Defense Warning and Notification System. Refer to AFMAN 10-2504, Air
   Force Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters, for
   further information on this subject.
   1.2.13. Important Considerations after an Incident.
       1.2.13.1. Rescuing the injured.
       1.2.13.2. Preventing further injury and loss of life.
       1.2.13.3. Protecting property and investigative data of evidentiary value from loss or
       damage.
       1.2.13.4. Safeguarding any classified information within the vicinity.
       1.2.13.5. Meeting the needs of informing the public. Meeting this requirement under the
       chaotic conditions at an accident site calls for close cooperation and mutual
       understanding between Security Forces, Public Affairs and the news media
       representatives.
1.3. Phases of Incident Management. The Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)
incorporates the five phases of incident management: prevention, preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation. AFIMS provides the framework with which the installation Disaster
Response Force (DRF) responds to all EM incidents. DRF members will respond to an incident
per the installation‘s CEMP 10-2. Refer to AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force
Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures, for definitions and tasks
assigned during each phase. The Federal Emergency Management Agency‘s (FEMA‘s) web site
at http://www.fema.gov/ has information on the National Incident Management System
(NIMS).         FEMA also offers emergency management training on-line at
http://training.fema.gov/EMI/.
1.4. Security Forces Response. IAW AFI 10-2501, The Air Force will establish a single
integrated EM program to mitigate the effects of major accidents; natural disasters; conventional
attacks (including those using high-yield explosives); and terrorist use of CBRN materials on Air
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                11


Force personnel, resources, and operations. Reference AFI 10-2501, AFMAN 10-2502 and
AFMAN 10-2504 for further guidance and term definitions.
   1.4.1. Major Accidents, Including Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT).
      1.4.1.1. A major accident is an accident of such a magnitude as to warrant response by
      the installation DRF. It differs from day-to-day emergencies and incidents that are
      routinely handled by base agencies without the DRF.
      1.4.1.2. Security Forces (SF) are Emergency Responders for HAZMAT events and
      provide support to First Responders. SF personnel do not fill the traditional roles and
      responsibilities of civilian law enforcement agencies during HAZMAT events and will
      not investigate or operate in suspected warm or hot zones. SF will take no further action
      beyond the following:
          1.4.1.2.1. Initiating the alarm sequence by making the appropriate notifications.
          1.4.1.2.2. Providing entry control point management.
          1.4.1.2.3. Performing cordon security to support the IC.
          1.4.1.2.4. Providing counter-attack to protect mission critical resources. SF
          commanders must weigh the risk to forces by understanding the protective
          capabilities of SF IPE and the environment the force will be expected to operate in
          before committing an assault force. See AFTTP(I) 3-2.46, Multiservice Tactics,
          Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
          Protection, for information on assessment of NBC filter performance as they relate to
          protection against selected Toxic Industrial Chemicals.
   1.4.2. Natural Disasters.
      1.4.2.1. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope,
      urgency and degree of damage and destruction. When planning for natural disasters that
      could occur on or near the installation plan for the worst-case scenario. Specific natural
      disasters will differ in scope and effects. Therefore, response, recovery and mitigation
      actions will vary. A national-level response will be required to help Air Force
      installations recover from extensive natural disasters.
      1.4.2.2. Natural disasters include earthquakes, extreme heat or cold, floods and flash
      floods, hurricanes or typhoons, landslides and mudflows, thunderstorms and lightning,
      tornadoes, straight-line winds, cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes, wild land fires, avalanches,
      winter storms, and natural outbreaks of disease.
      1.4.2.3. Installations use the ICC and EOC for C2 of resources when responding to and
      recovering from natural disasters. When requested, MAJCOMs may choose to deploy all
      or part of their DRF to support installations affected by a natural disaster.
      1.4.2.4. Commanders must be able to maintain the primary installation mission, save
      lives, mitigate damage and restore mission-essential resources and infrastructure after a
      natural disaster.
      1.4.2.5. Base the level of response and actions on the magnitude of the disaster and
      degree of damage.
 12                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   1.4.3. Conventional attacks (including those using high-yield explosives); and terrorist use
   of CBRN materials.
       1.4.3.1. Recognize attack initiation and protect personnel, weapon systems, and material
       from weapon effects.
       1.4.3.2. Maintain airbase security and physical integrity.
1.5. Special Considerations for Response to HAZMAT or CBRNE incidents. When
responding to an emergency situation, Security Forces may accidentally come into contact with a
peacetime mishap involving a HAZMAT spill or a terrorist use of Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear, or High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) weapons, materials or agents. If
responding to a known HAZMAT or CBRNE incident, Security Forces personnel must proceed
cautiously to avoid becoming a victim of the incident and follow the directions of trained
HAZMAT responders.
   1.5.1. Response to Contaminated Incident Site. An initial task within the emergency
   responder missions is that the IC must establish control of the site to protect first responders
   and keep out unauthorized personnel. The strategy is to establish three distinct zones: the
   exclusion zone (Hot Zone), the contamination reduction zone (Warm Zone), and the support
   zone (Cold Zone). Security Forces primary responsibility during initial response is to
   establish, in concert with the IC, a cordon, Incident Command Post (ICP), ECP, and
   Decontamination Corridor (DC). The BDOC/ECC will contact all affected posts and patrols
   and FES and advise them to proceed to the Cold Zone ICP staging area.
   1.5.2. If an incident occurs in a Protection Level (PL) 1-3 resource restricted area,
   evacuation processes will have to be coordinated through the BDOC/ECC. Prior to
   evacuating Restricted Areas, ICs must consider the totality of the incident to include threat to
   life, availability of personal protective equipment and threat to PL 1-3 resources. This
   decision will be made before evacuating or relieving contaminated Security Forces personnel
   from their duty positions.
   1.5.3. If decontamination is required follow the instructions of the IC and/or FES personnel.
   The base Fire Chief (FC) will develop local decontamination procedures. The Defense Force
   Commander (DFC) will work with the base FC to conduct cross functional training and
   exercise process to determine the best solution for their installation.
   1.5.4. Decontamination processes and equipment available will vary dependent on the
   situation and hazard involved.
       1.5.4.1. Security Forces performing day-to-day duties are armed with a variety of
       weapons ranging from the handgun to heavy machineguns. These items are accountable
       and require special handling, storage and/or destruction per AFI 31-101, Integrated
       Defense. For more information on weapon decontamination processes, refer to AFMAN
       31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. NOTE: Equipment items that cannot be
       decontaminated will be destroyed.          This includes weapons and ammunition.
       MAJCOM/A7S will establish procedures for the immediate replacement of contaminated
       weapons and ammunition once it‘s determined that they cannot be reissued based on the
       type of contaminate. See AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, for
       procedures for accountability of items being destroyed.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   13


       1.5.4.2. In a high risk response, Security Forces must work with the FBI and the
       HAZMAT team to coordinate the collection of evidence. Only those SF members
       properly trained and equipped to collect contaminated evidence will participate in the
       handling of any contaminated evidence or material.
           1.5.4.2.1. The lead investigative agency may request that evidence is not
           decontaminated before being bagged. See AFI 31-206, Security Investigations
           Program, for evidence collection.
           1.5.4.2.2. The chain of custody of evidence collected at HAZMAT or CBRNE
           incidents must be part of the preplanning and execution.
       1.5.4.3. Security Forces personnel will be medically examined and depending on the
       situation or symptoms, transported to a Medical Treatment Facility (MTF).
1.6. Special Considerations for Criminal or Terrorist Use of CBRNE. As previously noted,
during all response actions, first responders must continually assess the situation and be alert for
indicators of terrorist or criminal intent or that the disaster may have been human-caused. If a
CBRNE incident is believed to have been human-caused, the following procedures apply.
   1.6.1. Security Forces members may likely become victims based on their location at the
   initiation of the incident or initial response to the incident scene. The decontamination
   process will be the same as other HAZMAT incidents.
   1.6.2. If evidence is found on someone that provides a reasonable belief that they were
   responsible for the CBRNE incident, immediately apprehend and notify the BDOC/ECC and
   IC. Example: While going through decontamination a person is found with a bag containing
   a white powdery substance. Based on the person‘s nervous behavior and the suspicious
   powder in the bag the person should be apprehended and the bag set aside as
   evidence. Decontamination of all personnel should occur prior to leaving the hazard zone.
       1.6.2.1. Consideration must be taken on how to transport the suspect to the
       Decontamination Corridor. The contaminated Security Forces unit will be responsible
       for the suspect until released to AFOSI or FBI agents to limit further contamination
       exposure to other Security Forces.
       1.6.2.2. When the contaminated Security Forces members are moving or transporting the
       suspect to the Decontamination Line, Security Forces flight leadership must plan to
       transfer the suspect, after decontamination, over to a two-person decontaminated Security
       Forces unit. Continual communication during decontamination and transfer is critical
       and must be adequately planned for and exercised.
   1.6.3. Suspect decontamination and handling procedures.
       1.6.3.1. During the decontamination of a suspect, the safety of the first responder at the
       Decontamination Line must be paramount. Officer safety and emergency responder
       safety must be foremost in the minds of the Security Forces members. The agency
       responsible for decontamination must be informed that a possible hostile suspect is being
       processed.
       1.6.3.2. The receiving ―clean‖ unit will handcuff and search the decontaminated suspect
       as he/she leaves the decontamination area. Handcuffing and searching of the suspect will
       take place before the suspect is taken to the next stage.
 14                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


       1.6.3.3. Security Forces must coordinate with the lead Federal Investigative Agency (e.g.
       AFOSI or FBI) as soon as possible; however, the transportation of a suspect who requires
       medical attention to the nearest medical treatment facility takes priority.
           1.6.3.3.1. If no coordination with the lead Federal Investigative Agency can be made,
           Security Forces will be responsible for maintaining the custody and guarding any
           suspect transported to medical treatment facilities until properly relived.
       1.6.3.4. The transfer of the suspect to AFOSI or FBI will be properly documented IAW
       established procedures.
1.7. Exercises. Installations must conduct exercises as outlined in the Integrated Defense Plan
(IDP), AT Plan (ATP) and CEMP 10-2. These plans must include functional exercises that
allow for coordinated responses between Fire Emergency Services personnel and Security
Forces. This will ensure first responders know how to work collaboratively during response to
real world and exercise scenarios. To the greatest extent possible, exercise scenarios should be
combined to meet the objectives of the installation IDP, ATP, and CEMP 10-2 while avoiding
redundancies.
1.8. Legal Considerations.
   1.8.1. The provisions of this AFMAN direct Air Force personnel in their responses to high
   risk incidents. The provisions apply largely to US-based installations. Any operations
   conducted at an installation overseas may be subject to additional regulations and restrictions
   depending on the Status of Forces Agreement or other bi-lateral agreements with the host
   nation.
   1.8.2. Any guidance in this AFMAN relating to riot control agents or other less than lethal
   means do not provide authority to use such non-lethal measures in any area where US forces
   are engaged in hostilities or contingency operation. Such use of non-lethal munitions is
   authorized only as directed in the Rules of Engagement for the particular operation or
   contingency.
   1.8.3. Air Force operations in the US must comply with the Posse Commitatus Act, which
   generally prohibits federal military personnel from conducting law enforcement activities off
   of a military installation. During some civil disturbance scenarios, and other limited
   circumstances, federal military forces may be permitted to conduct law enforcement
   activities. The installation SJA must be consulted before Air Force personnel are employed
   off of the installation to ensure the manner in which they are being used complies with
   federal law and regulation.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    15


                                            Chapter 2

                                   COUNTERING THREATS

2.1. Definitions. The following definitions are provided for the purpose of clear communication
and to standardize titles and descriptions for operational planning and response purposes.
   2.1.1. Insider Threat. The DoD defines an Insider Threat as ―A disaffected individual(s)
   within the force motivated to do violence against the force and the nation.‖
   2.1.2. Active Shooter. The DHS defines an Active Shooter as ―An individual actively
   engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most
   cases, active shooters use firearms(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of
   victims.‖
   2.1.3. Suspicious Activity. The DoD defines Suspicious Activity as ―Observed behavior that
   may be indicative of intelligence gathering or other preoperational planning related to a
   terrorist or other security threat to DoD interests worldwide.‖ There are thirteen categories
   of suspicious activity. These categories are clearly defined and can be found in Attachment
   2.
   2.1.4. Radicalization. The DHS defines Radicalization as ―The process of adopting an
   extremist belief system; including the willingness to use, support, or facilitate violence as a
   method to effect societal change.‖
   2.1.5. Workplace Violence. The Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA)
   defines Workplace Violence as ―Any physical assault, threatening behavior, or verbal abuse
   occurring in the work setting.‖
   2.1.6. School Violence. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines School violence ―as a
   subset of youth violence, which refers to harmful behaviors that may start early and continue
   into young adulthood… It includes bullying, slapping, punching, weapon use, and rape. The
   young person can be a victim, an offender, or a witness to the violence-or a combination of
   these‖.
2.2. Prevention. Prevention starts with the ability to detect potential threats. Numerous
documented case studies exist that indicated trends of behavior demonstrated prior to violent
actions taken by an Active Shooter or other insider threats. Attachment 3 standardizes these
indicators and facilitates training, detection, and reporting. These indicators are specific actions,
behaviors, or activities that correlate to the thirteen categories of suspicious activity and may
indicate an individual‘s propensity for violence. Additionally, this list of indicators incorporates
indicators of workplace violence. It is imperative that the DFC, ATO or S2 educate the base
populace on these indicators through awareness briefings and effective community policing,
crime prevention and workplace violence prevention programs.
   2.2.1. All reporting and response actions will be based on specific observed behaviors and
   other indicators of possible threats (not because of someone‘s race, ethnicity or religion).
   2.2.2. The people most likely to recognize potential threat indicators are friends, coworkers,
   and supervisors. The DFC, ATO, and S2 are charged with educating the base populace and
   enabling airmen to report individuals exhibiting behavioral indicators that are possibly
 16                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   indicative of violence, terrorist, or criminal activity. Educating our personnel to refer these
   individuals for additional law enforcement intervention or assistance enhances the overall
   integrated defense posture of an installation.
2.3. Reporting. Prevention through education and detection is critical, but proper reporting of
observed behaviors that may be indicative of violence, terrorist, or criminal activity enables law
enforcement officials to properly investigate and take appropriate action. As part of base
populace awareness training, the DFC, ATO, or S2 must educate the base populace on how to
properly report suspicious activity or behavior through appropriate law enforcement reporting
channels.
   2.3.1. eGuardian. eGuardian has been designated as the system of record for all DoD law
   enforcement agencies/activities. Security Forces shall coordinate with their local AFOSI
   detachment to use the eGuardian system for reporting, storing, and sharing unclassified
   Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) dealing with information regarding a potential threat or
   suspicious activity related to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
       2.3.1.1. No entry may be made in eGuardian based on a person's ethnicity, race, religion,
       or lawful exercise of rights or privileges guaranteed by the law, unless reasonable
       suspicion exists of a direct relationship between such information and a specific criminal
       act or behavior that may pose a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, and forces in transit.
       2.3.1.2. The following specific categories of information are not permitted to be entered
       into eGuardian: classified information; information that divulges sensitive methods and
       techniques; information derived in accordance with chapter 36 of title 50, U.S.C., also
       known as "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act" (Reference (t)); grand jury
       information; Federal taxpayer information; sealed indictments; sealed court proceedings;
       confidential human source and witness information; and any other information of which
       the dissemination is prohibited by law.
       2.3.1.3. The collection and retention of information on US citizens by non-intelligence
       units within the Department of Defense is regulated and must comply with Department of
       Defense Directive 5200.27, Acquisition of Information Concerning Persons and
       Organizations not Affiliated with the Department of Defense.
2.4. Workplace Violence. At each installation, the key to identifying and preventing workplace
violence is to place emphasis on engaging the individual‘s leadership and/or contacting Security
Forces or AFOSI regarding any concerns involving potential criminal conduct. Security Forces
is a key player in the Workplace Violence Program and the DFC must coordinate on any
installation plans concerning this program.
   2.4.1. Planning. Successful workplace violence prevention programs are based on a strong
   policy against violent behavior combined with effective training on understanding indicators
   of violence and properly reporting concerns to the appropriate agency. AFI 44-154, Suicide
   and Violence Prevention, Education, and Training, establishes policy and mandatory training
   requirements for USAF personnel on detecting/reporting indicators of workplace violence.
       2.4.1.1. Per AFI 44-154 unit commanders will ensure all personnel complete a
       mandatory suicide prevention and violence awareness education program.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 17


       2.4.1.2. Completion of the suicide prevention and violence awareness education program
       training will be documented, and a tracking mechanism developed to ensure training is
       accomplished.
       2.4.1.3. When an individual demonstrates indicators, unit leadership must be made aware
       to facilitate the appropriate response and support for the individual and the potential
       target to prevent further escalation of the situation.
       2.4.1.4. If Security Forces is contacted about personnel demonstrating indicators of
       potential workplace violence, Mental Health professionals and the individual‘s unit
       leadership must be notified.
   2.4.2. Response. If prevention fails, Security Forces must develop procedures for responding
   to and resolving incidents of violence. A plan specific to workplace violence should be
   included in the IDP as an attachment. Additional information concerning workplace violence
   is available from the Office of Personnel Management at the following website:
   http://www.opm.gov/employment_and_benefits/worklife/officialdocuments/handbooksg
   uides/WorkplaceViolence/index.asp.
   2.4.3. Resiliency.    The TSR team will provide TSR services to enhance resilience to
   potentially traumatic events.
   2.4.4. Exercises. Installations should conduct an exercise that addresses response to an
   incident of workplace violence annually. Tabletop exercises are sufficient for exercising the
   partnership with local first responder agencies, but should not be used more than two years in
   a row to meet participation needs. Exercising the resiliency component of high-risk incidents
   is a critical part of assessing readiness. Exercises may be conducted in conjunction with other
   annual exercise requirements. Lesson Learned from these exercises should be thoroughly
   documented and reviewed and uploaded to the Air Force – Joint Lessons Learned
   Information System (AF-JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil/USAF.
2.5. School Violence. In recent years, there have been several incidents of violence in schools
throughout the United States. Although incidents of this nature are rare, many Air Force
installations have either DoD or locally sponsored schools on the installation. As a result,
installation commanders must ensure proper planning and exercises are conducted. Close
coordination between base and school officials is essential to successfully concluding any
school-related incidents.
   2.5.1. Planning. Security Forces must coordinate with school officials and become familiar
   with school policies concerning incidents on school grounds at their installation. Each school
   district has different policies and actions required based on incidents. If an installation
   school has no policies in force, base officials, including Security Forces, should assist them
   in establishing security and lock down procedures. Security Forces should inform school
   officials on their response capabilities and procedures as well, so all parties involved are
   comfortable with processes involved in response to school violence. MOAs must be
   maintained to address procedures; all procedures will be codified in the IDP.
       2.5.1.1. Jurisdiction. Local SJAs provide advice on the implications of installation
       jurisdictional requirements for schools located on Air Force installations. Jurisdictional
       requirements will necessitate different and varying responses by Security Forces and
       could require support from local Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).
18                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     2.5.1.2. Diagrams and Maps. Security Forces will have maps of school facilities and
     grounds immediately available to assist in responses to violence.
     2.5.1.3. Cordons. Security Forces and Fire Emergency Services will predetermine
     cordons for response to eliminate confusion that may occur upon notification of an
     incident at an installation school. Upon actual response to an incident, the cordon may be
     adjusted to accommodate specific threats.
     2.5.1.4. Encourage the use of Security Forces personnel that are already assigned duties
     as instructors at the schools [e.g. Drug Abuse Resistance and Education (DARE)
     instructors] to coordinate and exercise plans. These personnel already have a rapport
     with the children and they are familiar with the layout of the school.
     2.5.1.5. Coordinate with school officials (school liaison officer) for periodic
     walkthroughs with an MWD to familiarize the canine and handlers with school facilities.
     This also acquaints the faculty and students with this process.
     2.5.1.6. Security Forces will coordinate with school officials prior to utilizing school
     facilities for training. Active school facilities are best used during periods when school is
     not in session (weekends, spring breaks, holidays, etc.). School officials have the final
     say as to how their facilities are utilized.
  2.5.2. Reporting and Response. School officials should immediately lock down the school
  and notify Security Forces for immediate response to school incidents. The lock down
  process is necessary to ensure the safety of their students and accountability of students and
  personnel. School officials should report school violence incidents using the installation‘s
  emergency response telephone numbers or alarms, when available. Upon arrival, Security
  Forces must immediately contain the situation and enclose the scene. Attempt to obtain
  information on the subject‘s location and accountability of all students and faculty.
  2.5.3. Media. Media interest at scenes of school violence will be high. Ensure PA is
  immediately involved in establishing a media reception plan and media center to assist with
  information flow.
  2.5.4. Parents. As mentioned earlier, parental requirements at the scene will be challenging.
  The EOC Director and IC should select and establish an area for parents to respond to and
  receive information. PA is responsible for all information flow; however, Airman and
  Family Readiness Center, chaplains and medical personnel can assist with this. Give parents
  appropriate information for the situation.
  2.5.5. Resiliency. The TSR team will provide TSR services to enhance resilience to
  potentially traumatic events.
  2.5.6. Exercises. Installations that have on base schools, will conduct an exercise at least
  annually to bring all tasked agencies together to practice responding to a violent incident in a
  base school. It is recommended that an exercise occur during the school year so teachers and
  students can get involved as well. Exercising the resiliency component of high-risk incidents
  is a critical part of assessing readiness. Exercises may be conducted in conjunction with
  other annual exercise requirements. Lesson Learned from these exercises should be
  thoroughly documented and reviewed and uploaded to the Air Force – Joint Lessons Learned
  Information System (AF-JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil/USAF.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 19


2.6. Active Shooter. Active shooter incidents are incredibly dangerous and difficult because
there is no criminal objective (robbery, hostage taking) involved other than violence. Often, the
shooter has no regard for their life, and may be planning to die. These factors leave Security
Forces no other recourse but to locate and stop the shooter as quickly as possible. As a result,
installation commanders must ensure proper planning and exercises are conducted. Close
coordination between all tasked agencies and the base populace is essential to mitigate the threat
and minimize the loss of life in an Active Shooter incident.
   2.6.1. Planning. These types of incidents require preplanning and preparation in order to
   conclude the incident as quickly and as safely as possible. There are many tasks that can be
   considered but the following actions, at a minimum, must occur or be planned for
   immediately:
       2.6.1.1. Base Populace Education. In addition to awareness training on behavioral
       indicators as described in paragraph 2.2 and Attachment 3, the DFC, ATO, and S2 must
       ensure the base populace knows what actions to take upon notification that an Active
       Shooter incident is occurring at their location or elsewhere on base. This awareness
       training should be developed locally and contain a brief historical review of past
       incidents, but primarily focus on what actions airmen and civilians should take to protect
       themselves and assist responding forces. Special care should be taken to not divulge
       specific tactics, techniques, or procedures of responding forces.
       2.6.1.2. Each installation must develop and maintain an operational plan for response to
       active shooter incidents. This installation plan may be an element within an existing
       plan, such as the IDP, AT Plan or the CEMP 10-2, or a separate plan, as directed by the
       installation commander. These plans must incorporate all first responder agencies, to
       include off-base support, and be as detailed as possible to reduce the amount of time
       necessary to react, as response time is very crucial in this type of incident.
       2.6.1.3. Large Venues/Gathering Areas. Security Forces units must coordinate closely
       with owner/operators of large occupancy venues on the installation to become
       familiarized with those locations, both internally and externally.
       2.6.1.4. Arming Considerations. Security Forces goal is to always maintain superior fire
       power during response to high-risk incidents. If possible, every patrolman entering the
       building should possess an additional weapon, such as a rifle, carbine, or shotgun, to
       provide additional range capability to engage an Active Shooter. Do not delay response
       waiting for additional weapons; the primary focus remains on locating and stopping the
       Active Shooter as quickly as possible.
       2.6.1.5. Law Enforcement Training. To ensure standardization of Active Shooter
       training, unit-level trainers will utilize the Active Shooter curriculum located in the
       Electronic Tactics, Techniques, & Procedures Guides (eTTPGs) Library located on the
       Air Force Security Forces Center website.                       The library is at
       https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil, on the left column, click ‗eTTPGs‘.
       2.6.1.6. Equipment Considerations.      Equipment availability must be considered and
       include:
           2.6.1.6.1. Concealable body armor. Concealable body armor should be a matter of
           routine use by all law enforcement and security patrols, as indicated by AFI 31-101,
20                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


         Integrated Defense. In an active shooter event, heavier armor such as an Improved
         Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) with ceramic plates carried in the patrol vehicle could
         provide a tactical advantage to the entry team. The responding patrol is required to
         stop the threat immediately and donning additional armor shall not take more than a 1
         to 2 minutes
         2.6.1.6.2. Flashlights. Electrical power could be disrupted, possibly intentionally by
         either the suspect or the responders, during the incident. Security Forces units are
         highly recommended to incorporate into training the use/handling of a flashlight and a
         weapon simultaneously.
         2.6.1.6.3. Breaching equipment. This kind of equipment may be needed to force
         entry to a secure building. These tools include a ballistic shield, single-person door
         ram, Halligan tool, and bolt cutters. These tools should be contained in a man-
         portable backpack so they can be carried by any of the responding teams. Each
         Security Forces member should undergo thorough familiarization training on the
         employment of these tools.
         2.6.1.6.4. In addition to Security Forces standardized duty gear, consideration should
         be given to add individual first aid kits (IFAK), felt tip markers, portable litters, and
         Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MRE) or energy bars to Security Forces A-bags.
  2.6.2. Response. The primary goal of Security Forces in response to an Active Shooter
  incident is to eliminate the threat and minimize the loss of life. Each Security Forces
  member must realize that the speed of their response will minimize casualties, but will likely
  not prevent all loss of life. Unless otherwise directed by Base Defense Operations Center
  (BDOC) or the Flight Sergeant, the Security Forces member must take immediate action to
  eliminate any active threat to human life.
     2.6.2.1. Security Forces need to have an accurate understanding of the tactical situation,
     and a working plan to confront it. Because there is little time to develop an extensive
     plan at the scene, patrolmen should mentally prepare and build an action plan in advance.
     All actions should be in accordance with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air
     Force Personnel.
         2.6.2.1.1. Notify BDOC immediately of what teams are entering, what avenues of
         approach are used, and their associated armament and equipment.
         2.6.2.1.2. Upon arriving, if there is an active shooting in progress, do not verbalize
         your intent to use force if it endangers yourself or others. Use lethal force IAW AFI
         31-207.
         2.6.2.1.3. If the suspect manages to barricade himself/herself in a manner that limits
         physical/visual contact and is no longer an active threat, initiate EST or civilian
         Special Reaction Team (SRT) response. Refer to Chapter 3 for specific guidance in
         handling a barricaded subject.
     2.6.2.2. The scene will be loud and chaotic. Terrified victims may be able to direct you
     to the shooter and the sound of shooting may also assist in locating the shooter. The
     shooter will be highly focused on violence.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             21


     2.6.2.3. A Security Forces member can use the chaos and the shooter‘s diverted focus as
     cover to move quietly to a position of advantage.
     2.6.2.4. Incident Command. The initial incident command will come from the senior
     Security Forces member on-scene until transferred to a certified/trained IC and the
     AFIMS Incident Command System is established. At that time, the senior Security
     Forces member on scene will assume the role of Operations Section Chief (OpsSC), as
     outlined in AFMAN 10-2502, until properly relieved by higher Security Forces authority.
     The IC will retain overall management of the entire incident and supporting functions.
        2.6.2.4.1. The IC must establish a safe staging area for follow-on forces to include
        FES, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), and other on and off-base tasked
        agencies.
        2.6.2.4.2. The IC should have a pre-established code word that all responding units
        will use if they locate an improvised explosive device (IED) or other deliberately
        placed hazard at the incident scene. This code word must be incorporated into pre-
        planning and exercises.
     2.6.2.5. OpsSC Responsibilities. The OpsSC is responsible for the tactical operations at
     the incident, to include knowing the number of responding patrols at the scene, team
     compositions, roles and armament, team locations in facility/building, and up-to-date
     suspect actions to brief follow-on forces and the IC. The senior on-scene Security Forces
     representative will request assistance through the IC such as additional personnel,
     obtaining affected facility schematics to properly track and coordinate the various teams
     entering the building, or any other resources needed to mitigate the incident. This
     information, plus other critical data, must be transmitted to and documented by BDOC,
     ECC and/or EOC accordingly.
        2.6.2.5.1. The OpsSC will coordinate through the IC a methodical and efficient plan
        to clear the building or scene after any immediate threat is terminated. This is
        necessary to ensure there are no IED or additional subjects prior to allowing
        emergency responders in to tend to casualties.
        2.6.2.5.2. Consider tracking evacuated personnel by their original location at the
        incident scene. While not the primary focus, this will enable crime scene
        reconstruction and assist investigators.
     2.6.2.6. Team Composition/Additional Support. If the threat cannot be stopped by the
     initial responding patrol(s), try to isolate and contain it, and await backup.
     Backup/support should come in the form of specialized teams that have been specifically
     trained (see para 4.6.1.5.) in the role of Entry Team, Contact Team, and Search/Rescue
     Team. These teams should deploy in a manner that gets them to the shooter quickly, and
     offers a tactical advantage. The following is a brief synopsis of each team‘s capability
     and role:
        2.6.2.6.1. Entry Team. The primary role of the Entry Team is to immediately locate
        and eliminate the threat and minimize the loss of life. All Security Forces personnel
        should be trained to perform the role of Entry Team.
22                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


         2.6.2.6.2. Contact Team. The Contact Team‘s role is to limit the shooters movement,
         prevent escape, communicate status to the OpsSC and/or IC, provide preliminary
         assessment (dynamic intelligence), give victim locations and medical needs if time
         permits, report explosives types and locations, offer descriptions and locations of
         suspects, describe the shooter(s) weapons, and apprehend the suspect(s) if capable.
         2.6.2.6.3. Search/Rescue Team. The Search/Rescue Team‘s role is to recover
         casualties by entering or approaching danger areas to locate victims, extract victims
         to a safe area and relay medical information to the OpsSC, who will relay to the IC
         and medical personnel. Prior to entry, the team must know where to direct the
         uninjured and ambulatory (who can walk or run) in order to send them to a safe area.
         In the case of multiple victims, the search/rescue team(s) may need to be expanded or
         multiplied. Methodical control of the area around them must be emphasized by the
         search/rescue team and a system of identifying and accounting for victims must be
         put in place.
     2.6.2.7. Crime Scene Preservation. Once the incident site is secured, it and the
     surrounding area becomes a crime scene. All first responders, including Fire and/or
     Medical personnel, and all other individuals will have to be cleared by the IC before entry
     into the secured incident site. Legal jurisdiction and any agreements with outside law
     enforcement agencies will determine who has the responsibility to collect and store
     evidence and which agency will take the lead investigative role. Contact the base SJA for
     guidance. An active shooter incident will most likely include the formation of a Law
     Enforcement Joint Operations Center (JOC) to integrate/house the multiple law
     enforcement agencies involved in the investigation. The Air Force Office of Special
     Investigations (AFOSI) SAIC (Special Agent in Charge) or the DFC will most likely be
     the primary liaison within the JOC. At the scene, Security Forces will play an important
     role in maintaining the installation mission of protecting Air Force property, resources,
     and personnel.
  2.6.3. Jurisdiction. Local SJAs provide advice on evidence collection and the implications
  of jurisdictional requirements for facilities and open areas located on Air Force installations.
  Jurisdictional requirements will necessitate different and varied responses by Security Forces
  and other assisting law enforcement agencies.
  2.6.4. Media. Media interest at scenes of an active shooter incident will be high. The IC,
  through PA, is responsible for all public information flow. The Installation Commander or
  IC must ensure the PA Officer is a key player in exercises and training, and in the event of an
  actual incident, is immediately involved in establishing a media reception plan and media
  center to assist with information flow.
  2.6.5. Families. The EOC Director, through the Airman and Family Readiness Center
  (A&FRC) should establish an area for families to gather at to receive information and consult
  with Chaplains and other family support personnel. Like other agencies, the A&FRC must
  be included in all installation planning efforts to ensure their rapid and efficient response to
  an actual event. NOTE: This is a traumatic event for all involved. Lessons Learned have
  demonstrated the need to cordon the affected area to prevent emotional family members and
  friends from attempting to enter the incident scene.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                           23


  2.6.6. Resiliency. Following an Active Shooter incident, it is essential that all Security
  Forces members and Emergency Responders have access to a TSR Team. The installation
  TSR Team should have Security Forces personnel assigned to it to provide responding
  Security Forces incident personnel with peer support.
  2.6.7. Exercises. Installations must conduct Active Shooter exercises annually IAW AFI 10-
  2501. Exercising the resiliency component of high-risk incidents is a critical part of
  assessing readiness. Exercises may be conducted in conjunction with other annual exercise
  requirements. Lesson Learned from these exercises should be thoroughly documented and
  reviewed and uploaded to the Air Force – Joint Lessons Learned Information System (AF-
  JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil/USAF.
 24                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


                                           Chapter 3

                                    BARRICADED SUBJECTS

3.1. Initial Response. In high-risk situations that do not involve an Active Shooter, it is
important that Security Forces immediately contain or enclose the scene. On-duty Security
Forces personnel are likely to be the initial response element on scene. The first arriving unit
will establish command and control and assume the role of initial IC and initiate the Incident
Command System. The IC will maintain control of the situation until properly relieved of
command by a senior official/competent authority, based on parameters of the incident. Some
barricaded suspect cases involve hostage taking. Information regarding hostage situations is
described in further detail in Chapter 5.
   3.1.1. Responding units must keep the BDOC/ECC informed of the following:
       3.1.1.1. Arrival on scene.
       3.1.1.2. Position.
       3.1.1.3. Safe avenues of approach for other responding units.
       3.1.1.4. Status of the situation.
   3.1.2. To reduce risk, the patrolmen should take a covered position where they can best see
   what is happening while preventing the suspect from escaping. Immediately evacuate all
   nonessential personnel far enough away so they are in no danger of being taken hostage or hit
   by a suspect‘s fire. Do not allow volunteers or family members to start or become involved
   in any negotiations.
3.2. Containment of the Scene.
   3.2.1. Establish a cordon. The initial IC will direct the establishment of a 360-degree cordon
   at the scene of a barricaded subject. This cordon will be established and maintained by
   Security Forces, or designated augmentation forces, until the IC determines there is no longer
   a need. The senior Security Forces member on scene does this by assigning Security Forces
   personnel to establish inner and outer perimeters. How far these perimeters are established
   from the scene depends on the scope, complexity, and location of the incident.
       3.2.1.1. Outer perimeter. The outer perimeter is established to prevent people from
       interfering with recovery operations and to keep innocent bystanders and onlookers from
       being hurt. This perimeter should be established outside the maximum effective range of
       any weapons the barricaded subject has, if Security Forces members can establish the
       type/caliber of the weapon(s) involved. Direct all vehicles and pedestrians not involved
       in response and recovery operations away from the threat area. Set up an ECP along the
       outer perimeter in an area that is easily accessible to responding units. Send all personnel
       who need to enter the area to the ECP.
       3.2.1.2. Inner perimeter. Security Forces personnel normally establish the inner
       perimeter to contain the immediate scene. The Emergency Services Team (EST), if
       available, may replace on-duty Security Forces personnel posted on the inner perimeter if
       deemed appropriate for use by the OpsSC and IC. Guidance governing establishing,
       training, and utilizing EST can be found in Chapter 6. Security Forces can adjust the
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    25


       inner perimeter as needed. Due to the dangers involved, strict control of the area must be
       maintained. Only key personnel, such as EST, negotiation teams, and the senior
       representatives from Security Forces, Fire Emergency Services, and Emergency Medical
       Services, are allowed within the inner perimeter and only at the direction of the IC.
       Security Forces, or EST if available, is responsible for searching and clearing the inner
       perimeter. At this point, the installation commander could choose to have the lead
       agency assume control of the situation.
3.3. Establishing Jurisdiction and Command and Control.
   3.3.1. Role of Local Civilian Law Enforcement. The specific roles of state and local LEAs
   must be part of pre-incident planning. The type of jurisdiction (exclusive, partial, concurrent
   or proprietary) will dictate civil and military roles. Coordinate with the installation staff
   judge advocate prior to employment of off base law enforcement.
       3.3.1.1. Exclusive or Partial jurisdiction. For installations or portions of installations
       under exclusive federal jurisdiction, the state and local LEAs have no jurisdiction or
       authority, though they may seek or be asked to assist with security precautions and other
       duties consistent with their respective interests (e.g., off-installation traffic control,
       sealing the area).
       3.3.1.2. Concurrent or proprietary jurisdiction. If an incident occurs in an area of
       concurrent or proprietary jurisdiction, the status of the state and local LEAs is clearer, but
       roles in responding to the incident remain uncertain and must be clearly defined in plans.
       The installation commander exercises broad and ultimate authority to maintain law and
       order on the installation, notwithstanding concurrent state jurisdiction. The installation
       commander may also deny entry to or remove from the installation anyone who poses a
       threat to good order and discipline. It is recommended that the installation commander
       pursue memorandums of agreement (MOA) with local civilian law enforcement agencies
       to define response strategies and division of responsibilities (Attachment 4). These
       agreements must be exercised to validate their effectiveness and ensure the safety of the
       installation‘s personnel and resources.
3.4. Negotiations. The principle method for peacefully resolving a high-risk situation is
through the use of a negotiator. Each installation must have the services of a trained negotiator
available. Negotiators may be drawn from trained Security Forces, AFOSI, FBI, local civilian
LEAs, or even medical professionals. The source for the negotiator is determined by the
resources available in any given area and may be influenced by the incident itself. The source
for the negotiator capability must be determined in advance and available 24 hours a day for
immediate recall. A combination of sources may be used, i.e., AFOSI and Security Forces. For
further information concerning crisis negotiation, refer to Chapter 5.

                                            Chapter 4

                    DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE RESPONSE

4.1. Domestic Violence. Security Forces personnel must be prepared to encounter potentially
hostile incidents of domestic violence. Security Forces need to know how to diffuse these
incidents and regain control of the situation. Each year law enforcement personnel, including
Security Forces, are injured or killed responding to family violence calls.
   4.1.1. Studies have shown that family violence calls are often repeat calls. When the initial
   call is not effectively handled, it is likely the situation will reoccur and the patrolmen will be
   called again. By learning how to recognize child abuse/neglect and spouse abuse and by
   acquiring the skills necessary to act accordingly, Security Forces personnel can:
       4.1.1.1. Reduce the likelihood of injury to the family member.
       4.1.1.2. Provide protection to victims of family violence.
       4.1.1.3. Avoid repeat calls.
   4.1.2. Security Forces personnel have a critical role to play in restoring order and preventing
   future incidents of family violence. They are trained to respond in an emergency and have
   transportation and communication equipment immediately available. Security Forces also
   have the authority to intervene and, if necessary, to detain or apprehend.
4.2. Security Forces Role in Domestic Violence. One of the missions of Security Forces is to
maintain law and order. To reestablish order and preserve the peace, Security Forces personnel
are required to respond to situations of domestic violence. The primary role in these situations is
to take immediate action to restore order and protect lives. In addition, the sponsor's unit
commander, first sergeant and the base family advocacy officer must be advised of all incidents
of family violence. AFOSI is responsible for investigating major offenses, including child abuse
and spousal abuse involving aggravated assault. The local AFOSI detachment must be notified
immediately of all child abuse or neglect allegations to assist in determining who the
investigating authority is. Security Forces routinely investigate minor incidents of child
abuse/neglect and spousal abuse. Incidents should be recorded on AF Form 3545, Incident
Report, and AF IMT 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter. When peace has been restored and the
appropriate authorities have been notified of the incident, the Security Forces member‘s role has
ended, except where an offense has been committed and an apprehension will take place.
   4.2.1. Attitude of Responding Security Forces. The attitude of the responding Security
   Forces personnel, in many cases, will determine the attitude and cooperation of the family
   members involved. Realize that people may be hostile or angry, frightened or abusive,
   ashamed or uncooperative and they may view Security Forces personnel as intruders and
   resent their presence. The Security Forces member‘s approach should be calm, controlled
   and concerned. Care should be taken to avoid sarcastic or critical remarks, an impolite tone
   of voice or threatening or aggressive body positions. Hostility, indifference or aggression
   may provoke further violence while a sensitive and tactful approach may restore order and
   calm the situation.
   4.2.2. Best Approach. In responding to a call, keep in mind that each situation is different
   and must be treated individually. Meanings and attitudes might be read into words, facial
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   27


   expression and body positions. The best approach is a calm and positive one. Responses
   involving ongoing violent action or other aggressive actions by a suspect may require a more
   proactive and forceful response.
4.3. Unit Commander’s Role in Domestic Violence. Unit commanders are responsible for the
actions of assigned personnel, both on and off duty. This responsibility includes the behavior of
both military sponsors and their military dependents. Security Forces personnel should
recognize this command responsibility and duty to inform the commander of incidents of family
violence involving their assigned unit personnel and their family members.
4.4. Family Advocacy Officer’s Role in Domestic Violence. The Family Advocacy Officer
functions as the central coordinator for the base Family Advocacy Program. Under the direction
of the director of base medical services or chief of hospital services, the Family Advocacy
Officer performs a number of family violence prevention and intervention services. For more
information on family advocacy see AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy.
4.5. BDOC/ECC Controller’s Role in Domestic Violence. In answering family violence calls,
controllers must have all available information on the families and situations. The controller has
the responsibility for obtaining as much information as possible from the individual making the
call while dispatching a patrol unit. When a call is received indicating the possibility that family
violence has occurred or is occurring, the controller will:
   4.5.1. Obtain as much data as possible from the caller by asking who the involved parties
   are, what has happened, if the altercation is not currently ongoing when did it occur, where
   did it happen, where are the involved parties now, how the incident occurred, whether
   weapons were involved or available, and if medical aid is required.
   4.5.2. Asks the caller for the telephone number from which the call is being made. This
   enables the controller to call the number back to check the validity of the call and determine
   whether the situation has changed prior to the arrival of responding Security Forces patrols.
   4.5.3. Relay information to Security Forces responding to the situation. If the controller is
   unable to obtain a clear description of the situation, the responding unit(s) must be informed.
   4.5.4. Check AF Form 1314, Firearms Registration, roster or local firearms roster/database.
   4.5.5. Ensure that an appropriate patrol response has taken place, the controller will also
   ensure follow-up actions and referrals to unit commanders through first sergeants, family
   advocacy officer, and/or AFOSI has occurred. In cases where the reported abuse is not
   currently ongoing, a patrol response may not be appropriate. In these instances, coordination
   between the controller and their supervisory chain of command, the unit commander of the
   military member involved, AFOSI and the family advocacy officer will determine the
   appropriate response. If the incident has already occurred and is not currently in progress, it
   may be more appropriate to dispatch a Security Forces Investigator or AFOSI to the incident
   to investigate in accordance with AFI 31-206.
   4.5.6. Contact AFOSI immediately to meet the dispatched patrol when notified by the base
   hospital that a victim of a suspected child abuse incident is being treated.
 28                                                 AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


4.6. Patrol Response.
   4.6.1. Arriving Safely. The responding patrol(s) must drive to the scene as quickly and
   safely as possible. Patrols must comply with the standards set forth in AFI 31-201,
   Attachment 2, USAF Security Forces Model Vehicle Operation Policy.
      4.6.1.1. The responding patrol should formulate a plan before arrival to include
      determining in advance who will be in charge, who will approach first, who will serve as
      backup, etc.
      4.6.1.2. Use discretion when approaching a house where a domestic disturbance is
      occurring. Park Security Forces vehicles at least one (1) house away from the address of
      the incident. Parking directly in front of the house in question may escalate the situation
      or warn residents to conceal evidence of a crime. For the same reasons, flashing lights
      and sirens should be turned off at least one block before arrival and there should be no
      loud noises like slamming car doors or blaring radio communications.
   4.6.2. Approaching the Scene. Security Forces personnel must use caution when
   approaching the house of a domestic violence complaint.
      4.6.2.1. Before approaching the house, Security Forces personnel should stop and listen.
      Windows, doors, adjoining buildings or areas of possible concealment should be visually
      checked for unusual movements or objects.
      4.6.2.2. Security Forces must exercise caution if they decide to approach from the side or
      back door instead of the front door, as they could be mistaken for prowlers and escalate a
      situation.
      4.6.2.3. If the approach is made at night and flashlights are used, they should not be
      shined in windows. Avoid silhouetting other patrols; light discipline is essential.
   4.6.3. Entry Procedures. Security Forces personnel should always be dispatched in pairs to
   domestic violence calls and should always stand to one side of the door, never in front of it.
   The second Security Forces member should be behind and to one side of the first, in position
   to maintain visual contact with the inside of the residence and provide cover.
      4.6.3.1. Before knocking, pause and listen at the door. Security Forces personnel may be
      able to obtain information on the nature of the disturbance and whether or not it is violent
      before announcing their presence.
      4.6.3.2. Check screen doors before knocking to see whether they are locked. Locked
      screen doors can create an unexpected barrier between the Security Forces member and
      residents if immediate action is required.
      4.6.3.3. Knock on the door in a calm non-aggressive manner or use the doorbell, ringing
      only once each time. When knocking on the door, do not stand directly in front of the
      door. It creates the ―fatal funnel‖ effect and may put the Security Forces member at a
      disadvantage.
      4.6.3.4. Evaluate the risk of entry, even when invited to enter, and respond accordingly.
      4.6.3.5. If there is no response at the door and the dwelling appears quiet, the address
      should be verified with the BDOC/ECC controller. If the address is correct, the sides and
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              29


     rear of the quarters should be checked for indications of the presence of the occupants.
     Neighbors may also provide useful information.
  4.6.4. Initial Contact with Residents. Depending on the situation Security Forces personnel
  should display a calm, positive and helpful manner. Initial impressions will set the tone for
  the interview.
     4.6.4.1. When someone answers the door, Security Forces personnel should introduce
     and identify themselves and state the reason for their presence.
     4.6.4.2. If not invited into the dwelling, Security Forces personnel should request to
     move the discussion inside. This will remove the situation from the view of the
     neighbors and enable observation of:
         4.6.4.2.1. Any injuries requiring treatment;
         4.6.4.2.2. Location and number of the disputants;
         4.6.4.2.3. Visible weapons and threatening moves;
         4.6.4.2.4. Living conditions;
         4.6.4.2.5. Emotional stage of dispute and emotional condition of disputants;
         4.6.4.2.6. Impairment;
         4.6.4.2.7. Children at risk;
         4.6.4.2.8. Physical damage to property.
     4.6.4.3. Separate the disputants as necessary and maintain visual contact with the other
     Security Force members. If possible, keep disputants away from rooms and items that
     can be dangerous to themselves or Security Forces members.
     4.6.4.4. After providing for any necessary medical assistance and calming the situation,
     obtain information on the family structure and background. Such information will give
     important background and allow a "cooling off" period. Questions asked may include:
         4.6.4.4.1. Names and whereabouts of the sponsor and family members;
         4.6.4.4.2. Sponsor‘s rank, (and any other military member‘s) social security number
         and unit;
         4.6.4.4.3. Relationship and legal status of residents: i.e., nephew, uncle, boyfriend,
         girlfriend, valid marriage, for example;
         4.6.4.4.4. Length of residence in quarters and period assigned to installation;
         4.6.4.4.5. Ages and relationships of children;
         4.6.4.4.6. Whether military or civilian police have been required to respond to
         previous incidents;
         4.6.4.4.7. Whether the family has been to family advocacy office.
  4.6.5. Visual Observation. Observing conditions inside the quarters while obtaining
  background information may give ideas of the cause contributing to the situation. The
  behavior of residents can provide important clues.
 30                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


       4.6.5.1. Signs of fear, hate, depression and embarrassment can be detected in facial
       expressions, eye movements and body positions.
       4.6.5.2. Be alert for sudden movements and continual glances at closed doors, closets or
       bureaus. Such actions may be the first indication the individual has a weapon available
       or is attempting to conceal the presence of an injured family member or other evidence.
       4.6.5.3. The condition of the home and appearance of the residents may provide clues to
       family functioning. If the living conditions are unusual, unsafe or unhealthy, Security
       Forces members may want to arrange for photographs of the scene and request response
       of the military member‘s first sergeant or commander.
4.7. Differentiating Types of Disputes.
   4.7.1. Violent Disputes. When responding to a violent disturbance, Security Forces
   personnel must immediately separate the disputants. If personnel being interviewed are a
   suspect/subject ensure you read them their rights IAW Article 31, Uniform Code of Military
   Justice (UCMJ) or the 5th Amendment United States Constitution. If medical attention is
   required, it should be secured at once. AFOSI must be contacted if the assault resulted in
   serious injuries.
       4.7.1.1. Security Forces personnel must be vigilant about their personal safety as well as
       that of disputants. In separating the persons involved, make a visual search for objects
       that could be used as weapons. The disputants should never be allowed to come between
       the Security Forces members. Disputants should never be left alone in another room and
       should not be moved to the kitchen because of the availability of potential weapons. If
       the disputants cannot be calmed, apprehension and removal to the BDOC may be
       necessary. CAUTION: The victim may become hostile or violent when a spouse or
       family member is apprehended, detained, or physically restrained.
       4.7.1.2. Alcohol is involved to some extent in many situations of domestic violence.
       Intoxicated people tend to be violent in disputes making it difficult to reason with them or
       obtain factual information from them. The individual may have to be removed from the
       scene until sober enough to be effectively interviewed.
       4.7.1.3. A potential danger exists in persons who are unusually quiet and controlled in
       highly emotional disputes. Such people may be near the breaking point and may become
       violent and upset by an innocent gesture or remark.
       4.7.1.4. During violent disputes, it may be beneficial to separate the parties out of sight
       from each other. Only do this if it does not put Security Forces personnel or other
       innocent bystanders at increased risk. Once they are separated and order is restored, the
       parties may be interviewed.
   4.7.2. Verbal Disputes. The difference between violent disputes and verbal disputes is that
   in a verbal dispute, a physical assault has not occurred. The parties involved may be easier to
   reason with and a prompt resolution to the dispute is more likely.
       4.7.2.1. Remove the disputants to separate rooms if possible. Avoid leaving them alone
       or in the kitchen or other areas that may provide them access to weapons.
       4.7.2.2. Separating normally causes a distraction to the disputants. If Security Forces
       personnel use a calm, firm and assured tone of voice, it may further distract the disputants
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  31


       and better control the situation. Once they are separated and order is restored, the parties
       may be interviewed.
   4.7.3. Disputes Involving Children. In disputes where one disputant is a child or young
   adult, there may be a feeling in the youth of resentment against authority figures. The youth
   may assume that Security Forces will automatically side with the parents. Therefore, when
   answering such a disturbance call, an attitude of concern and understanding for the child‘s
   version of the argument is important. The youth‘s feelings, problems and thoughts should be
   listened to and evaluated as carefully as those of the parents or other disputants. However,
   take care not to interfere with parental rights regarding the children. If other children are
   present, but not involved in the dispute, ask parents to remove them from the room.
4.8. Conducting the Interview.
   4.8.1. The purpose of the interview is to:
       4.8.1.1. Assess the immediate danger to family members and need for medical assistance
       or protective custody;
       4.8.1.2. Determine whether suspected abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred;
       4.8.1.3. Determine the appropriate response to the situation;
       4.8.1.4. Identify the perpetrator if possible;
       4.8.1.5. Protect the legal rights of suspects;
       4.8.1.6. Identify victims and give them proper assistance.
   4.8.2. Gathering Information. Separate personnel and conduct interviews. Each person
   should be interviewed. If personnel being interviewed could be a suspect/subject, ensure you
   read them their rights IAW Article 31 of the UCMJ for military members or the 5th
   Amendment U.S. Constitution for civilians.
4.9. Security Forces Actions. Three actions may occur in domestic violence situations;
referral, temporary separation or apprehension. After order has been restored, one or more of
these actions is possible.
   4.9.1. Referral. If the BDOC/ECC controller has not already done so, request notification of
   the unit commander or first sergeant, AFOSI, and the family advocacy officer of the
   situation, as appropriate.
   4.9.2. Temporary Separation. Family members may be separated to ensure safety and
   protection. For example, the first sergeant may suggest that a spouse temporarily leave the
   quarters or a commander may order the separation by temporarily having the military
   member stay in a dormitory or military lodging facility. If a child‘s safety is threatened, take
   appropriate action under state law, including contacting child protective services. AFOSI has
   primary jurisdiction for serious child abuse or neglect involving infliction of serious bodily
   harm. The Security Forces role in this instance is to provide whatever support is requested
   by the hospital or commander.
   4.9.3. Apprehension. Apprehension may be the most prudent course of action when:
       4.9.3.1. There is a formal complaint;
32                                                 AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     4.9.3.2. Probable cause exists that a violation of the UCMJ or local law has occurred;
     4.9.3.3. The family member refuses to cooperate with Security Forces, unit commander
     or first sergeant or family advocacy officials.
     4.9.3.4. If it becomes necessary to control someone who is not subject to the Uniform
     Code of Military Justice they will be detained, rather than apprehended, until such time as
     they can be handed over to local authorities.
  4.9.4. Victim and Witness Assistance Program. Security Forces personnel investigating
  crimes must ensure all victims and witnesses are provided a DD Form 2701, Initial
  Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, to ensure victims/witnesses are aware of
  their rights under the Victim and Witness Assistance Program. For more information, refer
  to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice and Department of Defense Instruction
  (DoDI) 1030.02., Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures. NOTE: If suspected of
  committing an offense, a party will require rights advisement, pursuant to Article 31 of the
  UCMJ for military members or the 5th Amendment U.S. Constitution for civilians.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    33


                                            Chapter 5

                                    CRISIS NEGOTIATION

5.1. Overview. A crisis overrides an individual‘s normal psychological and biological coping
mechanisms. During crisis situations, people spontaneously turn to others for comfort, support,
understanding, and protection. A crisis does have the potential to disconnect individuals from
needed sources of support. The absence of support during a crisis represents the loss of the
primary human coping resource and often results in a subject‘s illogical and highly emotional
behavior. All of these factors make crisis situations difficult to control and negotiators must first
have a fundamental understanding of crisis negotiation in order to reach successful resolution of
situations.
5.2. Types of Behavior. When responding to a crisis involving a hostage taker or barricaded
subject, negotiators normally experience one of two categories of behavior; instrumental or
expressive. Although these two distinctly different categories of behavior represent opposite
ends of a continuum, subjects may often exhibit elements of both types during an incident.
   5.2.1. Instrumental Behavior. Instrumental behavior is characterized by substantive
   demands and clearly recognizable objectives that, if attained, will benefit the subject.
   5.2.2. Expressive Behavior. Expressive behavior is designed to communicate the subject‘s
   frustration, outrage, passion, despair, anger, or other feelings.
5.3. Types of Hostage Takers. Hostage takers usually fall into one of four major types;
mentally disturbed persons, criminals trapped during the commission of a crime, prisoners who
are revolting, or political terrorists attempting to produce social change through threat of or use
of violence.
   5.3.1. Hostage taking, by the very nature of the act, forces the hostage taker into stereotyped
   responses. The hostage becomes a pawn, caught between the hostage taker and authorities.
   The hostage takers become violent, strive to control the situation and move the event toward
   completion of their objective.
   5.3.2. The hostage, by conduct, can enhance or diminish their chance of survival. The more
   the hostage understands about their hostage taker, the better they will be able to predict the
   hostage takers behavior and feel some degree of control. This can assist by diminishing the
   hostages fear.
5.4. Reasoning Behind the Taking of Hostages. Hostage taking represents a unique bargain
struck over the value of human life. Whatever the immediate motivation, the basic purpose
remains the same. Hostage taking is a way of setting up a bargaining position to achieve an
otherwise unattainable objective.
   5.4.1. A victim may be chosen because the hostage taker believes they can receive a large
   ransom for the victim‘s return or because they‘re well-known, hold a significant job position,
   or simply because of their affiliation with a country, state, or organization. A victim may
   simply be hated by their captors and the captor may blame the victim directly for any
   personal grievances.
 34                                                   AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   5.4.2. Most of the time, the hostage is just an innocent victim of circumstance who happened
   to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
5.5. Types of Situations. All crisis situations, regardless of motive, mental health, or criminal
history of the subject are either hostage or non-hostage situations. Understanding the difference
between the two is paramount to successful resolution of the situation.
   5.5.1. Hostage Situations. Subjects demonstrate goal-oriented and purposeful behavior.
   They hold another person or persons for the purpose of forcing fulfillment of substantive
   demands upon a third party, usually law enforcement. Substantive demands include things
   they cannot obtain for themselves, such as money, escape, and political or social change.
   They use hostages as leverage to fulfill their demands.
   5.5.2. Non-Hostage Situations. Subjects often act in an emotional, senseless, and self-
   destructive manner and have no clear goals. Unable to control their emotions in response to
   life‘s many stressors, they are motivated by anger, rage, frustration, hurt, confusion, or
   depression, and often exhibit purposeless, self-defeating behavior. They have no substantive
   or escape demands or totally unrealistic demands that they have no reasonable expectation of
   fulfilling. Disgruntled employees, jilted lovers, rejected spouses, aggrieved individuals,
   idealistic fanatics, individuals with mental illness, and others with unfulfilled aspirations who
   feel they have been wronged by others or events fall into this broad category. Non-Hostage
   situations often result in Domestic Violence, Workplace Violence, or an Active Shooter
   scenario.
5.6. High Risk Indicators. Law enforcement authorities should be familiar with a number of
high risk factors involving background characteristics and behavioral patterns of the subject so
appropriate actions may be taken. Law enforcement authorities should be especially wary of a
situation that involves a subject who has a history of similar incidents, or who has had previous
problems with the hostage(s). Particular attention should be given to whether there have been
previous restraining orders issued against the subject for incidents of child or spouse abuse.
   5.6.1. Background Characteristics. Subjects with certain background characteristics have a
   greater potential for being involved in a volatile incident.
       5.6.1.1. Multiple Stressors
       5.6.1.2. Home Environment Stresses Male Dominance
       5.6.1.3. Similar Incidents and Problems with Victims
       5.6.1.4. Lacks Family or Social Support System
   5.6.2. Behavioral Patterns. Behavioral patterns may also give insight into the type of subject
   involved in the situation. Types of behavior negotiators may encounter include:
       5.6.2.1. Forcing Confrontation with Police
       5.6.2.2. Threatening or Injuring Victim(s)
       5.6.2.3. Verbalizing Intent to Commit Suicide
5.7. Philosophy of Crisis Negotiation. The philosophy of crisis negotiations includes self-
control, approach, empathy, and process. These four separate but interrelated steps have a
bearing on the outcome of successful negotiations.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    35


   5.7.1. Self-Control. The only aspect of a crisis situation we have absolute control of is our
   own emotions. When confronted with a difficult subject, the first step is not to control the
   subject‘s behavior, but to control your own behavior.
   5.7.2. Approach. Don‘t confuse getting even with getting what you want. Work toward de-
   escalation of the situation in order to lower tensions. Focus on the process of satisfying each
   side‘s needs, rather than the outcome, victory. The subject may be frustrated, angry, afraid,
   confused, depressed, or demonstrating other emotions. Listening is most effective
   concession you can make when negotiating. Show respect for the subject regardless of the
   circumstances or situation.
   5.7.3. Empathy. Empathy absorbs tension, and should be used to see through the eyes of the
   subject. A calm controlled demeanor is more effective than a brilliant argument. Being
   ―right‖ is not the issue. The issue is making the attempt to correctly understand what the
   subject is saying.
   5.7.4. Actively listen to the subject and acknowledge their point of view. This does not
   equate to agreeing with the subject. Attempt to find common ground and agree with the
   subject whenever you can without conceding. Don‘t argue with subjects. Attempt to create
   a positive atmosphere. Remember that people don‘t always say what they mean. Attempt to
   identify their true meaning, and be aware the true meaning is often an unsatisfied need.
   NOTE: Negotiators are not in the business of meeting demands, but rather they attempt to
   satisfy each side‘s needs.
5.8. Response. There are generally four choices for commanders at a hostage situation. The
first traditional confrontational response is to amass patrolmen and massive firepower and
assault. The second is to use selective sniper fire. The third is to use chemical agents. The
fourth is to contain the area and negotiate with a specially trained negotiator. The first three will
almost always result in injury.
   5.8.1. If possible, progress from a lesser response option to increased force options as the
   situation unfolds. If the threat to the victims is believed low, then high-risk tactical actions
   are inadvisable and difficult to defend. If the threat to the victims is higher, then risk-
   effective tactical action is easier to defend and should at least be considered. Finally, if the
   threat to the victims is very high, then high-risk tactical action may be essential. It is
   extremely difficult to return to negotiating after an assault takes place.
   5.8.2. The linear approach, parallel application, and law enforcement attitudes play a
   significant part in response options.
       5.8.2.1. Linear Approach. The linear approach is a two-step approach. First, the
       negotiator tries to talk the subject out. Second, assault teams use force to take the subject
       out (if necessary). NOTE: Linear application of force almost always results in strong
       resistance from the subject(s), and should only be used as a last resort.
       5.8.2.2. Parallel Application. Parallel application is the use of negotiations and tactics in
       synchronization. Tactics don‘t simply follow failed negotiations; rather the proper use of
       tactics encourages negotiations. Weigh the benefits of reaching agreement through
       negotiations with the risk of disagreement potentially leading to tactical intervention. An
       appropriate limited display of tactical power is not the same as an overtly threatening use
       of that power. The goal remains to bring subjects to the table, not to their knees.
 36                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


       5.8.2.3. Law Enforcement Attitudes. Law enforcement authorities should be aware of
       how their attitudes can affect the outcome of crisis situations.
           5.8.2.3.1. Emotion. Keep your emotions under control regardless of what transpires
           during the situation.
           5.8.2.3.2. Haste. Don‘t make snap decisions or attempt to push the subject to agree
           to resolution.
           5.8.2.3.3. Rigidity.   Refusing to listen and negotiate does not aid in peaceful
           resolution.
           5.8.2.3.4. Creativity. Creativity is a strength. Use things subjects say to create
           opportunities to seek peaceful resolution.
           5.8.2.3.5. Flexibility. Flexibility is a strength. Being flexible and negotiating with
           the subject establishes rapport and trust, and aids in peaceful resolution.
           5.8.2.3.6. Patience. Do not develop preconceived ideas that you must do something
           to resolve the situation. Showing patience and having restraint is not a sign of
           weakness, and can contribute to peaceful resolution of situations.
5.9. Operations . The Operations Section Chief (OSC) must understand that the choices they
make during any situation not only involve them, but also the Incident Commander (IC), and
may be scrutinized both in a court of law and the court of public opinion. When making
decisions, the OpsSC should use a three-part action criterion: 1) is the contemplated action
necessary 2), is the contemplated action risk-effective, and 3) is the contemplated action
acceptable in a particular situation? OpsSCs should be prepared to answer why they took action
when they did and whether they fully explored and attempted to implement less risky alternatives
first. OpsSCs should coordinate with SJA, as needed.
   5.9.1. Tactical Intervention. Loss of life is most likely to occur during tactical intervention.
   Therefore, before initiating any tactical action, the OpsSC must carefully consider the current
   threat to hostages/victims and risks tactical officers face.
   5.9.2. Unified Strategy. The OpsSC must bring all key component leaders together and
   ensure all parties understand the type of situation and its accompanying dynamics. All
   component leaders must understand and support the strategy once it is developed.
   5.9.3. OpsSC or IC as Negotiators. OpsSCs and ICs must not act as negotiators during a
   situation. They do not have the time to dedicate to negotiations. Their focus must remain on
   the operation in its totality and must not be diverted.
5.10. Use of Tactical Teams. The use of deadly force is the last option. When dealing with
―expressive‖ subjects, teams should keep a low profile to create a non-threatening environment
to assist in returning the subject to a normal functioning level. When dealing with
―instrumental‖ subjects, teams should make subjects aware of their presence in an effort to
promote agreement.
5.11. Negotiation Teams. Crisis negotiation is one of law enforcement‘s most effective tools
and constitutes a highly refined law enforcement discipline. The successful resolution of
countless hostages, barricaded subjects, attempted suicides, and kidnapping cases throughout the
world repeatedly has demonstrated the value of negotiating. These successful cases, as well as
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 37


those that resulted in the loss of fellow patrolmen and hostages, have shown the need for careful
deliberation in the selection and training of crisis negotiation team members. From a safety and
liability aspect, law enforcement authorities must understand how to select, organize, and train
crisis negotiation teams.
5.12. Selecting Team Members. Certain skills and expertise make more successful negotiators
and result in more peaceful resolutions in shorter time frames.
   5.12.1. Negotiation Team Leaders. Negotiation team leaders must be experienced,
   knowledgeable, and articulate supervisors or senior personnel. They should be well trained
   in the most current procedures for establishing and maintaining negotiations. They must
   understand how to devise a flexible negotiation strategy based on the incident and be capable
   of effectively articulating this strategy to the OpsSC and IC. In addition to overseeing actual
   negotiations, team leaders are responsible for training team members and recruiting new
   team members. Team leaders serve as principal advisors to the OpsSC.
   5.12.2. Negotiators. Negotiators should be volunteers and in excellent mental and physical
   health. The best criminal investigators tend to be the best crisis negotiators. They have had
   contact with a wide variety of people in diverse circumstances. Negotiators must have the
   time to participate in training and be available for call-outs regardless of other duties and
   responsibilities. Following are desirable personality traits for negotiators:
       5.12.2.1. Possess emotional maturity.
       5.12.2.2. Good listeners and possess excellent interviewing skills.
       5.12.2.3. A person who can easily establish credibility with others.
       5.12.2.4. Have the ability to use logical arguments to convince others that their
       viewpoint is rational and reasonable.
       5.12.2.5. Able to communicate with persons from all socioeconomic classes.
       5.12.2.6. Have practical intelligence, common sense, and are streetwise.
       5.12.2.7. Have the ability to cope with uncertainty and be willing to accept responsibility
       with no authority.
       5.12.2.8. Have total commitment to their job (negotiations).
       5.12.2.9. Understand they will have to assist in planning an assault to rescue hostages if
       negotiations are not going well and lives are in imminent danger.
   5.12.3. Negotiation Team Composition. A minimum of three negotiators is recommended
   for each incident. One team member acts as primary negotiator and engages the subject in
   dialogue. The second team member acts as a coach, or secondary negotiator, and assists the
   primary negotiator with choosing a specific dialogue and communication techniques. The
   third team member acts as team leader and assists in formulating the overall negotiation
   strategy, and interfaces with other response elements as they arrive. It is recommended that
   units have more than three negotiators available for incidents. If units are unable to source
   negotiators from within, it is recommended they establish an MOU/MOA with outside
   agencies.
 38                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   5.12.4. Negotiation Team Duties. Experience has revealed that a properly staffed
   negotiation team can more thoroughly assess an incident and generate better strategies.
   Teams must efficiently perform vital functions such as coaching the primary negotiator
   talking with the subject, maintaining situation boards, keeping a log, and communicating
   with the on-scene commander, command post and tactical team. The following serves to
   identify recommended positions, locations, and duties of a negotiation team during a
   significant or protracted event. This is only a guide and may be tailored to meet the needs of
   a specific situation. NOTE: Only trained and certified negotiators should occupy the
   positions of team leader, primary negotiator, and coach. Other positions may be filled with
   investigators, other law enforcement personnel, or support personnel.
       5.12.4.1. Negotiation Team Leader (Coordinator)
       5.12.4.2. Assistant Negotiation Team Leader
       5.12.4.3. Command Post Liaison
       5.12.4.4. Primary Negotiator
       5.12.4.5. Coach (Secondary Negotiator)
       5.12.4.6. Recorder
       5.12.4.7. Intelligence
       5.12.4.8. Behavioral Profiler
       5.12.4.9. Tactical Liaison
5.13. Training Negotiation Teams. Once a team is selected and assigned responsibilities, you
must determine the type of training team members need. Training should consist of basic skills
training, advanced and special skills training, team leader training, and regular team and
individual skills maintenance training. NOTE: The FBI conducts courses at many locations
throughout the United States at no cost to participating agencies. Training coordinators in FBI
field offices arrange these courses by request. In addition, the Federal Law Enforcement
Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, also offers training courses.
   5.13.1. Basic Skills Training. All negotiators should attend a 40-hour basic crisis
   negotiation course. The basic course should include extensive training in crisis intervention,
   suicide assessment and intervention, and knowledge of how to work the various positions on
   the team, and how to interact with tactical teams.
   5.13.2. Advanced and Special Skills Training. Experienced team members can use
   advanced and specialized training to build on basic crisis intervention techniques. This
   training should include handling manipulative subjects, reframing techniques to put a
   different spin on negative thoughts and perceptions of hostile subjects, and use of guided
   discovery-questioning techniques to augment basic problem solving techniques.
   5.13.3. Team Leader Training. Team leader training should include further training and
   practice in risk assessment, legal considerations, procedures for handling protracted
   incidents, effects of alcohol and other drugs, kidnap/extortion negotiations, role of the media,
   and use of third-party intermediaries and mental health professionals.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  39


   5.13.4. Regular Team and Individual Skills Maintenance Training. Negotiation team
   members should periodically conduct in-house refresher training of the items covered in
   basic skills, advanced and special skills, and team leader training that they have been
   formally trained on.
5.14. Resiliency. The TSR team will provide TSR services to enhance resilience to potentially
traumatic events. Following any negotiation, it is essential that all team members have access to
a TSR Team.
5.15. First Responder Negotiations. The first 15 to 45 minutes are the most dangerous time in
a crisis situation excluding a rescue attempt. Therefore, the most crucial moments of the
situation are in the hands of the first Security Forces member on-scene. Although the first
Security Forces member on-scene should not begin negotiations, it may be appropriate to initiate
contact with the subject in order to gain intelligence. Further, subjects may initiate an on-going
dialogue with the first Security Forces member on-scene on their own.
   5.15.1. Stabilize and Contain the Situation. In the first few minutes of a crisis situation, the
   subject‘s anxiety may overpower rational thought processes. The subject is now more likely
   to act on impulse or out of desperation. Your first action should be to ensure your own safety
   and approach the area cautiously. Then you should attempt to isolate, contain, and evaluate
   the situation, provide an initial report, and request assistance.
       5.15.1.1. Reduce Likelihood of Further Violence. Your next actions should be to reduce
       the likelihood of further violence. Begin to clear the area of innocent bystanders if you
       can do so safely without exposing yourself to other dangers. The best alternative is to
       evacuate the area along routes out of sight of the subject. This should be accomplished
       nonverbally with hand and arm signals if at all possible. If it is not possible to evacuate
       pedestrians out of sight of the subject, an alternative may be to tell the subject clearly
       what you want to do and get the subject to agree to allow the pedestrians to leave. Every
       effort should be made to evacuate pedestrians to a single location to assist in accounting
       for all pedestrians and have them available for witness interviews.
       5.15.1.2. Calm the Subject. The first few statements between you and the subject may
       set the tone for the next few hours. Start with giving the subject your name and let them
       know that you are a law enforcement officer. Reassure the subject that things are under
       control outside and that you don‘t want anyone including the subject to be injured.
       5.15.1.3. Avoid Eliciting Demands. Seemingly innocent questions may give the subject
       an opportunity to make demands on you. For example, a question such as, ―What‘s going
       on in there?‖ may result in an answer like, ―I have this clerk in here with a gun to her
       head and I‘ll shoot her if you‘re not gone in five minutes.‖ If you become engaged in an
       ongoing conversation with subjects, you should make every effort to avoid bargaining
       and making concessions. Your best option is to continue to calm and reassure the subject
       that no one is going to attempt to harm him/her and that you don‘t want the subject or any
       hostages harmed. If the subject should make demands, let the subject know that you
       can‘t make that decision but that law enforcement authorities who can assist the subject
       are on their way to the scene. If the two of you establish some sort of rapport, the
       negotiation team may have you continue to act as the primary negotiator with their
       support and guidance.

       5.15.1.4. Gather Information. Listening carefully to the subject may allow you to
       determine the sex, race, ethnic group, age range of the subject, or other pertinent
       information. Be prepared to pass any information to negotiators upon their arrival at the
       scene.
5.16. Guidelines. Once you have isolated and contained the situation as best you can, use the
following guidelines when dealing with subjects pending the arrival of the hostage negotiation
team.
   5.16.1. Keep a Log. The negotiation and tactical teams will be looking to you for
   information upon their arrival at the scene. Accordingly, keep a log of everything that
   transpires even if you have little or no contact with the subject. Record all communications
   with the subject along with your initial observations and impressions. Note exact words of
   the subject and your exact response if possible.
   5.16.2. Allow the Subject to Speak. Be a good listener and let the subject talk. Listening to
   the subject may provide some hint or indication of their willingness to surrender. Avoid
   dominating the conversation.
   5.16.3. Avoid Giving Orders.
   5.16.4. Play Down Past Events.
   5.16.5. Don‘t Offer the Subject Anything.
   5.16.6. Avoid Directing Attention to the Victims.
   5.16.7. Be as Honest as Possible. The majority of situations are resolved through straight-
   forward honest dialogue. The first task is to establish rapport and trust.
   5.16.8. If Unsure What‘s Intended, Ask. Don‘t try to interpret an unclear statement. Simply
   ask what is meant if unsure.
   5.16.9. Never Dismiss Any Request as Trivial.
   5.16.10. Never Say ―No.‖
   5.16.11. Soften Demands.
   5.16.12. Never Set Deadlines. Never set a deadline on yourself and try not to accept a
   deadline from a subject. Never tell a subject something will be done within a specific time.
   For example, ―I‘ll have you some coffee in 10 minutes.‖
   5.16.13. Don‘t Make Alternate Suggestions.
   5.16.14. Don‘t Introduce Outsiders. Never allow a non-law enforcement person (wife,
   minister, friend, etc.) to enter into an ongoing hostage situation unless the OpsSC and IC
   approve it.
   5.16.15. Don‘t Allow Exchanges. Do not allow any exchange of hostages, and especially
   don‘t exchange yourself for a hostage.
   5.16.16. Ask About Suicide. Ask subjects directly if they are considering suicide if you
   sense they may be considering it based on their comments. If a subject isn‘t considering
   suicide, you won‘t push them over the edge or put the idea in their head. If a subject is
   considering suicide, they may realize you can understand how they feel. This could be the
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   41


   first step in establishing rapport and trust eventually resulting in subjects abandoning
   weapons and surrendering.
   5.16.17. Never Negotiate Face-to-Face. Negotiating face-to-face is unnecessarily risking
   your own life. Further, if a subject threatens your life, other law enforcement officers may
   have to expose themselves in order to assist you. Finally, if the subject is considering
   suicide, they may use an assault on you to provoke other patrolmen into taking their life
   (suicide by cop).
   5.16.18. Plan Surrenders. The subject may decide to surrender prior to the arrival of the
   negotiation team and surrender plans are critical since you have an armed subject preparing
   to move from a barricaded position to your control. You must decide whether the hostages
   or the subject exit first and there are advantages and disadvantages to both. In any case, you
   should avoid taking a weapon directly from a subject. Instead, arrange for the subject to
   leave any weapons in a safe place prior to taking control of them.
5.17. Suicide Intervention. One of the most pressing considerations in dealing with a
barricaded subject, whether hostages are present or not, is the possibility the subject might
commit suicide. Unfortunately, many incidents conclude with the subject committing suicide
even when a successful resolution seems near. Negotiators or first responders may be called on
to attempt resolution of these situations, and suicide intervention can be more difficult than other
situations.
   5.17.1. Why Suicide. Subjects may choose suicide or exhibit suicidal behavior because of
   hostility toward others, traumatic life events, lack of social support, alcohol abuse,
   depression, or a feeling of hopelessness.
   5.17.2. Crisis State. A subject who is suicidal is in a state of crisis. An event has occurred
   and the subject‘s normal coping mechanisms have failed to resolve the situation. The subject
   is behaving at an intense emotional level rather than a rational level in response to the
   situation.
   5.17.3. Understanding Suicide. It is crucial that negotiators understand what suicide is, and
   are aware of myths and assumptions prior to attempting to resolve a suicidal situation.
   Negotiators should be familiar with AFI 44-154, Suicide and Violence Prevention Education
   and Training, and AFPAM 44-160, The Air Force Suicide Prevention Program.
   5.17.4. Suicide Methods. Suicidal subjects often have a detailed plan as to how they intend
   to commit suicide. Determining the subject‘s intended method may enable negotiators to
   disrupt the plan and prevent the suicide. Negotiators must remain alert to any indications of
   the subject‘s preferred method of suicide. In this regard, negotiators need to determine
   whether the subject possesses the means of suicide such as firearms, explosive devices,
   medications, or cutting instruments, or if they intend to be killed by engaging law
   enforcement with lethal force, forcing the patrolmen to use deadly force against them to kill
   them (suicide by cop).
       5.17.4.1. Negotiators and responding patrols should be aware that suicidal individuals
       may seek to destroy themselves because of depression, desperation, or a need to punish
       society for the wrongs they feel it has committed against them.
42                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     5.17.4.2. Subjects may not view death at their own hands as a socially acceptable method
     of death because of their individual social standards. Therefore, they may confront law
     enforcement authorities in a manner they know will require the use of deadly force. They
     believe this will allow society to perceive them as a victim of others instead of a victim of
     themselves.
     5.17.4.3. Although the following information is not all inclusive, the presence of one or
     more of these indicators may help identify a subject who is considering suicide by cop.
     Where a combination of these indicators are present, law enforcement authorities should
     consider them as evidence of a possible suicide by cop scenario especially if the subject
     confronts them in a manner that could bring about his own death.
         5.17.4.3.1. Subject has initiated a hostage or barricade situation and they refuse to
         negotiate with law enforcement authorities.
         5.17.4.3.2. Subject has just killed a significant other in their life, especially if the
         victim was a child or the subject‘s mother.
         5.17.4.3.3. Subject demands that law enforcement authorities kill them.
         5.17.4.3.4. Subject sets a deadline for law enforcement authorities to kill them.
         5.17.4.3.5. Subject has recently learned they have a life threatening illness or disease.
         5.17.4.3.6. Subject indicates an elaborate plan for their death, one that has taken both
         thought and preparation.
         5.17.4.3.7. Subject says they will only surrender in person to the officer in charge,
         e.g., the police chief or an officer with substantial rank and influence.
         5.17.4.3.8. Subject indicates they want to go out ―in a big way.‖
         5.17.4.3.9. Subject presents no demands that include escape or freedom.
         5.17.4.3.10. Subject provides law enforcement authorities with a verbal will.
         5.17.4.3.11. Subject appears to be looking for a manly or macho way to die.
         5.17.4.3.12. Subject has recently given away money or personal possessions.
         5.17.4.3.13. Subject has a criminal record indicating past assaults.
         5.17.4.3.14. Subject has recently experienced one or more traumatic events in their
         life that affects their family or career.
         5.17.4.3.15. Subject expresses feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.
  5.17.5. Negotiation Strategy. The purpose of intervention is to defuse intense emotions and
  return the subject to a normal functioning level. To accomplish this, negotiators must ask
  about suicide, buy time, establish rapport, communicate empathy, and gain information.
  Ultimately, your goal is to influence the subjects thinking in an attempt to return the subject
  to a normal functioning level where they will decide not to commit suicide. Negotiators
  should offer helpful suggestions and try to point out possible solutions to the subject‘s
  problems. However, negotiators should refrain from offering guaranteed solutions because
  these solutions have the potential to fail. Always try to help subjects face reality through
  discussions of the possible impact on the subject‘s family and friends.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 43


   5.17.6. Impact on Negotiators. The impact on negotiators of losing a suicidal subject can be
   severe. Negotiators consider the death of a hostage as being the direct responsibility of the
   subject, whereas, the loss of a suicidal subject may cause the negotiator to blame themselves.
   Negotiators often ask themselves what they did wrong or what else they could have said or
   done to prevent the subject from committing suicide. Supervisors should assess the
   negotiator to see if they need to seek attention from Mental Health.
5.18. Training. Units must incorporate first responder training as described in the Air Force
Emergency Response Operation Command and Control course into their annual training plans.
Units and flights need to coordinate training with the designated Incident Commander on the
installation, usually the Fire Department. In most crisis situations, subjects either verbalize or
otherwise demonstrate their concerns regarding possible armed intervention. First responder
training should concentrate on improving patrolmen‘s verbal and communication skills. The
way a first responder verbally conducts themselves has a significant bearing on their ability to
deal effectively and successfully with a wide variety of situations to include crisis situations.

                                           Chapter 6

                          EMERGENCY SERVICES TEAM (EST)

6.1. Concept. The basic premise of an EST is to have a tactical team of highly motivated and
well conditioned SF members that are specially trained and equipped to function in a high-risk
environment as a more effective and safer employment option than a larger group of SF without
the specialized training. The formation/establishment of an EST is optional; however, each AF
installation must have some type of emergency tactical response capability.
   6.1.1. MOA for Tactical Support. Installation Commanders may utilize civilian law
   enforcement support in lieu of establishing an EST, with supporting Crisis Negotiations
   Team (CNT), on their installation. This will be done through an MOA. A sample MOA can
   be found in Attachment 4 of this instruction. All MOAs will include the following
   information as conditions that must be agreed upon by both parties:
   6.1.1.1. Command and Control. The Installation Commander or DFC, if delegated, has
   tactical control (TACON) of the civilian agency team members when employed on the
   installation. The civilian agencies‘ leadership will maintain operational control (OPCON) of
   their team members and act as the liaison officer to the IC regarding tactical employment of
   his/her personnel. The Installation Commander will have final authority for any changes in
   tactical employment throughout the operation as well as when/if the EST/tactical team
   executes high risk operations.
       6.1.1.2. Authority/Jurisdiction.    Prior to establishing an MOA with local law
       enforcement agencies, consultation with the installation SJA is necessary to determine if
       the civilian agency can operate on the installation. Consultation is also required with the
       SJA when the installation is located outside of the US to determine, among other matters,
       if the agreement is considered an international agreement within the meaning of AFI 51-
       701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements.‖
       Additionally, the MOA must be routed through the appropriate channels (e.g. Wing
       Plans, Integrated Defense Council, Installation Antiterrorism Working Group, etc. as
       determined by the Installation Commander) before entering into the agreement.
       6.1.1.3. Certification. The local law enforcement agency must ensure their SRT or
       equivalent designated tactical team meets state certification and training standards prior
       to the DFC allowing employment on USAF installations. If there is no official state
       certification, the agency must meet the standards established by the National Tactical
       Officers Association (NTOA) in SWAT Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies, Sep
       2008, posted on their website: https://www.ntoa.org/massemail/swatstandards.pdf.
       There are separate standards for permanent tactical teams and part-time tactical teams.
       NOTE: NTOA standards are not a certification, rather a training standard the agency
       must meet.
       6.1.1.4. Training. MOAs with local law enforcement agencies must include guidance on
       their participation with mandatory recurring combined training on the installation.
       Training will take place with the local law enforcement agencies, the assigned SF unit,
       applicable FES personnel, and any certified ICs. At a minimum this training must occur
       semi-annually, not to exceed 180 days, with or without the participation of the local law
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 45


       enforcement agencies. Additionally, a combined exercise must be conducted annually
       IAW AFI-10-2501, and will not exceed 365 days. This exercise will include, SF
       personnel, FES personnel, certified IC personnel, and if possible the local law
       enforcement agencies with whom MOA‘s have been signed. Exercises will be evaluated
       by the Wing Exercise Evaluation Team (EET). A senior representative from the local
       law enforcement agency will be invited to be part of the evaluation team. Documentation
       of all training and exercises will be maintained by SFMQ and the EST Officer-in-Charge
       (OIC) or Noncommissioned Officer-in-charge (NCOIC). NOTE: If the Wing EET does
       not possess a SF expert, SFMQ personnel should augment in the evaluation of the
       exercise.
   6.1.2. The DFC is responsible for organizing, training and equipping the EST to meet
   mission objectives. A trained and certified IC will assume the role as the IC and the DFC or
   senior SF representative will assume the role of Operations Section Chief for EST
   employment operations.
6.2. Objective. The AF‘s primary objective in dealing with high-risk incidents is to prevent or
minimize the loss of life and resources by containment, negotiation and yielding to other federal
lead agencies. Consistent with the lead agency concept, during high-risk situation the USAF can
yield to the FBI or FAA, as required. When a designated lead agency assumes control of a high-
risk situation on an Air Force installation, the Installation Commander must be prepared to
provide EST support if requested, either by organic resources or through an MOA with another
civilian police agency.
   6.2.1. EST provides the Installation Commander with a viable option to restore good order
   and discipline during high-risk incidents. Effective employment of EST can result in
   achieving the desired incident outcome and mitigate potential losses due to hostile forces or
   other criminal adversaries. EST‘s primary goal is the preservation of life and keeping USAF
   assets and resources out of the control of criminal and terrorist ―elements‖.
6.3. Capability. Each installation must plan and exercise capabilities to respond to and resolve
a variety of high-risk incidents including, but not limited to: hostage incidents, sniper attacks,
DV protection support, aircraft hijacking, drug investigation/―buy-bust‖ apprehension support,
acts of terrorism and barricaded suspect incidents. The EST concept is designed to provide
support via pre-selected and highly trained personnel ready to respond as an effective team to
these high-risk incidents in the most effective way possible. Installation ESTs will alleviate
command and control problems that may be encountered when using local law enforcement
agencies as the high-risk incident response force. Establishing organic assets or an MOA
ensures USAF installations will not be unprepared to resolve high-risk incidents by relying on
the assumption the FBI or FAA will respond in a timely manner or be available to respond to a
given high-risk incident. EST concept success is predicated on the voluntary participation of
highly motivated, well trained and properly equipped personnel.
6.4. Organization. The number of personnel assigned to an EST is determined by: geographic
location of the installation, host wing mission, size of the SF unit, local criminal and terrorist
threat, wing FPCON requirements and other localized antiterrorism and force protection
requirements. Assigned primary and alternate personnel should equal the number necessary to
ensure 24-hour recall/response capability and will be determined by the DFC.
 46                                                   AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   6.4.1. Team composition should entail the following critical positions: OIC/NCOIC, Trainer,
   Entry Team, Apprehension/Extraction Team and Marksman/Observer Team. The minimum
   team requirement for building entry is eleven (11) personnel: six (6) to enter, four (4) to
   secure the inner perimeter and an OIC/NCOIC working with the Operations Section Chief to
   provide tactical advice. The DFC can augment minimum personnel requirements or establish
   additional requirements based on the installation‘s local criminal and terrorist threat
   environment.
   6.4.2. The EST is a police services activity that reports directly to the DFC. The DFC is
   responsible for team training, coordination and advising the IC on EST employment. The
   EST OIC/NCOIC is responsible for staffing, rehearsals/training and general leadership of the
   EST. Additionally, he/she is responsible for maintenance of recall rosters, equipment
   inventories, applicable quick reaction checklists and other documentation that may be
   beneficial during response operations.
6.5. Employment. Employ the EST as required to resolve high-risk or potentially violent
incidents. The DFC or designated representative should consider the following:
   6.5.1. Negotiations should be the first option for peaceful resolution of high-risk incidents.
   The IC or Operations Section Chief will direct employment of the EST to secure the incident
   in lieu of other alternatives (i.e. continued negotiation when it has proven ineffective), but the
   DFC is ultimately responsible for executing the operation and must maintain functional
   control of the EST.
   6.5.2. EST should not be staged in open areas in conjunction with non-violent civil
   disturbances, protest demonstrations and/or special events such as air shows and open house
   events. Crowd control should be conducted by other SF members. The EST should be
   staged well out of sight in a designated area during these events to respond if high-risk
   incidents evolve.
6.6. Weapons. If using a military EST team, their authorized EST weapons include the
carbine/rifle, handgun/pistol, grenade launcher and the shotgun. Unapproved modifications are
not authorized. Reference AFMAN 31-222, Use of Force Manual, for authorized nonlethal
weapons/munitions.
   6.6.1. EST members will carry a primary and secondary weapon. The pistol will normally
   be the secondary weapon, but is not limited to this role.
   6.6.1.1. The entry element should carry the carbine or rifle and be configured to
   accommodate employment of nonlethal munitions.
   6.6.2. EST designated marksman (DM)/observer teams should be armed with the rifle
   (currently authorized SF carbine or rifle, e.g. M-4 or M16A2) equipped with an Advanced
   Combat Optic Gunsight (ACOG) or an approved variable power scope. Individuals who
   have completed the Advanced Designated Marksman (ADM) AFQC or the Sharpshooter
   AFQC and whose qualification is current, may perform EST DM duties utilizing the
   currently authorized AF Sharpshooter or ADM rifle if available. Units will not be authorized
   these rifles for EST use alone. NOTE: Specific Sharpshooter, ADM and EST DM
   qualification training is required to employ personnel in these roles. Refer to AFI 36-2226,
   Combat Arms Program, for qualification training requirements. The EST DM will not
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              47


   normally be employed at target distances beyond 200 meters, with the optimal range in urban
   environments being 100 meters.
6.7. EST Training and Team Certification. National training standards required for
SWAT/EST personnel are published by the National Tactical Officer Association (NTOA).
These minimum standards must be completed successfully and documented on a localized AF
Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training prior to the individual being
certified as an EST member. Regular sustainment training IAW NTOA guidelines as a Fulltime
or Collateral team member must be successfully completed to maintain certification. Failure to
sustain training will result in decertification. Remedial training must be conducted before the
member may be employed in a tactical environment. Formal EST training must be obtained
through either the United States Army SRT Phase I course or another training course that meets
the national training standards IAW NTOA guidelines. Qualified marksman/observer team
personnel should complete the SRT Phase II course or the CPEC in addition to Phase I. The US
Army operates the SRT courses at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, as well as, offers a Mobile Training
Team capability. More information on SRT is available on the US Army Military Police School
web site at: http://www.wood.army.mil/usamps/. NOTE: SRT Phase II, CPEC and ADM
graduates meet requirements for marksman/observer teams as well. The CPEC and ADM are
taught at the SF Regional Training Center at Fort Bliss, TX.
   6.7.1. Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). EST TTPs are consistent with the
   consolidated DoD standards adopted by the US Army and the US Marine Corps military
   police for their SRTs, which provide a tactical police/force protection capability for each
   respective service. Technical guidance regarding EST TTPs is provided in Army Field
   Manual (FM) 3-19.11, Special Reaction Teams, and will be used by the Air Force as the
   tactical reference for EST employment for high risk situations. The minimum training
   standards must be completed by at least one EST member, preferably the NCOIC, who will
   then be certified to train the additional EST members. The ultimate goal, however, should be
   for each EST member to attend the SRT course or equivalent.
   6.7.2. Training. The goal in preparing teams is to provide a disciplined, professional
   response force rather than an unorganized operation assembled only when high risk situations
   occur. DFCs who establish an EST should seek initial training for all team members. The
   preferred course is the US Army SRT either in residence or through a Mobile Training Team
   (MTT). The two week SRT course (L5AZ3P071 0S2A, PDS Code 051) is held
   approximately every month, but has a maximum of 30 students per class and only a small
   percentage of those are allocated to the AF. SRT MTTs must be requested through the
   parent MAJCOM/A7S to the Headquarters, Department of the Army, G3 DAMO-ODO
   Provost Marshal. MTTs allow units to maintain team integrity and continuity and are much
   more cost effective than sending team members through the resident courses piecemeal.
   Every effort should be made to qualify EST members. Installation DFCs may seek initial
   and continuing training through the local law enforcement, FBI training programs, or private
   tactical schools as long as the basic standards in paragraph 6.1.1.3. are met.
       6.7.2.1. All training must be documented in the individual‘s Air Force Training Record
       (AFTR) Section III. A copy of the documentation of training will be maintained by EST
       OIC/NCOIC.
 48                                                   AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   6.7.3. Sustainment. Recurring training frequencies will be conducted IAW NTOA
   guidelines dependent upon member participation (i.e., Fulltime or Collateral). The DFC is
   responsible for team proficiency and sustainment training. The perishable nature of
   individual and collective skills necessary to perform effectively in the high risk environment
   requires allocation of optimum training time for EST members. Proficiency training must be
   continual and include realistic scenarios. ESTs must incorporate and utilize Standard
   Operating Procedures (SOP) battle drills and immediate action drills during training and
   rehearsal. Heavy emphasis must be placed on physical conditioning and teamwork drills to
   develop necessary skills and build individual and team confidence in stressful situations.
   Training sessions must be structured around a triad of 60% tactics, 20% marksmanship, and
   20% physical conditioning. Following an initial training program/course, each EST member
   must meet continuation training standards established per applicable local Operating
   Instructions (OIs). EST DM/observers must meet the qualification standards outlined in AFI
   36-2226 and AFMAN 36-2227, Volume 1, Combat Arms Training Programs, Individual
   Weapons. Units must develop local training programs for EST DM to augment qualification
   training and are encouraged to conduct more frequent live-fire sustainment training. Refer to
   AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions, Table 2.22, 2.37 and 2.38 for authorized
   EST, sharpshooter and designated marksman training munitions support requirements.
   6.7.4. Other Training Topics.
       6.7.4.1. Integration of crisis negotiations, Emergency Medical Service (EMS), Explosive
       Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and AFOSI/ Security Forces Investigations (S2I) capabilities
       to include management, analysis and support for EST operations/response.
       6.7.4.2. Designated marksman/observer observation and recording skills and command
       and control mechanisms.
       6.7.4.3. Performance oriented team leader/member skills.
       6.7.4.4. Advanced physical fitness to include approved defensive tactics per AFMAN
       31-222. At a minimum, all EST members must meet USAF fitness standards and
       establishing a higher physical standard for team members is recommended.
       6.7.4.5. Individual and small group training activities/exercises.
       6.7.4.6. Reading building schematics. This will assist in the familiarization of local
       systems used by CE and how to obtain a specific plan quickly.
       6.7.4.7. Training should be realistic and based on local threats and conditions. Practical
       training conducted to rehearse contingency plans will enhance EST effectiveness during
       actual high risk situations.
6.8. EST Relationship with CNT. EST members do not participate in or influence
negotiations. They should, however, pass on-scene information to the CNT regarding the
evolving situation regardless of type. In turn, the CNT can provide information to the EST. If
the EST is ordered to assault, the CNT may provide assistance by indirectly distracting the
subject through continued contact. EST team leaders should attempt to employ AFOSI and S2I
to gather additional information on criminal elements during contingency responses. Close
coordination with these organizations is essential to effective EST employment across the
spectrum of force protection contingencies. Information sharing between EST and CNT should
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                49


be managed through the BDOC. If possible, the principal negotiator should not know when the
assault order has been given. Inadvertent disclosure could jeopardize the operation.
6.9. MWD Team Use. Employment of the MWD is most effective when searching for a
possible subject/suspect(s) within a facility or concealed in an outdoor environment. If MWDs
are used, the team must also be included in regular EST training. Immediately follow any MWD
entry with EST entry to conduct a search and secure the area. The MWD handler will control
and direct the tactical movement of the MWD and the EST leader will control and direct the
tactical movement of the EST.
6.10. Emergency Medical Readiness. Planning for any high-risk situation or tactical mission
should include first-aid and buddy care. Ideally, the team should include a member(s) dedicated
and trained as emergency medical technicians (EMTs). EST members should train for medical
contingencies on a regular basis. If the EST doesn‘t have a dedicated EMT, training and exercise
scenarios should include EMS personnel, when possible. It is essential for installation
contingency planning to include careful coordination between installation EMS, CNT, FES,
EOD and SF to ensure participants understand the mission requirements of one another. This
will help clarify expectations of additional responding agencies.
6.11. Information. EST operations are dependent on the timely availability/delivery of reliable
information. Training and exercise scenarios should include the collection and use of operational
information. ESTs should seek assistance from S2I, AFOSI, and/or wing intelligence as needed
and authorized.
6.12. Interagency Cooperation. In addition to mandatory exercises and training events, ESTs
should meet and train with counterparts from other federal, state and local agencies (MOA with
FBI, FAA and local law enforcement) whenever possible. The shared experience of actual or
exercise response operations are mutually beneficial and may increase mission success.
6.13. Exercises. Rehearsing the EST in conjunction with supporting base agencies is essential.
This is best achieved through a robust base exercise and evaluation program.
   6.13.1. Joint agency exercises test command and control arrangements outlined in MOAs
   and operation plans. They also provide a means to assess the installation‘s ability to provide
   timely criminal intelligence, demonstrate team capabilities to the IC, build team confidence,
   and inter/intra-agency teamwork while affording the opportunity to refine EST TTPs.
   6.13.2. Scenarios should be consistent with the local threat and should include situations
   dealing with workplace violence, hostage incidents, barricaded subjects, terrorist attacks,
   hijackings, school violence and counter-sniper operations.
6.14. Reporting Requirements. Report all initial and updated information on Force
Protection/Suspicious Activity events to the Command Post. Command Post will ensure events
meeting OPREP-3 (Ref AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting) reporting channels are submitted as
required. The DFC will submit SF lessons learned reports within 60 days of an EST (or local
civilian SWAT) response through the AF Joint Lessons Learned Information System (AF JLLIS)
to the respective MAJCOM. The MAJCOM will in turn forward a copy of the report to HQ
AFSFC/SFOP within 90 days of the incident.

                                             Chapter 7

                                    CIVIL DISTURBANCES

7.1. Introduction. Civil disturbances present unique challenges to the armed forces. The roles
and missions of the armed forces inherently make the DoD a likely target for civil disturbances
both at home and abroad. The disturbances may range from peaceful demonstrations and rallies
outside a main gate to full scale riots that include burning and looting government property
inside the perimeter fence (see Attachment 5). The information, technology and weapon systems
entrusted to our care require absolute protection. The challenge arises in dealing with civil
disturbance situations. Attempting to understand, predict and control crowd behavior is a highly
technical field that requires specialized training. Complicating this challenge is the fact that
most of the specialized training is not common to any of our everyday missions and is extremely
perishable. Army Field Manual (FM) 19-15, Civil Disturbances, can provide the reader with
additional information on the topic.
7.2. Definition. Civil disturbances arise from acts of civil disobedience. These acts occur most
often when participants in mass acts of civil disobedience become antagonistic towards authority
and authorities must struggle to take the initiative from an unruly crowd. In the extreme, civil
disturbances include acts of criminal terrorism. Civil disturbances, in any form, are prejudicial
to public law and order. The installation commander is responsible for maintaining law and
order on the military installation. Installation commanders respond to disturbances using
installation resources. Violence and disorder by any individual or group of individuals will not
be tolerated. Installation commanders must be prepared to counter a disorder if preventative
measures fail. This preparation should consist of the following elements:
   7.2.1. Know the statutory and directive authority on which control actions rest.
   7.2.2. Maintain accurate operational information.
   7.2.3. Ensure all personnel assigned civil disturbance related tasks are adequately trained.
   7.2.4. Ensure personnel are properly equipped to handle civil disturbances.
   7.2.5. Develop plans that are flexible enough to ensure available manpower and equipment
   is used to the best advantage when violence occurs.
7.3. Federal Intervention and Aid. The US Constitution and US Code (USC) empower the
President to direct federal intervention in civil disturbances as listed below. However, other than
in extreme emergency situations, only the President or SECDEF may authorize federal troops to
intervene. The installation SJA should always be consulted before using forces in any of these
capacities.
   7.3.1. Respond to state requests for aid in restoring order.
   7.3.2. Enforce the laws of the United States.
   7.3.3. Protect the civil rights of citizens.
   7.3.4. Protect federal property and functions.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    51


7.4. Roles of the States. Under the Constitution, each state is responsible for protecting life and
property within its boundaries. State and local governments use their civil forces to maintain law
and order and quell civil disturbances.
7.5. Presidential Powers. The Constitution and federal statutes authorize the President to direct
the use of armed federal troops within the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and US
possessions and territories and their political subdivisions. The President also has the power to
federalize the National Guard of any state to suppress rebellion and enforce laws.
   7.5.1. Law. The President can also employ federal troops to ensure the execution of US law
   when a state opposes or obstructs US law or impedes the course of justice under those laws.
   The President can employ armed federal troops to suppress insurrection, domestic violence,
   unlawful assemblies and conspiracy. The key is, if such acts deprive the people of their
   constitutional rights or privileges and a state‘s civil authorities cannot or will not provide
   adequate protection, then employment of federal troops is authorized.
   7.5.2. Property. The President may also choose to use armed federal troops to protect
   federal property and functions when the need for protection exists and local civil authorities
   cannot or will not give adequate protection. The US has a right to protect all federal property
   and functions regardless of their location.
   7.5.3. Limits. While federal law authorizes domestic use of military force to suppress
   violence or insurrection, the Constitution and federal law provide certain restrictions. Under
   the Posse Comitatus Act neither active nor reserve personnel (USC, Title 10) may execute
   the law in place of duly appointed law enforcement officials without specific presidential or
   congressional approval and direction. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the
   National Guard (USC, Title 32) until those personnel have been federalized.
7.6. Causes. Civil disturbances may arise from a number of causes. Most often they arise from
political grievances, social unrest, terrorist acts or foreign influences. A single cause may trigger
the event or it may arise from a combination of causes.
   7.6.1. Political Grievances. Demonstrations of political grievances range from simple
   protests on specific issues to full-scale civil disobedience. Many forms of political protest,
   while disruptive, are not unlawful. These protests may be spontaneous, but most often are
   planned events. Often political protesters coordinate with local authorities. Most protesters
   are law-abiding citizens and intend for their protests to be nonviolent. Violence occurs
   mainly when control forces must try to contain a protest or arrest protesters involved in civil
   disobedience. The presence of agitators increases the chance of violence. Agitators want to
   provoke the control force into overreacting, which will embarrass the authorities. Violence
   and overreaction by the control force can also gain media and public sympathy for the
   protesters.
   7.6.2. Social Unrest. Urban conflicts and community unrest arise from highly emotional
   socio-economic issues. Economically deprived inner-city residents may perceive themselves
   as being treated unjustly or ignored by the people in power. When tension is high, it takes
   only a minor incident or a rumor of an injustice to ignite a civil disturbance. This is
   particularly true if community relations with the local police are part of the problem.
   7.6.3. Terrorist Acts/Foreign Influences. Many disaffected groups seek to embarrass the
   government. Disturbances may be a cover for terrorism. Often an overriding goal is to cause
 52                                                 AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   an overreaction by authorities with the intent to gain sympathy from the general population.
   Foreign nations may employ surrogates. These surrogates create activities that promote the
   sponsor-state‘s interests. Agents of the foreign nations may be part of the disturbances and
   can be in key leadership positions. If the agents can get the targeted government to
   overreact, then the repression serves to further expand support for the foreign influence.
7.7. Locations. Civil disturbances usually occur at places symbolic of a grievance, near the
cause of the grievance or close at hand to an aggrieved crowd. Examples of such places are
nuclear weapons facilities or power plants, in urban areas, at refugee camps or at government
facilities. Nuclear weapons facilities and power plants are subject to demonstrations by anti-
nuclear activists. These activists demonstrate at places they know or believe develop, build,
transport or store nuclear weapons, weapons-grade (nuclear) material or their components.
   7.7.1. Government Facilities. US government facilities such as recruiting offices, federally
   leased buildings, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) buildings and federal courthouses
   can also be the targets of demonstrations. A group may target a government facility simply
   because they attach a symbolic value to it or perceive a connection between it and the policy
   they are protesting. This is especially true of anti-war and anti-nuclear protest groups. They
   may choose a facility because they see it as the source of their grievance. Likewise, they
   may target a facility because people working there are seen as having the power to address
   the group‘s grievance.
   7.7.2. Refugee Camps. Refugee and resettlement camps can become the focus of a civil
   disturbance. Large numbers of refugees attempting to enter the US in mass are often placed
   temporarily in refugee camps until they can be resettled. These camps can either be in the
   US, a US-controlled area like Guantanamo Bay or in friendly allied nations. Regardless of
   the location, resettlement can be a slow and difficult process. The boredom, frustration and
   uncertainty refugees experience in these camps can create tensions that may erupt into
   violence. Agitators may infiltrate refugee camps to exploit these tensions in ways to
   embarrass and/or force the US into action.
   7.7.3. Other Demonstration Sites. Demonstrations at US government facilities are not
   limited to those in the US. US facilities in foreign nations can be locations of civil
   disturbances. DoD installations, US embassies and US consulates in foreign nations are
   favorite targets of demonstrators. DoD installations in foreign nations are often scenes of
   protest against US foreign policy. The actual installation and its mission may or may not be
   the true target. Often the installation is just a highly visible symbol of the US government.
7.8. Role of Military Forces. The preservation of law and order in the civilian community is
the responsibility of state and local governments and law enforcement authorities. The
preservation of law and order on the federal property of a military installation is the
responsibility of the installation commander and military law enforcement authorities.
   7.8.1. Scope. Within the Air Force, the Security Forces act as the primary control force for
   civil disturbances that occur on Air Force installations. Under certain circumstances,
   Security Forces personnel may also act as the control force for civil disturbances that occur
   in the local community, if called upon by competent authority. Additionally, Security Forces
   may act as the control forces for any migrant or refugee operations when directed by
   command authorities. Requests for military support to civilian law enforcement officials in
   connection with civil disturbances will be addressed in accordance with AFI 10-802, Military
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 53


   Support to Civil Authorities, Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 3025.12, Military
   Assistance for Civil Disturbances, and DoDD 3025.18 Defense Support of Civil Authorities.
   7.8.2. Responsibilities. Regardless of the nature of the disturbance, Security Forces
   personnel must display fair and impartial treatment during all contacts with the civilian
   population and any other participants in any civil disturbance. In all cases, personnel must
   adhere to the principle of minimum force as outlined in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel. Whenever possible, have civilian police apprehend, process,
   and detain civil law violators. Security forces perform these functions only when necessary
   and only to the minimum extent required. Return these functions to civil authorities as soon
   as possible. As the disturbance subsides, the commander should take steps to restore control
   to civil authorities. The control force gradually reduces the number and scope of its
   operations and should begin removing equipment from the area. Caution is required. Past
   experience has shown that rapid and complete withdrawal of military forces creates a
   dangerous vacuum. The vacuum often causes the disturbance to flare up since protesters
   believe civil authorities cannot maintain control. The security forces goal should be a phased
   return of control to civil authorities.
7.9. Levels of Disturbances. In most cases, crowd behavior escalates through many stages
before violence erupts. When personnel can recognize key aspects of each stage, they have the
best chance to control or disperse the crowd before it gets violent. The most recognizable stages
are listed below with essential components of each stage identified.
   7.9.1. Periods of Increased Tension. There are many indications that a base or community is
   in a period of increased tension as far as human relations are concerned. Identifiers marking
   this phase may appear as increased polarization in living, dining and work areas. Graffiti on
   walls or overheard conversations may indicate periods of increased tension. The biggest
   mistake at this stage is an overreaction to these situations by civil or military authorities.
   Block watch or community meetings are solid avenues to reduce tensions, air grievances and
   establish understanding.
   7.9.2. Scattered Minor Incidents of Violence. This phase may include incidents of
   harassment between individual members of opposing groups. Increase first-line supervision
   and community policing in high-incident areas to avoid escalation.
   7.9.3. Group-Oriented Violence. Roaming, unorganized groups bent on either destruction of
   property or assaults on people begin to show up with greater frequency and in larger groups.
   Leaders of these groups intentionally defy orders and authority. This is the first level of
   actual disturbance requiring direct police action. Riot control forces should assemble early in
   this phase, deploy to the scene and employ necessary measures (including force) to maintain
   order. Attempt to isolate and/or apprehend leaders and agitators. Use command action to
   stabilize the situation without force, if possible.
   7.9.4. Full Riot Phase. Riots include widespread destruction of property, total defiance of
   authority, open mob action and serious breaches of the peace. This level could result in
   serious injury or death to innocent persons. At this time, a full civil disturbance operation
   should already be in force and the mission becomes one of mob dispersal and restoration of
   order as rapidly as possible. It is best to apprehend individuals after the mob is broken into
   small groups.
 54                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   7.9.5. Summary. These levels of confrontation do not necessarily occur in order. Any phase
   could occur at any time and more than one phase could occur at the same time at different
   locations on the base or in the local community. A peaceful, orderly demonstration outside
   one gate could occur while others demonstrating for the same cause could be uncooperative
   and violating the law at a different gate.
7.10. The Participants
   7.10.1. The Environment. A civil disturbance occurs only in a particular environment--that
   environment is a fusing of cause, place and willing confrontational participants. Civil
   disturbance participants come from all backgrounds. Participants cover the broad spectrum
   from the far right to the far left. Participants may be members of special interest groups,
   disgruntled or unemployed persons. They may be environmentalists, anti-nuclear agitators,
   anti-abortion activists or foreign and domestic opponents of US policy. They come from all
   age groups and from all socioeconomic classes. Civil disturbance participants may be
   curious onlookers who have become swept away by the excitement of an event or
   demonstrators or counter demonstrators who have become emotional about their cause.
   Whoever they are, they have become subject to the social and psychological factors that can
   turn a large gathering of people into a disruptive, disorderly mob. Understanding these
   factors can help reduce disturbances and permit restoration of order with a minimum of
   force.
   7.10.2. The Human Factor. The basic human element sparking a disturbance is the presence
   of a crowd. There are almost as many types of crowds as there are reasons for people to
   assemble. There are casual crowds like those that assemble for a football game or gathers at
   an accident. Persons in such a crowd probably have no common bonds other than the
   enjoyment of the game or curiosity about the accident. There are ―planned‖ crowds that
   assemble at the call of a leader to accomplish a goal. Members of a planned crowd have
   common bonds of interest and purpose.
   7.10.3. Impact of Social Factors on a Crowd. The presence or absence of social factors like
   leadership, moral beliefs and social uniformity affect crowd behavior. Psychological factors
   also impact crowd behaviors. Typically a crowd only does those things that the majority of
   its members want to do. However, the emotional stimulus and protection of being in a crowd
   (anonymity) can lead to a violent synergy that individuals typically avoid. This dynamic,
   coupled with the fact that a crowd is open to manipulation, is what makes a crowd
   particularly volatile and a threat to public order.
      7.10.3.1. Leadership. Crowd situations are ripe with confusion and uncertainty.
      Members seek direction. The first person to give orders in an authoritative manner is
      likely to be followed. A skillful manipulator can channel the energy of a crowd toward
      violence or calmness. In riot situations, target the group leadership at the early stages for
      apprehension. Leaderless crowds are much easier to disperse.
   7.10.4. Emotional Contagion. Emotional contagion, a high state of excitement, provides the
   crowd psychological unity. Although temporary, this unity or contagion may be the only
   momentum a crowd needs to turn to mob action. Mob behavior is highly emotional, often
   unreasonable and always potentially violent.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   55


   7.10.5. Panic. Panic prompts unreasoning and frantic efforts in seeking safety. It is
   extremely contagious, spreads rapidly and endangers everyone in the area of the panicked
   crowd. Common panic scenarios include perceptions like:
       7.10.5.1. Danger is so close at hand that the only action is to flee.
       7.10.5.2. Escape routes are limited, blocked or have just been opened. Very often this
       form of panic causes people to stampede. The onslaught of a fleeing human mass may
       result in people being crushed, smothered or trampled.
       7.10.5.3. Riot control agents have been used; crowd members cannot disperse quickly
       and therefore believe their lives are at risk.
   7.10.6. These scenarios point to a critical concept in crowd control operations: Unless the
   mission is to contain and capture, always provide a number of open, easily identifiable
   escape routes that a crowd may access at any time.
7.11. Control Force Social Factors.
   7.11.1. It is critical to remember that control force members are also susceptible to crowd
   behaviors--particularly panic. Do not allow control force members to develop a feeling of
   anonymity. Helpful measures include:
       7.11.1.1. Leadership elements must know their people‘s names and use them at every
       opportunity.
       7.11.1.2. Personnel with questionable emotional stability or strong prejudices
       (particularly against the crowd being controlled) should not participate in operations.
       7.11.1.3. Do not dehumanize or depersonalize the crowd. It is easier to harm or fight an
       idea than a person. Fair and impartial performance of control force duties is imperative.
       7.11.1.4. Maintain a gender, ethnic and racial balance to offset the perception of a
       disturbance being an ―us‖ versus ―them‖ situation. Mob leaders often count on sympathy
       generated from the appearance of an overwhelming military force ―attacking‖ old people,
       women and children.
   7.11.2. Rigorous training, effective supervision and immediate corrective action of control
   force members are an absolute requirement during civil disturbance operations. The
   fundamental fact is all members of a control force are accountable for all of their actions.
7.12. Crowd Tactics. In civil disturbance situations, crowd tactics run the full spectrum.
Typically, the more organized a demonstration is, the more likely personnel will confront well-
planned tactics. Keep in mind the underlying purpose for most tactics is to make the authorities,
including the control force, look bad. The perception of a heavy-handed response may add
support to the protest, escalate demonstrator acts (more violence) or serve to justify (in the minds
of the crowd) outright acts of terrorism. This is why each and every member of the control force
must maintain a calm, professional demeanor--regardless of the tactics.
   7.12.1. Nonviolent Tactics.
       7.12.1.1. Nonviolent tactics may range from name-calling to building barricades.
       Demonstrators may converse with the control force members to distract, dissuade or gain
56                                                   AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     their sympathy. Do not respond to verbal barrages. ―Civil disobedience‖ is the most
     common nonviolent tactic. Examples include:
         7.12.1.1.1. Trespassing--requiring control force apprehensions. Dissidents often
         view being apprehended as a ―victory‖ and stage tactics to force mass apprehensions
         in an attempt to saturate the support functions behind control force units.
         7.12.1.1.2. Passive resistance--blocking entrances, driveways, and offices--and then
         going limp, thus requiring control force members to carry protesters away.
         7.12.1.1.3. Chaining, handcuffing or tying themselves together and/or to an object
         associated with the authorities (e.g. an aircraft, door, fence, or building).
     7.12.1.2. Sometimes women, children and the elderly are placed in the front ranks.
     Consider this real-world example: Mob planners prearranged media coverage. Their
     plan was to use only female demonstrators in acts of civil disobedience. An astute
     installation commander deployed only female Security Forces and augmentees in blues,
     with no weapons or utility belts. The Security Forces women effectively worked in pairs
     to carry away the passive female demonstrators who had staged a sit-in across the main
     gate thoroughfare. The image of Battle Dress Uniform-riot-clad Security Forces males
     removing these protesters never materialized. Result: The media blitz turned against the
     protesters--commending the restraint and professionalism displayed by the United States
     Air Force! Again, adapt a firm but impartial demeanor when and if personnel must
     apprehend protesters.
     7.12.1.3. Another common tactic (mentioned above) is to attempt to overwhelm the
     system by staging groups for mass apprehensions. Consider how best to process
     violators:
         7.12.1.3.1. In mass, all receive the same process.
         7.12.1.3.2. Selectively--process and turn over to civil authorities the leaders, agitators
         and repeat offenders while all others receive a debarment/expulsion letter.
         7.12.1.3.3. Hold, identify and turn over to civil authorities.
         7.12.1.3.4. The processing procedures will vary depending on each situation.
         Preplanning for this phase of the contingency among civil authorities, the installation
         commander, judge advocate and Security Forces is critical.
  7.12.2. Violent Tactics.
     7.12.2.1. A violent mob is potentially one of the most dangerous threats Security Forces
     will ever face. Violent mobs are notorious for firebombing, brick throwing and breaking
     into and entering secured facilities. Here are some less known, but just as deadly, tactics
     and weapons:
         7.12.2.1.1. Balloons filled with paint to use as ―bombs‖ on aircraft, buildings or
         control force members.
         7.12.2.1.2. Bolt cutters to cut through fences.
         7.12.2.1.3. Clubs disguised to look like protest signs.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  57


           7.12.2.1.4. Lead pipes wrapped in newspaper to use as clubs or be thrown as deadly
           missiles.
           7.12.2.1.5. Firecrackers dipped in glue and covered with BBs or small nails to use as
           miniature shrapnel grenades.
           7.12.2.1.6. Plywood shields and motorcycle helmets to protect against riot batons.
           7.12.2.1.7. Goggles to protect against smoke and gas.
           7.12.2.1.8. Ropes, chains, and grappling hooks to pull down fences. Mattresses,
           furniture pads or heavy blankets to lie on top of barbed wire during breaching
           (trespass) movements.
           7.12.2.1.9. Firearms, explosives and vehicle assaults (using vehicles to crash a gate,
           etc.) are the most extreme forms of crowd violence.
       7.12.2.2. Control force members disrupt a mob‘s desired activity which makes the
       control force the mob‘s most immediate target and threat. Controlled, measured
       responses will ultimately subdue any crowd. Control force members who get out of hand
       will only fuel and potentially escalate violence.
7.13. Civil Disturbance Training. Crowd control situations, particularly those with a potential
for violence, are best handled by a combination of planning and training. It is too late to train
once a crisis begins. As discussed earlier, given the out-of-mission role, coupled with the
specialization required for civil disturbance operations, just-in-time (JIT) training may be the
most effective and efficient course of action, if time allows. Lessons learned from several civil
disturbance operations praised this training methodology. Solid training, both JIT and annual
sustainment, remains the best avenue to prepare security forces for any contingency. Accurate
information is the basis for appropriate training. Unit-level trainers should utilize the
Confrontation Management curriculum located in the eTTPG Library located on the Air Force
Security Forces Center website. The library is at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil, on the left
column, click ‗eTTPGs‘.
   7.13.1. Generic Unit Training. Because we cannot train for every specific civil disturbance,
   Security Forces should conduct some generic training which can cover different situations.
   Critical to any security forces operation is fitness for duty consideration. DFCs must
   accurately plan, organize and equip personnel who will deploy, whether to the front gate or
   around the world. Two absolutes, regardless of the mission, are:
       7.13.1.1. Appropriate selection and training for deployment teams are critical to proper
       mission preparation.
       7.13.1.2. Tailoring of the deployed UTCs logistics detail for the specific deployment to
       ensure the proper equipment is taken to complete the mission. In the near future,
       capability kits will be completed and propositioned at various locations to assist with
       these types of deployments.
   7.13.2. Domestic Civil Disturbance Training.
       7.13.2.1. Selection of the control force should draw on the unit‘s most stable personnel.
       Training should always emphasize tactics designed to present a disciplined show of force.
       Design training to examine the degrees of force to use and priority of each. Every control
58                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


     force member must realize they are responsible for their actions while performing civil
     disturbance duties. Following the guidelines that established in AFI 31-207, Arming and
     Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, is critical to the outcome of any situation. Much of
     the training conducted for Security Forces has direct application in the realm of civil
     disturbance operations. Continually teaching and evaluating these topics should provide
     positive benefits when, and if, Security Forces employ troops in civil disturbance
     missions:
         7.13.2.1.1. Arming and use of force.
         7.13.2.1.2. Unarmed self-defense.
         7.13.2.1.3. Use of riot control agents and munitions.
         7.13.2.1.4. Human relations and stress management.
         7.13.2.1.5. Dealing with panic.
         7.13.2.1.6. Weapons retention for the M-9, M-4 and M-870.
     7.13.2.2. Specialized civil disturbance topics ideal for JIT training include:
         7.13.2.2.1. Civil disturbance mission orientation and intelligence briefing.
         7.13.2.2.2. Crowd control tactics.
         7.13.2.2.3. Formations and movements.
         7.13.2.2.4. Use of the baton and other nonlethal weapons.
         7.13.2.2.5. (Rapid) Flexi-cuffing.
         7.13.2.2.6. The military working dog (MWD) in a civil disturbance environment.
         7.13.2.2.7. Transporting large numbers of apprehended personnel.
         7.13.2.2.8. Processing large numbers of apprehended personnel. NOTE: The above
         list is not all-inclusive; therefore, commanders must adapt training to the local
         environment.
  7.13.3. Foreign Civil Disturbance Training. Clearly, a foreign civil disturbance mission
  requires more specialized JIT training in addition to the above-listed topics. Often an in-
  place country team will conduct this training. These missions require an especially stable,
  properly selected control force. Experience shows tours beyond 120 days induce
  considerable stress--even for the best prepared. Third world nations rife with poverty,
  disease and different customs add to an already stressful environment. Again, training
  should always emphasize a disciplined show of force, subject to the government,
  organization or individual in charge (e.g., UN, US State Department, US ambassador).
  Additional JIT training topics include:
     7.13.3.1. Intelligence briefing.
     7.13.3.2. SJA briefing.
         7.13.3.2.1. Cultural orientation--we need to overcome cultural barriers by learning
         about the nation/ culture we‘re deployed to and make efforts to share our culture with
         them. Often, simple things are overlooked.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   59


           7.13.3.2.2. Morale strategies for US personnel and dissidents (particularly useful in
           migrant, internment and relocation camps).
           7.13.3.2.3. . Rumor control plan--for BOTH the control force and dissidents.
           7.13.3.2.4. . Control forces escape, evasion, recovery and reconstitution plans--
           should mob violence get out of hand or become life threatening to the control force.
7.14. Information Needs. Regardless of the home station or deployment location, accurate and
timely information is the key to developing effective civil disturbance training plans. Process
raw data and feed it up the chain of command. Analyze information and flow it back down the
chain to those who need it the most--control force members. The information focus must assess
the social, economic and political climate of the area and determine the likelihood of active
participation or support from the local populace. Federal law has strict limitations on the armed
forces collecting, storing or disseminating personal data on US citizens. The control force
commander should coordinate with civil and military attorneys throughout any operation.
7.15. Threat Analysis. Threat information is the most vital information force planners have
when determining appropriate countermeasures. Threat information constantly changes and
must be reviewed on a consistent basis. Procedures need to be established for gathering,
analyzing, and disseminating this information in a timely fashion, both up and down the chain of
command, this will help determine the appropriate countermeasures and guard against
overreaction. Three kinds of information produce a threat analysis:
   7.15.1. Intelligence and criminal. Provide information on the goals, methods of operation,
   techniques, strategies, tactics and targets of individuals or groups.
   7.15.2. Threat. This information identifies and defines individuals and groups.
   7.15.3. Vulnerability. This information focuses on security weaknesses and high-risk targets
   (e.g. military installations, utility plants, dams or dike works). To assess the vulnerability of
   the installation, consider:
       7.15.3.1. Installation and surrounding community characteristics that would make an
       attractive target for terrorists or civil disturbance (e.g., nuclear mission, research and
       development facilities, antiterrorism units, unique training missions).
       7.15.3.2. Status of training. Readiness can be a powerful deterrent.
       7.15.3.3. Communications availability/vulnerability.
       7.15.3.4. Nonmilitary law enforcement resources.
       7.15.3.5. Time and distance from other US military installations that could provide
       support.
       7.15.3.6. Time and distance from urban areas. Large urban areas offer choice targets;
       ease of infiltration, concealment and escape; and large concentrations of ethnic
       populations that may be sympathetic to a particular cause.
       7.15.3.7. Geographic region and proximity to foreign borders.
       7.15.3.8. Access to the installation or community--power grids, fuel depots and
       pipelines.
 60                                                  AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


      7.15.3.9. Population density of the installation or community.
      7.15.3.10. Terrain.
      7.15.3.11. Weather.
7.16. Operations
   7.16.1. Restore Order. Security Forces must isolate any civil disturbance threatening
   military order and prevent the disturbance from spreading. Security Forces protect people,
   facilities and services. Mob demonstrators usually view control force members as defenders
   of the ―status quo‖ and thereby consider them targets. Above all, the control force mission is
   to provide disciplined restraint to maintain law and order. The nature of control force
   operations can vary greatly. Adopt operational strategies from AFH 31-305, Security Police
   Deployment Planning Handbook. Use this manual to prepare specific mission plans.
   7.16.2. Isolate the Disturbance.
      7.16.2.1. The initial control task is to isolate the crowd and seal off the disturbance area.
      Once isolated, time becomes the commander‘s ally. To achieve this end, initiate
      measures to:
          7.16.2.1.1. Prevent disorder from spreading to unaffected areas.
          7.16.2.1.2. Move uninvolved people from the area immediately.
          7.16.2.1.3. Prevent unauthorized people from entering the disturbance area.
          7.16.2.1.4. Apprehend disturbance leaders/agitators.
      7.16.2.2. Once the four control measures above are in place, allow the crowd to disperse
      peacefully. Isolate the affected area much the same as we do restricted areas: use signs,
      barriers and mobile patrols. Apprehend individuals in the mob who refuse to leave
      immediately and remove them from the area so they cannot reorganize or rekindle the
      crowd into an unruly mob.
   7.16.3. Protect Targets. In most civil disturbance missions, Security Forces will be assigned
   to protect ―targets‖ from the crowd. Targets include people and facilities. Adapt procedures
   from AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense and DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V1, Nuclear
   Weapon Security Manual: The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, to fulfill this
   aspect of the mission.
   7.16.4. Crowd Control.
      7.16.4.1. The control force uses carefully selected tactics and wisely committed
      resources to exert control over disorderly crowds. Installation/operation commanders
      have four basic options available to them. Their order can be to monitor, disperse,
      contain or block the crowd. Implement these options alone or in combination. Variables
      that might influence the tactic(s) applied include:
          7.16.4.1.1. Severity of the disturbance.
          7.16.4.1.2. Public opinion.
          7.16.4.1.3. Current policies.
          7.16.4.1.4. Crowd demographics (mood, intent, composition and activity).
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                61


        7.16.4.1.5. Capabilities and preparedness of control forces.
        7.16.4.1.6. Immediate and long-term benefits of control force action.
        7.16.4.1.7. Weather, terrain and time of day.
     7.16.4.2. Monitor.
        7.16.4.2.1. Monitoring does not antagonize peaceful gatherings and is appropriate
        when more decisive action is inappropriate. Monitoring is particularly useful in large,
        non-violent demonstrations. This is also an ideal stage to meet demonstration leaders,
        determine their intent and gain their cooperation. Contact with the leadership may be
        the only control measure needed, persuading leaders to police (literally) their own
        gathering. Planned demonstrations usually require coordination of the following
        options:
            7.16.4.2.1.1. Formal issuance of permits to march or demonstrate.
            7.16.4.2.1.2. Planned   starting   point,   route   and    rally point(s)   for   the
            demonstration.
            7.16.4.2.1.3. Time schedule.
            7.16.4.2.1.4. The need to marshal/escort the demonstration and which
            organization will provide personnel to serve as marshals.
            7.16.4.2.1.5. Violence, litter and property damage prevention.
            7.16.4.2.1.6. Personnel safety.
        7.16.4.2.2. Assigning a member of the control force to photograph faces of crowd
        members is an extremely effective part of monitoring. When individuals in crowds
        realize they are being photographed, Security Forces neutralize the anonymity that
        adds to their brazenness. Crowd members need to see the photographer. The
        photographer needs to be in uniform. There should be no doubt in anyone‘s mind that
        individuals in the crowd are being photographed (still or video) by the control force.
        Ensure the safety of the photographer. Should the mob turn violent, photographic
        evidence can be remarkably beneficial.
     7.16.4.3. Disperse.
        7.16.4.3.1. The control force may disperse the crowd. Key to any dispersal operation
        is control and orderliness. An uncontrolled, fragmented crowd may actually spread
        violence and damage. Clearly inform the crowd of the requirement to disperse. Detail
        authorized egress routes. Maintain (likely) target countermeasures. Apprehend any
        small groups that resist or loiter in the area after dispersal. A hierarchy of dispersal
        options includes:
            7.16.4.3.1.1. Violent, destructive confrontations. Format: Top (first resort) to
            bottom (last resort):
                7.16.4.3.1.1.1. Monitor, release/read a proclamation ―this may display a show
                of force.‖
                7.16.4.3.1.1.2. Increase four-person and MWD patrols.
62                                                    AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011


                 7.16.4.3.1.1.3. Employ crowd control formations.
                 7.16.4.3.1.1.4. Implement riot tactics.
                 7.16.4.3.1.1.5. Employ water cannon.
                 7.16.4.3.1.1.6. Employ chemical agents.
                 7.16.4.3.1.1.7. Employ lethal force.
         7.16.4.3.2. Peaceful demonstrations. Adapt this hierarchy to specific situations.
     7.16.4.4. Contain. Containment is a suitable option for keeping disorder from spreading
     and when the commander directs apprehensions. Vehicles, which are under the control
     of the on-scene commander, may be an excellent force multiplier. Used jointly with
     dismounted troops, the 33-ton crash (fire) trucks are a ready resource (known to be
     resoundingly successful) and have a tremendous psychological impact on mobs. Lights,
     sirens and public address systems on law enforcement vehicles—used judiciously--can
     aid containment efforts. When using vehicles in a containment operation, establishment
     of a mobile command post is recommended.
     7.16.5. Block. Blocking may be necessary to protect specific targets in the path of an
     advancing crowd (e.g., keeping an unruly mob off the flight line to protect aircraft).
     Control force members on line or in vehicles are common barricades. Depending on the
     severity of the violence or threat, erect concertina wire, earthen-filled barrels or jersey
     barriers to counter higher level threats like speeding vehicles or mass breaches.
  7.16.6. Serious Threats. Control forces may encounter high-level threats that pose grave
  danger to all persons in the area. These threats include hostage/barricade situations, snipers,
  bomb threats and fires. Immediate-action responses must be in place so control forces can
  minimize the tragedy caused by these events. Air Force security forces shall adapt the
  guidance from AFI 31-101 and DoD S-5210.41-M to effectively deal with serious threats.
  Fires offer unique challenges beyond the capabilities of most military control forces. The
  specialization required of firefighters precludes control forces from direct engagement.
  Control force members can help by remaining vigilant to the threat and reporting fires
  immediately. At a fire scene, military control force members may:
     7.16.6.1. Establish a protective cordon around the firefighters' area of operations. The
     cordon should provide security for firefighters (sniper suppression) as well as hydrant and
     hose security.
     7.16.6.2. Maintain observation posts (i.e. tall buildings) to prevent sniping, watch for
     other fires and coordinate the approach of responding units. Ensure Security Forces
     thoroughly coordinate posting control force members on top of buildings to preclude
     others from mistaking them as snipers.
     7.16.6.3. Establish crowd and traffic control.
  7.16.7. Riot Control Formations and Maneuvers. Information and training material on
  specific riot control techniques can be found in the Electronic Tactics, Techniques, &
  Procedures Guides (e-TTPGs) Library located on the Air Force Security Forces Center‘s web
  site. The library is at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil in the middle column under e-TTPGs.

                        CATEGORIES OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY

A2.1. ACQUISITION OF EXPERTISE. Unjustified attempts to obtain or conduct specialized
training in security concepts, military weapons or tactics, or other unusual capabilities such as
specialized transport or handling capabilities that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a
threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A2.2. BREACH OR ATTEMPTED INTRUSION. Unauthorized entry or attempted entry into a
restricted area or protected site; impersonation of authorized personnel (e.g., police, security, or
janitorial personnel).
A2.3. ELICITING INFORMATION. Suspicious questioning of personnel by any means about
particular DoD structures, functions, personnel, or procedures at the facility or infrastructure.
A2.4. EXPESSED OR IMPLIED THREAT. A threat to DoD personnel or threatened damage to
or compromise of a DoD facility or infrastructure.
A2.5. FLYOVER OR LANDING. Suspicious overflight of or landing near a DoD facility or
infrastructure by any type of flying vehicle (e.g., airplane, helicopter, unmanned aerial vehicle,
hang glider).
A2.6. MATERIALS ACQUISITION OR STORAGE. Acquisition of unusual quantities of
precursor material (e.g., cell phones, pagers, fuel, and timers); unauthorized or unlicensed
individual or group attempts to obtain precursor chemicals, agents, or toxic materials; or rental of
storage units for the purpose of storing precursor material, chemicals, or apparatuses for mixing
chemicals.
A2.7. MISREPRESENTATION. Misusing or presenting false insignia, documents, or
identification or engaging in any other activity to misrepresent one's affiliation.
A2.8. RECRUITING. Building operations teams and developing contacts, or collecting
personnel data, banking data, or travel data under circumstances that would cause a reasonable
person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A2.9. SABOTAGE, TAMPERING, OR VANDALISM. Damaging, manipulating, or defacing
part of a DoD facility, infrastructure, or protected site. Acts of vandalism committed by DoD
civilian employees, military members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious
activity unless those acts relate to a pattern of criminal activity or otherwise would cause a
reasonable person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A2.10. SURVEILLANCE. Monitoring the activity of DoD personnel, facilities, processes, or
systems, including showing unusual interest in a facility, infrastructure, or personnel (e.g.,
observation through binoculars, taking notes, drawing maps or diagrams of the facility, and
taking pictures or video of a facility, infrastructure, personnel, or the surrounding environment)
under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel,
facilities, or forces in transit.
A2.11. TESTING OF SECURITY. A challenge to or a series of interactions with DoD
installations, vessels, personnel, or systems that could reveal physical, personnel, or cyber
security capabilities or vulnerabilities.
AFMAN31-201V4 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    71


A2.12. THEFT, LOSS, OR DIVERSION. Theft or loss associated with a DoD facility or
infrastructure (e.g., of badges, uniforms, identification cards, emergency vehicles, technology, or
documents, whether classified or unclassified) that are proprietary to the facility, or a diversion
of attention from a DoD facility or infrastructure that is related to a theft or loss associated with
that facility.
A2.13. WEAPONS DISCOVERY. Discovery of weapons or explosives, as defined in section
930 of title 18, U.S.C. (Reference (n)). The discovery of personal weapons legally owned by
DoD civilian employees, military members, or their dependents should not be reported as
suspicious activity if the discovery is solely the result of the owner's failure to properly store or
secure the weapon(s).

                          BEHAVIORAL THREAT INDICATORS

A3.1. Foreword. This list is a compilation of behavioral threat indicators derived from multiple
credible open source documents from various DoD, DoS, DoJ, State and University studies or
directives. NOTE: Not all indicators are independently actionable, but when put to together or
demonstrated in conjunction with one another, they could indicate a threat.

       A3.2.1.2. Statement of intent to commit or threatening to commit a terrorist act, whether
       serious or supposedly as a ―joke,‖ and regardless of whether or not you think the person
       intends to carry out the action.
       A3.2.1.3. Deliberate probing of security responses, such as deliberately causing a false
       alarm, faked accidental entry to an unauthorized area, or other suspicious activity
       designed to test security responses without prior authorization.
       A3.2.1.4. Statements of support for suicide bombers who have attacked the United States
       or U.S. personnel or interests abroad.
