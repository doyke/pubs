                                           Chapter 1

           PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. Guidance cannot cover all situations. Supervisors are expected to use sound
judgment in determining the requirement for a runway supervisory unit (RSU). The intent is to
provide RSU supervision for the majority of local undergraduate flying training (UFT) and pilot
instructor training (PIT) flying operations; in particular, multiple landings during periods of
student training and solo student operations.
1.2. Recommended Changes and Waivers:
   1.2.1. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistency in training.
   Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special consideration and possible waiver
   of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is important to preserve fidelity of training
   and policy implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for
   review of proposed waivers.
   1.2.2. Unless otherwise stated in this supplement, AETC A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for
   waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this supplement. (T-2) Wing/CCs are
   the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this
   instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances. (T-3)
   1.2.3. AETC commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests to AETC/A2/3/10 via the
   Tasker Management Tool (TMT). (T-2) Waiver requests must provide justification why the
   individual or unit cannot comply with requirements. (T-2) AETC/A3VO and the units will
   file a copy of approved waivers according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
   Management. (T-1)
1.3. Runway Control Structure (RCS). RCS refers to the structure used by the runway
supervisory unit (RSU) crew. AETC RCSs are usually permanent structures but properly
equipped mobile units may be used. RCSs must be located between the runway threshold and
3,000 feet down the runway, 250 feet from the runway centerline and, when possible, on the side
of the runway opposite the direction of break. (T-1) Request waivers to RCS location according
to unified facilities criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design located
at: http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc_3_260_01.pdf.
1.4. Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) Responsibilities. The OG/CC is responsible
for oversight of the RSU program. The OG/CC will:
   1.4.1. Ensure each RSU position is manned by adequately trained and certified personnel.
   1.4.2. Appoint an RSU program manager in writing at the operations group standardization
   and evaluation (OGV) level. (T-2) Maintain a copy of the appointment memorandum in the
   program continuity binder. (T-3)
   1.4.3. Appoint one T-6 and one T-38 RSU training and standardization officer (RSUTSO) in
   writing and ensure a copy of each appointment memorandum is maintained in the program
   continuity binder. (T-2) Note: Squadron appointed RSU training officers (RSUTO) may
   function as RSUTSOs at the discretion of the OG/CC. Exception: The OG/CC at JBSA
   Randolph will appoint one T-38 RSUTSO.
 6                                                                   AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


     1.4.4. Review and certify all controller AETC Forms 309, RCS/RSU Crewmember
     Evaluation and Qualification Certificate. (T-3)
     1.4.5. Review the training records and circumstances of controllers who exceed 90-day
     currency requirements to determine their suitability to remain in the RSU program. (T-3)
     Document the review in the individual’s training folder. (T-3)
     1.4.6. Ensure RSU control is provided to home station aircraft only. Note: This does not
     prevent an RSU controller from offering advice to other aircraft to prevent an accident. Relay
     advisories through the tower if time and conditions permit.
     1.4.7. Establish procedures to transfer runway and pattern responsibility from one facility to
     another. (T-2) Overlapping of control is prohibited. Granting the tower access to an RSU-
     controlled runway for a transient takeoff or landing does not require transfer of runway
     control. Transfer of runway control must however, be accomplished if emergency vehicles
     require access to or across an RSU-controlled runway. The RSU may keep pattern control
     but controllers will not allow any aircraft to takeoff or land. Runway control may be returned
     to RSU control after all emergency response vehicles have crossed the affected runway or the
     emergency has been terminated.
     1.4.8. Establish procedures to resolve conflicts between tower-controlled aircraft and RSU-
     controlled aircraft that are overshooting the final turn. (T-2)
     1.4.9. Establish procedures to ensure RSU-controlled traffic is separated from arriving and
     departing transient aircraft. (T-2)
     1.4.10. Establish procedures to relinquish RSU control of a runway to the tower when
     weather conditions prevent visual flight rules (VFR) traffic patterns. (T-2)
     1.4.11. Establish procedures to use if RSU or control tower communications fail. (T-2)
1.5. RSU Program Manager Responsibilities. The RSU program manager must be a current
RSU controller. (T-2) The RSU program manager will:
     1.5.1. Maintain overall control of the RSU program and function as the OG/CC point of
     contact on RSU issues. (T-3)
     1.5.2. Limit RCS maximum occupancy as follows:
        1.5.2.1. Inside a large (permanent) RCS at one time 10 individuals. (T-3)
        1.5.2.2. Inside a small (mobile) RCS at one time six individuals. (T-3)
     1.5.3. Maintain a permanent visitor log or develop a process to verify that all orientation and
     required supervisory visits are accomplished. (T-3)
     1.5.4. Ensure the controller is seated at the end of the RCS closest to the runway approach
     end and the observer is seated at the opposite end. (T-2)
     1.5.5. Forward all open RCS discrepancies to the OG/CC each flying week. (T-3)
     1.5.6. Observe Class A RSU operations at least once per quarter for a minimum of 1 hour.
     (T-3) Visits will vary between each type of aircraft, document on AETC Form 1163,
     RCS/RSU Supervisor’s Critique.
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                        7


   1.5.7. Review and provide AETC Forms 1163 to the respective T-6 or T-38 squadron
   commander (SQ/CC) and RSUTSO. (T-3)
   1.5.8. Where appropriate, use risk management (RM) principles in building necessary
   control measures into the RSU program. Examples of RM include mitigating the risk in RSU
   operations relating to solo students, poor or adverse weather, or crowded patterns. These are
   all cases where risk analysis and elevating concerns to more experienced and qualified
   supervisors such as the TOP 3 or OG/CC may be required.
   1.5.9. Establish a currency requirement tracking system for all personnel in the RSU
   program. (T-3)
1.6. RSU Training and Standardization Officer (RSUTSO) Responsibilities. The RSUTSO
must be a qualified instructor controller. (T-2) Each RSUTSO will:
   1.6.1. Establish and supervise RSU program and crew training to include developing and
   maintaining written qualification examinations (see Chapter 4). (T-2)
   1.6.2. Administer, document, and route required controller AETC Forms 309. (T-3)
   1.6.3. Conduct quarterly RSU standardization meetings at a time and place that ensures
   maximum attendance (see paragraph 5.6). (T-3)
   1.6.4. Conduct instructor upgrade briefings. (T-3)
   1.6.5. Conduct no-notice evaluations (see paragraph 5.8). (T-2)
   1.6.6. Review all AETC Forms 1163 and maintain them in accordance with AFI 33-364 and
   AFRIMS RDS. (T-3)
   1.6.7. For RCS facilities with an auxiliary power unit (APU) requirement:
      1.6.7.1. Establish a training program with local power production personnel to ensure all
      controllers and observers are certified in APU operations. (T-2)
      1.6.7.2. Evaluate and document APU operating procedures on initial controller
      evaluations and during initial observer and monitor training. (T-2)
   1.6.8. Ensure current documents are available (electronic or hardcopies) for use in active
   RCSs. (T-3) Minimum required documents include:
      1.6.8.1. AETCI 11-204 (with local supplement).
      1.6.8.2. Local area pattern guidance.
      1.6.8.3. Applicable aircraft flight manuals.
      1.6.8.4. Quick-reaction checklists.
      1.6.8.5. Local area maps marked with prominent landmarks and emergency fields.
1.7. SQ/CC Responsibilities. Each T-6 and T-38 SQ/CC will:
   1.7.1. Select and appoint the minimum number of personnel required to safely accomplish
   RSU operations. (T-2)
   1.7.2. Establish a continuing education program for the instructor force covering all aspects
   of RSU pattern operations. (T-2)
 8                                                                     AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


     1.7.3. Ensure controllers are evenly distributed throughout the squadron. (T-3) Each flight
     should normally have at least one assigned controller.
     1.7.4. Review and sign controller, monitor, and observer AETC Forms 309. (T-3)
     1.7.5. Appoint a RSUTO if the squadron has qualified RSU personnel. (T-3)
     1.7.6. Appoint one additional controller evaluator (per squadron assigned to RSU), if
     desired.
     1.7.7. Appoint an RCS facility officer. (T-3) Note: If the RSUTSO or RSUTO serves as the
     facility officer, no additional appointment is required. Civilian contractors serving as facility
     officers will comply with their statement of work.
     1.7.8. Review the training records and circumstances of controllers who exceed 30-day
     currency requirements (45 days for the 12th Flying Training Wing [12 FTW]) and ensure all
     instances, regardless of duration, are documented in the controller’s training folder. (T-3)
1.8. RSUTO Responsibilities. Each T-6 and T-38 RSUTO must be a qualified instructor

Notes:
1. Does not preclude temporary control of the runway by the tower (that is, emergency vehicle
crossings) as long as the RSU controller continues to control the traffic pattern as needed to
comply with tower controlled runway requirements (that is, restricted low approach). Units are
responsible for developing appropriate procedures. (T-2)
2. The WG/CC may waive RSU requirement after an appropriate risk assessment. (T-3)
3. Randolph AFB PIT may conduct T-6 AHC maneuvers in the tower controlled pattern as long
as the supervisor of flying [SOF] monitors pattern operations, and no other aircraft monitored by
the SOF are airborne in the local area. AHC ELPs flown in the Randolph AFB tower controlled
pattern will be flown under the supervision of a tower controller and SOF who have received an
orientation on T-6 AHC ELP operations. (T-2) This orientation will be given by the runway
supervisory unit training and standardization officer, runway supervisory unit training officer, or
the SOF program manager and will cover basic AHC ELP operations as well as the SOF/tower
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                          11


controller’s role in making safety-of-flight radio calls (i.e., “go around,” “discontinue”).
4. 479FTG will conduct T-6 AHC pattern operations in the Pensacola NAS tower-controlled
pattern. 479FTG/CC will ensure USN tower controllers receive an orientation briefing on T-6
AHC pattern operations. This orientation will cover AHC ELP pattern operations, with specific
guidance on the tower controller’s role in making safety-of-flight radio calls (“go around/wave-
off”, “discontinue”, etc.) (T-2)
5. T-38 supervised solo out-and-back and solo night navigation sorties may depart or return (one
pattern to a full stop) under tower control as long as a Class B RSU is in place.
6. Local T-38 solo student sorties may depart or return (one pattern to a full stop) under tower
control as long as a Class B RSU is in place and a Class A RSU is open on the primary T-38
runway. (Exception: Solo student contact and/or transition sorties will return to an RSU
controlled pattern. [T-2]) Local T-6 solo student sorties may depart under tower control at the
discretion of the OG/CC as long as a Class B RSU is in place and a Class A RSU is open on the
T-6 runway.
7. Randolph auxiliary airfield operations require a Class A RSU.
8. T-38 supervised solo single-ship sorties: Before any students arriving, landing, or departing an
out base, an assistant flight commander or above (if unavailable, a qualified RSU controller) will
be in place at the approach end of the active runway or in the control tower. (T-2) He or she will
have the proper publications, act as the on-scene mission commander, and advise the air traffic
controller in emergency situations. Personnel performing this duty must not interfere with
control tower operations. On-scene commanders will ensure they have a VHF discreet frequency
to communicate with the students. This requirement is waived if a Class A RSU and a SOF are in
place at the out base and the on-scene commander has relayed the call signs of all aircraft in the
deployment to the current SOF.
9. T-38 Formation solo O&B sorties: Solo students are required to land before their formation
flight lead that will serve as on-scene commander and advise ATC in emergency situations. (T-2)
10. Includes ENJJPT PIT and transition (trainee) syllabus sorties.
11. Opening RSU crews will check the condition of the auxiliary field's runway by conducting a
low approach before landing. (T-2)

landings, and full-stop landings performed by another type aircraft.
2.3. Supervisory Visits. Active supervision of the RSU program by unit leadership is critical to
safe and effective flying operations. Required visit intervals defined below should be considered
 12                                                                AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


absolute minimums and more frequent observations by supervisors at all levels are encouraged.
Supervisors will use an AETC Form 1163 to record their observations of RSU crew
performance, aircrew compliance with traffic pattern procedures, and overall radio discipline
during each visit. (T-3) The RSUTSO will review AETC Forms 1163 and send them (as a
minimum) to the OGV program manager, facility manager (if facility related), and SQ/CC for
their review. (T-3) The minimum frequency of supervisory visits is as follows:
   2.3.1. The OG/CC or OG/CD and the RSU program manager will observe Class A RSU
   operations at least once per quarter. (T-2) Visitation to each home and auxiliary field RSU is
   highly encouraged during each quarter.
   2.3.2. T-6 and T-38 squadron commanders and operations officers will observe Class A
   RSU operations in their respective RSUs at least once within each half of the quarter. (T-2)
   CCs and DOs will alternate visits between the home and auxiliary field. Units that have more
   than one squadron per MDS may alternate visits between squadrons.
   2.3.3. The 560 FTS CC, DO, or ADO may alternate RSU visits, but each CC will ensure
   supervisory visitation occurs on a monthly basis. (T-2) Flight CC participation is encouraged,
   but not required.
2.4. Equipment and Maintenance:
   2.4.1. RCSs are real property; base civil engineering units provide for their support and
   maintenance. (T-1) Modifications will not be made to standard RCS design and equipment
   without the approval of HQ AETC/A3V and the HQ AETC/A7C. HQ AETC/A6CS must
   review and coordinate all requests for modification of communications equipment.
   2.4.2. The RSU crew will notify the appropriate agency of any maintenance discrepancy and
   obtain a job control number and an estimated completion time. (T-3)
   2.4.3. For onsite repairs, the individual providing the repair completes the appropriate
   portions of AETC Form 360, showing actions taken and notifies the RCS facility officer. If
   the cause of the discrepancy cannot be determined, the repair person annotates in the
   corrective action block “could not duplicate,” and notifies the RCS facility officer. Note:
   Repeat intermittent operation write-ups with no determined cause will require a thorough
   inspection of affected system components.
   2.4.4. Maintenance personnel will document removal and replacement of RCS
   communications equipment on AETC Form 360 to include serial numbers, if applicable. (T-
   3)
   2.4.5. The RCS facility officer or appointed alternate ensures RCS equipment is operational,
   as applicable. (T-2) RCS equipment includes:
        2.4.5.1. Radios. Normal RCS radio configuration should consist of three radios (one
        single-channel primary frequency, one single-channel guard frequency, and one
        multifrequency). Radios must provide transmit, receive, and record capability. (T-2)
        OG/CC may approve an RSU opening or remaining open with only two radios (one
        primary frequency and one guard frequency) only if both have transmit and receive
        capability. RSU may also remain open if the record capability is inoperable. Consider
        both situations a temporary configuration to allow operations while the inoperative radio
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                          13


     is expeditiously repaired. Each RCS is equipped with an RSU upgrade position that
     overrides transmissions from the trainee’s position.
     2.4.5.2. Telephones. Each RCS should have a minimum of one Class C telephone line
     and two telephones. Note: OG/CC may approve operations at the auxiliary field without
     this requirement provided an operable cellular telephone is available.
     2.4.5.3. Hotlines. Hotlines should be available to ensure direct contact with the
     following: (Note: OG/CC may approve operations without these requirements provided
     an operable speed dial capability is available.
        2.4.5.3.1. Tower. Note: Auxiliary fields are exempt.
        2.4.5.3.2. Ground control approach (GCA). Note: Required for runways where
        precision approach radar or airport surveillance radar (ASR) approaches are flown
        (except emergency-only ASRs).
        2.4.5.3.3. SOF. Note: The tower and SOF may share the same line if the activities
        are collocated.
        2.4.5.3.4. Crash or rescue.
        2.4.5.3.5. Other RCSs serving parallel runways, as necessary.
        2.4.5.3.6. Other agencies as required.
     2.4.5.4. Flare Pistols (Optional). If flares are maintained and used, at least two flare
     pistols and six flare cartridges should be in place and operable at the start of flying. (T-2)
     2.4.5.5. Light Gun. A light gun will be available in each RCS. (T-2)
     2.4.5.6. Binoculars. Two sets of binoculars at home field and one set at the auxiliary
     field are required. (T-2)
     2.4.5.7. Wind-Measuring Equipment. (T-2) Each RCS must be able to display current
     wind information (both direction and velocity) either through a dedicated wind-
     measuring system or a remote access system. At the home field, a temporary operation
     without this equipment is acceptable when alternate procedures (such as a tower) are
     established to obtain accurate wind information. At the auxiliary field, a temporary
     operation without this equipment is acceptable with OG/CC approval after close scrutiny
     of current and forecasted weather and winds. In either case, consider this a temporary
     configuration to allow operations while the equipment is expeditiously repaired.
     2.4.5.8. Portable Toilet Facilities. As required.
     2.4.5.9. Air-Conditioner and Heater. An air-conditioner and heater capable of
     maintaining temperatures within the RCS between 70 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit
     are required. (T-2)
     2.4.5.10. Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). An APU capable of supporting essential RCS
     equipment (including air-conditioner) during commercial power outages is required. (T-2)
     (Exception: APUs are not required to be prepositioned at RCSs if the OG/CC and base
     civil engineer jointly concur that predicted reliability of commercial power is sufficient to
     satisfy RSU and divert requirements.) For RCSs with an APU requirement:
 14                                                                   AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


          2.4.5.10.1. RSUTSOs will establish a training program with local power production
          personnel to ensure all controllers and observers are certified in APU operations. (T-
          2)
          2.4.5.10.2. The OG/CC may approve continued RSU operations with an inoperable
          APU as long as commercial power is available. If commercial power is subsequently
          lost, the RSU crew will notify airborne aircrews that communication capability has
          been lost according to local guidance. The RSU crew must contact the appropriate
          agency to ensure the APU is repaired as quickly as possible. (T-3)
      2.4.5.11. Dehumidifier. Install a dehumidifier in each RCS to ensure humidity levels
      remain acceptable for electronics equipment. (T-2) (Exception: A dehumidifier is not
      required if the air conditioner is not turned off.) Note: Establish an outside drain for the
      dehumidifier since facilities are not always occupied.
   2.4.6. BAK-15 Aircraft Arresting System Components. Test the BAK-15 at the
   beginning of each flying week. (T-2) With OG/CC approval, an RSU may open or remain
   open with an inoperable BAK-15 barrier. Consider this a temporary configuration to allow
   operation while the barrier is expeditiously repaired.
2.5. Handling and Storing Procedures for Flares and Flare Pistols. Maintenance and use of
flares is optional. If flares are maintained and used, units must comply with the following
requirements:
   2.5.1. Because flares and flare pistols are classified as munitions and firearms, RSU
   personnel handling them must apply the special security and storage procedures in AFMAN
   91-201, Explosive Safety Standards. (T-1)
   2.5.2. RSU personnel who handle flares and flare pistols must complete initial and recurring
   training according to AFMAN 91-201. (T-1) They must also comply with the following
   procedures:
      2.5.2.1. Load flare pistols only after they are installed in a flare port. (T-2) Unload the
      pistol before removal from a flare port. (T-2)
      2.5.2.2. If a dry firing check is required, install the flare pistol in the flare port before
      firing. (T-2)
      2.5.2.3. Leave the breech open when the flare pistol is not secured in the flare port. (T-2)
      2.5.2.4. If a flare fails to fire, make two more attempts. If the flare still fails to fire, use
      the other pistol. Wait at least 30 seconds after a misfire, then open the breech, unload the
      pistol, and examine the flare for primer indentation by the firing pin.
          2.5.2.4.1. If an indentation exists, reload the pistol with a new flare, place the
          misfired flare into a container marked “misfired flares,” and place the container
          outside the RCS.
          2.5.2.4.2. If no indentation exists, remove the pistol from service and have qualified
          personnel conduct an inspection of the pistol.
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                    15


  2.5.3. Bases will establish local procedures for disposal of the misfired flares as well as
  inspection and maintenance of pistols and their mounts. (T-3) Bases will publish local
  procedures according to guidance in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. (T-

                          CREW QUALIFICATION AND DUTIES

3.1. Controller Qualification:
   3.1.1. The SQ/CC will select the minimum number of controllers necessary to satisfy
   mission requirements, attempting to ensure an overall balance between first assignment
   instructor pilots and major weapon system personnel. (T-2)
   3.1.2. RSU controllers are selected from the most highly qualified, current instructor pilots
   (IP) with at least 6 months IP experience in current aircraft and a minimum of 90 days
   experience as an observer or monitor. (T-2) Controller candidates, regardless of previous
   experience or qualification, will complete the initial qualification controller syllabus outlined
   in Attachment 3. (T-2) Proficiency advancement is authorized at the discretion of the
   OG/CC.
   3.1.3. The initial qualification evaluation should include all aspects of a normally scheduled
   RSU tour (crew brief, control of overhead traffic, debrief, etc). The tour length will be an
   entire scheduled tour. (T-2) Periodic evaluations should be planned for 2 hours minimum.
   3.1.4. Before controlling traffic at night, a minimum of 1 night on-the-job-training (OJT)
   tour with a minimum length of 2 hours is required. (T-2) If the night tour is not
   accomplished, the Letter of Xs will reflect a day-only qualification. (T-2)
   3.1.5. After completion of the initial evaluation, but before performing unsupervised
   controller duties, the OG/CC must interview the candidate; sign the AETC Form 309 as well
   as the AF Form 4348. (T-2) The SQ/CC ensures the Letter of Xs is updated to reflect this
   qualification. Currency requirements and the evaluation zone are based on the day and month
   of the evaluation. Subsequent AETC Forms 309 are reviewed and signed by the OG/CC. (T-
   3)
   3.1.6. Before performing aircraft handling characteristics/emergency landing pattern
   (AHC/ELP) controller duties, RSU controllers will accomplish all qualification requirements
   established in Attachment 3. (T-2)
   3.1.7. If a controller fails the initial or periodic evaluation, the evaluator will document the
   results on the AETC Form 309. (T-2) The RSUTSO or RSUTO will consult with the
   individual’s SQ/CC to determine whether to retrain or withdraw the controller from the
   program. (T-2) If training is continued, the controller will complete the recommended
   retraining and accomplish the evaluation. (T-2) Note: Current controllers who were RSU
   instructors (observer or monitor) before controller upgrade may perform instructor monitor
   or instructor observer duties. All night RSU operations require a controller to have a night
   qualification. (T-2)
3.2. Instructor Controller Qualification. The SQ/CC will designate the minimum number of
controllers necessary to perform instructor controller duties. (T-2) Candidates must have 6
months of current controller experience or have accomplished 20 tours. (T-2) Before performing
instructor controller duties, trainees will receive an instructor controller briefing from the
RSUTSO. (T-3) The RSUTO can give this briefing if the RSUTSO is not available (leave,
temporary duty [TDY], etc.). Instructor controllers will be tracked on the Letter of Xs. (T-3)

3.3. Controller Duties. The RSU controller is responsible for the safe and efficient control of
all aircraft under the RSU’s jurisdiction, including air discipline, pattern conformity, and
compliance with established procedures. However, he or she is not responsible for individual
aircrew training requirements. The RSU controller will:
   3.3.1. Use preventive control procedures to ensure flight safety within the RSU pattern. (T-
   2) (Note: Preventive controls are aimed at avoiding an unwanted situation.)
   3.3.2. Resolve pattern conflicts, using any means necessary (to include plain English). (T-2)
   3.3.3. Issue traffic priority to emergency and minimum fuel aircraft. (T-2)
   3.3.4. Positively identify solos, particularly Commander’s Awareness Program solos, at all
   times and issue traffic priority as the situation dictates. (T-2)
   3.3.5. Brief the observer, spotter, and recorder on their duties before each tour. (T-2)
   3.3.6. Focus attention on the lowest, slowest airborne aircraft within his or her primary area
   of responsibility (AOR). (T-2) The controller is responsible for the entire pattern. However,
   his or her primary AOR should emphasize that part of the traffic pattern from:
       3.3.6.1. Initial to overhead the RCS.
       3.3.6.2. Closed downwind abeam the RCS to the perch (high key or base key).
       3.3.6.3. The final turn through the final approach and touchdown zone.
   3.3.7. Verbalize handoffs of overheads, long landings, and go-arounds. (T-2) Note: Verbal
   handoffs are designed to prevent unnecessary overlap between AORs. Controllers may need
   to glance into the observer’s AOR for situational awareness, but should not use this
   technique repeatedly as a substitute for good cockpit/crew resource management (CRM).
   3.3.8. Ensure proper use of AETC Form 355 or equivalent product approved by their unit
   publishing manager, to record takeoff and landing times and pattern comments. (T-3)
   3.3.9. Initiate a preliminary communications search when a single-ship local T-38 student
   solo sortie is airborne for 1 hour, increase this time to 1+20 for other T-38 sorties, 1+20 for
   T-6 student solo sorties, 1+45 for other T-6 sorties, and 3+10 for T-1A sorties. (T-2) Notify
   the SOF if the preliminary communications search is unsuccessful. (T-2)
   3.3.10. Advise the SOF if weather observed is incompatible with the current flying status.
   (T-2) In coordination with the SOF, take immediate action when weather dictates. (T-2)

   trends, and winds as appropriate, to facilitate safe and efficient pattern operations. (T-2)
   3.3.12. Announce bird condition, advisories on the location and flight path of any large
   influx of birds in the vicinity of the airfield, activities of other aircraft that may affect the
   traffic pattern, and other conditions, as appropriate, that may affect safety of operations. (T-2)
   3.3.13. Ensure aircraft-arresting barriers are operational and in the proper position before
   clearing aircraft for takeoff or landing. (T-2)
   3.3.14. Ensure aircraft are visually checked for proper configuration before takeoff or
   landing. (T-2)
 18                                                                 AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


   3.3.15. Report deviations from established procedures to the appropriate squadron
   supervisor. (T-2)
   3.3.16. Not attempt to maintain the normal volume and pace of pattern operations when
   emergency situations arise. (T-2) To maintain situational awareness on the emergency
   aircraft, the RSU controller will:
       3.3.16.1. Consider using any combination of the following: stop launch, stop pattern
       entries, restricted low approach, straight through initial, etc.
       3.3.16.2. Time permitting, review emergency procedures with the aircraft and coordinate
       actions with the SOF. (T-2)
       3.3.16.3. Designate an aircraft with an instructor onboard to fly as chase when an
       emergency aircraft in the VFR pattern requires airborne assistance. (T-2)
   3.3.17. Notify base operations (or other appropriate agency tasked with barrier maintenance)
   if an aircraft disturbs the down barrier in the approach end overrun. (T-2)
   3.3.18. Not permit other duties (upgrades, telephone calls, facility maintenance, etc.) to
   distract attention from his or her primary controller responsibilities. (T-2)
3.4. Monitor Qualification. The SQ/CC will select the minimum number of monitors
necessary to satisfy mission requirements and document selection via AF Form 4348. (T-2)
Monitors are selected from the most highly qualified and current IPs with at least 3 months of IP
experience accumulated during their current duty assignment. (T-2) On completion of training,
the RSUTSO must ensure all training was accomplished before the trainee’s perform monitor
duties. (T-2)
   3.4.1. The Letter of Xs must be updated to reflect monitor qualification. (T-3)
   3.4.2. Currency requirements begin on the day of the last upgrade tour.

monitor duties, trainees will receive an instructor monitor briefing from the RSUTSO. (T-3) The
RSUTO can give this briefing if the RSUTSO is not available (leave, TDY, etc.). Instructor
monitors will be tracked on the Letter of Xs. (T-3)
3.6. Monitor Duties. Each monitor will:
   3.6.1. Transmit proper instructions to prevent potentially hazardous situations during takeoff
   and landing. (T-2)
   3.6.2. Ensure all aircraft are visually checked for proper configuration before takeoff or
   landing. (T-2)
   3.6.3. Focus attention on the lowest, slowest airborne aircraft. (T-2)

   qualified in one type of aircraft, may monitor initial takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, and
   full-stop landings performed by another type aircraft (see Table 2.2.). In addition, monitors
   who transitioned directly from the observer position may perform observer duties if they
   maintain required observer currency requirements.
3.7. Observer Qualification:
   3.7.1. The SQ/CC will select the minimum number of observers necessary to satisfy mission
   requirements. (T-2)
   3.7.2. RSU observers are selected from the most highly qualified and current IPs with at
   least 3 months of IP experience in their assigned aircraft accumulated during their current
   duty assignment. (T-2)
       3.7.2.1. Observer trainees in the 560 FTS must be rated pilots current and qualified in the
       aircraft being observed. (T-2)

                  CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

5.1. Currency Documentation. The RSU program manager will establish a currency
requirement tracking system for all personnel in the RSU program. (T-2) This system should
allow for easy review of data relating to the number of tours accomplished, duration, dates of
tour, etc. Note: When accomplishing recurrency or requalification tours, both the instructor and
trainee must log the tour in order to verify proper completion of requalification training. (T-3)
5.2. Flight Currency, Medical, and Crew Duty Day Restrictions:
   5.2.1. If an individual is grounded for an extended period, the OG/CC may authorize RSU
   controller, monitor, or observer duty without aircraft qualification or currency. Document the
   authorization in the individual’s training folder. (T-3) During the grounded period, the
   individual will satisfy all RSU duty prerequisites (go/no-go items, RSU meeting attendance,
   etc.) and currencies. (T-2)
   5.2.2. RSU crewmembers that are medically excused from flying duty or grounded may not
   perform RSU duty without specific written clearance from the flight surgeon. (T-2)
   5.2.3. RSU crewmembers are not permitted to perform RSU duty if such duty will extend
   their crew duty period beyond 12 hours. (T-2) Note: RSU duty is a flying-related activity and
   must be considered when scheduling instructors and students (for student night flying
   operations, etc.).
5.3. Controller Currency:
   5.3.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, controllers will perform Class A RSU
   duties for at least 1 hour every 30-calendar days (45 days for the 12 FTW). (T-2) A full-
   length, regularly scheduled tour is the preferred method for updating controller currency. A
   controller performing instructor duties may log a tour to meet this requirement. Note: Initial
   currency is based on the date of the initial evaluation, not the date the OG/CC signs the
   AETC Form 309.
   5.3.2. If 30 days pass without performing controller duties (45 days for the 12 FTW), the
   controller must undergo refresher training to include a review of applicable RSU publications
   and a 1-hour OJT tour under the supervision of a current instructor controller. (T-2)
   Document the loss of currency and recurrency in the individual’s training record. (T-3)
   5.3.3. If 60 days pass without performing controller duties, the controller must undergo
   refresher training of at least two 2-hour tours under the supervision of an instructor
   controller. (T-2) In addition, the controller must accomplish a written examination. (T-2)
   Document the loss of currency and recurrency in the individual’s training record. (T-3)
   5.3.4. If more than 90 days pass without performing controller duties, the controller must
   complete nonwaiverable requalification training (see paragraph 4.1.2). (T-2) Base the

   5.3.6. The OG/CC must review the circumstances for an individual who exceeds 90-day
   currency to determine his or her suitability to remain in the RSU program. (T-3) Document
   the review in the individual’s training record. (T-3)
5.4. Monitor Currency:
   5.4.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, each monitor must perform RSU duty at
   least once every 45 days. (T-2) A monitor performing instructor duties may log a tour to
   meet this requirement. A monitor may hold dual qualification as an observer as long as he or
   she maintains currency requirements in both positions. That is, monitor duty does not satisfy
   observer currency requirements or the reverse.
   5.4.2. If 45 days pass without performing monitor duties, the monitor must undergo refresher
   training to include a review of applicable RSU publications, and a 1-hour OJT tour under the
   supervision of a current instructor controller or instructor monitor. (T-2) Note: Controllers
   may perform instructor monitor duties, but they will not simultaneously control traffic and
   conduct monitor upgrade training. (T-2)
   5.4.3. If more than 60 days pass without performing monitor duties, the monitor must
   complete refresher training to include a 1-hour requalification tour, an oral evaluation, and a
   written examination. (T-2)
   5.4.4. The SQ/CC must review each instance of lost currency. (T-3) Document the review in
   the individual’s training record. (T-3)
5.5. Observer Currency:
   5.5.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, each observer must perform RSU duty at
   least once every 45 days. (T-2) An observer performing instructor duties may log a tour to
   meet this requirement. An observer may hold dual qualification as a monitor as long as he or
   she maintains currency requirements in both positions. That is, observer duty does not satisfy
   monitor currency requirements or the reverse.
   5.5.2. If 45 days pass without performing observer duties, the observer must undergo
   refresher training to include a review of applicable RSU publications and a 1-hour OJT tour
   under the supervision of a current instructor controller or instructor observer. (T-2) Note:
   Controllers may perform instructor observer duties, but they will not simultaneously control
   traffic and conduct observer upgrade training. (T-2)
   5.5.3. If more than 60 days pass without performing observer duties, the observer must
   complete refresher training to include a 1-hour requalification tour, an oral evaluation, and a
   written examination. (T-2)
   5.5.4. The SQ/CC must review each instance of lost currency. (T-3) Document the review in
   the individual’s training record. (T-3)
5.6. Quarterly RSU Standardization Meeting:
   5.6.1. Conduct quarterly RSU standardization meetings at a time and place that will ensure
   maximum attendance. (T-3) As a minimum, include an emergency scenario, trends, and
   current issues. (T-3) Discussion of how solos may complicate the scenario is recommended.
   5.6.2. Mandatory attendees include all RSU-qualified IP crewmembers, the OG/CC or
   OG/CD, the respective SQ/CC or DO, and the OGV program manager or alternate. (T-3)
 26                                                                AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


   Exception: Randolph PIT trainees are not required to attend. These meetings will take
   priority over simulators and/or flying. Appointments will be scheduled to avoid conflicts
   with the RSU meeting. Develop a process to ensure RSU crewmembers not in attendance
   read and initial the meeting minutes before their next RSU tour. (T-3) Meeting minutes must
   clearly communicate all pertinent aspects of the meeting, particularly emergency procedure
   discussions and resolutions. (T-3)
5.7. Controller Performance Evaluations:
   5.7.1. Establish the evaluation zone from the 12th through the 17th month from the initial or
   previous evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to perform controller duties
   and as well as a full knowledge of applicable directives, aircraft performance characteristics,
   operating limitations, emergency procedures, and APU procedures (if applicable).
   5.7.2. Document the evaluation performance on the AETC Form 309 and route through the
   OG/CC for signature. (T-3) Initial and periodic performance evaluation prerequisites are an
   oral evaluation; a 25-question, written test based on controller responsibilities; and a review
   of appropriate RSU directives. (T-2)
5.8. Controller No-Notice Evaluations:
   5.8.1. Each RSUTSO and RSUTO will conduct no-notice evaluations. (T-2) The no-notice
   program has three parts: (1) follow-up monitoring of individuals with previously identified
   deficiencies, (2) evaluations associated with local unit evaluations, and (3) random sampling
   of the assigned RSU crew force (quality of force). The no-notice program will include
   sufficient controller evaluations to ensure quality of force is maintained. (T-3)
   5.8.2. No-notice evaluations should not be used as a scheduling tool to satisfy periodic
   evaluation requirements. Administered correctly, no-notice evaluations may count for the
   periodic evaluation if all other evaluation requirements are completed within 30 calendar
   days of the evaluation.
   5.8.3. The new evaluation zone is based on the date of the no-notice evaluation.
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                          27


                                            Chapter 6

                            TRAFFIC PATTERN OPERATIONS

6.1. Conduct of Operations: When established within Class C airspace, conduct RSU patterns
within practice areas as defined in local operating agreements. Participating local aircraft in the
practice areas are exempt from Class C services and will instead operate according to local
guidelines.
   6.1.1. RSU patterns exist to facilitate safe and efficient VFR traffic pattern operations. RSU
   personnel will use preventive control procedures to ensure flight safety within the RSU
   pattern, but are not responsible for individual aircrew training requirements. (T-2) (Note:
   Preventive control is aimed at avoiding an unwanted situation.) The following are examples
   of preventive control:
       6.1.1.1. Denying closed requests with aircraft on initial.
       6.1.1.2. Denying closed requests with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles from
       touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
       6.1.1.3. Denying late closed requests.
       6.1.1.4. Denying straight-in requests or clearance.
       6.1.1.5. Preventing aircraft from initiating the break with straight-in traffic between 9
       and 4 miles from touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
       6.1.1.6. Preventing aircraft from initiating the break with aircraft between “report high
       key” and low key.
   6.1.2. Under most circumstances, preventive control and standard RSU radio terminology
   (see Attachment 4) should be adequate to safely control the pattern. However, improper
   actions by aircrew or RSU personnel do occur and may sometimes lead to pattern conflicts.
   In these situations, RSU personnel must intervene immediately, using whatever means
   necessary (including “plain English”) to resolve the conflict. (T-2)
6.2. Aircraft Control:
   6.2.1. RSUs will control aircraft according to procedures in this chapter.
   6.2.2. Local aircraft under tower control and transient aircraft will be controlled according to
   applicable Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control publications. (T-
   1) Note: Controllers must be aware that tower operations differ considerably from RSU
   procedures.
   6.2.3. RSU controllers will not clear an aircraft for a low approach (less than 500 feet above
   ground level [AGL]) directly over a transient aircraft on landing roll or taxiing on the
   runway. (T-1) Aircraft shall not be cleared for a low approach or restricted low approach
   directly over a transient aircraft that is in position and hold or departing. (T-1)
   6.2.4. RSU controllers will not authorize a landing aircraft to cross the threshold until a
   preceding transient aircraft clears the runway. (T-1) With tower approval, Reduced Same
   Runway Separation (RSRS) may be applied between home station and non-home station
   AETC trainer type aircraft according to Attachment 6. In this instance, tower retains
 28                                                                  AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


   separation responsibility and shall issue go around instructions to the trailing aircraft
   (including RSU controlled) as required.
   6.2.5. RSU crews will maintain a separate traffic count for each Class A RSU-controlled
   runway. (T-3) Count one movement for each takeoff or landing. Count a touch-and-go
   landing or low approach as two events. Count all aircraft in formation as one aircraft.
   6.2.6. RSU crews will use AETC Form 355 or equivalent, approved by the unit publishing
   manager, to record flight-following information, documentation of upgrade tours, recurrency
   and requalification, time in and time out of the facility, and comments on individual aircrew
   performance. (T-3) Maintain AETC Form 355 or equivalent for 1 year. (T-3) When
   documenting recurrency or requalification tours on AETC Form 355 or equivalent, both the
   instructor and trainee must log the tour in order to verify training. (T-3)
6.3. Procedures at UFT and PIT Bases:
   6.3.1. Each base will establish procedures to provide positive separation between RSU-
   controlled traffic and transient aircraft under tower or approach control. (T-2) Publish
   guidance according to AFI 33-360. (T-1)
   6.3.2. Air traffic facilities will coordinate radar approaches to RSU-controlled runways as
   follows:
      6.3.2.1. Do not integrate approaches under tower and radar control with RSU-controlled
      traffic unless direct communication is established between the RSU, tower, and radar
      facility. (T-2)
      6.3.2.2. To ensure proper sequencing of arriving radar traffic with RSU-controlled
      traffic, radar and RSU controllers will coordinate as follows:
          6.3.2.2.1. At a specified position, the radar controller establishes initial contact with
          the RSU and provides identification, position, and type of approach of the aircraft
          under radar control. The RSU is told when the aircraft is 9 miles from touchdown (5
          miles for T-6s). The RSU is also told when the aircraft is 4 miles from touchdown (2
          miles for T-6s).
          6.3.2.2.2. The RSU acknowledges each position report and issues appropriate traffic
          advisories and field information. (T-2) In no case will a radar approach be continued
          closer than 3 miles from touchdown unless coordinated with the RSU controller. (T-
          2)
          6.3.2.2.3. During T-38 night straight-in approaches, only one coordination call from
          the tower or radar to the RSU is required. This call must be made no closer than 5
          miles from touchdown and must include the frequency assigned to the aircraft nearest
          touchdown. (T-2)
   6.3.3. Straight-in aircraft will report 9 and 4 miles from touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
   (T-2) RSU controllers will clear aircraft requesting a straight-in not later than when the
   aircraft is 9 miles from touchdown (5 miles for T-6s). (T-2) RSU crews will only allow
   aircraft to commence the break or depart high key with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4
   miles (5 and 2 miles for T-6s) to facilitate pattern breakout training (pattern status allowing).
   (T-2) Aircrews will not commence the final or base turn if closed or low key traffic was
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                         29


  approved with an aircraft between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2 miles for T-6s). Units will establish
  local procedures to accommodate cancellation of a straight-in clearance. (T-2)
     6.3.3.1. To facilitate pattern breakout training where the emergency landing pattern
     (ELP) is flown opposite direction to the overhead pattern, RSU crews may clear aircraft
     to break.
     6.3.3.2. Aircrews will not commence the final turn if clearance was given with an
     aircraft between report high key and low key.
  6.3.4. RSU controllers must evaluate each minimum fuel situation in light of existing
  conditions and determine the extent to which aircraft are given special handling. When a
  pilot declares minimum fuel, other approaches and landings may continue. However; if a
  traffic conflict exists or is anticipated, minimum fuel aircraft must be given landing priority.
  (T-2) RSU controllers will acknowledge the initial minimum fuel call. (T-2)
  6.3.5. On arrival in the pattern, emergency aircraft will be given traffic priority. (T-2) When
  emergency situations arise, controllers will not attempt to maintain the normal volume and
  pace of pattern operations. To maintain situational awareness on the emergency aircraft,
  consider any combination of the following: stop launch, restricted low approach, and straight
  through initial. Time permitting, review emergency procedures with the aircraft and
  coordinate actions with the SOF.
  6.3.6. When an emergency aircraft in the VFR pattern requires airborne assistance, designate
  an aircraft with an instructor on board to fly as chase. (T-2) When an aircraft is disabled on
  or near a runway, discontinue normal traffic pattern operations. (T-2) Controllers will base
  subsequent control decisions on the status of the distressed aircraft. (T-2) Airfield managers
  or their representatives are responsible for authorizing resumption of normal runway
  operations.
  6.3.7. Control formations as a unit. (T-2) However, after formation aircraft have split up,
  RSU controllers may apply RSRS criteria (See Attachment 6).
  6.3.8. Procedures for RSU takeoff clearance are as follows:
     6.3.8.1. Do not allow more than four aircraft on the runway in takeoff position at the
     same time. (T-2) At night, do not allow more than one aircraft (or one element of two
     aircraft) on the runway at one time. (T-2)
     6.3.8.2. RSU controllers may authorize aircraft to line up and wait when takeoff
     clearance cannot be issued because of other traffic.
     6.3.8.3. RSU controllers may authorize aircraft to line up and wait when restricted low
     approach traffic is on final. Controllers will not clear aircraft for takeoff until proper
     separation is ensured with restricted low approach aircraft. (T-2)
  6.3.9. Accomplish departure and arrival separation as specified in the AETC Supplement to
  AFI 13-204, Volume 3. (T-1)
  6.3.10. Procedures for anticipating separation are as follows:
     6.3.10.1. Takeoff or landing clearance need not be withheld until prescribed separation
     exists if there is reasonable assurance that required separation will exist when the aircraft
     starts a takeoff roll or crosses the landing threshold. Landing clearance may be issued to a
30                                                                  AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014


     radar-controlled aircraft when the aircraft is 3 miles from touchdown even though a
     preceding aircraft has not crossed the landing threshold if there is reasonable assurance
     that prescribed separation will exist when the radar-controlled aircraft crosses the
     threshold.
     6.3.10.2. The RSU controller may not issue a clearance that requires a provisional or
     conditional phrase. (T-2) Specific guidance, such as “abort” or “go-around,” should be
     used. (See Attachment 4 for standard RSU phraseology.)
  6.3.11. Do not allow instrument and straight-in approaches to proceed inside 4 miles (2
  miles for T-6s) from the time a four-ship formation pitches until number four has initiated the
  turn to final. (T-2)
  6.3.12. Closed traffic procedures are as follows:
     6.3.12.1. Aircraft will not normally be cleared for closed traffic or low key with another
     aircraft on initial before the break, with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2
     miles for T-6s), or with an aircraft between initial and halfway between high key and low
     key. Note: An aircraft may be cleared for closed traffic or low key if the aircraft at high
     key is orbiting.
         6.3.12.1.1. To facilitate pattern breakout training where the ELP pattern is flown
         opposite direction to the overhead pattern, aircraft may request and be cleared for
         closed traffic with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2 miles for T-6s),
         and with an aircraft between initial and halfway between high key and low key.
         6.3.12.1.2. The words “for practice breakout” will be added to the end of the request
         for closed, the closed approved, and closed downwind radio calls. If a closed pattern
         was approved under these conditions, the aircrew will not commence the final turn.
     6.3.12.2. Caution must be used when clearing closed traffic with two aircraft on
     departure leg. If there is a question as to which aircraft has requested a closed, the
     controller will not issue a clearance until the question is resolved.
  6.3.13. Aircraft will not be cleared for high key with an aircraft in the high pattern. (T-2)
  6.3.14. When the aircrew reports or the controller directs a low approach, the aircraft will
  not touch down. During local flying operations when the aircrew is directed to make a
  restricted low approach, the aircraft will descend no lower than 500 feet AGL. (The
  controller may specify higher.) Aircraft making a restricted low approach with an aircraft in
  takeoff position must clear the runway, safety of flight permitting.
  6.3.15. The RSU controller’s silence to the pilot’s “gear down” call is an implied clearance
  to land, which may be modified by oral communications.
  6.3.16. RSU controllers will refrain from soliciting early turnoffs or instructing aircrews to
  clear the runway faster than normal. (T-2)
  6.3.17. RSU controllers may request T-6 aircrews to turn off strobe lights during hours of
  darkness while in the home-base traffic pattern.
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                              31


                                              Chapter 7

                                 LOCAL AREA PROCEDURES

7.1. Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). The airfield operations flight commander
will provide TERPS service according to AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures, for any procedure
designed for instrument approach or departure of aircraft; that is, nonprecision and precision
approaches and standard instrument departures. (T-1)
7.2. Aircraft Traffic Patterns. Attachment 5 of this publication establishes home and auxiliary
field traffic patterns for T-1, T-6, and T-38 aircraft. In addition, the following rules apply to these
aircraft:
   7.2.1. Aircraft departing under RSU control must remain in visual meteorological conditions
   until the departure control facility establishes radio and radar contact with the aircraft. (T-2)
   Military assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft (MARSA) will apply until standard
   instrument flight rules (IFR) separation is established. Each base will also designate points at
   which aircraft normally terminate IFR service on arrival. (T-2)
   7.2.2. Aircraft of like type in the terminal area (not under radar or tower control) must
   maintain a specified airspeed on designated ground tracks and adhere to established altitudes.
   (T-2)
   7.2.3. The number of aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern is limited to 12 T-6s, 12 T-38s, or 10
   T-1s. (T-2) The night VFR traffic pattern for each aircraft is limited to 8 aircraft. (T-2)
   7.2.4. UFT aircraft may remain in formation in the traffic pattern unless the RSU controller
   or tower directs otherwise.
   7.2.5. A common initial with opposite direction breaks for single runway operations will not
   be established. (Auxiliary fields are exempt.)
   7.2.6. When weather prevents the use of established pattern breakout procedures, a restricted
   pattern may be flown if the following requirements are satisfied:
       7.2.6.1. The existing ceiling is at least 500 feet above pattern altitude.
       7.2.6.2. Pattern is entered only:
           7.2.6.2.1. From initial takeoff.
           7.2.6.2.2. Via a crosswind entry or closed from a parallel runway.
           7.2.6.2.3. From a straight-in approach (if procedures are established to prevent a
           traffic conflict).
       7.2.6.3. Traffic pattern is limited to eight aircraft.
       7.2.6.4. Solo student sorties are prohibited.

       SYLLABUS REQUIREMENTS FOR RSU CONTROLLER CANDIDATES

A3.1. Training Requirements. The following minimum requirements will be included in the
local syllabus of instruction to upgrade RSU controller candidates: (Note: Additional training
(AT) or procedures peculiar to the local area will be added as necessary.)
   A3.1.1. Trainees must complete a minimum of nine daylight OJT tours within 45 calendar
   days. (T-2) (Exception: 560 FTS controllers only require 5 daylight OJT tours within 45
   calendar days. OG/CC may reduce this requirement to a minimum of three tours.) The
   objective is to schedule tours to ensure continuity of training. Trainees who do not complete
   the training within 45 days are reviewed by the SQ/CC, who determines their suitability for
   continued training. (T-2) If trainees are retained, the SQ/CC must make recommendations for
   AT. (T-2) Circumstances and AT requirements are documented in the individual’s training
   record. (T-3) Before controlling traffic at night, a minimum of one night OJT tour (for a
   minimum of 2 hours) is required (paragraph A3.5). (T-2) Note: The 560 FTS controllers are
   exempt from night requirements.
   A3.1.2. Complete four daylight tours before accomplishing a night tour. (T-2)
   A3.1.3. Day tours and evaluations must be completed during periods when the status of
   flying permits an overhead pattern. (T-2) The trainee is normally limited to one upgrade tour
   per day. Although highly discouraged, an OG/CC may authorize an additional tour based on
   unique training circumstances. However, do not conduct such a practice on a routine basis.
   A3.1.4. The trainee will receive OJT by actually controlling traffic while under direct
   supervision of an instructor controller. (T-2) The instructor retains responsibility for a safe
   traffic pattern and will take control of the pattern if the trainee does not adequately respond to
   the situation. (T-2) The training program should include provisions to ensure the trainee’s
   familiarity with his or her responsibilities when performing the monitor function.
   A3.1.5. Documentation showing the trainee’s progress must be maintained to ensure
   completion of all syllabus requirements before an evaluation. (T-3)
   A3.1.6. Controllers transferred intracommand will receive sufficient training to ensure their
   familiarity with local operations. (T-2)
   A3.1.7. Additional manning in the RCS during OJT tours will not be used as a substitute for
   normal manning requirements.
A3.2. Orientation. The trainee will:
   A3.2.1. Receive a briefing from the RSUTSO or RSUTO about the controller training
   program and the RSU’s role in the student training environment. (T-3)
   A3.2.2. Study the appropriate publications concerning RSU operations. (T-3)
   A3.2.3. If possible visit the tower and terminal radar facility to observe terminal activities
   and the interface with RSU operations.
A3.3. OJT Tour 1. The trainee is briefed on and observes the crew briefing, RCS and APU
preflight checks, and crew changeover procedures. He or she will practice controlling VFR
traffic.
 38                                                                   AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014

                          STANDARD RSU RADIO TERMINOLOGY

A4.1. Overview. Tables A4.1 through A4.5 contain standard RSU radio terminology. This
terminology is not intended to cover every situation or restrict the use of additional terms. When
communicating with aircrews, RSU controllers are expected to use good judgment and have the
flexibility to use concise, common-sense, directive language appropriate for the situation. They
must use timely, clear, concise, standard terminology that communicates the same meaning to all
AETC crews.

A4.2. Issuing Instructions. When issuing instructions, RSU controllers will normally refer to
the aircraft’s position rather than its call sign. RSU controllers will identify the source of the
transmission when using a guard channel; for example, “Final, go-around, Westwind on guard.”
However, RSU controllers or observers do not normally use terms such as “number one” or
“number two” to identify a pattern position because pilots to whom instructions are issued may
not know their relative position. To prevent confusion between pattern position and formation
position, identify aircraft in formation by call sign.

            TRAFFIC PATTERNS FOR HOME AND AUXILIARY FIELDS

A5.1. T-6 and T-38 Aircraft:
   A5.1.1. The T-6 traffic pattern altitude is normally 1,000 feet AGL. The T-38 traffic pattern
   altitude is normally 1,500 feet AGL.
   A5.1.2. Establish an initial approach of 3 to 5 nautical mile (nm), measured from the runway
   threshold. (T-2) Radar-controlled aircraft may enter the initial from either side if the entry
   point is located outside of VFR traffic.
   A5.1.3. Establish a VFR entry and reentry leg that is entered from a turn from one side only.
   (T-2) Aircraft entering on the VFR entry leg must be wings level on the entry leg at least 1
   nm before entering the pattern or converging with other aircraft and must give way to aircraft
   established in pattern.
   A5.1.4. A common entry leg may be used for both VFR and radar sequence entries if right-
   of-way priorities are established where aircraft converge and provisions are made for aircraft
   forced to give way. Aircraft must be wings level at least 1 nm before converging points and
   must converge at a 45-degree angle in level flight to facilitate clearing.
   A5.1.5. Units will establish pattern right-of-way priorities, breakout, and go-around
   procedures for aircraft that converge onto a common ground track. (T-2) (Note: Units will
   develop local guidance to resolve conflicts between straight-in and final turn aircraft. [T-2])
   An aircraft:
      A5.1.5.1. On a 90- or 45-to-initial that is giving way to aircraft on initial will climb a
      minimum of 500 feet and reenter at the VFR entry point, request radar initial, or fly
      straight through on an offset initial, obtaining spacing and letting down to traffic pattern
      altitude during the turn to outside downwind.
      A5.1.5.2. Giving way on VFR entry leg will climb a minimum of 500 feet and reenter in
      the VFR entry point.
      A5.1.5.3. On a straight-in approach that perceives a conflict with an aircraft turning final
      will discontinue the approach and offset the ground track away from the final turn.
      A5.1.5.4. Breaking out from inside or outside downwind will climb a minimum of 500
      feet and reenter at the VFR entry point or request radar initial.
      A5.1.5.5. Breaking out from low closed downwind will maintain 500 feet below pattern
      altitude and reenter at the VFR entry point or request radar initial.
      A5.1.5.6. Breaking out of the traffic pattern will advise the controlling agency by
      position.
   A5.1.6. Pattern spacing will normally be obtained by adjusting the position of the crosswind
   leg.
   A5.1.7. Radar service may be terminated before actual pattern entry if the approach control
   facility establishes aircraft separation and sequencing before termination point and a
   prescribed ground track and airspeed are flown from termination point to the pattern.
AETCI11-204 8 MAY 2014                                                                         45


   A5.1.8. Weather minimums must ensure that VFR conditions, including required cloud
   clearance and visibility, can be maintained during all portions of the pattern.
   A5.1.9. Units will develop procedures to permit pitchouts and closed patterns opposite the
   normal direction of break at auxiliary fields. (T-2) Establish go-around, breakout, and reentry
   procedures to prevent conflicts. (T-2)
   A5.1.10. Establish runway change procedures to ensure an orderly transition to the new
   pattern. (T-2)
A5.2. T-1 Aircraft:
   A5.2.1. Pattern Altitude. The T-1 traffic pattern and outside downwind altitude is normally
   1,500 feet AGL; the closed pattern altitude is normally 1,000 feet AGL.
   A5.2.2. Initial Approach. Establish an initial approach of 3 to 5 nm miles, measured from
   the runway threshold. (T-2) Radar-controlled aircraft may enter initial from either side if the
   entry point is located outside of VFR traffic.
   A5.2.3. VFR Entry and Reentry. Establish a VFR entry and reentry leg that is entered
   from a turn from one side only. (T-2) Aircraft entering on the VFR entry leg must be wings
   level on the entry leg at least 1 nm before entering the pattern or converging with other
   aircraft and must give way to aircraft established in pattern.
   A5.2.4. Common Entry Leg. A common entry leg may be used for both VFR and radar
   sequence entries if right-of-way priorities are established where aircraft converge and
   provisions are made for aircraft forced to give way. Aircraft must be wings level at least 1
   nm before converging points and must converge at a 45-degree angle in level flight to
   facilitate clearing.
   A5.2.5. Right-of-Way Priorities. Units will establish pattern right-of-way priorities and
   breakout procedures for aircraft that converge onto a common ground track. (T-2) An
   aircraft:
      A5.2.5.1. In the overhead that is giving way to aircraft on final approach will climb 500
      feet and reenter at the VFR entry point.
      A5.2.5.2. In the closed pattern that is giving way to aircraft on final approach will
      maintain pattern altitude and reenter at the VFR entry point.
      A5.2.5.3. That is giving way on VFR entry leg will climb 500 feet and reenter at the
      VFR entry point.
      A5.2.5.4. On a straight-in approach that perceives a conflict with an aircraft turning final
      will discontinue the approach and offset the ground track away from the final turn.
   A5.2.6. Pattern Spacing. The crew will normally obtain pattern spacing by adjusting the
   position of the crosswind leg.
   A5.2.7. Radar Service. Radar service may be terminated before actual pattern entry if the
   approach control facility establishes aircraft separation and sequencing before termination
   point and a prescribed ground track and airspeed are flown from the termination point to the
   pattern.

  A5.2.8. Weather Minimums. Weather minimums must ensure that VFR conditions,
  including required cloud clearance and visibility, are maintained during all portions of the
  pattern.
  A5.2.9. Runway Change Procedures. Units must establish runway change procedures to
  ensure an orderly transition to the new pattern. (T-2)

REDUCED SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION (RSRS) FOR TRAINER-TYPE AIRCRAFT
                         OPERATIONS

A6.1. RSRS Authority. RSRS operations on RSU controlled runways differ slightly from
RSRS operations on tower controlled runways. FAA Order JO 7110.65 and AFI 13-204, Volume
3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs have delegated authority to reduce same
runway separation standards for military aircraft to Major Air Command, Directors of
Operations (MAJCOM/DOs). AFI 13-204, Volume 3 provides guidance for tower controllers
and this AETCI provides guidance for RSU controllers. When applying RSRS, RSU controllers
must be able to determine distance between aircraft using suitable landmarks (i.e., distance
remaining markers, intersections, etc.).
   A6.1.1. Similar Trainer-Type Aircraft Operations:
       A6.1.1.1. Similar trainer-type RSRS may only be applied using alternate runway side
       procedures. Similar trainer-type aircraft are defined as aircraft with the same airframe; for
       example, T-38 to T-38 and T-6 to T-6.
       A6.1.1.2. When alternate runway side procedures are used; similar trainer type RSRS for
       T-6 and T-38 patterns is 3,000 feet or when the preceding aircraft is airborne. When
       alternate runway side procedures are not used, the minimum RSRS is 6,000 feet.
       A6.1.1.3. T-1A aircraft are not authorized to use alternate runway side procedures. T-1A
       to T-1A minimum separation is 6,000 feet or when the preceding aircraft is airborne for
       all type landings.
       A6.1.1.4. The use of alternate runway side procedures is an aircrew responsibility and
       must be addressed in local operating procedures.
       A6.1.1.5. Arrivals. An RSRS of 3,000-feet may be applied between a formation landing
       and a subsequent single aircraft (of a similar type) if both formation aircraft are
       positioned on the cold (exit) side of the runway and the arriving aircraft is landing on the
       hot side of the runway. Ensure 6,000 feet RSRS in front of a formation landing.
       A6.1.1.6. Departures. Prior to launching any departure, ensure a clear hot side of the
       runway. Prior to launching any formation accomplishing a formation takeoff, ensure the
       runway is clear.
       A6.1.1.7. The OG/CC may authorize RSRS during wet runway operations based on local
       surface conditions. Units will document wet runway RSRS procedures in their
       supplement to this instruction.
A6.2. Dissimilar Trainer-Type Aircraft Operations. Minimum separation for dissimilar
trainer-type aircraft is 6,000 feet.
A6.3. Night Operations. During night operations, 6,000 feet is the minimum separation for all
aircraft types.
