3. Procedure to be followed.
       3.1. The procedures set forth in paragraph 3.2. apply to the service of criminal process.
       Paragraph 3.3. applies to the service of civil process.
       3.2. Criminal Process.
              3.2.1. Service by Process Server.
                      3.2.1.1. When a process server enters an installation, he or she should be
                      referred to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). If there is no Judge
                      Advocate or legal officer assigned, the process server should be referred to the
                      installation commander or his or her designee.
                      3.2.1.2. The individual to whom the matter is referred should contact the
                      person sought and advise when and where to meet the process server and that a
                      judge advocate or legal officer is available to give legal advice.
                      3.2.1.3. If the person sought is not immediately available, the process server
                      should be asked to return at a time to be arranged.
                      3.2.1.4. Please note that under arrangements with the U.K. courts, bailiffs may
                      now serve arrest warrants for non-payment of fines.
              3.2.2. Service by Mail.
                      3.2.2.1. When process is received by mail, it should be referred to the Office of
                      the SJA. If there is no Judge Advocate or legal officer, it should be referred to
                      the installation commander or his or her designee.
                      3.2.2.2. The individual to whom the matter is referred should contact the
                      person sought and set a time and place to meet the process server and should
                      inform that person that a judge advocate or legal officer is available to give
                      legal advice.
                      3.2.2.3. The individual to whom the matter is referred should contact the
                      person who mailed the process and advise that the person sought will be
                      available for service at a set place and time; and that no member of the U.S.
                      military can serve such process.
              3.2.3. If possible, service of criminal process should be made at the Office of the SJA
              and in the presence of legal personnel. A copy of the process should be obtained or a
              memorandum of its contents be made. The copy or memorandum should reflect the
              name and location of the court for appearance, the date and time of appearance or
              answer, and the nature of the change.
              3.2.4. After service has been completed, consideration should be given to the
              following matters:
                      3.2.4.1. Notifying the individual’s unit commander, the servicing SJA or legal
                      officer, and other interested persons (for example: Third Air Force – United
                      Kingdom – Judge Advocate (3 AF-UK/JA), Military Personnel Flight (MPF),
                      supervisor, or family).
 3AFI51-711      28 JANUARY 2009                                                                 3


                      3.2.4.2. Placing the individual on international hold. This consideration is
                      particularly important because it has been agreed with British authorities that
                      members of the Visiting Forces involved in criminal offenses will not be
                      allowed to leave the UK prior to the matter being resolved. All problems
                      encountered in implementing this requirement should be referred to 3 AF-
                      UK/JA.
                      3.2.4.3. Analyzing the summons to determine whether U.S. or UK authorities
                      have the primary right to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over the case.
                      3.2.4.4. Appointing a Military Legal Advisor (MLA) in accordance with AFI
                      51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction.
                      3.2.4.5. Appointing a Trial Observer (TO) in accordance with AR 27-50 /
                      SECNAVINST5820.4G / AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces Policies, Procedures
                      and Information.
       3.3. Civil Process. The procedures used when dealing with civil process are the same as those
       followed with respect to criminal process except that the considerations in paragraph 3.2.4.
       will normally not apply. Civil process should be examined to determine if the matter should
       be reported in accordance with AFI 51-301 (for Air Force personnel); or in accordance with
       AR 27-40, Litigation.
4. Restriction. Legal process will not be accepted for service, nor served, by U.S. military personnel.
