                    PYRAMID NOTIFICATION SYSTEM GUIDANCE

1.1. General. This guidance provides a system to expeditiously pass critical information to HQ
AFGSC military and key civilian personnel. Primary method is an expanding telephonic network
(pyramid) to notify either only key personnel or the entire HQ Staff. An alternate procedure is
provided for recall during communications outages. The pyramid notification system may be
activated to implement a general recall, telephone standby, information relay, or a as
communications test of the notification system.
1.2. Responsibilities:
1.2.1. The Commander, AFGSC, will direct activation of the pyramid notification system IAW
established plans.
1.2.2. The AFGSC Vice Commander, when the commander is unavailable, will direct activation
of the pyramid notification system IAW established plans.
1.2.3. Director of Operations (HQ AFGSC/A3), when the AFGSC Commander and Vice
Commander are unavailable, will direct activation of the pyramid notification system IAW
established plans.
1.2.4. The AFGSC Command Center will develop and maintain procedures to notify each
Directorate/Special Staff Agency.
1.2.5. The AFGSC Command Center controller team, when directed by appropriate authority (ref

AFGSC/CCQ is the Headquarters Control Center (HCC) and will perform all accountability and
strength accounting responsibility.
1.2.6. Directorates/Special Staff Agencies.
1.2.6.1. Prepare and maintain an organizational pyramid notification recall roster marked "FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY". A sample format is provided in Figure 1.1. The recall rosters will be
updated as personnel changes occur to maintain the responsiveness of the system. Recall rosters
and changes will be provided to the AFGSC Command Center quarterly and as changes
occur.
1.2.6.1.1. Recall rosters may be e-mailed, provided the rosters are sent from a ".mil" e-mail
address to a ".mil" address, and are sent signed and encrypted. If providing a recall roster via e-
mail:
1.2.6.1.1.1. Ensure the subject line of the e-mail reads (FOUO) Recall Roster.
1.2.6.1.1.2. Include the following statement at the top and bottom of the e-mail text: "This
e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY information which must be protected under
the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332."
1.2.6.2. Appoint a system monitor to maintain currency of the pyramid notification recall rosters.
