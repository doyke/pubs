1. General Provisions:
     1.1. The 374th Airlift Wing (374 AW) encourages and supports the Civil Engineer (CE)
     Self-Help Program as much as possible, within the availability of funds and manpower and
     within the capability of the requester to do the work requested.
     1.2. Self-Help was established as a means for organizations to accomplish minor
     improvements within a facility which would either be unfunded or deferred within the work
     order priority system due to level of work or limited funding/man-hours by CE. The Self-
     Help Center encompasses both the Family Housing (FH) Base-U-Fix-It Store (BUFIS) and
     the Self-Help Program. The consolidation of those functions eliminates duplication of
     material and saves considerable manpower, space, and money to provide better technical
     support, materials, tools, and additional instructions to the requesting organizations. The
     requester has the option to quickly accomplish work through self-help work. Requests for
     self-help work are closely reviewed by 374 CES personnel to ensure the requester has the
     technical ability to complete the work. The Facility Manager (FM) and FH occupant are
     responsible for all work done on real property including self-help. More complex work gets
     detailed reviews before approval to prevent accidents and to determine requester's capability
     to do the work. Customers will be held monetarily liable for any corrective or collateral
     facility work required due to unauthorized work. Self-Help supplies are only used for Yokota
     Air Base installation.
2. Responsibilities Assigned:
     2.1. The Self-Help Program is a base responsibility and to ensure success of the Self-Help
     Program, financial and manpower support from base resources is essential.

3. Self-Help Procedures:
     3.1. Submit self-help work requests to the Self-Help Center, Building 933, on an AF Form
     332 (see paragraph 7). The AF Form 332 must be signed by the squadron commander in
     block 11and coordinated through the FM.
     3.2. Requester will coordinate the AF Form 332 through 374 AW Safety (374 AW/SE), 374
     CES Fire Emergency Services (374 CES/CEF), 374 CES Environmental Element (374
     CES/CEAN) and other organizations as required by the Self-Help Center. If excavation is
     required, four inches (100 mm) or deeper, or walls are to be removed or penetrated, the
     requester must process and have on-hand a approved copy of the AF Form 103, Base Civil
     Engineer Work Clearance Request, at the site. In addition, if excavation is over four feet or
     deeper, coordinate with the Self-Help Program Manager to ensure that a competent craftsman
     is present to comply with OSHA requirements. Appropriate floor plans, sketches, or site
     plans must accompany the AF Form 332. Submit requests with sufficient lead times to
     enable CE to meet the required start date, usually 30 to 90 days. This time will vary
     depending on the complexity of the project and material availability.
     3.3. The project manager and requesting organization commanders are responsible for
     insuring all workers conduct all self-help work request activities in compliance with
     environmental, fire and safety laws and directives. Weekly safety briefings will be conducted
     and documented and each project manager will have on file for each employee an AF Form
     55, Employee Safety and Health Record, covering at the least the items pertaining to the self-
     help job to be performed.
     3.4. Pick up materials by appointment within an agreed time, generally within 7 calendar
     days after notification that the materials are available. If the user organization fails to pick
     up the materials within this time, the work request will be canceled and all materials
     transferred to self-help stock for issue to other customers. The canceled AF Form 332 can be
     reinstated by the requesting organization, but the materials may not be available for issue
     because of issue to another customer.
     3.5. Maintain control of and account for all materials issued.
     3.6. Self-Help materials will not be used to accomplish work by contract.
     3.7. Establish and coordinate work start and completion dates with the self-help monitor.
     3.8. Commence self-help projects only with the prior written approval and coordination of
     CE or Self-Help Center Manager on the AF Form 332.
     3.9. Provide a weekly written report signed by the organization commander that lists the
     name, grade, and hours worked by each individual assigned to the project, for proper cost
     savings accounting and manpower reporting.
     3.10. Accompany the self-help monitor on all in-progress and final inspections.
     3.11. Sign AF Form 327, Base Civil Engineer Work Order, upon completion of the work.
     3.12. Turn in all unused materials and borrowed tools within 2 workdays after the final
     inspection of the work by the self-help monitor.

Note: The Self-Help Center Manager is the approval authority for enforcement of acceptable
finish standards, as set forth by the 374 AW Commander (374 AW/CC).
4. Type of Work Authorized.
   4.1. The Self-Help Program is primarily designed to provide assistance to CE to accomplish
   Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and Minor Construction (MC) work. All work must remain
   within the approved scope for each project. All known MC requirements for a facility,
   whether by self-help or CE efforts, are included in one work request for the purpose of
   approval levels. When MC and M&R are performed at the same time as a combined
   undertaking, MC is treated and processed as a separate work request to decide the
   appropriate cost and approval levels. If M&R work cannot be separately identified from MC,
   all of the work is identified as MC. Work on non-US Air Force-owned or operated facilities
   and FH is excluded from this program.
Note: FM’s are required to have a FM card to check out tools from the Self-Help Center.
   4.2. Minor Maintenance and Repair (M&R). First sergeants, dormitory managers, FMs and
   their alternates, housing occupants and other specified people are allowed to draw materials
   without submitting AF Form 332. These are materials issued across the counter to do minor
   maintenance. Examples are paint, electrical receptacle covers, commode seats, hasps,
   caulking, and tools. In addition to minor maintenance type items, FH provides other items
   such as furnace and air conditioner filters and landscaping items like trees and shrubbery.
   Self-Help Center maintains listings of people authorized to draw items from the center.
Note: Any M&R work that requires penetration of walls will require an AF Form 332 to ensure
no asbestos or lead base paint is present.
       4.2.1. M&R Examples. The following is a list of typical minor M&R tasks which may
       be authorized for accomplishment. The list is not all-inclusive, since the size and
       complexity of jobs will depend upon the capability of the individual self-help donors.
       Some examples are:
          4.2.1.1. Replace ceiling tiles.
          4.2.1.2. Replace clothing hooks.

            4.2.1.15. Do touch-up painting.
            4.2.1.16. Replace broken floor tiles (after area has been cleared of asbestos
            containing materials).
            4.2.1.17. Replace 110V receptacle covers.
            4.2.1.18. Replace 110V switch covers.
            4.2.1.19. As a general rule, no self-help electrical work (wiring, installation of panels
            and outlets, etc.) will be allowed. Personnel will not be authorized to perform
            maintenance on equipment items such as furnaces, boilers, air conditioning system,
            exterior electrical systems, or other utilities, such as gas, fuel, water, and sewer lines.
     4.3. Minor Construction (MC). The Self-Help Center provides materials to support
     organizations that do minor construction self-help work within their capabilities, including
     paneling or fabric covered sheet rock and suspended ceilings, floor tiles, walls, etc. The
     requestor submits an approved AF Form 332 to draw materials for this self-help work.
        4.3.1. In-house support from the Operations Flight may be authorized, e.g., support of
        electrical, plumbing work.
        4.3.2. Self-Help materials must meet Air Force standards.
        4.3.3. Self-Help MC work will not begin until the requester receives an approved AF
        Form 332.
        4.3.4. After self-help work begins, the work will be inspected by a self-help inspector to
        ensure it meets the scope of the approved project and CE work standards. If oil-based
        paint or other hazardous materials are used, the excess hazardous materials must be
        returned to self-help.
Note: Any removal/disturbance of Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) or Lead Base Paint
(LBP) can only be performed by trained/qualified persons, usually specialty contractors.
5. Project Scope and Costs:
     5.1. Self-Help project costs include all materials (self-help or CE) purchased with
     appropriated funds and all CE support. Projects must not be subdivided in order to reduce
     costs for purposes of approval.
     5.2. Changes to the facility layout will require detail sketches, floor plan, utility system
     changes. This will ensure that the changes are reflected in the Real Property records, fire
     evacuation plans & CE as-built records. These changes will be turned in to the CE Real
     Property office to determine in capitalization of the changes are required.
6. Approval of Self-Help Work Requests. All work is approved on an AF Form 332.
     6.1. Approval is based on the expertise available within the requesting organization.
     Modifications to existing plumbing, electrical wiring, heating, and air-conditioning systems

       CE representative has inspected and accepted the modifications to the building.
   6.2. To expedite the approval process, the requesting organization must fill out the Self-Help
   Customer Planning Checklist; available at the Self-Help Center. This checklist is also used
   to ensure the speedy planning and coordination of the requested work. Inclusion of the
   checklist is mandatory when submitting the AF Form 332.
   6.3. Self-Help MC work plans (rough sketch) will be coordinated through 374 CES Natural
   Resources Office (374 CES/CEAN) (Environmental, Bldg 838), Fire Prevention (374
   CES/CEFP) Wing Safety (374 AW/SE) or any other agency that may require coordination on
   CE work support. Any changes to the work plans my require return to coordinating agencies
   before work begins.
   6.4. In order for self-help monitors to provide better assistance and response, each squadron
   will be permitted no more than three in-progress self help work orders at a time. Exceptions
   will be approved by the 374 CES Commander (374 CES/CC).
   6.5. After the request has been reviewed, approved, and signed, it will be assigned a self-
   help work order number and logged into the Work Information Management System. All
   requests submitted are considered Priority 4 (Pri 4) routine work and depending on the scope
   of the work and the materials needed, may require a 30-to-90-day lead time for planning and
   material acquisitions.
   6.6. If the approved request requires CE direct labor support, the work will be scheduled
   based on the scope of the support required, urgency of the need, availability of the materials
   and manpower, and the priority of the work backlogged in the affected CE shops.
   6.7. Upon approval of the request, the requesting organization will ensure sufficient labor
   and expertise are available to complete all work within the approval scope and time frame.
   6.8. 374 CES/CEAN approval of request may be dependent upon availability of sampling
   data for lead, asbestos, or Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). Include floor plans and
   detailed descriptions of building materials that will be affected by the project.
7. Materials. All materials must meet Air Force standards. The material needed to fill the work
order will be issued from store stock or back-ordered through Base Supply. Once the work order
is 100% material completed, the Self-Help Center Project Manager will contact the requesting
organization to set up a material pickup appointment. At this time the requesting organization
will be briefed on their responsibilities covered in the self-help confirmation briefing. The
requesting organization has 90 days to complete the work from the date the material was issued.
8. Removal of Self-Help Work.
   8.1. Self-Help Store personnel will conduct spot inspections at various stages of each self-
   help project. Work outside the scope of the approved work request or work that does not
   conform to good construction practices will be removed by the requesting organization when
   directed by the Self-Help Center Manager.

Figure A3.1. Tool Safety Briefing
                                  TOOL SAFETY BRIEFING
Power tools being issued:



Initial each item:
_____ Know your power tool. If you have not operated a certain power tool before, be fair to
yourself and people working with you by reading the owner’s manual carefully. Learn its
application and limitations and the specific potential hazards peculiar to this tool.
_____ Ground all tools (unless double insulated). If tool is equipped with an approved 3-prong
grounding type plug to fit the proper grounding type receptacle, do not attempt to bypass this
safety feature. The green conductor in the cord is the grounding wire. Never connect the green
wire to a live terminal.
_____ Keep guards in place. Keep them in working order and in proper adjustment and
alignment.
_____ Use recommended accessories. Consult the owner’s manual for recommended
accessories and follow the instructions that accompany the accessories. The improper use of
accessories may cause hazards.
_____ Never use tools to stand on or in any manner that it is not designed for. Serious injury
could occur if a tool is tipped or if a cutting tool is accidentally contacted.
_____ Direction of feed. Feed work into a blade or cutter against the direction of rotation of the
blade or cutter only.
_____ Never leave tool running unattended. Turn power off and don’t leave tool until it comes
to complete stop.
_____ Keep hands away from cutting area.
_____ Keep work area clean. Cluttered areas and benches invite injuries.
_____ Consider work area environment. Don’t expose power tools to rain, nor use power tools
in damp or wet locations; and keep work areas well lit.
_____ Guard against electrical shock. Prevent body contact with grounded surfaces; for
example: pipes, radiators, ranges, refrigerator enclosures.
_____ Keep children away. All visitors should be kept away from work area and do not let
visitor’s contact tools or extensions cords.
_____ Store idle tools. When not in use, tools should be stored in dry, high, or locked-up place,
out of reach of children.
_____ Don’t force tools. It will do the job better and safer at its speed rate.
YOKOTAABPAM32-1098 25 APRIL 2012                                                                15


_____ Use the correct tool. The right tool will do the job better and safer.
_____ Dress properly. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry, as these can be caught in moving
parts; rubber gloves and nonskid footwear are recommended when working outdoors, and wear
protective hair covering to contain long hair.
_____ Use required personnel protective equipment. Ensure that this equipment is clean and
worn properly. If you are not sure what’s required, contact your installation safety office. Do
not wear face shields as a substitute for required safety glasses/goggles. Also use face or dust
mask if cutting operation is dusty. NOTE: Facemask must be fit-tested by BioEnvironmental
prior to use. Some dust masks are obsolete, check with safety or bioenvironmental office for the
most current information.
_____ Don’t abuse cord. Never carry tool by cord or yank it to disconnect from receptacle.
Keep cord from heat, oil, and sharp edges.
_____ Secure work. Use clamps or a vise to hold work. It’s safer than using your hand and it
frees both hands to operate tool.
_____ Don’t overreach. Keep proper footing and balance at all times.
_____ Maintain tools with care. Keep tools sharp and clean for better and safer performance.
Follow instructions for lubricating and changing accessories. Inspect tool cords periodically and
if damaged report to self-help personnel before using the tool! Inspect extension cords
periodically and report any changes to self-help personnel. Keep handles dry, clean and free
from oil and grease.
_____ Disconnect tools. When not in use, before servicing, and when changing accessories,
such as blades, bits, cutters.
_____ Remove adjusting keys and wrenches. Form a habit of checking to see that keys and
adjusting wrenches are removed from tool before turning it on.
______ Avoid unintentional starting. Don’t carry plugged in tool with finger on switch and be
sure switch is off when plugging in.
______ Stay alert. Watch what you are doing; use common sense; and do not operate tool when
you are tired.
______ Check damaged parts. Before further use of the tool, a guard, or other part that is
damaged should be carefully checked to determine that it would operate properly and perform its
intended function. Check for alignment of moving parts, binding of moving pairs, breakage of
parts, mounting and any other conditions that may affect its operation. A guard or other part that
is damaged should be reported to self-help personnel. Do not use tool if switch does not turn it
on and off.
_____ Do not operate portable electric tools near flammable liquids or in gaseous or explosive
atmospheres. Motors in these tools normally spark, and the sparks might ignite fumes.
