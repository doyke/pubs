RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

        By Order of the Commander, AFISRA, this Guidance Memorandum (GM) implements
the policy/guidance for the management of the AFISRA Operational Transition Process (OTP).
OTP is the formal process by which AFISRA/CC accepts delivery of new capabilities or
modifications of fielded systems through a decision defined as Operational Acceptance (OA).
The Operational Acceptance (OA) decision authority for Initial Operational Capability/Full
Operational Capability (IOC/FOC) hereby resides with the AFISRA/CC unless otherwise
delegated. When a program meets the outlined criteria for Wing/Center Authority Declaration,
the applicable Wing/Center Commander will assume the authority for IOC/FOC. This GM will
be effective immediately and applies to all subordinate units and AFISRA-gained Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve units/personnel. Compliance with this Memorandum is
mandatory and will be subject to implementation no later than 120 days following the date of
this memorandum.

        The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified
with a Tier (e.g., T-0A, T-1A, T-2A) number following the compliance statement IAW AFI 33-
360/AFISRA Supplement, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1. Requests for
waivers must be submitted through chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval
authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Maintain
records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication in accordance with
(IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

                              AFISRA Supplement Guidance

The below guidance establishes the AFISRA Operational Transition Process as follows:

1. Operational Transition Process. The Operational Transition Process is the formal process
by which AFISRA/CC accepts delivery of new capabilities or modifications of fielded systems
through a decision defined as Operational Acceptance (OA).

2. Operational Acceptance Plan. The OA Plan is AFISRA’s supplement to the developed
programmatic documentation. The OA Plan will complement, but not duplicate, the direction
outlined in the developed programmatic documentation by providing supplemental data to
support successful operational transition.

3. Operational Acceptance Decision. The OA decision is the point where the OA Approval
Authority accepts or rejects the capabilities or modifications presented.

3.1. The OA Approval Authority. The OA decision is made at the appropriate level based on
determination criteria as established by the AFISRA/CC.

Table 3.1. OA Approval Authority Determination.

  OA Approval Authority                      Programs/Activity

                                                   not exist within the AF and a CONOP,

                                                 Program/system initiated via
                                                   UON/JUON per AFI 63-114
