This instruction implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs. This instruction establishes specific
guidelines for 19 AW, 314 AW, 189 AW, 29 WPS, 34 CTS, and 19 MXG C-130 aircraft
configured with chaff/flare munitions for Airlift Defensive Systems (ADS). These systems use
Hazard Class/Division 1.3 and 1.4 explosives, which require special handling and coordination.
The following procedures must be accomplished to ensure explosives are handled safely and
expeditiously while on LRAFB or at a deployed location. All personnel working around
explosives-loaded aircraft must be trained and familiar with the hazards involved. They will also
ensure explosives operations expose the minimum number of people to the minimum amount of
explosives for a minimum amount of time. References: T.O. 11A-1-33, T.O. 00-25-172, T.O.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a complete revision due to Little Rock AFB conversion from AETC to AMC.
Instructions was renumbered to LRAFBI91-200 allow the LRAFBI91-202 to be realigned with
its parent instruction, AFMAN91-201.
1. Mishap Notification and Emergency Actions
1.1. When a mishap occurs involving explosives, immediately notify Maintenance Operations
Center (MOC), which in turn will notify the Fire Department, Explosive Ordnance Disposal
(EOD), Base Operations, Security Forces, and Wing Weapons Safety. Aircraft involved in a
mishap will be impounded IAW Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, AFI91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and local unit Maintenance Operating Instructions. A designated 19
AW representative will respond to the aircraft mishap scene and refer to the LRAFB Mishap
Response Plan 91-204 to consider implementing the plan for all ground mishaps involving on-
base aircraft containing explosives.
     1.2. If fire is involved:
         1.2.1. All nonessential personnel will be withdrawn to the minimum distance required
         for the greatest munitions hazard present.
         1.2.2. On scene supervisor will notify MOC of the aircraft tail number, location, amount
         of explosives involved, and the fire symbol. MOC will notify Base Operations and the
         Fire Alarm Communications Center.

WARNING
Do not use Halon, carbon dioxide, or water fire extinguishers on or near flares. Breathing
apparatus is required for fire fighting personnel. These extinguishers may be used on
surrounding areas. Attempt to fight fire only if explosives are not directly involved.
2. Procedures for Chaff/Flare Pre-load Checks
     2.1. Chaff & flare mission requirements will be identified in the weekly flying schedule
     using the appropriate configuration code. Changes to the weekly flying schedule requiring
     additional chaff & flare support will require coordination using the AF Form2407. Daily
     ―blue line‖ products adding/removing chaff & flare requirements constitute a change to the
     weekly flying schedule and require AF Form2407 coordination.
     2.2. Production Superintendent will:

      2.2.1. Contact MOC, Load Team, and Munitions Flight (MXMW) no later than 1600 on
      the day prior to the mission to confirm the aircraft tail number, aircraft location, required
      chaff/flare payload requirements, and the required delivery time of loaded magazines to
      the aircraft.
      2.2.2. Coordinate with the load team to start the chaff/flare pre-load checks prior to
      magazine delivery time.
      2.2.3. Coordinate with MXMW and ECM for delivery time.
   2.3. The load team will notify the Production Superintendent when the pre-load checks are
   completed and the aircraft is ready to be loaded.
3. Procedures for Requesting, Transporting, and Uploading/Downloading Chaff/Flare
Modules
   3.1. The entire LRAFB flight line and all aircraft parking locations to include stubs 3-8 on
   Taxiway G Aircraft Parking Apron (Christmas Tree) are authorized for
   uploading/downloading chaff & flare munitions. Delivery times for chaff & flare loaded
   trailers will be coordinated between the affected ECM shop, production superintendent, and
   19 EMS/MXMW. Assess the risks and hazards associated with seasonal weather patterns
   when determining chaff & flare delivery times.
   3.2. Aircraft should normally be refueled before uploading/downloading magazines
   containing chaff/flare munitions. Aircraft refueling is authorized after loaded magazines are
   installed in aircraft but the SAFE status of each mechanical/electrical chaff/flare dispensing
   system must be validated. Hot refueling (refueling with one or more engines running) on
   explosives-loaded aircraft, requires MAJCOM authorization.
   3.3. Explosives will be transported and protected in accordance with AFMAN91-201,
   AFI24-301, Chapter 4, and LRAFBI31-101.
   3.4. Only those people trained, tested, and certified by their unit Weapons Safety
   Representative or VCO may drive vehicles transporting explosives.
   3.5. At the Production Superintendent’s request, MOC will contact MXMW and request
   delivery/pickup of chaff/flare magazines to/from the aircraft.
   3.6. Explosive transport drivers will contact MOC when explosives transportation is started
   and completed and give the amount and type of munitions being loaded.
   3.7. MOC will notify Base Operations, Fire Department, and Security Forces when
   explosives transport is started/completed.      MOC must also ensure Fire Alarm
   Communications Center is made aware of the location of explosives awaiting upload/pickup,
   upload/download operations and explosives-loaded aircraft on the flight line.
   3.8. The loading team, which will consist of a minimum of two qualified technicians, will
   ―secure‖ the immediate area and remain vigilant throughout the upload/download operation
   to ensure nonessential personnel do not come within 50 feet of explosive upload/download
   operations.
