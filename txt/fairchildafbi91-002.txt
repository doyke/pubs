Purpose: This regulation sets forth uniform requirements for the direct and indirect discharge of nondo-
mestic waste into the sanitary sewer collection system serving Fairchild Air Force Base (FAFB). This
applies to all organizations on FAFB to include associate units.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This instruction has been revised to further specify areas and levels of responsibility, types of pretreat-
ment equipment used and locations of equipment.


1. Objective:
   1.1. To prevent the introduction of industrial wastewater into the sanitary sewage collection system
   that would interfere with the operation of the system (i.e. impairs the flow or creates a hazardous envi-
   ronment), and/or exceed the discharge limitations imposed by the City of Spokane Pretreatment Ordi-
   nance #C-30677 (See Attachment 2).

2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. Environmental Protection Committee Chairman:
       2.1.1. Ensure pollutant concentrations in the wastewater leaving the base do not exceed estab-
       lished discharge limitations.

       wastewater system.
   2.2. Organizational Commanders:
2                                                                 FAIRCHILDAFBI91-002 1 MAY 2004


       2.2.1. Identify all sources of nondomestic wastewater discharge within their organization facili-
       ties (92 CES/CEV assistance is available, if requested).
       2.2.2. Reduce the discharge of nondomestic waste by modifying the operational process, where
       feasible (92 CES/CEV assistance is available, if requested).
       2.2.3. Provide protection against accidental discharge of nondomestic waste into the sanitary
       sewer system.
       2.2.4. Ensure maintenance surfaces and floors are kept clean without washing any spilled material
       into floor drains.
       2.2.5. Immediately notify 92 CES/CEOE. Please contact using the following emergency numbers
       247-2302/2303. (of any accidental discharge into the sanitary sewer system.) If unable to contact
       92 CES/CEOE call the FAFB Fire Department.
    2.3. 92 CES/CEO will:
       2.3.1. Install, repair, clean and inspect sewer mains, laterals and lift stations to ensure the efficient
       flow of wastewater to the FAFB point of discharge.
       2.3.2. Operate and maintain pretreatment equipment to assure compliance with discharge require-
       ments.
       2.3.3. Identify and eliminate inflow/infiltration of stormwater and/or groundwater through either
       the initiation of immediate corrective action or development of a project.
       2.3.4. Inspect facilities to ensure compliance with this regulation.
       2.3.5. Maintain records of sewer main/lateral cleaning, repair and replacement, as well as submit-
       ting changes for as-built to be updated when necessary.
    2.4. 92 CES/CEV will:
       2.4.1. Maintain a pretreatment plan as required by City of Spokane Pretreatment Ordinance
       #C-30677.
       2.4.2. Provide a liason to communicate with City of Spokane wastewater treatment personnel
       regarding wastewater discharge issues.
       2.4.3. Review and interpret analysis data for wastewater quality.
       2.4.4. Maintain an inventory on point source discharges within the base boundaries.
       2.4.5. Provide training, as required or requested, on wastewater collection/treatment system
       requirements.
       2.4.6. Report accidental spills of hazardous materials to appropriate authorities according to the
       FAFB HAZMAT Plan.
       2.4.7. Identify federal, state and local regulations/policies applicable to sanitary sewer collection
       system discharge requirements.
    2.5. 92 ADS/SGGB will:
       2.5.1. Sample point and non-point wastewater source discharge as required and/or as requested.
       Submit samples to laboratory for analysis. 92 CES/CEV will interpret results upon completion.

      2.5.2. Provide guidance on occupational safety and health requirements regarding sanitary sewer
      collection system operation and maintenance.

3. Pretreatment Equipment:
   3.1. Oil/water separators are used on FAFB to remove fuels, oils and grease from wastewater streams
   originating in aircraft, vehicle and equipment maintenance facilities and wash racks. A list of separa-
   tor locations is attached (Attachment 3).
      3.1.1. Contractor will inspect separators on a monthly basis to remove any floating product con-
      tained therein. Any recovered product must be recycled.
      3.1.2. Separators shall be cleaned at a minimum of once every two years with most being cleaned
      annually. The wastewater shall be sampled on an annual basis for compliance with the City of
      Spokane wastewater discharge parameters.
   3.2. Grease traps are installed at food service establishments to prevent excessive discharge of grease
   and oil into the wastewater collection and treatment system. A list of grease trap locations is attached
   (Attachment 4).
      3.2.1. Contractor will empty and inspect grease traps on a quarterly frequency. For those estab-
      lishments generating large amounts of grease, the frequency of cleaning shall be increased, as nec-
      essary.
      3.2.2. Contractor will inspect the recycle wash rack at Transportation on a monthly basis. Inspec-
      tion shall include backwashing of multi-media filters, cleaning of cartridge filters, removal of oil/
      grease from clarifier and cleaning/maintenance of equipment, as necessary. The discharge shall be
      sampled on an annual basis to assure compliance with City of Spokane wastewater discharge
      requirements.
      3.2.3. Grit chambers are installed to separate sand, gravel, cinders, food and particles from enter-
      ing the wastewater collection system while maintaining the organic material in the flow for down-
      stream treatment. A list of grit chamber locations is attached (Attachment 5).
      3.2.4. Grit chambers installed on wash racks shall be pumped out on an as-needed basis.
      3.2.5. Manholes and collection lines shall be cleaned and videotaped whenever infrastructure
      damage is suspected or blockage is occurring.

4. Training and Record Keeping
   4.1. Personnel responsible for sewage collection system maintenance shall be properly trained in
   health and safety issues to include confined space entry and atmosphere testing and monitoring.
   4.2. Personnel training shall be documented and maintained on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record.
   4.3. 92 CES/CEO shall be responsible for maintaining records of sewer main/lateral cleaning, repair
   and replacement, as well as submitting changes for as-builts to be updated when necessary.
