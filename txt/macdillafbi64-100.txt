VENDOR LOAN AGREEMENT
Prior to acceptance of any article of equipment, material, or disclosure of information for evaluation or
testing by the Government, the following policy must be understood and agreed to by the individual, firm,
or corporation submitting such article, invention, or disclosure.
_____________________________, hereinafter referred to as the submitter, is authorized to submit the
materials as herein described, and subject to the terms of this agreement.
ARTICLE(S) OR INFORMATION TO BE EVALUATED
(Describe):___________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________
LOCATION OF EVALUATION OR
TEST:_________________________________________________________
DATE(S) AND DURATION OF EVALUATION OR
TEST:___________________________________________
The period of this agreement shall be from _________________ to ____________________unless
sooner terminated by either party. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time after giving notice
to the other party so coordinated action may be taken for removal of article(s) or information.
POLICY
1. The government has a continuing interest in receiving and evaluation voluntary submissions, which
contain new ideas, suggestions, and inventive concepts that are germane to the potential needs of the gov-
ernment. However, the military service has many of its personnel and contractors working on research
and development including modifications of material and its present application; consequently, the sub-
stance of this submission may already be known to Government employees or Government contractors,
may already be in the public domain, or may be available either now or later from sources other than this
submission. Accordingly, it has been found desirable, in receiving voluntary submissions for evaluation,
to exercise such precaution as will preclude misunderstanding by the submitter and prevent such submis-
sions from having any restrictive or limiting effect on the Government's improvement programs.
2. It should be understood that acceptance for test or evaluation for potential usefulness to the Govern-
ment does not apply a promise to pay, a recognition of novelty, originality or uniqueness, or a contractual
relationship such as would render the Government liable to pay for any use of information to which it
would in no way obligate the Government to procure experimental, production, or other quantities of the
article submitted or the item covered by the disclosure. The submitter will not tile any claim against the
Government or otherwise seek compensation for any information or services provided.
3. Due care will be exercised in the handling and testing of voluntary submissions. The Government will
however assume no responsibility or liability to submitters or others for:
a. Damage to, destruction of, or loss of voluntary submissions resulting from testing activities or other-
wise.
b. Damage or injuries due to negligence or other causes which are incurred or suffered by submitters, sub-
mitters’ employees, or invitees during any test of such article or disclosure which is under the control of
MACDILLAFBI64-100 22 JULY 2008                                                                            15


the submitter, his authorized agents, or employees whether or not Government personnel are participating
in the test.
4. The manufacture, transportation, and maintenance of article submitted to the Government for revalua-
tion or testing will be accomplished without cost to the Government.
5. Submitters may furnish instructions to the Government concerning the disposal of voluntary submis-
sions, provided such instructions are furnished prior to completion of the tests or evaluation. Any disposal
in accordance with such instructions prior to the completion of the tests or evaluation, the Government
will dispose of such in accordance with established procedures.
6. The voluntary submissions will be handled in accordance with established Government procedures for
safeguarding such articles or information against unauthorized disclosure. In addition, data forming a part
of or constituting the submission will not be disclosed outside the Government or be duplicated, used, or
disclosed in whole or in part by the Government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal. This
restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in such data if it is obtained
from another source, or is in the public domain. Liability by reason of unauthorized disclosure of the sub-
mission by the Government will under no circumstances extend beyond the actual damage to the submit-
ter caused by acts of the Government and cognizable law. Furthermore, the Government accepts no
liability for failure to safeguard information unless the information consists of a patentable invention,
copyrighted material, or data constituting a trade secret. Proposals, without restrictive markings, received
from educational or nonprofit organizations may be evaluated outside the Government provided that the
evaluators agree in writing not to reproduce, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part, except
for the purpose of evaluation, without the written permission from the submitter.
7. Unsolicited articles or disclosures are submitted and received in accordance with Policy Agreement
notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent conditions on or submitted together with such article or dis-
closures, or orally expressed.
8. Informal information covering the results of evaluations or tests will be furnished to submitters upon
request. Such information shall not be construed as an endorsement by the Government on article or the
subject matter of disclosures nor shall they be used in whole or in part for advertising purposes with
industry or other Government agencies.
9. The terms of the Policy Agreement shall apply to all submitted articles and disclosures. The provisions
of any contract for procurement resulting from these disclosures will supersede this understanding.

             DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR SERVICE CONTRACT ACQUISITION
              (CONTRACT VALUE ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $100K PER YEAR)

A4.1. A complete package, to include as a minimum the following documents and information:
     A4.1.1. A funded AF Form 9 reflecting the estimated cost. Note: For succeeding fiscal year require-
     ments, an unfunded AF Form 9, coordinated with 6 CPTS/FMA and liaison office, is acceptable to ini-
     tiate the acquisition.
     A4.1.2. Performance Work Statements (PWS) are in accordance with AFI 63-124, Performance
     Based Service Acquisition. The QAPC will assist in explaining how to prepare a PWS.
     A4.1.3. Suggested “Bid Schedule” based on historical, projected estimates of work, and market
     research. The bid schedule should reflect the Government Estimate stated on the AF Form 9.
     A4.1.4. Performance Plan outlining the method and frequency of contract surveillance.
     A4.1.5. Nomination letter for Functional Commander/Director (if Commander of functional area
     chooses to delegate authority), and for Primary and Alternate Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP)
     assigned to the project (must be nominated by the Functional Commander/Director).
     A4.1.6. Appendices (which are attached to the PWS). Appendices list such things as government fur-
     nished property/equipment/material; contractor furnished supplies/equipment/material; workload
     estimates, labor hour rates, square footage, etc., or any other data necessary to elicit accurate bids/pro-
     posals.
     A4.1.7. Processed and approved DD 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specification, if
     security clearances are required by the contractor/employees.
     A4.1.8. List (on AF Form 9 or separate letter) anticipated performance period (service contracts are
     written for a period of one year with a maximum of four unilateral one-year option periods available).
     A4.1.9. If not obvious by the nature of the service, list job/discipline categories for which Department
     of Labor wage classifications will be needed.
     A4.1.10. If permits/licenses or other specialized requirements will be necessary, list those in the PWS
     or separate letter.
     A4.1.11. Ozone Depleting Substances Certification (or Waiver) (see page 3).

     the Manpower Office (6 AMW/MO) and the 6th Mission Support Squadron, Civilian Personnel (6
     MSS/DPC), is required before a package will be accepted in 6 CONS.

A4.2. For those requirements that are not considered “recurring services,” AFI 63-124 may not apply.
The following documents would be substituted for those applicable documents discussed above.
     A4.2.1. Statement of Work instead of a PWS.
     A4.2.2. Quality Assurance Inspection Checklist as simple or as complex as the service dictates.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
Solicitation No:
Project Title:
1. As a representative of the requiring activity, I certify that the submitted requirement package for the
aforementioned solicitation complies with the Air Force policy stated below:
SUBPART 5323.8 — OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES (ODS)
5323.804 Contract clauses.
a. Unless a requiring activity obtains a Senior Acquisition Official (SAO) approval in accordance with
AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, Chapter 4, solicitations or contracts may not include
any specification, standard, drawing, or other document that:
(1) Requires the use of a Class I ODS in the manufacture, test, operation, or maintenance of any system,
subsystem, item, component, or process; or
(2) Establishes a test, operation, or maintenance requirement that can only be met by use of a Class I ODS.
b. Requiring activities must provide to the contracting officer either:
(1) A certification that there are no Class I ODS requirements, or
(2) A copy of a SAO approval for each Class I ODS requirement.
c. If the requiring activity does not provide the certification statement, the contracting officer shall include
the clause at 5352.223-9000, Elimination of Use of Class I Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), in solici-
tations and contracts.
2. If there is a change in my requirement after contract award, I shall notify the contracting officer if any
additional Class I ODS have been required in the performance of the eventual contract or will be delivered
as part of the end item(s) or service(s) under the eventual contract.
3. Using Activity Certification:
I have reviewed the requirement, including available technical documentation, and believe that it does not
require the contractor to use Class I ODS identified in Air Force policy, nor is it written so that it can only
be met by the use of a Class I ODS.
