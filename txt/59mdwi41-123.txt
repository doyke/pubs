SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: deleted inpatient services and references to hospital; grouped information for better
flow; and updated references.
1. General. The 59 MDW strives to improve patient outcomes by respecting each patient’s
rights, including but not limited to fair treatment, access to care, informed decision-making,
participation in health care decisions, the right to security, personal privacy and confidentiality,
access to protective services, the right to designate a decision-maker when the patient is unable
to understand and/or communicate their wishes, and the right to refuse participation in health
care that is against the patient’s moral or ethical beliefs. Resolution of conflicts arising out of the
above issues will be handled in accordance with the goals of providing beneficence, non-
malfeasance, justice and autonomy. The 59 MDW provides a uniform standard for admission,
transfer, and discharge of patients that takes into consideration, at least, differing ethical, moral,
religious and socioeconomic beliefs and disregards issues representing a conflict of interest such
as financial gain.
2. Patient Rights and the 59 MDW. The 59 MDW respects patient rights.
     2.1. The 59 MDW will provide care to patients with respect for human dignity and the
     uniqueness of individuals. Care provided will be equal to all others without consideration of
     social or economic status, race, religion, personal attributes, values or personal and cultural
     beliefs, nature of health problems, and preferences.
     2.2. Staff may not refuse care to a patient due to the patient’s race, religion, socioeconomic
     status, gender, or sexual orientation, as this constitutes discrimination.
     2.3. The 59 MDW accommodates the patient’s right to religious and other spiritual services.
3. The 59 MDW has written policies on patient rights.
     3.1. Patients receive instruction on their rights and responsibilities through 59 MDWVA 41-
     107, Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, which is hung in all clinic waiting areas
     and throughout 59 MDW. Additionally, brochures are available in patient care areas but are
     not mandatory. Patients also receive a written copy of the Patient Bill of Rights as well as
     information on advanced directives upon pre-admission with same-day surgery. The Patient
     Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and information on advanced directives is also available
     to patients on the 59 MDW public website (www.whasc.af.mil).
4. The 59 MDW respects the patient’s right to receive information in a manner he or she
understands.
     4.1. Each patient has the right to be informed of and to participate in every aspect of their
     health care. Information will be provided in a manner tailored to the patient’s age, language,
     and ability to understand.
     4.2. Efforts will be made to accommodate patients who cannot see, hear, or understand
     written or spoken English. Assistance and writing materials will be utilized and provided
     when needed. For instance, whiteboards could be used to communicate with patients that
     cannot hear.

   4.3. Translation Services for Various Languages. The Wilford Hall telephone operators,
   information desk (210) 292-7412, 59 MDW Patient Advocate Office, and clinics have the
   number for a translation service to assist with any patient who does not speak English. 59
   MDW uses World Wide Interpreters, who are available 24 hours a day. The company offers
   interpretation for more than 200 languages. All interpreters are medically trained. There is
   no waiting time for language interpretation since it is on the phone. Clinics can call World
   Wide Interpreters at (800) 945-7889 directly. For sign language, Member Services in
   TRICARE uses a designated company. When services are rendered, the invoice is submitted
   to contract services.
      4.3.1. Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf are maintained at the Clinic Entrance’s
      Information Desk and in the Urgent Care Clinic.
   4.4. The 59 MDW may also communicate to the patient’s designated representative, for
   those patients who lack capacity due to medical conditions or due to age (below the age of
   capacity).
5. The 59 MDW respects the patient’s right to participate in decisions about their care,
treatment and services.
   5.1. The 59 MDW promotes patient involvement in all aspects of patient care.
      5.1.1. The 59 MDW provides the patient or their designated representative with
      information about the outcomes of care, treatment, and services that the patient needs in
      order to participate in current and future health care decisions.
      5.1.2. When a patient is unable to make decisions about their care, treatment, and
      services, the 59 MDW involves a designated representative in making these decisions.
      The 59MDWI 44-150, Advanced Directives and End of Life, discusses capacity and the
      means to obtain a designated representative to make decisions on behalf of the patient.
      The 59 MDW follows Texas law regarding determining designated representatives (i.e.
      surrogate decision-makers) for patients.
      5.1.3. Patients or their designated representatives have the right to communicate with
      healthcare providers in confidence, have the confidentiality of their individually
      identifiable healthcare information protected, and to review their records, subject to
      limited exceptions for which there is a clear legal basis. The patient may request an
      amendment and obtain information on disclosures of his or her health information, in
      accordance with law and regulation. Uses and disclosures of protected health
      information shall be governed by the Department of Defense (DoD) 6025.18-R, Privacy
      of Individually Identifiable Health Information in DoD Health Care Programs, and the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. IAW AFI 41-210, TRICARE
      Operations and Patient Administrative Functions, only those with a proper and legitimate
      need to know will have access to patient information.
      5.1.4. When dilemmas arise involving care decisions, an adhoc committee is created by
      Executive Committee of the Medical Staff as needed to oversee ethical issues.
      5.1.5. Patients and family members are directed to clergy members and other support
      departments, when appropriate, to help resolve these conflicts.
4                                                            59MDWI41-123 26 AUGUST 2013


    5.2. Patient families are included in care decisions and resolving dilemmas about care
    decisions when necessary.
       5.2.1. In the case of an incapacitated or minor patient, care decisions are made IAW
       59MDWI 44-150, 59MDWI 44-121, Treatment of Minors; and 59MDWI 51-302,
       Informed Consent/Refusal of Treatment, Diagnostics and Blood or Blood Products.
       Ethical dilemmas are resolved IAW 59MDWI 41-115, Patient Advocate Program, and
       59MDWI 44-133, Plan for the Provision of Patient Care. All other applicable laws and
       regulations apply to these processes.
    5.3. Transfers. Patient transfer to and from the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) is based
    on the patient’s need for services and the MTF’s ability to fill those needs. The patient will
    be informed of alternatives and risks to transfer IAW 59MDWI 41-119, Outpatient Referrals
    and Consultations; and 59MDWI 41-122, Patient Transfers.
       5.3.1. If the MTF is unable to meet the needs of the patient due to a conflict with its
       mission or philosophy, and the patient desires to be transferred to another facility or
       discharged, the MTF will make every effort to coordinate the same IAW Air Force and
       Department of Defense (DoD) Directives.
       5.3.2. Provider-to-Provider Transfer of a Patient. If, for moral, ethical or religious
       reasons, the healthcare provider is unable to treat the patient as the patient or family
       wishes, and it is not medically or legally contraindicated, the patient will be transferred to
       another provider or service. The initial healthcare provider will continue care of the
       patient until the transfer to another provider has been completed.
    5.4. Refusal of Treatment. IAW Department of Defense Instruction 6000.14, DoD Patient
    Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, 59MDWI 41-107, Verification of Eligibility, a patient has
    the right to refuse medical treatment.

       services decisions, the 59 MDW respects the designated representative’s right to refuse
       care, treatment and services on the patient’s behalf, IAW law and regulation.
       5.4.2. The Staff Judge Advocate or Medical Law Consultant (MLC) must be consulted in
       all cases where the patient who is refusing treatment is active duty military or reserves.
           5.4.2.1. If the medical condition or lack of treatment prevents an active duty person
           from remaining worldwide qualified or prevents them from doing their primary duty,
           he or she may meet a medical board and may be medically discharged from the
           service.
    5.5. Sentinel Events. The 59 MDW has a mechanism in place that informs the patient or
    their designated representative about unanticipated outcomes of care, treatment, and services
    that relate to sentinel events considered reviewable by The Accreditation Association for
    Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).
       5.5.1. The provider, or staff member responsible for managing the patient’s care,
       treatment and services, or their designated representative, informs the patient about
       unanticipated outcomes of care, treatment, and services related to sentinel events when
       the patient or their designated representative is not already aware of the occurrence or
       when further discussion is needed.
