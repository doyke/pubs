SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The codes in this
manual are those mandated for use by Air Force weather organizations. This revision updates
the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) code to reference new header format, the 30-hour TAF
process, and the addition of a volcanic ash group reported in the TAF according to observation
and Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) plume model data. This publication also updates all
references to current publications.

                AIR FORCE TERMINAL AERODROME FORECAST CODE

1.1. General. This chapter gives instructions for encoding Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts
(TAFs). Air Force weather organizations specify, amend, and disseminate TAFs in accordance
with AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities and AFMAN 15-129 Volume 1,
Air and Space Weather Operations – Characterization.
     1.1.1. Unless otherwise specified, forecast elements in the main body of the forecast text
     (clouds, weather, wind, etc.) apply to the area within a 5 statute mile (8,000 meters) radius of
     the center of the aerodrome. Specified weather between 5 statute miles (8000 meters) and 10
     statute miles (16 kilometers) of the aerodrome center will be encoded as VC (in the vicinity).
     Do not specify elements outside of the “vicinity” in forecasts.
     1.1.2. Forecast elements represent the expected condition during the forecast period and in
     the forecast area. Times of occurrence or changes (as indicated by YYGGGeGe or
     YYGGgg) represent specific times when conditions are expected to occur.
1.2. Code Format. USAF bases coding practices are derived from the WMO No. 306, Volume
I.1, Part A, Section FM 51, Aerodrome Forecast aligning with practices of the Aviation Routine
Weather Report (METAR) code also found in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
Definitions and coding conventions for construction of w’w’ groups (Table 1.2) are also found in
AFMAN 15-111.
1.3. TAF Encoding.
     1.3.1. TAF Code Format. Use the following format for encoding TAFs:

Figure 1.1. TAF Code Format
MESSAGE HEADING
TAF (AMD) CCCC YYG1G1/YYG2G2 dddff GfmfmKT VVVV w’w’ NsNsNshshshsCC
or VVhshshs or SKC (VAbbbttt) (WShxhxhx/dddfffKT) (6IchihihitL) (5BhBhBhBtL)

ddffGfmf mKT…same as above… (Remarks) TX(M)TFTF/YYGFGFZ
TN(M)TFTF/YYGFGFZ (AMD or COR) YYGGgg (Limited Forecast Service Indicator
[FNXXT/QCYY]).

        1.3.1.1. Make all TAFs valid for a 30-hour forecast period.
        1.3.1.2. Use groups in parentheses only as condition exists or as required.
        1.3.1.3. The     forecast    maximum      (TX(M)TFTF/YYGFGFZ)        and   minimum
        (TN(M)TFTF/YYGFGFZ) temperature groups will be entered on the last line of the TAF
        before the forecast modifier and date/time (e.g., COR 271615, AMD 141232).
     1.3.2. Example TAF. The following is an Air Force weather TAF example for Barksdale
     AFB, LA with explanations and definitions of the code format:

     1.3.4. Specification of Symbolic Letters.
        1.3.4.1. Message Heading (TAF [AMD] CCCC YYG1G1/YYG2G2)— The message
        heading consists of:
            1.3.4.1.1. Message identifier of TAF
            1.3.4.1.2. Modifier for an amended, delayed, or corrected TAF (AMD). Do not use
            the modifier COR in the first line of the body of any TAF. Identify delays or
            corrections to TAFS by including the AMD modifier in the first line of the body of
            the TAF. As necessary, append a correction date and time in the remarks on the last
            line of the TAF.
            1.3.4.1.3. Location identifier (CCCC)
            1.3.4.1.4. Valid Period (YYG1G1/YYG2G2) —The valid period consists of the
            current day of the month (YY) and the 30-hour period of the forecast beginning time
            (G1G1) and ending time (G2G2) in whole hours, except for amended TAFs. All
            times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For TAF groups starting and
            stopping at midnight UTC, use 00 and 24 respectively to indicate the appropriate
            valid times. Amended TAFs are valid from the current hour to the ending hour of the
            original TAF. For example, if the current time is 1640Z, the amended time would be
AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     9


        16Z; if the current time is 2110Z, the amended time would be 21Z. For example,
        amending the 0318/0424Z TAF at 2131Z, the valid period is 0321/0424Z. Indicate
        the exact date time of the amendment in the TAF remarks (See paragraph 1.3.5).
     1.3.4.2. Wind Group (dddffGfmfmKT). Surface wind direction, speed and gusts, if any.
        1.3.4.2.1. Wind direction (ddd)—Forecast true wind direction (from which wind is
        blowing) to the nearest 10 degrees. If direction will vary more than 60 degrees,
        encode the prevailing direction for ddd and append the limits of variability to remarks
        (e.g., WND 270V350). Forecast a prevailing wind direction whenever it can be
        determined. In rare cases, there may be situations when forecasting a prevailing
        direction is not possible. In these situations, encode VRB for ddd.
            1.3.4.2.1.1. When wind will be calm, encode dddff as 00000KT.
            1.3.4.2.1.2. When wind speed will be 6 knots or less and a direction cannot be
            determined, encode dddff as VRBff.
            1.3.4.2.1.3. When wind speed will be more than 6 knots, do not use VRB for ddd
            unless the situation involves air-mass thunderstorm activity during which
            forecasting a prevailing wind direction with confidence is not possible. When it is
            possible to forecast the peak gust direction, but not the prevailing direction,
            encode the wind group as VRBffGfmfmKT and append the probable peak gust
            direction to remarks (e.g., GST DRCTN 250).
        1.3.4.2.2. Wind Speed (ff)—Mean forecast wind speed in whole knots. When speed
        is equal to or greater than 100 knots, use three digits.
        1.3.4.2.3. Gusts (Gfmfm)—Forecast speed or gusts, in whole knots. Encode gusts
        when they will exceed a mean speed (ff) of 10 knots or more. Encode gusts of 100
        knots or more in three digits.
        1.3.4.2.4. KT—Unit indicator for wind speeds in knots.
     1.3.4.3. Visibility Group (VVVV). Forecast prevailing visibility in meters, rounded
     down to the nearest reportable value from Table 1.1. Include weather and/or an
     obscuration (w’w’) whenever visibility is forecast less than 9,999 meters. If visibility
     will alternate frequently from one significant value to another, describe the situation with
     a TEMPO group; do not use variable visibility remarks. NOTE: While a visibility of less
     than 9,999 meters requires a weather and/or obscuration, weather such as precipitation
     does not require a restriction to visibility to be reported in a forecast (i.e., 9999 –RA). In
     this case, the weather is significant because it is occurring, not because it is restricting
     visibility.

            1.3.4.4.1. Construct predominant forecast weather (w’w’) groups by considering
            Table 1.2, columns one to five in sequence. That is intensity/proximity, followed by
            description, followed by precipitation type (two precipitation types can be used in the
            same w’w’ group), obscuration, or other weather phenomena (e.g., +SHRA is heavy
            showers of rain, +TSRAGR is thunderstorms, heavy rain, and hail; -RASN is light
            rain and snow; TS is thunderstorm without precipitation).
               1.3.4.4.1.1. Only one w’w’ group is normally included in any one forecast period
               unless one group will not adequately describe the forecast situation. When more
               than one weather or obscuration condition exists, limit the w’w’ group to three
               groups. When more than three w’w’ groups apply to a situation, select and
               encode the three w’w’ that are most significant to operations.
               1.3.4.4.1.2. When applicable, funnel clouds (FC) and tornadoes (+FC) will take
               precedence over all other w’w’ groups and will always be forecast as at the station
               and not in the vicinity.
               1.3.4.4.2.1. VC may be encoded in combination with thunderstorms (TS),
               showers (SH), fog (FG), blowing snow (BLSN), blowing dust (BLDU), blowing
               sand (BLSA), well-developed dust/sand whirls (PO), sand storm (SS), and dust
12                                                     AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013


            storm (DS). When encoding, place VC before the precipitation, obscuration, or
            other weather phenomena entry without a space between the two (i.e., VCSH,
            VCPO). Do not encode intensity qualifiers with VC. Forecast weather in the
            vicinity will be the last entry in the weather (w’w’) group.
        1.3.4.4.3. When an encoded predominant forecast condition is followed by a change
        group (BECMG or FM) without a w’w’ group, encode the change group w’w’ as
        NSW (no significant weather) to indicate that significant weather is no longer
        expected. This includes weather forecast in the vicinity (e.g., VCSH was included in
        a previous group, and forecasted to end).
        1.3.4.4.4. Forecast Volcanic Ash (VA) as present weather regardless of restrictions to
        visibility when VA is observed and/or the VAAC forecast includes a surfaced-based
        VA plume.
        1.3.4.4.5. Forecast Squall (SQ) when a strong wind characterized by a sudden onset
        in which the wind speed increases at least 16 knots and sustained at 22 knots or more
        for at least one minute.
     1.3.4.5. Cloud and Obscuration Group (NsNsNshshshsCC). Report as often as necessary
     to indicate all forecast cloud layers. Arrange groups in ascending order of cloud bases
     AGL (i.e., lowest base first). Encode SKC to forecast clear skies.
        1.3.4.5.1. Cloud Amount (NsNsNs)—The cloud amount will be given as sky clear
        (SKC = no clouds); few (FEW = trace to 2/8ths); scattered (SCT = 3/8ths to 4/8ths);
        broken (BKN = 5/8ths to 7/8ths); or overcast (OVC = 8/8ths). Follow the three-letter
        abbreviations with the height of the base of the cloud layer (mass) hshshs without a
        space (i.e., FEW100, SCT250). The summation principle applies. This principle
        states that the sky cover at any level is equal to the summation of the sky cover of the
        lowest layer, plus the additional sky cover at all successively higher layers, up to and
        including, the layer being considered. Do not assign a sky cover to a layer less than a
        lower layer (e.g., SCT015 FEW020 should be SCT015 BKN020).
            1.3.4.5.1.1. When the sky will be totally obscured, encode VVhshshs, where VV
            is the indicator and hshshs is the vertical visibility in hundreds of feet.
        1.3.4.5.2. Ceiling Height—A ceiling is the height above the earth’s surface of the
        lowest layer reported as broken or overcast; or the vertical visibility into an indefinite
        ceiling. Consider all layers and obscuring phenomena to be opaque. Therefore, there
        is no need to make a ceiling remark in the TAF.
        1.3.4.5.3. Indefinite Ceiling (VVhshshs)—The vertical visibility measured in feet,
        into a surface-based total obscuration, which hides the entire celestial dome (8/8ths).
        1.3.4.5.4. Surface-Based Partial Obscuration—When forecasting a surface-based
        partial obscuration, encode as FEW000, SCT000, or BKN000 as appropriate to
        indicate a surface-based partial obscuration. Code as a remark the obscuring
        phenomena and the applicable layer. For example, FG SCT000 would indicate the
        w’w’ weather element causing the obscuration is caused by fog and layer amount is
        SCT. Include the amount of partial obscuration in your sky cover summation
        computation. Do not consider surface-based partial obscurations as a ceiling.

         1.3.4.5.5. Variable Sky Condition—If two or more significant sky conditions will
         alternate frequently from one to the other, describe the situation with a TEMPO
         group; do not use variable sky condition remarks.
         1.3.4.5.6. Height of Cloud Base (hshshs)—Forecast the height of the base of each
         sky cover layer in hundreds of feet AGL using the reportable layers defined in Table
         1.3.

Table 1.3. Reportable Cloud Layers
Range of Height Values (feet)                   Reportable Increments (feet)
< 50 feet                                       Round down to 000 feet
> 50 feet but < 5,000 feet                      To the nearest 100 feet
> 5,000 feet but < 10,000 feet                  To the nearest 500 feet
> 10,000 feet                                   To the nearest 1,000 feet
         1.3.4.5.7. Cloud Type (CC)—The only cloud type included in the aerodrome forecast
         is cumulonimbus (CB); when appropriate, the contraction CB follows cloud or
         obscuration height (hshsh) without a space.
             1.3.4.5.7.1. The cloud or obscuration group will include a forecast cloud type of
             cumulonimbus (CB) whenever a thunderstorm is included in the significant
             weather group. This includes forecasts for thunderstorms in the vicinity (i.e.,
             VCTS). The following example shows the use of the CB contraction:

      1.3.4.6. Volcanic Ash (VA) Group (VAbbbttt). Include a VA group in the TAF,
      following the cloud and obscuration group, when US assets fall within the boundaries of
      a VAAC ash-plume forecast. Encode all VA plume forecasts provided by the VAAC in
      TAF coded products. The unit’s VA plume forecast must be horizontally consistent with
      the official VAAC forecast. NOTE: If the responsible VAAC cannot product the volcanic
      ash products, then the 2 WS will be the primary source.
         1.3.4.6.1. VA—The volcanic ash group indicator.
         1.3.4.6.2. bbb—The height of the base of the volcanic ash, encoded in hundreds of
         feet AGL
         1.3.4.6.3. ttt—The height of the top the volcanic ash layer, also encoded in hundreds
         of feet AGL, as forecast by the VAAC.
         1.3.4.6.4. When forecasting VA to be surface based, encode VA as both present
         weather (w’w’) and add a VA group. The following examples show the use of the
         VA group:

          1.3.4.6.6. VA is not surface-based but forecasted in a VAAC ash plume over the
          TAF location. The VAAC forecasted ash plume has a base height of 10,000 feet and
          a plume top of 20,000 feet.
      1.3.4.7. Non-Convective Low-Level Wind Shear Group (WShxhxhx/dddfffKT). Use
      this group only to forecast wind shear not associated with convective activity from the
      surface up to and including 2,000 feet AGL. Wind shear is a potentially hazardous
      problem for aircraft preparing for approach to, or take-off, from aerodromes. Include
      forecasts of non-convective wind shear on an as-needed basis to focus the attention of the
      pilot on existing or expected wind shear problems.
          1.3.4.7.1. Encode non-convective low-level wind shear forecasts in the following
          format:
             1.3.4.7.1.1. WS—Low-level wind shear group indicator.
             1.3.4.7.1.2. hxhxhx—Forecast height of the wind shear in hundreds of feet AGL.
             1.3.4.7.1.3. ddd—Forecast wind direction, in tens of degrees true, above the
             indicated height. Do not use VRB in the non-convective low-level wind shear
             forecast group.
             1.3.4.7.1.4. ff—Forecast wind speed, in knots, of the forecast wind above the
             indicated height.
             1.3.4.7.1.5. KT—Unit indicator for wind speed in knots.
          1.3.4.7.2. Non-convective low-level wind shear forecasts will be included in the
          TAF, when expected, following the cloud forecast and before the altimeter setting
          forecast in the initial forecast period or in a FM or BECMG group. Once included in
          the forecast, the wind shear group remains the prevailing condition until the next FM
          or BECMG group or until the end of the forecast valid period if there are no
          subsequent FM or BECMG groups. Forecasts for non-convective low-level wind
          shear will not be included in TEMPO groups.
          1.3.4.7.3. The following is an example of a TAF containing a non-convective low-
          level wind shear forecast.
AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    15

             1.3.4.7.3.1. In this TAF, non-convective low-level wind shear is forecasted at
             1,500 feet with winds from 120 degrees at 38 knots from 011600Z until the
             beginning of the next FM group at 012130Z.
      1.3.4.8. Icing Group (6IchihihitL). Forecast icing group, used to forecast icing not
      associated with thunderstorms (thunderstorm forecasts imply moderate or greater icing).
      Repeat as necessary to indicate multiple icing layers. Omit when no icing is forecast.
      Format icing groups as:
         1.3.4.8.1. 6—Icing group indicator.
         1.3.4.8.2. Ic—Type of icing (Table 1.5)—When forecasting more than one type of
         icing within the same layer, encode the highest code figure.
         1.3.4.8.3. hihihi—Height of base of forecasted icing layer in hundreds of feet AGL
         (Table 1.4).
         1.3.4.8.4. tL—Icing layer thickness in thousands of feet (Table 1.6). When
         forecasting a layer to be thicker than 9,000 feet, repeat the icing group so that the base
         of the layer expressed by the second group coincides with the top layer given by the
         first group (See Note).
      1.3.4.9. Turbulence group (5BhBhBhBtL). Forecast turbulence group, used only to
      forecast turbulence not associated with a thunderstorm (thunderstorms already imply
      severe or extreme turbulence). Turbulence forecasts apply to category II (CAT II)
      aircraft. Omit when no turbulence is forecasted. Format turbulence groups as:
         1.3.4.9.1. 5—Turbulence group indicator.
         1.3.4.9.2. B—Type and intensity of turbulence (Table 1.7)—When forecasting more
         than one type of turbulence within the same layer, encode the highest code figure.
         1.3.4.9.3. hBhBhB—Height of base of forecasted turbulence layer in hundreds of
         feet AGL (Table 1.4).
         1.3.4.9.4. tL—Thickness of the turbulence layer in thousands of feet (Table 1.6)—
         When forecasting a layer to be thicker than 9,000 feet, repeat the turbulence group so
         that the base of the layer expressed by the second group coincides with the top layer
         given by the first group (See Note). NOTE: Icing and turbulence forecasts are for
         phenomena not associated with thunderstorm activity, from surface to 10,000 feet
         AGL. Forecasters may address the areas above 10,000 feet MSL provided the
         forecast in the TAF is horizontally consistent with turbulence products in the FITL

   1.3.5. TAF Remarks. For weather and obscurations, use the alphabetic abbreviations in
   Table 1.2. Use JO 7340.2C, Federal Aviation Administration Order, Contractions, for all
   others. Relate operationally significant forecast elements to geographical features within the
   aerodrome radius whenever possible (e.g., FG OVR RIVER E), (WND 06010KT AFT
   1219). When applicable add start/end times, without adding a Z, for conditions described in
   remarks (e.g., ―SHRA OMTNS E 1414-1419). The Forecast Maximum and Minimum
   Temperature groups (T [M] TFTF/YYGFGFZ) are the only remarks allowed to append a Z in
   the remarks section. Ensure start/end times are not confused with other numerical values.
   Do not use the terms OCNL, VC, or CB in remarks. Do not use the remarks section as a
   substitute for a BECMG or TEMPO group. Encode remarks in the following order of entry:
      1.3.5.1. Forecast      Maximum          and     Minimum       Temperature    groups
      (T(X)(N)[M]TFTF/YYGFGFZ). This group provides a mechanism to forecast a
      two-digit temperature (TFTF: whole degrees Celsius) in the TAF code for specific
      times. To indicate forecast maximum and minimum temperatures expected to occur at
      the time indicated by GFGFZ, the letter indicator TX for the maximum forecast
      temperature and TN for the minimum forecast temperature shall precede TFTF without a
      space. Organizations encode the forecast maximum (first entry) and minimum
      temperature (last entry) for the first 24-hour period of the TAF. Format temperature
      groups as:
          1.3.5.1.1. TX— Maximum Temperature remark indicator
          1.3.5.1.2. TN— Minimum Temperature remark indicator
          1.3.5.1.3. TFTF—The forecast temperature in whole degrees Celsius (C). Precede
          temperatures between +9°C and -9°C with a zero (0); precede temperatures below
          0°C by the letter M (for minus).
          1.3.5.1.4. YY—The 2 digit day of the month.
          1.3.5.1.5. GFGF—The valid time to the nearest whole hour UTC of the temperature
          forecast.
          1.3.5.1.6. Z—Abbreviation for Zulu, the military time zone associated with UTC.

Figure 1.8. Example of Min/Max Temperature Groups
TX17/0721Z TN08/0812Z — forecast maximum temperature is 17°C at 072100Z and forecast
minimum temperature is 8°C at 081200Z.

TX00/1418Z TNM09/1507Z — forecast maximum temperature is 0°C at 141800Z and
forecast minimum temperature is minus 9°C at 150700Z.

      1.3.5.2. AMD or COR YYGGgg. Append this group to identify an amended TAF
      (AMD) or a corrected TAF (COR). The YYGGgg is the date and time (UTC) the
      amendment or correction was issued (encode without a Z). Issue amendments for the
      entire remaining period of the TAF. When issuing a correction, repeat the entire text (as
      corrected) of the original TAF.
AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  19


         1.3.5.2.1. The AMD and COR indicators can be used individually or together. For
         example, the last entry of a 0112/0212 TAF amended at 011410 would be AMD
         011410. The last entry of a TAF correction issued at 011420 to a TAF amendment
         issued at 011410 would be AMD COR 011420. Note: If AMD, COR, or AMD COR
         are used with the remark LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG, the modifier
         and time will be entered before the remark. Example: AMD 311830 LAST NO
         AMDS AFT 3120 NEXT 0211.
     1.3.5.3. Limited-Duty and Limited METWATCH Remarks. All limited-duty locations
     will coordinate with their supporting CU on all TAF valid times around operational hours
     IAW AFI 15-128 and AFMAN 15-129V1. At location where limited-duty operations are
     in effect (i.e. < 24-hours with no weather personnel on duty), use the following remarks
     with YY being the day of the month UTC and GG is the time to the nearest whole hour
     UTC.
         1.3.5.3.1. LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG—Use this remark when the
         airfield is closed and a TAF is no longer required per coordinated requirements.
         1.3.5.3.2. LIMITED METWATCH YYGG TIL YYGG—Use this remark when an
         airfield is open and no weather personnel are on duty, and an operational automated
         sensor is not in use.
  1.3.6. Change Groups (TTTTT).                 Use BECMG YYGG/YYGeGe, TEMPO
  YYGG/YYGeGe, and FM YYGGgg change groups to indicate changes from the
  predominant forecast condition at some intermediate date and hour time (YYGGgg) or
  during a specified period between hours (YYGG to YYGeGe). TEMPO groups may be used
  to forecast a change in any or all forecast groups and will be followed by a description of all
  the elements (except non- convective low-level wind shear and QNH groups), for which a
  change is forecast to occur intermittently from YYGG to YYGeGe. FM change groups must
  include all encoded elements. Start a new line of text for each change group. Change groups
  that begin or end at midnight UTC will use 00 and 24 respectively to indicate the appropriate
  valid times. Keep changes in forecast change groups operationally significant to airfield
  operations. Avoid overlapping forecast periods in order to avoid confusion and keep the
  intent of the forecast simple
     1.3.6.1. Becoming (BECMG)—The change-indicator group TTTTT YYGG/YYGeGe in
     the form of BECMG YYGG/YYGeGe will be used to indicate a change to forecast
     prevailing conditions expected to occur at either a regular or irregular rate at an
     unspecified time within the period defined by a two-digit date (YY), two-digit change
     beginning time (GG) with a solidus separating a two-digit date (YY) and a two-digit
     ending time (GeGe) in whole hours. The time-period described by a BECMG group will
     usually be for one hour and never exceed two hours. This change to the predominant
     conditions will be followed by a description of all elements for which the change is
     forecast. The forecast conditions encoded after the BECMG YYGG/YYGeGe group are
     those elements expected to prevail from the ending time of this change group (GeGe) to
     the ending time of the forecast period (YYG2G2) and the forecasted conditions must
     occur in less than 30 minutes after the YYGeGe group. When using the BECMG group
     to forecast a change in one or more elements, repeat the entire element(s). For example,
     if the BECMG group was used to forecast a decrease in the ceiling and all other forecast
20                                                     AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013


     layers were expected to remain the same, the entire cloud code group must be repeated,
     not just the ceiling layer.
     1.3.6.2. Temporary (TEMPO)—The change-indicator group TTTTT YYGG/YYGeGe in
     the form of TEMPO YYGG/YYGeGe group will be used to indicate temporary
     fluctuations to the forecast meteorological conditions. Conditions described by the
     TEMPO group must occur once during the specified time-period indicated by the date
     YY and time GG to the date YY and time GeGe, for less than 30 consecutive minutes or
     occur for an aggregate total of less than 30 minutes of every cardinal hour and cover less
     than half of the period indicated by the date YY and time GG to the date YY and time
     GeGe. Exception: Organizations will allow 45 minutes for thunderstorms. The extra 15
     minutes provide for the 15-minute period between the time thunder is last heard and the
     time the thunderstorm is officially ended. If forecast conditions in the TEMPO group last
     more than 30 consecutive minutes or are expected to last more than half of the period
     indicated by the time YYGG to YYGeGe, then the temporary condition will be
     considered to be predominant and entered in the initial forecast period or
     following a FMYYGGgg or BECMG group.
     1.3.6.3. From (FMYYGGgg)—The time indicator YYGGgg in the form of FMYYGGgg
     will be used to indicate the beginning of a self-contained part of the forecast indicated by
     the two-digit date YY and four-digit time GGgg. When the group FMYYGGgg is used,
     all forecast conditions preceding this group are superseded by the conditions forecasted in
     this group. For example, if the TAF period is 1909/2015 and a change is forecast at 1420
     UTC, the entry FM191420 shall be encoded. The elements entered on this line are in
     effect from 191420 UTC to the end of the forecast period, 201500 UTC. While the use
     of a four-digit time in whole hours (e.g., 1600) remains acceptable, a forecast and
     amending events may require a higher time resolution. Use forecast minutes in this case.
     Four-digit resolution will only be used in this FMGGgg group. The forecasted conditions
     must occur in less than 30 minutes from the time specified in the YYGGgg group.

                       PILOT WEATHER REPORT (PIREP) CODE

2.1. General. This chapter contains instructions for encoding pilot weather reports (PIREPs) in
a standard format to facilitate processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of reports of in-
flight weather occurrences. AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air and Space Weather Operations –
Exploitation outlines procedures for requesting, recording, and disseminating PIREPs.
2.2. PIREP Code Definitions.
   2.2.1. PIREP.    A meteorological report specifying atmospheric phenomena that is
   encountered by an aircraft.
   2.2.2. Text Element Indicator (TEI). A two-letter contraction with solidus used in the
   standard PIREP message to identify the elements being reported.
   2.2.3. Navigational Aid (NAVAID). An electronic navigation aid facility, specifically
   limited to Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-Directional Radio Range (VOR), or combined
   VHF Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facilities.
2.3. Encoding PIREPS. Place the appropriate data received from a pilot either in the air or on
the ground, or from a reliable source on the ground, in a standard format for dissemination. Each
report will:
   2.3.1. Identify the type of report and each element in the report by a TEI.
   2.3.2. Include as a minimum, the transmitting organization, entries for message type,
   location, time, flight level, type of aircraft, and at least one other element.
   2.3.3. Describe location with reference to a VHF NAVAID, the four-letter airport identifier
   (KQ and EQ identifiers will not be used), or under certain circumstances as identified in
   paragraph 2.4.2 using latitude/longitude.
   2.3.4. Use only authorized contractions and aircraft designators, listed JO 7350.8T,
   Federal Aviation Administration Order, Location Identifiers, JO 7340.2C, Federal
   Aviation Administration Order, Contractions and authorized four-letter location identifiers.
   Where plain language is called for, authorized contractions and abbreviations should be used.
   However, do not omit essential remarks due to lack of readily available contractions.
   2.3.5. Omit TEIs for unreported or unknown elements other than those in paragraph 2.3.2. If
   one of the required TEIs is unknown, enter "UNKN" for that element.
   2.3.6. Correcting a PIREP. Correct original PIREP by adding 1 minute to the initial Time
   group (/TM_GGgg) and add a remark (e.g., COR 1814) when the correction is transmitted as
   the last entry in the REMARKS section.
2.4. PIREP Code Breakdown.

NOTE: Areas in bold indicate MANDATORY entries, plus one other element.

NOTE: Each TEI is preceded by a solidus (/) and, except for flight level, followed by a space.
The underline symbol (_) is used for illustration purposes only to indicate a required space. In
the individual TEI sections that follow, the information enclosed in parentheses depict the format
of optional entries.

   2.4.1. Message Type. Identifies the type of message reported. Use UUA for urgent or UA
   for routine pilot reports. Use UUA whenever reporting any of the following:
       2.4.1.1. Tornado/waterspout (+FC) or funnel cloud (FC)
       2.4.1.2. Severe icing
       2.4.1.3. Severe or extreme turbulence, including Clear Air Turbulence (CAT)
       2.4.1.4. Widespread dust storm and sand storm
       2.4.1.5. Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS)—This condition exists when the fluctuation in
       airspeed is 10 knots or more.
       2.4.1.6. Hail (GR or GS)
       2.4.1.7. Volcanic eruption and/or ash (VA) when reported by any source, in the air or on
       the ground.
       2.4.1.8. Any condition that, in the judgment of the person entering the PIREP into the
       system, would present an extreme hazard to flight.
   2.4.2. Location (/OV). After the TEI, describe the point at which, or the line along which,
   the reported phenomenon or phenomena occurred by reference to a VHF NAVAID(s), or an
   airport using the four-letter location identifier. Latitude/longitude may be used anywhere in
   the world and reported in degrees and minutes where latitude is reported in four digits
   appended with N or S (North or South) and longitude is reported in five digits appended by E
   or W (East or West) NOTE: Some weather processing systems may drop the leading K, P,
   or H on the location identifier and display only the three-letter identifier. If appropriate,
   follow the identifier by the radial bearing and distance from the NAVAID. Using three digits
   each, indicate the magnetic bearing direction in degrees followed by the distance in nautical
   miles.
       2.4.2.1. FORMAT: /OV_LOC/AIRPORT or NAVAID (RRRDDD) (AIRPORT or
       NAVAID (RRRDDD) or /OV_LLLLN LLLLW (LATITUDE and LONGITUDE).
       2.4.2.2. LOC/AIRPORT or NAVAID is the four-letter location identifier for the airport
       or four-letter identifier for the VHF NAVAID. RRR and DDD are the magnetic bearing
       and distance from the location, respectively. There is no space between location and
       RRRDDD.          There is also no space before or after the hyphen when two

      AIRPORTS/NAVAIDs are reported. When used, latitude and longitude will be recorded
      using degrees and minutes North/South and East/West. Do not use contractions such as
      DURC or statements such as AT TOP OF CLIMB in this field. Add these as Remarks
      (/RM). A further explanation of distance, referencing an airport, may be added in
      remarks, such as MDW 10E. See Table 2.1 for examples of encoding locations.

21 degrees and 39 minutes North latitude and     /OV_2139N_15715W
157 degrees and 15 minutes West longitude
   2.4.3. Time (/TM_GGgg). Enter the UTC time, GGgg, in hours and minutes, as given by the
   pilot, when the reported phenomenon was (or phenomena were) encountered or occurred. If
   a span of time is reported, encode the midpoint; for example, if the report is for 1845Z to
   1935Z, encode the midpoint, 1910Z as 1910.
   2.4.4. Flight Level (/FLHHH (-HHH). Enter the aircraft’s altitude (flight level), HHH, in
   hundreds of feet above mean sea level (MSL) when the phenomenon was or phenomena were
   first encountered, or if the altitude is unknown, enter UNKN. If an aircraft was climbing or
   descending, enter the appropriate contraction (DURC or DURD) in the remarks section.
   Unless stated, all heights are considered MSL (i.e., /RM DURC OVC005-020 AGL, /RM
   DURD MOD TB 010-040 AGL). If the condition encountered was within a layer, enter the
   altitude range of the layer within the appropriate phenomenon TEI or in remarks. There is no
   space between the FL TEI and the altitude. NOTE: It is the responsibility of the Pilot to
   Metro Service (PMSV) operator to distinguish low-level MSL heights, versus low-level
   AGL heights, when gathering data from the pilot.
   2.4.5. Type of Aircraft (/TP_AAAA or /TP_UNKN). If the type of aircraft is unknown,
   enter UNKN; otherwise enter the aircraft type designator (i.e., B2, F35, etc). The proper
   coding of this TEI is critical for the accurate interpretation and utilization of PIREPs, in
   particular those of icing or turbulence. JO 7340.2C, Federal Aviation Administration Order,
   Contractions, Chapter Five, Aircraft Type Designators provides all recognized aircraft
   designators for use in PIREPs as agreed to between the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The type designators are
   limited to four alphanumeric characters.
   2.4.6. Sky Cover (/SK). A PIREP may include the Sky Cover TEI. Enter the sky condition
   followed by heights of bases, and applicable, -TOP followed by the height of the tops. For
 24                                                     AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013


   each layer, enter the heights of clouds in hundreds of feet above mean sea level (MSL) in
   three digits and use the cloud cover contractions SKC, FEW, SCT, BKN, or OVC. If cloud
   cover amounts range between two values, separate the contractions with a hyphen and no
   spaces (e.g., BKN-OVC). Indicate unknown heights by using UNKN. If the pilot reports
   he/she is in clouds, enter OVC, and in remarks enter IMC. When more than one layer is
   reported, separate layers by a solidus (/). NOTE: There are no spaces between cloud cover
   contractions and heights.
      2.4.6.1. FORMAT:    /SK_NsNsNs (-sNsNsNs) hbhbhb (-TOPhththt)/NsNsNs (-
      SNsNsNs) hbhbhb, etc.
      2.4.6.2. NsNsNs is the three-letter contraction for the amount of cloud cover, hbhbhb is
      the height of the base of a layer of clouds in hundreds of feet, and hththt is the height of
      the top of the layer in hundreds of feet and indicated as TOP and the height hththt. Thus,
      the code form for cloud amount, base, and tops becomes NsNsNshbhbhb-TOPhththt.

   2.4.7. Weather (/WX). PIREPs may include flight visibility and/or flight weather in this
   TEI.
      2.4.7.1. Flight Visibility (FV). Flight visibility will be the first entry in the /WX TEI if
      reported by the pilot. Enter it as FV followed immediately (no space) by the two-digit
      visibility value rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole statute mile (SM).
      Append SM to the flight visibility value (e.g., FV03SM) when reported. Use FV99SM to
      enter a report of unrestricted flight visibility. Overseas organizations using metric system
      visibility values will encode in kilometers. Encode unrestricted visibility as FV99.
      2.4.7.2. When rounding the visibility value down becomes operationally significant,
      consider adding a clarifying comment in the Remarks section. For example, a report of
      1/2 SM (above airfield minimums) visibility would be rounded down and reported as
      FV00SM (below minimums); append in remarks the comment IN FLT VIS 1/2 SM.
      Leave out if unknown or not reported.
      2.4.7.3. When entering flight weather into the TEI use one or more of the listed weather
      types in Table 2.2, using the appropriate METAR contraction.

spelled out in the /RM TEI.
2. If the size of hail is known, enter in 1/4 inch increments in the /RM TEI.

         2.4.7.3.1. When combining one or more forms of precipitation, report the dominant
         type first. The proximity qualifier VC (vicinity) may be used in combination only
         with the abbreviations TS, FG, SH, PO, BLDU, BLSA, and BLSN. Indicate
         intensity ( − for light, no qualifier for moderate, and + for heavy) with precipitation
 26                                                     AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013


          types, except ice crystals, snow pellets, and hail, including those associated with a
          thunderstorm and those of a showery nature. Encode tornadoes and waterspouts
          as +FC. Do not ascribe intensity to obscurations of blowing dust, blowing sand, and
          blowing snow. Only ascribe moderate or heavy intensity to dust storms and sand
          storms.
      2.4.7.4. If reported, enter weather layers (i.e., fog, haze, smoke or dust) with the base
      and/or top of the layer, encoded in the same manner as cloud cover in the /SK TEI (e.g.,
      FU002-TOP030). When reporting more than one type of weather phenomenon, report
      the types in the following order: (1) Tornado, Funnel Cloud, or Waterspout, (2)
      Thunderstorm with or without associated precipitation, (3) Weather phenomena in order
      of decreasing predominance (i.e., the most dominant reported first). Use separate groups
      for each type of weather or thunderstorm, and report no more than three groups in one
      PIREP. Coding present weather and the use of qualifiers/descriptors is based on Federal
      Meteorological Handbook 1 (FCM-H1), Surface Weather Observations and Reports.
      Further details are in AFMAN 15-111.
          2.4.7.4.1. FORMAT: /WX_(FVvvSM_)ww(_ww)(_ww). The vv is the two-digit
          flight visibility value and ww is the variable length encoded flight weather.

   2.4.8. Temperature (/TA). If given the outside air temperature, encode it using two digits in
   whole degrees Celsius. Prefix sub-zero temperatures with an M; for example, a temperature
   of –2°C is encoded /TA_M02. If the aircrew reports an uncorrected TA, append the remark,
   /RM TA IS UNCORRECTED. 00°C is a positive number.
      2.4.8.1. FORMAT: /TA_(M)T’T’. T’T’ is the two-digit temperature value in whole
      degrees Celsius.
   2.4.9. Wind Direction and Speed (/WV). If reported, encode the direction which the wind is
   blowing from, in tens of degrees using three digits. A 0 precedes directions less than 100
   degrees. For example, code a wind direction of 90 degrees as 090. Enter the wind speed
   (spot wind) as a two- or three-digit group immediately following the wind direction. Encode
   the speed in whole knots using the hundreds digit (if not zero) and the tens and units digits.
   The wind group always ends with KT to indicate that winds are in knots. Encode speeds of
   less than 10 knots using a leading zero. For example, encode a wind speed of 8 knots as
   08KT. Encode a wind speed of 112 knots as 112KT.

   follows:
      2.4.10.1. Intensity. This is the first element reported after the space following the TEI.
      The reportable intensities are LGT, MOD, SEV, and EXTRM. HVY is not a reportable
      intensity. Enter a range or variations in intensity as two values separated by a hyphen
      (e.g., MOD-SEV). If the pilot specifies no turbulence was encountered, enter NEG in the
      /TB TEI.
      2.4.10.2. Type. May be blank, or enter either CAT or CHOP, if reported by the pilot.
      CAT is Clear Air Turbulence. Encountering this type of turbulence occurs where no
      clouds are present and commonly applied to high-level turbulence associated with wind
      shear, often near the jet stream. CAT intensity may be light, moderate, severe, or
      extreme. CHOP turbulence causes rapid and somewhat rhythmic jolts or bumpiness
      without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude and may be indicated as either light or
      moderate. Never report CHOP as severe or extreme.
      2.4.10.3. Altitude. Enter the reported turbulence altitude only if it differs from the value
      reported in /FL, or when reported as a layer with defined or undefined boundaries. When
      entering a layer, use a hyphen between height values. Enter undefined lower and higher
      boundary limits as BLO or ABV. Use a solidus to separate two or more layers of
      turbulence.
      2.4.10.4. FORMAT: /TB_III (-III)(_CAT or CHOP_)_(hbhbhb-hththt)/III(-III) etc. The
      III is the intensity of the turbulence and CAT or CHOP are the only two entries for type
      of turbulence permitted. The hbhbhb group is the base of the turbulence layer, if defined,
      or BLO or ABV, if undefined; and hththt is the top of a defined layer or the boundary of
      an undefined layer.

      2.4.11.1. Intensity. Enter TRACE, LGT, MOD, SEV, or ranges covering two values
      separated by a hyphen. HVY is not a reportable intensity. If the pilot specifies no icing
      was encountered, enter NEG in the /IC TEI.
      2.4.11.2. Type. Enter the reported icing types: RIME, CLR (Clear), or MXD (Mixed).
          2.4.11.2.1. RIME — Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous freezing
          of small supercooled water droplets.
          2.4.11.2.2. CLR (Clear) — Glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively
          slow freezing of large supercooled water droplets.
          2.4.11.2.3. MXD (Mixed) — A combination of rime and clear icing.
      2.4.11.3. Altitude. Enter the reported icing altitude only if it differs from the value
      reported in /FL, or is reported as a layer with defined or undefined boundaries. When
      entering a layer, use a hyphen between height values. Enter undefined lower and higher
      boundary limits as BLO or ABV. Use a solidus ("/") to separate two or more layers of
      icing.
      2.4.11.4. FORMAT. /IC_III (-III) _ (type) _ (hbhbhb-hththt)/III (-III) _etc. The III is
      the intensity of the icing; type is one of the three listed icing types; hbhbhb is the base of
      the icing layer, if defined, or BLO or ABV, if undefined; and hththt is the top of a defined
      layer or the boundary of an undefined layer.

   2.4.12. Remarks (/RM). Data or phenomena following this TEI are considered significant;
   however, they do not fit in any previously reported TEI or they further define entries reported
   in other TEIs. Enter correction remarks as the last entry. Report the following phenomena
   when encountered by pilots. Enter heights only if they differ from /FL.
      2.4.12.1. Wind Shear. Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS) is indicated by rapid air speed
      fluctuations within 2,000 feet of the earth’s surface. When the fluctuation in airspeed
      is10 knots or more, the report is classified as an urgent (UUA) PIREP. When LLWS is a
      reason for issuing an Urgent PIREP, or whenever it is included as an element in any
      PIREP, enter LLWS as the first remark immediately after the /RM TEI, (i.e., /RM
      LLWS_-15KT_SFC-003_DURC_RY22_JFK. LLWS may be reported as -, +, or +/-,
      depending on the effect of the phenomena on the aircraft. If the location of the LLWS
      encounter is different from the /OV or /FL TEI, then include this information in remarks
      using the same format(s).
      2.4.12.2. FUNNEL CLOUD, TORNADO, and WATERSPOUT. Enter the appropriate
      term followed by the direction of movement, if reported.
      2.4.12.3. Thunderstorm. Enter area coverage descriptions (ISOLD, FEW, SCT, NMRS),
      or if storms are reported in a line, enter description (LN, SCT LN, BKN LN, SLD LN), if
AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               29


     known. Follow the area coverage description with the contraction TS, the location and
     movement of storms, and type of lightning, if known.
     2.4.12.4. Lightning. Enter frequency (OCNL, FRQ, CONS), followed by lightning type
     (e.g., OCNL LTGIC, FRQ LTGCCCA, CONS LTGICCG, FRQ LTGCA) or
     combinations, as reported by the pilot.
     2.4.12.5. Electric Discharge. Enter DISCHARGE followed by altitude if different from
     flight level.
     2.4.12.6. Contrails. Enter CONTRAILS followed by their height if different from the/FL
     height.
     2.4.12.7. Cloud Reports. Report heights of bases and tops encountered in /SK TEI. The
     remarks section is used for clouds that can be seen but were not encountered during
     flight, such as CS W, OVC BLO, SCT-BKN ABV, TS E MOV NE, etc.
     2.4.12.8. Language/Terminology. The pilot may report information in words or phrases
     that are non-standard or cannot be encoded, such as very rough or bumpy. If specified
     phraseology is not adequate, use plain language to enter a description of the phenomena
     as clearly and concisely as possible. Appropriate remarks made by the pilot that do not
     fit in any TEI may also be included in remarks section. Some remarks that fall into this
     category are DURC, DURD, RCA, TOP, TOC, or CONTRAILS.
     2.4.12.9. Volcanic Eruption. Indicate Volcanic Eruption in the remarks section of an
     Urgent PIREP. (Volcanic ash alone is considered weather phenomena and is included in
     /WX TEI.) In a report of volcanic activity, include as much information as possible, such
     as the name of the volcano/mountain, time of observed eruption (if different from /TM
     entry), location, and any ash cloud observed with the direction of the ash cloud
     movement. When receiving a report from anyone other than a pilot in the air or on the
     ground enter aircraft UNKN, flight level UNKN, and indicate in Remarks that the report
     is UNOFFICIAL. If the report is only for the smell of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and no
     volcanic ash, enter VA into the WX section of the PIREP and place in remarks “SO2 NO
     ASH” or “SULFUR SMELL NO ASH”. Treat reports for SO2 and no ash cloud as non-
     urgent PIREPs.
     2.4.12.10. PIREP Source. For further identification of the source of a PIREP, append the
     aircraft identification, call sign, or registration number to the Remarks section.
        2.4.12.10.1. The facility encoding the PIREP may be added to the end of the
        remarks (e.g., ZLA CWSU).
     2.4.12.11. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) / Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)
     PIREPS. Except for unmanned aircraft equipped with specialized meteorological
     sensors, RPA / UAS pilots typically rely on the limited capability of onboard Day TV
     (DTV)/Infrared (IR) sensors and ground control station (GCS) readouts to detect inflight
     weather. As a result, observed weather conditions filtered through the “lenses” of RPA /
     UAS sensors may differ significantly from weather conditions observed by pilots of
     manned aircraft. To ensure accurate interpretation of weather reported by RPA pilots:
        2.4.12.11.1. Only encode objective weather elements (i.e., temperature and wind
        speed/direction) in the main portion of the text element report.

          2.4.12.11.2. Encode subjective weather elements (i.e., sky cover, weather, flight level
          visibility, turbulence, and icing) observed using onboard sensors in the remarks
          section of the report.
          2.4.12.11.3. Precede subjective weather elements encoded in the remarks section of
          the report with an estimated remark followed by the type of sensor used to determine
          subjective weather condition(s) (e.g., “EST DTV” for Day TV, “EST IR” for Infrared
          (IR) sensor, or “EST GCS”).
2.5. PIREP Examples:
   2.5.1. Clear-air Turbulence. At 2200Z, a Boeing 757-200 pilot reports severe clear-air
   turbulence between 35,000 and 39,000 feet over Toledo.

 NOTES:
 1. Do not include data for more than one GMT day in a single message. Repeat lines 4 and 4a as
 often as necessary. Include data for only one flare on a single data line 4 or 4a.
 2. If, a preliminary event-level flare is transmitted in error (e.g., not occurring or not event-level),
 immediately transmit a deletion using the event header (SXXX_ _, where _ _ is the specific
 numeric designator for each site) and the deletion code 4, and attach a short PLAIN message
 stating the event was transmitted in error.
 3. Use line 4a to report other flare maxima (if applicable); use the IBGgg and 7AAAA groups as
 often as necessary, however, use no more than four secondary maxima on a single line 4a. Use
 the data encoded in groups TIBcc GGggL 7AAAA in line 4 to identify the largest, most energetic
 maximum. Use the cc, Flare Characteristics, in the TIBcc group in line 4 to describe the most
 significant maximum. Report a secondary maximum in line 4a in chronological sequence
 irrespective of the time of the largest, most energetic maximum.

NOTES:
1. Do not include data for more than one GMT day in a single message. Repeat lines 4 and 4aas
often as necessary. Include data for only one phenomenon on a single data line 4 or 4a.
2. For filaments which disappear overnight: Report the last time the filament was observed as the
DSF start time, with a time qualifier of s = 3, "Activity started after GGgg"; and the time the
filament was first observed to be absent as the DSF end time, with a time qualifier of e = 2, "Activity
ended before GGgg". Coordination with other observatories to narrow this time period is permitted.
Report the location of the DSF as its position at the time the filament was last visible. As with all
other DALAS messages, the date of the message (DD) must correspond to the activity start time. Do
not use the DALAS code to report overnight DSF if the period between activity start and end
exceeds 24 hours. Instead, report all relevant information about the DSF in a scheduled or
unscheduled PLAIN language message.
3. Report DALAS features equal to or less than 5 degrees in length with only one QXXYY group
located by the centroid. Use up to three QXXYY groups, as needed, to indicate the two end points
and one intermediate point. If more than three QXXYY groups are required to describe a filament,
either report the additional groups in an appended plain language message or divide the filament into
sections and report them in separate DALAS messages.

3.4. Sunspot Code (SPOTS). Use this code to make routine reports of sunspots as observed
with an optical telescope viewing in integrated (white) light. (See Note 1)

Notes:
1. Do not include data for more than one GMT day in a single message. Repeat line 4 as often as
necessary. Include data for only one frequency on a single data line.
2. The pp indicator in line 3 is a safeguard should any of the p values be garbled in lines 4. Repeat
the highest p value assigned to any of the peak fluxes of the FFabp groups as pp in line 3. For
example, if highest p value equals 2, then pp is encoded as 22.
3. If a preliminary event-level burst is transmitted in error (e.g., caused by RFI, not occurring, or
not event-level), immediately transmit a deletion using the event header (SXXX_ _, where _ _ is
the specific numeric designator for each site) and the deletion code 4, and attach a short
PLAIN message stating the event was transmitted in error.
4. This only applies to uncertainty in hours and full minutes. It does not apply to uncertainty in
tenth of minutes.
5. JJ is the same number for each frequency reported that, in the analyst's judgment, gives burst
information associated with the same event. Noise storms on different frequencies will have
separate serial numbers assigned, to facilitate ending the noise storms independently.
6. If a distinctly separate burst is superimposed on a non-impulsive burst, a noise storm, or on the
decaying stage of a large burst, treat it as a separate burst and assign a different burst serial
number.
7. If, for example, the first two significant figures of a flux reading are 52, then a = 5 and b = 2. If
the actual reading is 52 solar flux units (sfu) (1 sfu = 10-22 watt*m^-2*Hz^-1), then p = 1 and abp
=521 (for 5.2 x 101). Similarly, if the actual reading is 5200 sfu, then p = 3, and abp = 523 (for
5.2 x 103). Do not report mean flux for noise storms or fluctuations, instead encode "000". Mean
flux estimates for other types of bursts are required, even during manual operations.
8. When a Castelli-U event occurs, continue to report the maximum peaks for each frequency,
rather than the peaks used in defining the Castelli-U.
9. Do not report bursts of less than 100 sfu unless they are significant and/or contribute to the
understanding of what is occurring. Examples: Gradual Rise and Fall bursts, or bursts that are part
of a spectral group, should be reported even when their peaks are less than 100 sfu.
10. The standard unit of integrated flux is the solar flux unit-second, where 1 sfu-sec equals 10-
22 watt*sec*m-2*Hz-1 or 10-22 joule*m-2*Hz-1. Encode an integrated flux of 564,000 sfu-sec as
75605 (or 95605), which equals 5.6 x 10-17 watt*sec*m-2*Hz-1. Do not report integrated fluxes
for noise storms or fluctuations; reporting these fluxes are optional for other types of bursts during
manual operations, since they can be computed later from the time and mean flux data in the
message. If an integrated flux value is not reported, replace the abpp with ////.

reports of the solar radio spectrum, as measured on a Solar Radio Spectrograph (SRS).

 Notes:
 1. Do not include data for more than one GMT day in a single message. Repeat line 4 as often as
 necessary. Include data for only one spectral burst (sweep) on a single data line.
 2. JJ will be a unique identification number for each spectral burst reported, even if two or more
 sweep types are superimposed in time. Report a superimposed sweep separately from other sweep
 types when it is one or two importance categories higher, or is associated with a discrete frequency
 burst. Assign the sweep serial numbers separately from the discrete frequency burst serial numbers.

4.3. Integrated Solar Radio Flux Code (IFLUX). Use this code to report the background
component of the solar radio flux as measured on discrete (fixed) frequency radiometers at local

Notes:
1. A full data line 4 includes 11111 followed by data for four frequencies. The final data line 4a
of the message will include 11111 and data for one to four frequencies followed by 99999. Include
data for only one "GGgg" time on a single data line 4 or 4a.
2. Transmit a "FFFFF qffff" data group for each operational fixed frequency. If no data are
available for a particular frequency, omit the corresponding "FFFFF qffff" data group. If flux
values are acquired from each antenna sequentially, vice simultaneously, send separate messages
using the applicable "GGgg" times.

 Notes:
 1. Under current polling procedures and software design, there will be data for only one
 ionogram per message (the last hourly or half-hourly ionogram run prior to polling). Therefore,
 3//nn will always be coded as 3//01.
 2. The number of coefficients is variable, depending on the complexity of the true height profile.
 If less than eight coefficients are used for a given layer, the remaining five-character positions are
 filled with solidi (/).
 3. If E, F1, or F2-layer electron density profile data are absent, the whole corresponding line (all
 ten five-character groups) will be filled with solidi (/). In the case where data for all three layers
 are absent, fill Lines 5, 6, and 7 with solidi.

 Notes:
 1. Virtual height is the apparent height of a reflecting layer. It is determined by multiplying the
 round trip travel time of the sounder pulse by one-half the speed of light in a vacuum.
 2. Under current polling procedures and software design, there will be data for only one ionogram
 per message (the last hourly or half-hourly ionogram run prior to polling).
 3. Repeat line 4a as often as is necessary. Send as many frequency-height groups as necessary to
 define the virtual height profile (normally less than 300). The total number of groups sent must
 match the number in line 3.

5.3. Total Electron Content and Scintillation Code (TELSI). This code is used to make
routine or special reports of the equivalent total electron content (TEC) and ionospheric
scintillation (variability) along paths between GPS/NAVSTAR satellites and an automated

 Notes:
 1. For messages sent at 15-minute periods of transmission, report only one 15-minute data set. For
 messages transmitted every 30 minutes, report only two 15-minute data sets (observation intervals).
 Messages transmitted once per hour would contain four 15-minute data sets.
 2. Use lines 5 through 7 only when needed to report data from a constellation of 2, 3, or 4 satellites
 within the field of view of the IMS during the reporting period of the messages.
 3. Repeat lines 4 through 7 for each data set corresponding to a time interval within the message.
 For example, a message transmitted once per hour containing four 15-minute data sets and 4
 satellites within the field of view for the entire period would have 3 lines for each 15- minute
 period for satellite 1 (Lines 4, 4a, 4b), 3 lines for each 15-minute period for satellite 2 (Lines 5, 5a,
 5b), etc. Thus, 3 lines per satellite per period, for 4 satellites, for 4 periods, would equate to 48
 lines.
 4. The Ionospheric Penetration Point (IPP) is defined to be where the ray path between the
 GPS/NAVSTAR satellite and the IMS intersects 350 km altitude (typically in the F-region).
 5. Express latitudes and longitudes to the nearest tenth of a degree. Longitudes run from
 0 to 359.9 degrees west of Greenwich. Latitudes run from -90.0 to +90.0, the sign being
 distinguished by the first coded character (0=positive, 1=negative). Examples: 0675 is 67.5N;
 while 1675 is 67.5S.
 6. If the standard deviation (ddd) is lower by a factor of 10 from the TEC, encode ddd as 0dd
 (which is two significant digits to nearest tenth) in order to raise the exponent by one. For example,
 if TEC equals 25.2 x 1016 and the standard deviation is 31.1 x 1015, then tttddde is
 2520316. If ddd is out of range (too low or high), encode as //9 or //0 respectively.
 7. If the minimum (tytyty) TEC is lower by a factor of 10 from the maximum TEC, encode tytyty
 as 0tyty (which is two significant digits to nearest tenth) in order to raise the exponent by one. For
 example, if TEC (maximum) equals 35.2 x 1016 and TEC (minimum) is 98.1 x 1015, encode
 txtxtxtytytye as 3520986. If TEC (minimum) is two orders of magnitude lower, encode as 00ty to
 raise exponent by two; i.e., 98.1 x 1014 is reported as 009. If TEC minimum is out of range,
 encode as //9.
 8. Locations of the mean Amplitude Scintillation Index (S4) and mean Phase Scintillation Index
 (sigma-sub-delta-phi) are assumed to be at the same location (IPP) as the mean TEC (tttddde) group
 in Line 4.
 9. The maximum S4 measured at 1.6 GHz should be in approximately the same location as the
 maximum S4 at 1.2 GHz.
 10. The maximum spectral strength (TxTxTx) and the minimum slope parameter (PnPnPn) derived
 from the differential carrier phase advances between the two satellite frequencies (1.6

                                      SPECIAL CODES

6.1. Event Code (EVENT). Use this code for rapid reporting of real-time solar and geophysical
events. The activity being reported has a unique identifier depending on the type of data.
NOTE: the EVENT code (not to be confused with an encoded message such as BURST that is
event-level) is transmitted when responding to a REQST from the SpaceWOC. Send an event
code (EVENT) response to all instrument observatories when your observations do not meet
event criteria reported by another site. For example, if Sagamore Hill transmits an event-level
burst of 4000sfu on 245 MHz, and your 245 MHz burst at Kaena Point has reached a maximum
of only 120sfu, then you would transmit a RADNS. If you are not on the sun, respond with a
RADNO. These same guidelines apply to optical (SOON) responses. RSTN and SOON sites on
the sun should respond only once with the appropriate activity condition. The purpose of the
EVENT Code is the rapid exchange of brief event information (or lack of it). The valuable
information needed at the forecast centers is the coded preliminary burst, sweep, flare or DALAS
messages. EVENT coded data should not be sent when the actual messages are available, and
repeated EVENT Code transmissions should be minimized.

 Notes:
 1. RAD (II), SWP(II), FLA(II), LOOP(I), and LIMB(I) may be encoded in any order within a
 single EVENT code message. Repeat these event-type indicator groups in a message to report
 multiple phenomena (e.g., RAD05 RADCU). No more than eight groups may be included in a
 single message.
 2. Do not report a combination of RAD05, RAD11, or RAD55 in the same message. Report
 RAD00 and RADCU regardless of whether RAD05, RAD11, or RAD55 have already been
 reported. Report RAD00 and RADCU only once per burst.
 3. SWP (II) data are not immediately available. Transmit reports as soon as an accurate
 determination of sweep type is made.
 4. To initially report a flare event, an optical-only observatory in automatic mode (computer is
 able to analyze data and generate messages) will transmit a preliminary FLARE code message in
 place of the EVENT code "FLA//" message. Combined optical-radio observatories are not
 required to (but may) include a "FLA//" in an all-sensor EVENT code message under these
 circumstances. Since there is only one flare event threshold (i.e., exceeding 0N), do not transmit
 another "FLA//" message when a flare increases classification (for example, when it goes from a
 1N to a 1B or a 2B). However, an extra FLARE code preliminary message, before the
 mandatory post maximum preliminary, would be appropriate.
 5. Omit the LOOP(I) and/or LIMB(I) group(s) if they do not apply. Report LOOP(I) and
 LIMB(I) only once per event. If a loop prominence event or an energetic limb event is still in
 progress when a new all-sensor EVENT code message must be transmitted for any reason, the
 solar analyst may (depending on the exact circumstances) find it appropriate to append a Plain
 Language Code (PLAIN) (see paragraph 6.3) stating that loops or limb event activity is still in
 progress.
 6. X-ray event messages do not require a response from the observatories.

6.2. Event Acknowledgment Code (AKNOW). This message is generated by the forecast
center to acknowledge receipt of event, SXXX_ _ MANOP, messages and to provide a quality
and system acceptance assessment of the messages.

Notes:
1. Do not combine optical, radio, and geophysical instruments in a single STATS message.
Send each system status in separate messages, using the MANOP headers appropriate to the data type:
AXXX61 for optical, AXXX71 for radio, and SXXX6_ for ionospheric. If old STATS messages are
transmitted (e.g., to update the SpaceWOC, the current status must be retransmitted after sending the
old messages is completed, since it is the last received message that updates the forecast center status
displays.
2. Repeat lines 4 and 4a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one GMT day in
a single message. Data line 4 contains the 11111 and GGggM groups, and a maximum of 7 jEEOI
groups. Data line 4a contains the 22222 group and a maximum of 8 jEEOI groups.
3. At a SOON site the method of observation ("M") may change (from semiautomatic to automatic, or
vice versa) without any system/equipment item changing status. This may occur when light levels
improve in the morning, making automatic operations possible, and again later in the evening when
declining light levels may make automatic operations impossible. In such situations, the analyst must
send a STATS message with a single jEEOI group of 206//. (The
206// group is required for decode purposes at the forecast center, not because the status of the
Hydrogen-alpha system (EE = 06) has changed.) For example, a SOON site opened in semiautomatic
mode; when light levels improve sufficiently to support automatic operations, the analyst would
transmit the following message, even though no systems/equipment changed status:

 Automatic
 STATS

 11111 17401 206// 99999

 4. Report the status of all installed systems/equipment, in numerical order (i.e., // or 01, 02, 03,
 ...), in the first STATS message of the observing day. For SOON, analysts may report 05 (FMQ-
 7, all SOON subsystems) in place of 06 to 09 if these items have the same status, expected
 outage time, and reason for outage. For RSTN, analysts may report 10 (FRR-95, all discrete
 frequency radiometers and SRS) in place of 11 to 88 and 19 if these items have the same status,
 expected outage time, and reason for outage. For example, a SOON site opens with the
 computer, commercial phones, and spectrograph inoperative; site has no Defense Switching
 Network (DSN) capability installed:
AFMAN15-124 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      77

22222 006// 10752 008// 009// 99999
Report outages "by exception"; to do so, first indicate all items are operational, then (in the same
message) indicate the non-operational item(s) using the same time. The above example could be
coded:

Figure 6.7. Example of STATS Message for Equipment Outage
STATS
IIiii 20226 20101
11111 17252 0//// 10192 10442 10752 99999

5. After the first STATS message of the observing day, it is only necessary to report the
systems/equipment that change status during the day. For example, continuing from the example
above, computer repaired, but no other changes:

STATS
IIiii 20226 20101
11111 18301 201// 99999

STATS reportable AWN, DSN, or commercial phone outage is intended to reflect a site-wide
outage in send, receive, or both. The fact that a single phone instrument/line or teletype printer is
out of service is not reportable by STATS. For example, at a dual SOON/RSTN site, if SOON
has no AWN capability, but RSTN does, the outage is not reportable by STATS. At a dual site,
the SOON and RSTN analysts should not both report a site-wide AWN, DSN, or commercial
phone outage. In fact, for a dual site, use only a SOON STATS message (i.e., 11111 or 22222
line entry) to update these three items. The same is not true for computers. It is possible for one
side to have a computer outage and the other side to be in automatic mode, so the SOON and
RSTN computers are treated separately. For this reason, a computer outage that affects both
SOON and RSTN must be reported in both a SOON and a RSTN STATS message.
6. Repeat lines 5 and 5a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one GMT
day in a single message. Data line 5 contains the 33333 and GGggM groups, and a maximum of
seven jFFOI groups. Data line 5a contains the 44444 group and a maximum of eight jFFOI
groups.
7. Repeat lines 6 and 6a as often as necessary, but do not include data for more than one GMT
day in a single message. For example, report status of an ionosonde and an IMS in the same
STATS message using two lines 6. Data line 6 contains the 55555 and GGggM groups, and a
maximum of seven jHHOI groups. Data line 6a contains the 66666 group and a maximum of
eight jHHOI groups.
