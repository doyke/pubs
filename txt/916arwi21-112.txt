1. General.
   1.1. This chapter establishes responsibilities and procedures for maintaining Thermal
   Radiation Barrier Curtains which falls under the Flash Blindness Protective Maintenance
   Program. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that aircraft thermal curtains are ready for
   Emergency War Order (EWO) and Alert contingencies on a day-to-day basis.
2. Thermal Curtains.
   2.1. The thermal curtains are fabricated of fiberglass fabric with an aluminum face, silicone
   rubber back, and fastened to a metal frame.
   2.2. Thermal radiation from a nuclear blast will burn through the curtain material wherever
   the aluminum is soiled.
 2                                                              916ARWI21-112 21 JUNE 2011


     2.3. To assure aircrew survivability from thermal radiation it is imperative that curtains are
     handled only by qualified personnel.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. It is the responsibility of Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and Aircraft Maintenance
     Squadron (AMXS) Superintendents to ensure that the contents of this chapter are rigidly
     enforced.
4. Procedures.
     4.1. The Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) appoints a Maintenance Group
     Monitor for the Flash Blindness Protective Device Maintenance Program. This ensures an
     effective aircraft thermal protective device inspection and maintenance program is set up and
     followed.
     4.2. The Maintenance Group Monitor ensures:
        4.2.1. An adequate and effective training program is established for all crew chiefs in Air
        Force Specialty Code (AFSC), (2A5X1) and ground personnel, who are required to
        handle thermal curtains during aircraft generation, recover, and alert. Thermal curtains
        will only be handled with lint free cotton gloves and inspected with applicable technical
        orders and instructions.
        4.2.2. Aircraft thermal radiation barrier curtains and associated hardware are maintained
        in accordance with TO 1C-135(K)R-2-2GA-1, AFI 21-101, AFRC Supplement and
        requirements of this operating instruction.
        4.2.3. A complete set of condemned thermal curtains are maintained and marked, ―For
        Training Only‖, to allow installation practice for maintenance and aircrew members.
        NOTE: A pair of clean gloves is kept in the cockpit curtain storage container for use
        when installing and removing curtains. Curtains must be handled as little as possible and
        then, only by their edges and non-reflective slides.
        4.2.4. A pre-alert/EWO/Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) generation inspection of
        all aircraft thermal protective devices and associated hardware is conducted by qualified
        ground air crewman, AFSC – (2A5X1) to ensure proper fit of installed curtains and to
        detect obvious defects.
            4.2.4.1. This inspection is documented in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
            Discrepancy and Work Document, with the following note: ―Thermal Curtain/
            Radiation Barrier Installation required.‖
            4.2.4.2. Upon certification acceptance, the ground crew man signs the ―corrected by‖
            Block of the AFTO Form 781A entry and the aircraft commander signs the
            ―inspected by‖ block.
            4.2.4.3. Upon termination of exercise, a qualified crew chief will remove the
            curtains, place them in containers and transport them to the AFE section where an
            AFE technician will inspect the curtains and reseal the containers.
            4.2.4.4. During Isochronal Inspection (ISO), crew chief or ISO personnel will
            remove curtains and route them to AFE for a complete inspection.

        4.2.4.5. Anytime any question arises as to the serviceability of the curtains,
        Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) is notified and they will request an AFE
        technician to determine serviceability.
        4.2.4.6. The AFE Superintendent appoints an AFE technician to monitor and
        maintain surveillance over the Thermal Radiation Barrier Curtains.
           4.2.4.6.1. The AFE monitor ensures:
           4.2.4.6.2. Aircraft thermal radiation barrier curtains and associated hardware are
           maintained in accordance with TO 1C-135(K)R-2-2GA-1, AFI 21-101, AFRC
           Supplement and requirements of this operating instruction.
           4.2.4.6.3. All AFE technicians are trained and task qualified to inspect, and repair
           thermal protective devices.
           4.2.4.6.4. That a serviceable 200 to 500 watt, 110-volt light box is maintained for
           inspection of thermal curtains.
           4.2.4.6.5. After alert tours or generation exercises, a qualified AFE technician
           validates serviceability of all thermal protection devices and seals containers.
           4.2.4.6.6. The containers, which remained sealed, are not re-inspected.
           4.2.4.6.7. All devices are removed and sealed in an appropriate storage container
           when applicable. APG section is responsible for removing thermal curtains. This
           is not a function of the AFE section.
           4.2.4.6.8. Lead seal crimping tools are modified to reflect the 916 ARW code
           identifier (916).
           4.2.4.6.9. The AFE Section and Sortie Support will maintain control and
           accountability of the identifier crimping tools.
           4.2.4.6.10. During equipment inventory of the curtains in accordance with TO
           1C-135-21 and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization
           Reporting, a qualified Sortie Support Technician will physically open all thermal
           curtain containers and verify accountability of all thermal curtains inside. Upon
           completion, the Sortie Support Technician will reseal the container using the lead
           seal-crimping tool.
           4.2.4.6.11. During an equipment inventory on AF Form 4076, for aircraft that
           remain within the Continental United States (CONUS), verification of the lead
           seal with the 916 identifier is all that is required. The AF Form 4076, Aircraft
           Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, will be annotated by having the word ―SEALED‖
           by each container checked and a line drawn down through the contents.
