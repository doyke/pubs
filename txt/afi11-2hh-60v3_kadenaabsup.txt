8.2.1. Introduction. Section 8.2 of this supplement provides procedural guidance, general
information, and training restrictions pertinent to helicopter operations at Kadena AB and off
station. This supplement is not a single source document and must be used in conjunction with
18th Wing Instruction (18 WGI) 13-204, Airfield Operations Instruction, MCAS Futenma
Airfield Operations Manual; USMC Base Order P3500.1B, SOP for CTA; and AFI 13-212,
Kadena AB Supplement (AFI13-212_KADENAABSUP), Range Planning and Operations.
8.2.2. General Policy. All aircrew, whether at home station or deployed, will operate within AFI
11-202, Volume 3, AFI 11-2HH-60, Volume 3, and all general published guidance with a
particular sensitivity to host-nation requirements and restrictions. Any conflicts will be
identified and elevated to the appropriate commander prior to mission prosecution unless safety-
of-flight or a life-saving operational necessity dictates otherwise.
8.2.3. Mission Planning.
8.2.3.1. (Added) Preparation. All aircrew must be familiar with 18 WGI 13-204, Airfield
Operations Instruction, MCAS Futenma Airfield Operations Manual, BO P3500.1B, SOP for
CTA, and AFI 13-212, Kadena AB Supplement, prior to participating in flight operations.
8.2.3.2. (Added) Operational Risk Management (ORM). The 33 RQS ORM worksheet should
be completed prior to the Aircrew Briefing. The sheet will be completed, approved and briefed
to the crew prior to flight.
8.2.3.3. (Added) Mission Folders. Flight authorizations, weight and balance, currency products,
ORM, and passenger manifests will be placed in the flight folder prior to the flight. The
Operations Supervisor and Aircraft Commander (AC) are responsible to confirm the aircrew
go/no-go status to include monthly boldface, Flight Crew Information Files, Duties Not to
Involve Flying (DNIF), and ground/flight currency. After the flight, the AC will ensure all
copies of the flight documents are placed in the flight folder and turned in to the Operations Duty
Officer (ODO). Crews will follow USAF HH-60G Combat Rescue Forces Standard Operating
Procedures, Chapter 4.
8.2.3.4. (Added) Low-Level Surveys. Master CHUM maps will consist of a 1:250,000 map
[Joint Operations Graphic (JOG)] of the Okinawa area and 1:50,000 maps of the Northern
Training Area (NTA) and Central Training Area (CTA). Master CHUM maps will be
maintained in the flight planning room and posted monthly by Weapons and Tactics (DOW) with
CHUM updates. Aircrews will only use low-level training maps that have current and annotated
CHUM information. Aircrews will post newly identified hazards on the map immediately after
the flight and notify the squadron Safety Officer. Low-Level flight training is authorized in the
NTA, CTA, Ukibaru, -174, W-176, W-178 and all over water areas. DOW will ensure that the
CHUM and hazard overlays for the Falcon View/Combat Flight Planning Systems are posted.
8.2.3.5. (Added) Preflight. Scheduled aircraft should be crew ready not later than 2 hours prior
to scheduled takeoff. FEs should not begin a preflight inspection until the aircraft is crew ready
AFI11-2HH-60V3_KADENAABSUP 29 JUNE 2011                                                              3


(includes scheduled munitions configuration and forms at aircraft) unless approved by the Ops
Supervisor. Ops (ODO/aircrew) should request a power cart be available for use during the
preflight and run-up.
8.2.3.6. (Added) Cross-Country Flights. Submit cross-country plan to Wing Scheduling (18
OSS/OSOS), not later than 3 weeks prior to the planned departure date. At non-DoD airfields,
all ground handling and servicing will be conducted or supervised by a 33 RQS FE, AG or crew
chief.
8.2.4. Normal Operations.
8.2.4.1. (Added) Hot Refueling. Hot refueling is available at Kadena AB or Futenma MCAS.
Prior coordination is required for both locations. If a scheduled hot refueling is canceled for any
reason, the aircraft commander will ensure the ODO is notified to cancel the refueling request.
All personnel not directly involved in the refueling or receiving training will exit the aircraft and
remain clear until the aircraft clears the refueling zone.
8.2.4.1.1. (Added) Kadena AB. Prior coordination is required to perform hot refuel operations
at Kadena AB. Coordination flow is as follows: Scheduling will email the Maintenance
Operations Control Center (MOCC) and Petroleum/Oils/Lubricants (POL) office with A/C tail
number and desired hot refuel time not later than 24 hours prior. On the scheduled hot refuel day
the ODO will call the MOCC at 634-4139 not later than 2 hours prior to the scheduled refuel
time. Any changes to the scheduled hot refuel time will be coordinated with POL not later than
2 hours prior to the previously scheduled time or the new request time, whichever is earlier.
POL phone number is 634-3773. Hot refuel can be conducted either single ship or two ship on
Papa 3 on the Papa Row. Upon turning into Papa 5, the crew will follow the yellow taxi line to
the refuel spot. A marshaller is required to taxi the aircraft onto the refuel spot. Once in position
the Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) and fire guard will extend the refueling hose and position
the fire bottles as required.
8.2.4.1.2. (Added) Futenma MCAS. Prior Permission Required (PPR) is desired (but not
required during normal duty hours) for hot gas and may be obtained by calling Hot Gas
operations desk at DSN 636-3248/3412. Fuel pits are normally open Monday through Friday
0700L to 2300L. Coordinate with the Air Operations Officer at 636-3066 for refueling outside
normal duty hours. Plan on landing in the vicinity of taxiway D/Helo Spot ―3‖ or as directed by
Futenma Tower. Contact ground for taxi into the pits. The pilot on the controls will wait until a
marshaller is in position and ready to direct the aircraft prior to taxiing forward into the fuel pits.
8.2.4.2. (Added) Personnel Airdrop Deployments. Drop zones [Ie Shima (W-178), Ourawan
DZ, Ridout DZ (Kadena) and Tsuken DZ] will be scheduled in advance and a Notice to Airman
(NOTAM) will be posted.
8.2.4.2.1. (Added) When performing personnel deployments at Ie Shima, a boat or a hoist
equipped helicopter with a Day Water Operations (DWO)/ Night Water Operations (NWO)
qualified crew (appropriate for the time of day) will be immediately available in order to recover
off-DZ drops.
8.2.4.3. (Added) Pyrotechnic devices will not be used for land operations unless specific
approval is obtained from the controlling agency.
8.2.4.4. (Added) Flight Following.

8.2.4.4.1. (Added) Crews will pass an ―Operations Normal‖ and position report every 30
minutes (if on alert) or 1 hour (if non-alert or air refueling) to Jolly Operations for flight
following. Line of sight communications (LARS/VHF) should be used to the maximum extent
possible. If direct contact is not possible, and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) is not
available, calls should be made to the nearest agency for relay to Jolly Operations. If the aircrew
expects to be off radios for more than 30 minutes (i.e., shutdown or extended ground operations)
pass the expected time for continued communications to the flight following agency. Alert
crews may pre-coordinate airborne contact times in excess of 30 minutes with the ODO, but in
no case will time between calls exceed 60 minutes. Calls ―in the blind‖ do not constitute an Ops
Normal call. Crews should pass Operations Normal report every 1 hour during Cross Country
flights. AC will call at each intermediate stop and upon arrival at final destination.
8.2.4.4.2. (Added) Approximately 10 minutes prior to landing at home station, chalk 2 will pass
flight lead their aircraft’s alpha status and flight lead will pass the flight status to Jolly Ops.
Aircrews will provide applicable information to the ODO (i.e., estimated time of arrival, alpha
status, request for maintenance specialists); the ODO will pass info to the maintenance
production supervisor.
8.2.4.5. (Added) Simulated EP’s. With appropriately qualified crews, simulated EPs may be
conducted at all approved LZs with a current survey. Exception: Auto rotations, Roll-On
landings and practice single-engine maneuvers with a throttle dragged must terminate to a paved
runway/taxiway or the W-178 runway.
8.2.5. Instrument Procedures. Due to the limited availability of suitable alternate airfields and
their close proximity to Kadena AB, aircrews must pay particular attention to weather conditions
and alternate airfield requirements prior to accepting an IFR clearance.
8.2.6. Combat Rescue Operations.
8.2.6.1. Weapons Employment. The primary weapons employment ranges are W-173, W-174
and W-176. Refer to AFI 13-212, Kadena AB Supplement, and Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume
6, for range-specific procedures. During night or marginal weather gunnery training, aircraft
commanders will pay particular attention to the hazards of over water weapons pattern
maneuvering and potential for target fixation and/or inadvertent descents. Fixed-forward firing
is not authorized without CC/DO approval.
8.2.6.1.1. (Added) Live Ammunition. Weapons will be armed only after the range is cleared
and clearance is given by the aircraft commander. When weapons are not being fired and the
pattern puts the gunner on the opposite side of the target, weapons will be pointed in a safe
direction.
8.2.6.1.2. (Added) Blank Ammunition. Weapons will not be armed with blanks until the aircraft
is in the CTA, NTA, Ukibaru or over water. Blank ammunition will not be fired in the
immediate vicinity of any boats, vehicles, civilian populous or non-participating military
personnel. Blank ammunition will not be fired at participating military personnel (i.e.,
aggressors during CSAR training) when they are within 100 feet of the weapon.
8.2.6.1.3. (Added) Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention. Following gunnery training
(both live and blank), the aircrew will pause at their next landing for a visual inspection and a
general cabin look-over to remove any possible FOD hazard. During taxi the crew should close
the cargo doors to prevent FOD. After shutdown, use all available light sources to visually
AFI11-2HH-60V3_KADENAABSUP 29 JUNE 2011                                                             5


inspect the entire aircraft and the surrounding ramp area. Crews should pay particular attention
to the landing gear strut and brake/wheel areas of the aircraft. If required to land on the runway,
the crews should close the cabin doors prior to commencing the approach. Terminate the
approach in a hover abeam the desired landing pad, hover taxi to the pad and accomplish FOD
inspection.
8.2.6.2. (Added) Chaff/Flare Employment. Aircraft with chaff and flare should be self tested on
the ground to verify payload count and mag IDs. Chaff and flares will only be expended at an
approved range. Aircrews will inspect for hung flares following flare operations at the next
landing site. If this inspection is conducted at Kadena AB, land adjacent to Pad 1 or 2, taxi onto
Pad 1or 2 and visually inspect for hung flares. When flying outside an approved range, the
system will be entirely disabled and safed by selecting MODE – OFF on the CMDS and by
inserting the Chaff/Flare Safety Pins. Aircraft configured without Chaff and/or Flares are
authorized flights with the ALE-47 in Training Mode.
8.2.6.3. (Added) Water Operations Training. Authorized training areas are depicted in the
Shogun In-Flight Guide and graphically depicted in [NO LABEL MAPPING for
"Attachment"! 3 of this supplement. Limit expendables used to sea dye and chem lights only,
unless a boat and Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) personnel are available for pyro
recovery. Pyrotechnic smokes may be used in W-173, W-174, W-176, and North and South
water training areas without recovery.
8.2.6.3.1. (Added) Open-Ocean (non-protected water areas) live training must be approved by
33 RQS/DO or Operations Supervisor. For the purposes of this paragraph all areas other than
Tsuken Jima, Ourawan DZ (Bay), and Ukibaru are considered unprotected.
8.2.6.3.2. (Added) Helicopter Cover-Ship Requirements and Safety Considerations. Cover-
Ships will maintain constant line-of-sight communications with the deploying helicopter at all
times and remain within 10 NM. Each aircrew will pass their operating location to the other.
Aircraft should maintain A/A TACAN DME with each other. When using the ―cover ship
capable of deploying PJs and/or a life raft‖ option, the cover ship crew must be mission qualified
for low-level flight (raft deployment) and will carry a second life raft for deployment.
8.2.6.3.3. (Added) Cover (Safety) Boat Procedures. The boat party and helicopter will maintain
positive visual contact at all times and minimize the distance to the deploying team to ensure
prompt response. In addition to visual contact, night water operations require positive radio
contact. Aircrew will positively identify the boat party with pre-briefed signals (strobe lights,
chem lights, flashlights, etc.). The boat party will ensure the specific training area is clear of all
water hazards and direct changes as necessary. During live deployments, the aircrew will
conduct operations/deployments in such proximity to the boat party as to allow visual monitoring
of deployed personnel and adequate response time.
8.2.6.4. (Added) Air Refueling. The primary air refueling tracks are defined in the Shogun In-
Flight Guide and graphically depicted in [NO LABEL MAPPING for "Attachment"! 3 of this
supplement. Other over water tracks can be arranged between tanker and receiver provided no
restrictions exist in the areas chosen. Ensure the ODO is informed which are to be used.
8.2.6.5. (Added) Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIE) Operations. Day/Night AIE training
(live or simulated) is authorized at any of the training sites listed in the FCIF Site Book and this
publication, to include tower-approved locations on Kadena AB or Futenma MCAS. Live

Operating Procedures.
8.2.9. Other Procedures.
8.2.9.1. Filing flight plans. All 33 RQS local flights will have a flight plan on file and signed.
The ODO will fax the flight plan to base operations prior to crew step. IFR flight plans (and
VFR flight plans outside the local area) must be filed in person at base operations. Rescue
missions will use ―Air Force Rescue‖ and the last 3 digits of the tail number. Functional Check
Flights (FCF) will use the designated ―Test‖ call sign. All scheduled flights will have a posted
call sign.
8.2.9.2. Taxi/parking procedures. Aircraft will normally be parked in the Valley. FCF aircraft
are normally parked on Papa 1C unless there is sufficient room in the Valley. Papa 1C is within
a restricted area and personnel must use the entry control point for access. Ground Control must
be called for engine start as well as taxi clearance beyond the Throat. The pilot on the controls
will signal the marshaller with a flash of the landing light when ready to taxi out of parking.
Hover checks are normally conducted on the Throat but may be conducted in other locations in
accordance with 18 WGI 13-204. Spot turns on the center parking spot in the Valley are not
authorized.
8.2.9.3. Scramble Procedures. The squadron will maintain 30-minute aircrew recall response
capability during all 18th Wing night fighter operations (not including cross-country
arrivals/departures).
8.2.9.3.1. (Added) Aircraft will be fully configured, hover checked and placed on alert prior to
the start of the alert period. The Operations Supervisor and Aircraft Commanders will
coordinate with the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) for situational awareness on fighter
launch/recovery windows and operating areas.
8.2.9.3.2. (Added) All scheduled alert crews will conduct a crew briefing to include individual
crewmember duties during a scramble launch. 33 RQS alert aircrew will ensure they maintain
the ability to respond to the squadron within 30 minutes of mission notification. If an alert
crewmember leaves the squadron building, he/she must notify the ODO or aircraft commander
and carry an operable beeper or cell phone. Upon recall, contact the ops desk as soon as possible
to confirm you were successfully contacted and provide an estimated amount of time of arrival to
squadron.
8.2.9.3.3. (Added) Upon mission notification, the ODO will immediately contact ops and mx
supervision, coordinate with PJ’s as required and run the Search and Rescue Quick Reaction
Checklist. The phrase ―TOKYO, TOKYO, TOKYO‖ is used to alert all necessary personnel of
the potential SAR mission. All available non-alert aircrew will report to the Ops Desk and make
AFI11-2HH-60V3_KADENAABSUP 29 JUNE 2011                                                          7


themselves available for any support tasks by alert aircrew or ops supervision (mission planning,
preflight, additional aircraft, etc.).
8.2.9.3.4. (Added) Launch Procedures. Alert aircraft will not launch on a SAR without
authority from 33 RQS/CC or higher. SAR aircraft may take-off from the Throat with ATC
clearance.
8.2.9.4. Traffic Pattern and Landing Areas.
8.2.9.4.1. (Added) Kadena AB. Traffic patterns, arrival, departures, and other airfield
information are found in 18 WGI 13-204. Traffic pattern altitude is 800’ MSL. FCF areas are
found in AFI 21-101, Air Combat Command, USAF in Europe and PACAF Supplement, Kadena
AB Supplement (AFI21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_KADENAABSUP), Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management.
8.2.9.4.1.1. (Added) On occasions when flights are approved and scheduled to recover after
2200L, the aircrew will recover to the runway environment using one of the methods listed
below for noise abatement. After recovering to the runway environment, aircrews may conduct
aircraft wash, FARP operations, hover checks, etc. with no restrictions.
8.2.9.4.1.1.1. (Added) Recover using any published instrument approach.
8.2.9.4.1.1.2. (Added) Recover via a visual straight-in approach that emulates straight-in
instrument approach track using runway headings (under tower control).
8.2.9.4.1.1.3. (Added) Recover via BOLO 5 arrival, flying the arrival 1NM offshore paralleling
the coastline to a point where a straight-in visual approach can be made to the runway or helipad.
8.2.9.4.2. (Added) MCAS Futenma. Traffic patterns, arrival, departures, and other airfield
information are found in MCAS Futenma Airfield Operations Manual. Traffic pattern altitude is
1000’ MSL, 1300’ MSL for auto rotations. All non-Futenma assigned aircraft require a PPR.
No live ordinance of any kind is authorized.
8.2.9.4.3. (Added) Landing Zones. Areas include the NTA, CTA, and various other operating
areas/sites. Site descriptions and restrictions are contained in the LZ Books located in the Flight
Planning/Reference Library (OPR - DOW). Advisory frequencies for NTA and CTA are
published in the in-flight guide and should be continuously monitored when not in contact with
ATC. Advisory calls with position and intentions should be made as appropriate. Aircraft
commanders will ensure that updated site surveys are provided to DOW. The helicopter LZs in
the CTA and NTA can be used without prior scheduling, as long as they are not listed as
unavailable in the Range Bulletin.
8.2.9.4.3.1. (Added) NTA [Jungle Warfare Training Center (JWTC)]. The ODO will coordinate
all training missions in the NTA/R-201 to include flight route de-confliction, LZ use, LZ
availability, time of use, type of use, and any live training (AIEs or ground personnel) with
―NTA Base Camp‖ telephonically (DSN 622-2238/2237) to determine site availability and de-
confliction with other users. NTA Base Camp maintains listening watch on NTA frequency and
operates similar to an advisory service. Upon arrival, broadcast entry location, intended landing
site(s), and any other pertinent information. Upon departure, broadcast ―departing‖ and route of
flight.
8.2.9.4.3.2. (Added) CTA. The ODO will coordinate and obtain clearance for all operations in
the CTA/R-202 through ―Range Control‖ (DSN 622-2237/2238) prior to entry. Notify ―Range
