    back of the envelope or on the front of a parcel or box.

5.2. If the envelope size is under 12 by 16 inches when preparing Confidential material for consolidated mail
locations, use only one container and put the classification above and below the mailing address and on both sides.
If the envelope is 12 by 16 inches or larger, a package or box, prepare an outer container--do not show the

Restricted Delivery, Return Receipt Showing to Whom and Date Delivered; Return Receipt Showing to Whom,
Date, and Address of Delivery. Leave the form intact, wet the sticky portion, and attach it to the top center of the
envelope between the return address and postage area. DPO personnel will stamp the USPS Form 3800 and give
the receipt portion to 11 CS/SCSRAA.

8. Preparing Secret and Confidential Material for Andrews or Bolling AFBs:

system, prepare the inner container and show the classification on it, complete address of the intended organization
and, if possible, the recipient's name. Put the number from the registered mail label below the complete return
address. Then prepare the outer container, do not show the classification or individual's name, address it to the



                                                        10
Department of State, Pouch Room (must be on second line), Washington DC 20520-0528 ( place on third line).
Put the registered mail label "number" on the top center position of the envelope between the return address and
postage area and prepare an original and one copy of USPS Form 3877. NOTE: Review DoD 4525.8-M/AF
Supplement 1, Chapter 6, for size limitations of material accepted or address format to use when sending
unclassified mail and additional State Department pouch information.

10. NATO Material. When you have classified NATO material for dispatch, give it to your NATO control point
person. He or she will prepare and pass the material on to Document Security (11 CS/SCSRAS).

11. Pentagon Recorded Mail (PRM):

Section D—Express Delivery, Bulk Mail Dispatches, and Freight Delivery

13. Express Delivery:

13.1. Express delivery of time-sensitive material is very costly. If possible, consider other options to meet time
constraints. NOTE: Review DoD 4525.8-M/AF Supplement, Chapter 3, paragraph K.

13.2. If the options are inappropriate, contact 11 CS/SCSRAA or bring the item to Room 4B1064. The HQ USAF
Mail Room use several services that can meet the demand. The U.S. Government carrier (presently FEDEX) can
provide next day service for stateside locations, and 2-3 day service to foreign countries. USPS Express Mail can
be used to APO/FPO overseas addresses and for classified shipments to contractors, or military addresses in
Alaska, Hawaii, or U.S. territories. Quick Delivery Service, a contractor, can provide same day service in the
Washington Metropolitan Area.

13.3. Bring mail for delivery to APOs or FPOs by USPS Express Mail to 11 CS/SCSRAA by 1130, and for other
locations by 1500. APO and FPO Express Mail must be in the local post office before 1200; if received after that
time, the expedite delivery guarantee is void. Other USPS Express Mail must be in the post office by 1600. Bring
time-sensitive material for fast delivery by other commercial companies to 11 CS/SCSRAA no later than 1500.
Bring time sensitive material that requires same day delivery in local area to mail room by 1500.

13.4. When preparing time-sensitive material for dispatch by:

      13.4.1. USPS Express Mail: Put it in a container (envelope, box, etc.) and use the complete mailing
      address, recipient's name and phone number. Normally BITC personnel contact the individual for pickup;
      when it is not picked up, the item is delivered on the scheduled mail run.

      13.4.2. Federal Express (will deliver material directly to the intended address): Put it in a container, use
      the complete mailing address and the recipient's name, phone and building number. Building and phone
      numbers are not mandatory for addresses that are not located on military installations.




                                                         11
14. Bulk Mail Dispatches. OPRs should contact the Chief, Correspondence Management Section (11 CS/SCSRA)
at (703) 697-0269 when bulk mailings are anticipated. He or she will help to ensure the most efficient, cost
effective means of preparing and mailing such items.

15. Freight Delivery. Any item weighing more than 70 pounds is considered freight. 11 CS/SCSRAA will not
handle anything over that weight. Contact 11 SUPS/OL-P at (703) 697-5800 to dispatch heavy items or large
quantities to a specific location.

Section E—Other Services and Information

16. Other Services:

16.1. Heavy or Large Quantity Mailings. When offices have heavy or large quantity mailings, they should contact
their ADOs. If necessary, their ADOs can contact 11 CS/SCSRAA and request assistance.

16.2. Same Day Delivery of Time-Sensitive Material. When requested to provide same-day delivery of time-
sensitive material to stateside or worldwide locations, 11 CS/SCSRAA will review USPS Express Mail Airport-to-
Airport Service or contact various commercial airlines. If commercial airlines are used, the requester must pay for
the service in advance.

16.3. Special Mail Services. Some offices that need Registered or Certified mail service should:

      16.3.1. Request those services from 11 CS/SCSRAA.

      16.3.2. Package the material and address properly.

      16.3.3. Be sure to stamp or write on the desired service (i.e., registered or certified).

      16.3.4. Put a control number on the envelope and prepare an AF Form 12.

      16.3.5. Call 11 CS/SCSRAA ((703) 695-6393) for pickup or bring the item to Room 4Bl064.

16.4. Top Secret Material. Document Security (11 CS/SCSRAS) or other Top Secret control points handle Top
Secret material. 11 CS/SCSRAA personnel cannot deliver or pick up Top Secret Material.

17. Other Pertinent Mail Management Information:

17.1. Accountable Material for Five or More Separate Activity Distribution Offices. When preparing accountable
communications for five or more separate activity distribution offices, prepare an AF Form 12 for each office.
Prepare a AF Form 12 to list all items dispatched and address it to 11 CS/SCSRAA. (NOTE: Do not list
interoffice communications and mail for dispatch through USPS on the same AF Form 12.)

17.2. Classified Mail Container. When preparing classified material for delivery or dispatch, use an opaque
container. Classified markings must not be visible on any item sent through the USPS. Also, when addressing
classified mail outer containers for delivery by the postal service, use only the organization's name or symbol,
complete mailing, and your return addresses. If needed, put the individual's name on the inner container only.
Send classified material only to official government agencies or DoD contractors with facility clearances. Review
DoD 5200.1-R for further guidance.

17.3. Classified Mail Delivery. All Secret material sent through the HQ USAF Mail Room must be controlled.
Unless desired by the sender, Confidential is not controlled. Both types of material must be in sealed containers
and marked accordingly.




                                                          12
17.4. Late Receipt of Expedite Mail. HQ USAF Mail Room personnel will check dispatch dates of incoming
expedite mail. When USPS Express Mail is received late, they will notify the sending organization by returning a
copy of the Express Mail Receipt, Label 11A. The sender should complete a PS Form 3533, Application and
Voucher for Refund of Postage and Fees, and send it to the local servicing post office. When expedite material
from commercial companies is received late, 11 CS/SCSRAA will contact the delivering company to receive a
refund credit.

17.5. Multiple Registered Mailings to Nonconsolidated Mail Locations. When sending two or more accountable
items to the same location that has no consolidated mailing, consolidate the material in a container (box, large
envelope, wrap, etc.) Address it to the BITC and the location; include the 9-digit ZIP Code. This economical
action helps to minimize postal expenditures. A costly register fee is charged for each item mailed separately.

17.6. SF 65, US Government Messenger Envelope. Offices should use SF 65, to send unclassified interoffice
administrative communications or communications for other DoD elements in the Pentagon, or material for the
pouches. DO NOT USE SFs 65 as classified mail containers. When using SFs 65 to send interoffice
communications or material for Pentagon DoD elements, use complete office symbols. Use complete mailing
addresses when sending material for consolidation.

17.7. Suspicious Mail Item. When receiving mail that could possibly contain a harmful device, DO NOT OPEN
IT; isolate the item and immediately evacuate everyone from the area. Quickly contact the security police at (703)
697-8291, or building security if not located in the Pentagon. Review additional guidance in DoD 4525.8-M/AF
Supplement, Chapter 5.

17.8. Unclassified Sensitive Administrative Communications. When opening a container that has such material,
immediately replace it in the container and give it to the supervisor. The supervisor will take it to the appropriate
office chief. If further routing of the material is necessary, the chief should ensure it is personally delivered to that
official or sent in a double sealed container. Use the original envelope as the inner container and mark it "must be
opened by"; put the name of the person to whom the container is addressed.

Section F—Obtaining Pertinent Mail Room Items

18. Registered Mail Labels. The HQ USAF Mail Room obtains registered and certified mail labels from the US
Postal Service and issues them to Activity Distribution Offices that frequently dispatch registered or certified mail.

19. Postal Service Forms. HQ USAF Mail Room also maintains supplies of PS Forms 3533, Application and
Voucher for Refund of Postage and Fees; 3575, Change of Address Order; 3576, Change of Address Notice to
