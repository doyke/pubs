                                           Chapter 1

                                          GENERAL

    1.1. Purpose.      This Operating Instruction establishes, defines, and describes the
         responsibilities, manning, and operational procedures used to activate, operate, and
         deactivate the AFCAT. All references to HAF include personnel from the offices of the
         Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force — Secretariat and Air Staff, respectively.

    1.2. Mission of AFCAT. The mission of the AFCAT is to maintain 24-hour situational
         awareness on global events in order to enable the CSAF and SECAF to make key
         decisions related to their Title 10 role in organizing, training, and equipping US Air
         Force forces. On order from the AF/A3/5, the AFCAT takes action to coordinate and
         facilitate Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements, and ensure situational
         awareness for HAF senior leaders. Implied tasks related to the AFCAT mission
         include:

       1.2.1. Keeping the SECAF and CSAF informed of worldwide events that may require
              U.S. Air Force involvement, including involvement in support of the President
              and Secretary of Defense, COCOM, or other Federal/State/local operations.

       1.2.2. Providing connectivity between the HAF and MAJCOMs and Air Component
              Commanders to facilitate direct liaison and reachback for Title 10 and other
              support.

       1.2.3. Serving as the HAF focal point for responses to National Capital Region (NCR)
              emergencies and crises, including those that require essential HAF personnel
              relocation.

       1.2.4. Facilitating the flow of Air Force current operations information and supporting
              the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and other US government
              (USG) operations centers as requested/able.

    1.3. Roles, Responsibilities and Functions. The AFCAT provides the HAF the capability to
         monitor and respond to a wide variety of events where significant US military
         operations are required. The AFCAT is task organized and tailored to the specific crisis
         or US military operation. Members of the AFCAT include personnel from the HAF
         and are the central coordination element for the SECAF and CSAF. The AFCAT
         gathers and analyzes information, provides subject matter expert inputs, and acts as the
         central HAF point of contact for all matters related to the incident for which the
         AFCAT is responsible. Overall, the AF/A3/5 is responsible for AFCAT operations.
         For daily operations the AFCAT Director and Team Chief responsibilities are delegated
         to the AF/A3O-AO. When the situation requires increased manning, the AFCAT is
         activated and manned by personnel from the HAF.
HOI 10-2 17 August 2011                                                                          5

  1.4. AFCAT Organization. During normal operations and minor crises the Air Force Watch
       (AF/A3O-AOA, referred to as AFWATCH) will provide crisis response coordination.
       In the event of a significant crisis that results in a large military/Air Force response the
       AFCAT will be activated and tailored to the required HAF organizations.

  1.5. Procedures. In order to ensure the AFCAT begins and ends operations efficiently,
       various steps are required to activate and deactivate the AFCAT. Activation and
       deactivation procedures are outlined in Chapter 5.

      1.5.1. Organizations, Responsibilities, and Staffing Procedures.    Other than the
             requirement to provide manpower for their respective AFCAT positions, AFCAT
             activation does not affect the normal operations of HAF organizations, unless
             otherwise directed by the AF/A3/5.

      1.5.2. Operations and Security. Depending on the nature of the crisis and required
             military response, AFCAT actions may range from unclassified through Top
             Secret.

             1.5.2.1. Security Clearance Requirements. The AFCAT floor, located within the
                      Resources and Situational Awareness Center (RSAC), is a Sensitive
                      Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Therefore, to have
                      unescorted access to the AFCAT, personnel must possess a TS/SCI
                      clearance and be read into SI/TK/G/HCS. Personnel assigned to the
                      AFCAT who do not meet these requirements will be escorted during
                      AFCAT operations.

             1.5.2.2. CAT Access. Personnel assigned to the AFCAT who do not already
                      have access to the RSAC must submit requests to AF/A3O-AO Security
                      Personnel via their unit security manager.

      1.5.3. Electronic Equipment in the RSAC. Electronic devices are not permitted in the
             RSAC and AFCAT.

      1.5.4. Battle Rhythm and Daily Requirements. Typical AFCAT battle rhythm and daily
             requirements are described in Chapter 4, but remain flexible to the situation.

  1.6. Exercises. The AF/A3/5 periodically exercises the AFCAT. When exercises are
       executed, the HAF staff organizations supporting the AFCAT will participate as
       directed.

  1.7. Relocation. Normally, the AFCAT operates in the Pentagon’s RSAC facility. If
       relocation is directed, the AFCAT will move to the designated relocation sites. Due to
       the possibility of relocation, all AFCAT members must have a ―go-kit‖ ready to allow
       for immediate relocation. Please refer to Appendix 5 to Annex C to HAF OPORD 3-
       09, available on the SIPRnet at
6                                                   HOI 10-2 17 August 2011

                                       CHAPTER 2

                                 AFCAT Response Levels

  2.1. Crisis Action Operations. The AFCAT can be tasked to respond under any crisis/event.
       When a crisis develops that requires action and monitoring beyond the capability of the
       AFWATCH, long term HAF engagement, or a significant military response, AF/A3/5
       activates the AFCAT.


      2.1.1. AFCAT. The AFCAT is task organized and tailored to the specific crisis or US
             military operation. Members of the AFCAT include personnel from the HAF
             staff and are the central situational awareness element for the SECAF and CSAF
             during a crisis situation. The AFCAT gathers and analyzes information,
             provides SME inputs, and acts as the central HAF point of contact for all matters
             related to the incident for which the AFCAT is responsible. The AF/A3/5
             activates the AFCAT when a crisis is either expected to require long-term
             engagement by the HAF or a significant US military response. The AFCAT is
             supervised by the AFCAT Director, and is responsible for specific crisis related
             monitoring and action. An AFCAT normally operates in the AFOG Crisis
             Action Center within the RSAC, but may be formed in other locations, including
             other staff areas, the NMCC, or locations off the Pentagon Reservation at the
             discretion of the AF/A3/5. Figure 2.1 – Roles Comprising AFCAT outlines the
             functions (desks) of the AFCAT, and what organizations serve as the OPR.

    2.2. AFCAT Support. Various organizations support and coordinate with the AFCAT.
         These organizations include AFDW, MAJCOM CATs and other Services’ CATs. Upon
         activation of a AFCAT the following organizations provide support for operations:
HOI 10-2 17 August 2011                                                               9

      2.2.1. IT Support. Upon activation of a AFCAT, the 844 CS provides manning
             augmentation and specialized skills and expertise and must be available to
             provide support 24 hours a day.

      2.2.2. Facility Support. AF/A3O-AO maintains the crisis facilities within the RSAC
             and ensures these spaces are ready within 1 hour of notification of AFCAT
             activation.

                                           CHAPTER 3

                              Roles, Responsibilities, and Functions

     3.1. General. This chapter assigns responsibilities for the activation, operation, and
          deactivation of AFCATs; however, these responsibilities are neither all-inclusive nor
          restrictive -- the responsibilities of an AFCAT and its members are crisis dependent.

     3.2. AF/A3/5

          3.2.1.    Authorizes the activation of the AFCAT.

          3.2.2.    Maintains awareness of the AFCAT.

          3.2.3.    Establishes and publishes detailed standard operating procedures for the
                    AFCAT outlined in this operating instruction.

     3.3. Air Staff and Secretariat Directorates.

          3.3.1.    Prior to AFCAT Activation

               3.3.1.1. Maintain standing AFCAT rosters of eligible, trained, and cleared
                        individuals to fill various AFCAT desk positions familiar with their
                        organization’s responsibilities.

               3.3.1.2. Provide the AFWATCH a POC who will receive notification of all
                        AFCAT activations and maintain recall information of AFCAT members
                        as well as the schedule for AFCAT manning of their applicable desk.

               3.3.1.3. Ensure potential AFCAT members have required clearances.

               3.3.1.4. Provide all potential AFCAT members desk specific training regarding
                        their duties and responsibilities and require potential AFCAT members to
                        review this Instruction.

               3.3.1.5. Ensure AFCAT desks have pertinent references, planning data, telephone
                        numbers, and relevant SIPRNET/JWICS addresses for key contacts.

                           Battle Rhythm and Daily Requirements

     4.1. General. During AFCAT operations, the battle rhythm is flexible and will be altered to
          meet the requirements of the situation. Typically, a AFCAT is manned 24-hours a day
          by two teams, each working a 12-hour shift, plus changeover time. Shift changeovers
          usually begin at 0530 local and 1730 local and conclude at 0630 local and 1830 local.

     4.2. Reporting requirements. During operations, the AFCAT is responsible for producing
          briefings, reports, and summaries. Figure 4.1 – Reporting Requirements outlines
          required reports and OPR for the report. See Attachment 2 for templates of documents
          outlined in this section.

                circumstances permit.

         4.2.2. Activation Message. The activation message notifies operations centers globally
                of AFCAT activation.
                                                              HOI 10-2 17 August 2011

4.2.3. Deactivation Message. The deactivation message notifies operations centers
       globally of AFCAT deactivation.

4.2.4. Director Executive Summary and Daily Guidance. The Director Executive
       Summary and Daily Guidance provides the CSAF and SECAF a snapshot of
       ongoing operations and the Directors situation assessment and priorities for the
       next 48 hours.

4.2.5. Situation Report. The SITREP provides a daily summary of AFCAT actions in
       response to the crisis.

4.2.6. Strategic Timeline. The strategic timeline serves as a strategic level synopsis of
       events occurring throughout the course of AFCAT operations. The strategic
       timeline is updated daily with the final product published upon AFCAT
       deactivation.

4.2.7. Events Log. Desks are required to maintain an events log of activities.
       Activities are entered using the Events Log database located on the AFCAT
       Portal, located at http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/afcat. The events log
       is established and maintained by each desk or individual, and is consolidated by
       the Exec.

4.2.8. Lessons Learned. Desks are required to record lessons pertaining to their desk
       and functional area, as well as AFCAT operations, and provide them to the
       AFCAT ―Lessons Learned‖ desk.

4.2.9. Director’s Update. Twice daily, the director is provided an update of the actions
       from the previous reporting period and anticipated future requirements.
       Typically the briefing is conducted in conjunction with AFCAT shift change
       operations. Both the off-going shift and on-coming shift are required to attend
       the changeover brief. This brief is normally conducted in the CAC.

4.2.10. Desk and Individual Changeover Briefs. AFCAT members, and individual
        desks conduct change briefs between off-going and on-coming shifts. At a
        minimum, the briefs will include applicable actions completed, open taskings,
        and any other pertinent information.

4.2.11. Situation Update Brief. During the beginning stages of a crisis, a situation brief
        is presented to provide details on the current situation, and propose a mission
        statement, commander’s intent, key tasks, priorities and recommended courses
        of action to include AFCAT activation.

                                        CHAPTER 5

                        CAT Activation and Deactivation Checklists

     5.1. CAT Activation and Deactivation Procedures

         5.1.1. When directed, the AFWATCH under direction from AF/A3/5 activates an
              AFCAT and as the situation dictates executes a recall of the AFCAT. This recall is
              communicated via multiple means to include phone and e-mail. The Air Force
              Duty Officer (AFDO) develops an activation message for AF/A3/5 release via
              AF/A3O-AO. This message directs applicable organizations, and requests
              subordinate commands, to provide support to the AFCAT. It also lists the names
              of essential personnel; secure and non-secure telephone numbers and other
              appropriate contact information. The message is sent to all higher, adjacent, and
              subordinate commands announcing that the AFCAT has been activated.

         5.1.2. The AFWATCH will include the report time in the recall activation message.
              AFCAT members will make every effort to be present for duty at or before the
              scheduled report time. When scheduled AFCAT members are directed to report,
              they shall report to the AFCAT floor within 1 hour during duty hours and within 2
              hours during non-duty hours.

         5.1.3. Upon activation, the AFCAT Team Chief is the sole authority for release or
              recall of individual AFCAT members. Following the inbrief, the AFCAT Team
              Chief will determine, based on the current situation, the necessary staffing
              requirements. At that point, the Team Chief may release some AFCAT members
              to virtual presence or standby presence.

             5.1.3.1. Members released to virtual presence may return to their workcenters (if
                  within the Pentagon) but will remain on 15 minute recall to return to the
                  AFCAT floor.

             5.1.3.2. Members released to standby presence resume their normal duty
                  schedules, subject to recall on the normal AFCAT activation timeline (within 1
                  hour during duty hours and within 2 hours during non-duty hours).

         5.1.4. When directed by the AF/A3/5, the AFCAT Director or his designated
              representative deactivates the AFCAT. Through the AFWATCH, the AF/A3/5
              sends a deactivation message to all higher, adjacent, and subordinate commands
              and interested agencies advising them of the AFCAT deactivation. The message
              also provides specific points of contact for any unresolved issues.
                                                             HOI 10-2 17 August 2011

                                     CHAPTER 6

                                  Briefing Procedures

6.1. General. AFCAT desks provide individual brief inputs based on their areas of expertise,
     which support the Director’s Update, with individual slides provided upon request.
     Brief inputs are produced twice daily and provided to the Team Chief. Normally, these
     desk inputs cover significant events for the last 24 hours, projected actions for the next
     7 days, summary of results, and additional detailed information related to the crisis.

6.2. Concept. The daily Director’s Update is normally presented at 0600 and 1800 in the
     CAC. AFCAT members provide input to the Briefing Team as directed by the AFCAT
     battle rhythm. The Briefing Team then collates the inputs and prepares the brief. The
     Team Chief or Director reviews and approves the brief. Depending upon the audience
     for the final brief, it may also be reviewed by the AF/A3/5. The AFCAT Director
     provides the battle rhythm for briefings and this timeline may change due to the nature
     of the crisis supported. Figure 6.1 – Example Brief Preparation Schedule shows a
     typical brief preparation schedule.

6.3. AFCAT Briefers. Briefer responsibilities include:

    6.3.1.   Receiving inputs and developing briefings and presentations.

    6.3.2.   Providing guidance to AFCAT desks on requirements directed by the AFCAT
             Director and/or Team Chief.

    6.3.3.   Meeting with AFCAT desks to ensure briefing products are streamlined.

    6.3.4.   Establishing timeline / milestones for required products.

    6.3.5.   Scheduling training briefings for exercises.

    6.3.6.   Prior to real world operations or exercises, preparing the AFCAT Briefer desk.

    6.3.7.   Ensuring scrolling slideshow on television is up-to-date (coordinate with
             AFCAT Exec).

                                    CHAPTER 7

                             CAT Leadership Positions

7.1. General. The VCSAF will task each HAF 2-letter to maintain personnel rosters of
     eligible, trained, and cleared individuals available for AFCAT leadership positions.

    7.1.1.   This tasking will be reviewed and reissued every 2 years, unless the VCSAF or
             the AF/A3/5 directs a more frequent review.

    7.1.2.   Each 2-letter will supply a name and contact information for each person
             tasked; selected personnel must have the AFSC, experience levels, and
             clearance levels required.

    7.1.3.   Each person supplied should have at least one year remaining on the HAF.

    7.1.4.   Each 2-letter will supply a replacement name before removing anyone from
             their AFCAT personnel roster.

    7.1.5.   Figure 7.1 - Tasking by HAF 2-letter spreadsheet is the governing directive for
             specified leadership position requirements per 2-letter.

7.2. Implementation. AF/A3/5 is responsible for the implementation of the VCSAF’s
     tasking, and for the review, update, and rewrite of the tasking plan every two years.

    7.2.1. The standard and expectation is that each person on a standby or active
         AFCAT desk roster should expect to appear for 2 x 4-day tours each month, and
         that each person serving on the AFCAT shall serve 4 x 12-hour days in a row
         before being replaced to maximize continuity.

    7.2.2. One person per shift must be rostered to fill all AFCAT positions. The
         AFWATCH will produce a monthly on-call schedule based on 2-letter staffing
         inputs. In order to attain the required standby AFCAT schedule, each 2-letter is
         required to provide the number of personnel listed in Figure 7.1 – Tasking by HAF
         2-letter.

                                      CHAPTER 8

                       AFCAT Familiarization and Exercises

8.1. General. In order to prepare for AFCAT operations, AFCAT members must be trained
     to operate in the AFCAT. Training involves understanding of AFCAT processes to
     include reporting requirements, automated data systems, battle rhythms, and other
     various requirements.

8.2. Familiarization and Recurring Training. Familiarization training is developed by the
     AF/A3O-AO, and is intended for eligible HAF staff members. Familiarization training
     is found on the AFOG SIPRNET page. Following initial training, AFCAT members
     should accomplish refresher training semi-annually. The training includes:

    8.2.1.   Sign in procedures.

    8.2.2.   Computer procedures to include log-in and e-mail management.

    8.2.3.   Briefing preparation and delivery.

    8.2.4.   Security procedures.

    8.2.5.   Evacuation procedures.

    8.2.6.   Roles and responsibilities of various positions and cells.

    8.2.7.   Battle Rhythm.

8.3. Exercises. On a routine basis, the AFCAT conducts exercises in order to test AFCAT
     members on various procedures. These exercises can be stand alone HAF exercises or
     on a national level in conjunction with outside organizations such the Joint Staff,
     Interagency, or Combatant Commands.

    8.3.1.   AF/A3O-AO will, when possible and appropriate, give 30 to 60 days
             notification of upcoming exercises to help reduce disruption to normal
             workflow.

A2.1. General. This enclosure provides templates and samples for AFCAT documents. For
master copies of these documents, refer to the AFCAT Portal.

A2.2.   AFCAT Documents

   A2.2.1. Warning Order (WARNORD) Message. The WARNORD is used to provide
   advanced notice of impending AFCAT activation. Typically the WARNORD is published
   NLT 24 hours prior to AFCAT activation. The intended audience for the WARNORD is the
   HAF AFCAT and subordinate Air Force commands. The WARNORD is typically
   transmitted via e-mail. The OPR for the WARNORD is AF/A3O-AO. See Figure A2.1 –
   Sample WARNORD for a template.

   A2.2.2. Activation Message. The activation message is used to provide notice of HAF
   AFCAT Activation. The activation message typically includes activation time, AFCAT
   desks activated, and contact information for the AFCAT. AFWATCH will send out the
   activation message on behalf of AF/A3O-AO.

   A2.2.3. Deactivation Message. The deactivation message is used to provide notice of HAF
   AFCAT deactivation time and information regarding ongoing crisis related activity for future
   operations. AFWATCH will send out the AFCAT deactivation message on behalf of
   AF/A3O-AO as directed by AFCAT Team Chief.

   A2.2.4. Director Executive Summary and Daily Guidance. The Director Executive
   Summary and Daily Guidance is designed to provide a snapshot of operations ongoing and
   the Directors assessment of the situation. Additionally, it provides the priorities for the next
   48 hours. Typically the Director Executive Summary and Daily Guidance is published twice
   daily at 0600 and 1800. The intended audience for the Director Executive Summary and
   Daily Guidance is the CSAF and SECAF. The OPR for the Executive Summary is the
   AFCAT Exec. The OCR for the Executive Summary portion of the document is the AFCAT
   Briefer. The OCR for the Daily Guidance is the Future Operations Cell. See Figure A2.2 –
