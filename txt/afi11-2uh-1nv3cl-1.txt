SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely
reviewed. Major revisions include removing certain briefings, making
the Aircrew Briefing applicable to all missions and re-aligning other
2                         AFI11-2UH-1NV3CL-1 27 February 2007

briefings and checklists by functional area.

1. General. Aircrews will use those briefings applicable to their
unit/mission. The aircrew briefing will be accomplished for all flights.
Specialized briefings will be accomplished prior to accomplishing the
associated maneuver or mission. MAJCOMs will determine the
specialized briefings, checklists and miscellaneous pages to be carried.

2. Supplements and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
Supplemented information is additional steps or more restricted
guidance and will be published as a MAJCOM supplement. SOPs are
developed at the unit level to describe standards for accomplishing
steps in this checklist. Forward SOPs to parent MAJCOM through
Stan/Eval channels for approval and implementation.
