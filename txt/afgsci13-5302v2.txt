                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Evaluation Program. Standardization and evaluation across units, missions, and
functional areas is done to gain efficiencies in processes, to increase combat capability, and to
provide common training products where possible. Unit-level evaluations will challenge an
Airman’s ability to operate in the heart of the nuclear envelope and validate that they are trained
to meet the nuclear needs of the military. Evaluations measure proficiency on existing, new, or
revised procedures and equipment, verify procedures are being trained properly to ensure
mission accomplishment and provide feedback on training programs. They also provide
squadron leadership feedback on an individual’s or crew’s demonstrated performance.
     1.1.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will design and implement evaluation programs to ensure
     procedures contained in technical orders, checklists, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
     (TTPs) and operations manuals are standardized, accurate, and effective to fulfill mission
     accomplishment.
     1.1.2. The 625 STOS/ALCS will evaluate in accordance with established Training and
     Evaluation Performance Standards (TEPS).
        1.1.2.1. Reference Attachment 2 of AFGSC Instruction (AFGSCI) 13-5302v1, Airborne

       performance event.
   2.3.4. Spot Evaluation. Spot evaluations are special-check evaluations that are given to
   check proficiency or validate training.
       2.3.4.1. Spot evaluations may be directed or requested by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO when a
       check in proficiency is deemed appropriate, and a qualification evaluation is not
       appropriate.
       2.3.4.2. For each major weapon system modification, a spot evaluation may be directed
       or requested to verify training and proficiency following supplemental training.
   2.3.5. Requalification Evaluation. Requalification evaluations are special-check evaluations
   that are required upon completion of individual training resulting from an unqualified (Q3)
   evaluation rating on any full-check, spot evaluation or special HHQ evaluation.
       2.3.5.1. If conducting a requalification evaluation resulting from an evaluation where
       only one member of the crew received a Q3, only the unqualified crew member requires a
       requalification evaluation. The same crew members should be evaluated together;
       however, another crew member may take the place of the qualified crew member and will
       be given credit for a spot evaluation.
           2.3.5.1.1. If the evaluation meets the criteria in paragraph 2.3.2.1., the qualified crew
           member will be given credit for a qualification evaluation.

       Flight.
   2.3.6. Special HHQ Evaluation. Short HHQ evaluations are special-checks given by 20 AF
   evaluators or Inspector General (IG) inspectors. Short HHQ evaluations do not meet criteria
   of a full HHQ evaluation and will not advance an individual’s delinquency date.
       2.3.6.1. Special HHQ evaluations may be conducted as no-notice.
2.4. No-Notice Evaluations. A no-notice evaluation is one where the evaluatee is notified of an
evaluation, but may not have normal preparation time. To maintain the integrity of the no-notice
program, it is imperative that crews will not be told earlier than 18 hours in advance of their
pending evaluation.
   2.4.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will maintain a no-notice evaluation program.
       2.4.1.1. A minimum of 10 percent of all recurring qualification evaluations conducted
       annually will be given as a no-notice evaluation.
AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                              11


      2.4.1.2. No-notice evaluations will be either a spot evaluation or a qualification
      evaluation.
      2.4.1.3. No-notice evaluations must be out-of-cycle (at least 2 months before
      delinquency date) in order to count for no-notice statistics.
      2.4.1.4. The 625 STOS/ALCS will develop a no-notice review process of individual
      technical orders to ensure correct posting.
2.5. Delinquency Dates. The delinquency date establishes the maximum time until an AMR
individual must receive a qualification evaluation.
   2.5.1. All AMR certified crew members must receive qualification evaluations as a periodic
   check on proficiency. Failure to receive a qualification evaluation before the individual’s
   delinquency date causes the individual to be placed in restricted status.
   2.5.2. If time does not permit a crew member to receive an evaluation prior to deployment,
   the operator will be placed in restricted or decertified status at the time restriction or
   decertification is required. Refer to AFGSCI 13-5302v1 for removal from restricted or
   decertified status.
2.6. Delinquency Date Calculation. The delinquency date is calculated from the date of
evaluation(s) completion.
   2.6.1. Delinquency dates following initial, qualification or full HHQ evaluations are
   established by calculating the first day of the 13th month following successful completion of
   the evaluation.
      2.6.1.1. If a full-check evaluation is rated Q3, establish the delinquency date by
      calculating the first day of the 13th month following successful completion of the
      resulting requalification evaluation.
   2.6.2. Spot and special HHQ evaluations will not advance the delinquency date.

                        EVALUATION SCENARIOS AND SCRIPTS

4.1. Evaluation Scenarios. A scenario is a specific task or set of tasks presented in a coherent
manner to simulate operational conditions for the purpose of evaluating crew members.
   4.1.1. Crew members should be evaluated in a realistic crew environment.
   4.1.2. Performance tasks identified in the JPRL in Attachment 2 of AFGSCI 13-5302v1 will
   be evaluated using scenarios.
   4.1.3. Evaluation scenario results are based on crew member performance on each task or
   subtask with respect to the applicable performance standard.
4.2. Evaluation Scenario Conduct. Evaluators will ensure all scenario stimuli are presented as
written in the script and will provide a fair and unbiased evaluation of the crew.
   4.2.1. Evaluators will ensure the crew being evaluated will not use any training materials
   such as study-guides, acronym charts or any personally made status tracking products during
   an evaluation.
   4.2.2. For all evaluations, there will be at least a one-to-one ratio of evaluators to evaluatees.
   4.2.3. During an evaluation, the evaluators will not challenge, correct, or prompt the
   evaluatee as to the validity of the actions performed except to provide proper weapon system
   status.
       4.2.3.1. If the crew under evaluation in the APT passes direction to another agency, that
       agency should take the actions directed by the crew regardless if the direction is
       incorrect.
   4.2.4. Evaluatees are only permitted to ask questions to clarify a stimulus. Evaluators will
   not give more information than would normally be available or that would prompt a
   response.
   4.2.5. Evaluatees will be given the opportunity to correctly perform the action or to take an
   incorrect action; however, evaluators must intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to
   any equipment. Errors will be assessed in accordance with Chapter 5 of this publication.
   4.2.6. During an evaluation, the evaluator may ask questions to clarify an evaluatee’s
   response to a task. Evaluators will ensure questions will not interfere with crew actions,
   interrupt crew actions or prompt the evaluatee.
   4.2.7. Evaluators must always provide status that crew members would normally detect with
   their senses (e.g., heat, air, smoke, etc.) when it cannot be simulated by the APT. Status
   cards will be used to the maximum extent possible. Evaluators will ensure proper
   configuration is programmed whenever possible or briefed to the evaluated crew.
4.3. Evaluation Scripts. The 625 STOS/ALCS will design and use scripts to conduct
evaluation scenarios. Unit-level evaluations will verify proficiency and validate unit training
through robust and challenging evaluation scenarios that adhere to technical orders and all HHQ
evaluation standards.
AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 17


  4.3.1. The Chief, ALCS Evaluation will ensure all required (―R‖) JPRs, as specified in the
  JPRL, are evaluated at least once every 12 months.
  4.3.2. All simulation materials will be marked ―For Training Use Only‖ or ―For Evaluation
  Use Only‖.
  4.3.3. Scripts will contain valid peacetime and wartime stimuli. Stimuli will be identified by
  JPR, task description, initiation and response agencies, as well as notes or expected responses
  (e.g., TEPS notes, evaluator notes and expected evaluatee response).
     4.3.3.1. Estimated scenario run times are for scenario presentation only and do not
     establish a time standard for completing actions. Applicable proficiency time standards
     must be annotated within the script.
     4.3.3.2. Scripts must have a plan for presentation of problem sequences and events that
     specify instructions for evaluators and APT operators. Scripts will include instructions for
     simulated inputs, status cards or briefings and will identify proper crew responses.
  4.3.4. Problem presentation and equipment response must comply with TEPS and EWO
  TEPS (ETEPS) constraints.
     4.3.4.1. Evaluators should follow the script as written. However, if following the script
     as it is written causes inaccurate presentation, use evaluator judgment and provide
     accurate status.
  4.3.5. Use status cards or briefings to introduce stimuli that cannot be presented in a more
  realistic manner. Cards and briefs must not prompt, but must have enough information for the
  evaluatee to clearly understand the input.
  4.3.6. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety or cause
  equipment damage.
  4.3.7. Scenarios should be designed so that all actions are accomplished as a crew.
  4.3.8. Simulate realistic operational environments in the APT requiring the evaluatee to
  prioritize actions.
     4.3.8.1. Multiple inputs may be introduced to determine a crew’s capability to establish
     priorities. Do not inject unrelated tasks or status (e.g., two events occurring
     simultaneously where one task does not logically lead to another) while the crew is
     accomplishing critical phases of Level A TEPS/ETEPS performances. This does not
     preclude the presentation of expected follow-on weapon system indications related to
     previous inputs, provided those indications do not directly interfere with the crew's ability
     to execute its critical actions.
         4.3.8.1.1. If unrelated status occurs during a Level A TEPS/ETEPS as the result of
         equipment malfunction or due to the evaluator, but the status does not have an impact
         on the crew’s ability to effectively execute its critical actions, the evaluator will
         immediately brief the crew to disregard status and adjust the Level A TEPS/ETEPS.
         The scenario event is considered valid.
         4.3.8.1.2. If unrelated status occurs during a Level A TEPS/ETEPS as the result of
         equipment malfunction or due to the evaluator, and the status has an impact upon the
         crew’s ability to effectively execute its critical actions, the evaluator will immediately
 18                                                    AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011


           brief the crew to disregard status. The scenario event is invalid and errors will not be
           assessed.
       4.3.8.2. Scenarios should be designed to evaluate concepts and avoid presentation of
       excessive weapon system status. No more than four simultaneous problems will be
       included in any evaluation script.
   4.3.9. EWO and weapon system portions of the evaluation may be designed to provide a
   seamless evaluation.
   4.3.10. Scripts are normally designed not to exceed the following time standards:
       4.3.10.1. Initial evaluations should not be scripted to exceed 4 hours.
       4.3.10.2. Qualification evaluations should not be scripted to exceed 3 hours.
       4.3.10.3. Unit special-check evaluations should not be scripted to exceed 2 hours.
       4.3.10.4. Full and special HHQ evaluations will be scripted to meet HHQ needs.
   4.3.11. Scripts must be fully coordinated prior to being used for documented evaluations. At
   a minimum, coordination for evaluation scripts must include the Chief, ALCS Flight and
   Chief, ALCS Evaluation. Scripts will be coordinated with outside agencies as required.
       4.3.11.1. The Chief, ALCS Flight or designated representative will be the final approval
       for all APT evaluation scripts.
   4.3.12. The 625 STOS/ALCS must retain evaluation scripts and ancillary items such as
   emergency action messages (EAMs), status cards and script programming in either paper or
   electronic copy for a period of at least 12 months from the on-line date. This does not
   require a removable storage element for old revision products. Off-line scripts do not require
   updates.
4.4. TEPS and Timing Constraints. TEPS detail task performance, standards, timing
requirements and constraints for the express purpose of standardizing training and evaluation that
support operational mission ready certification requirements.
   4.4.1. TEPS/ETEPS are designed for preparing and presenting training and evaluation
   materials and will be used to prioritize tasks during an evaluation. TEPS/ETEPS will not
   supplement technical data or instructions.
   4.4.2. TEPS/ETEPS are divided into three levels.
       4.4.2.1. Level A - Tasks, if not performed correctly, could result in mission failure,
       endangerment of human life, serious injury or death or require an elevated level of
       proficiency.
           4.4.2.1.1. Level A tasks have the greatest potential for mission and/or personnel
           impacts and drive the most stringent training and evaluation program requirements.
           4.4.2.1.2. Asterisked Level A performance standards are not subject to judgment,
           require strict application and adherence. Asterisked Level A’s are used where a direct
           correlation exists between exceeding the time and a tangible undesirable outcome, or
           requires a higher level of proficiency necessary for mission accomplishment.
AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                               19


          4.4.2.1.3. Non-asterisked Level A performance standards provide an objective
          measurement guideline for performances requiring urgent action. Because event
          outcome may be influenced by outside factors, there is not always a direct correlation
          between outcome and successful completion of task-associated actions within the
          specified time parameter(s). Exceeding one of these times may not indicate a serious
          deficiency based on judgment and assessment of the specific scenario. Non-
          asterisked performance standards are guidelines to aid unit commanders in
          determining corrective actions.
          4.4.2.1.4. When an event has an associated Level A time standard, do not present
          new unrelated status until the Level A time standard has expired or has been
          successfully accomplished.
          4.4.2.1.5. When more than one Level A time standard is running simultaneously,
          time concurrently only if specifically written for concurrent timing, otherwise, time
          separately and sequentially.
              4.4.2.1.5.1. The only instance concurrent Level A time standards should occur is
              when there are multiple Level A time standards associated with a task.
          4.4.2.1.6. During a Level A TEPS timing standard event, as long as an evaluatee
          completes the task within the allotted TEPS time period, the only errors assessed
          during this period should be attributed to incorrect actions.
      4.4.2.2. Level B - Tasks deemed integral to the performance of other tasks and required
      to sustain acceptable weapon system operation and mission execution.
          4.4.2.2.1. Operators must accomplish Level B tasks properly without taking any
          intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events,
          adversely affect task performance or outcome.
      4.4.2.3. Level C - Rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system operations that
      by themselves have little or no impact on mission execution.
          4.4.2.3.1. Level C tasks apply where no specific time standard is identified. The
          standard is to accomplish the task proficiently in accordance with technical orders and
          governing directives.
   4.4.3. Level B and C performances within Level A tasks must be performed correctly in
   accordance with technical orders, governing instructions or other applicable documents.
   4.4.4. Level A, B, and C tasks must be accomplished without outside assistance except as
   specified by the governing technical order, HHQ instruction or publication.
   4.4.5. Outside agency responses will not be used to satisfy accomplishment of TEPS. If the
   MCCM-A has the technical data to satisfy the required task(s), the outside agency will not
   provide the data.
4.5. Status Presentation. Crew members must receive proper configuration and status for
operational realism.
   4.5.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will adhere to status presentation requirements and
   configuration actions for fire/overheat conditions and Nuclear Event (NE) Restart indications
   as provided by 20 AF.
 20                                                     AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011


   4.5.2. Status cards and briefings will be standardized and presented in accordance with 20
   AF directions.
4.6. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the evaluators to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of an evaluation.
   4.6.1. Evaluators will conduct a pre-brief for evaluatees to set the environment of the
   evaluation and to ensure the evaluatees clearly understand expectations, responsibilities,
   limitations and other rules of engagement before being administered the evaluation.
   4.6.2. Evaluators may use briefing as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario
   presentation and to alleviate the crew from performing unnecessary actions.
       4.6.2.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will standardize phrases used during evaluation breaks,
       between script events and termination. Standardized verbiage eliminates evaluator
       prompting that could occur when a crew has not completed all required actions before
       evaluation termination.
       4.6.2.2. If the crew has correctly accomplished a task, the task re-occurs and is not
       intended to be evaluated again, an evaluator may brief the task accomplished when the
       crew identifies the requirement to re-accomplish the task.
       4.6.2.3. If a task is not intended to be evaluated, and is not the result of a crew’s incorrect
       action, evaluators may brief the task accomplished when the crew identifies the
       requirement to accomplish the task.
4.7. Evaluation Scenario Termination. Once an evaluation is started, all efforts will be made
to complete the evaluation.
   4.7.1. Situations may arise in which early evaluation termination would be required.
   Evaluations terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally
   stopped, or the evaluation may be completely re-accomplished.
   4.7.2. Before deviating from the approved script and terminating the evaluation, the
   evaluators must determine if the minimum JPR coverage and Level A requirements outlined
   in paragraph 2.3.2.1. have been met to warrant a valid evaluation.
4.8. Outbriefing the Evaluatee. The outbriefing provides qualification ratings and feedback to
the evaluatee and the evaluation program.
   4.8.1. Evaluators will brief results to the SQ/CC or SQ/DO, and the Chief, ALCS Flight as
   soon as practical after completion of evaluation.
       4.8.1.1. The outbrief should include discussion of positive performance, strengths, any
       noted deficiencies, probable causes, and direct/indirect impacts to the mission, personnel,
       and other organizations.
          4.8.1.1.1. The Chief, ALCS Flight may recommend additional training and other
          corrective actions for any errors regardless of evaluation rating.
          4.8.1.1.2. Upon determination of any corrective actions for errors, the outbrief
          session may be used for instructors to administer individual training.
AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 21

                            EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

5.1. Error Determination. Upon completion of an evaluation, evaluators will identify, assess
and document errors.
   5.1.1. Error determination must be based upon the actions or inactions of the evaluatee.
   5.1.2. When the evaluatee causes a script deviation and an error results, evaluators will
   assess the error.
       5.1.2.1. If a crew takes multiple incorrect actions that lead to an action warranting a more
       severe error, assess only the highest degree error, and fully describe the other incorrect
       actions in the error description (commonly referred to as snowballing).
   5.1.3. Assess errors to only one crew member when, in the evaluator’s judgment, the other
   crew member was not in a position to detect and had no requirement to detect the incorrect
   action.
   5.1.4. Use the Deficiency Codes in Attachment 6 of AFGSCI 13-5302v1 to describe why an
   evaluatee committed an error.
   5.1.5. Evaluators will use definitions and/or examples of errors in paragraphs 5.3. through
   5.5. of this instruction and AFGSCI 13-5302v4 for error determinations.
   5.1.6. If the evaluators through the Chief, ALCS Flight cannot ascertain how to assess an
   error for an on-going evaluation after querying all required on-base agencies, call and initiate
   a formal request for error determination with 20 AF/A3N.
       5.1.6.1. 20 AF/A3N will analyze the information passed, make a final determination, and
       respond back to the Chief, ALCS Flight as soon as possible.
       5.1.6.2. If 20 AF/A3N is unable to make a final determination, a formal request for error
       determination must be forwarded to HQ AFGSC/A3T. The information will be analyzed
       and a final determination will be provided to 20 AF.
          5.1.6.2.1. Error determination requests for EWO errors must be forwarded to HQ
          AFGSC/A3T and A3I. The information will be analyzed by HQ AFGSC A3T and
          A3I and a final determination will be provided to 20 AF.
5.2. Error Consummation. Evaluation errors will not be assessed based on possible
consequences of incorrect crew actions, but on the actions themselves.
   5.2.1. Errors are based on decision points and may be consummated at the expiration of
   Level A TEPS, clock advances or check phase termination.
       5.2.1.1. Errors will be assessed on incorrect actions at the point of consummation
       regardless of the scripted outcome.
   5.2.2. If a crew fails to accomplish a required Level B task action prior to the clock advance,
   but is able to complete the task after the clock advance, the error may be partially or fully
   recovered depending on the circumstances.
 22                                                    AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011


       5.2.2.1. If a clock advance removes the crew’s ability to accomplish the required action
       (e.g., loss of communications with ground crews, no longer on station, etc.), award the
       appropriate error for failure to accomplish the task.
       5.2.2.2. If a clock advance would result in error consummation, the evaluator will use
       evaluator judgment prior to advancing the clock.
   5.2.3. If a script is written to brief a crew out of actions but the crew has performed an
   incorrect action that could impact future events, allow the crew to continue their actions
   through consummation of the error.
   5.2.4. If a crew takes an incorrect action, document the appropriate error. If recovery to a
   less severe error is possible, evaluators will allow the crew the opportunity to correct their
   action.
       5.2.4.1. An incorrect report to an outside entity can be corrected to no error if the crew
       takes corrective actions prior to termination of the report or call. If the crew takes
       corrective actions prior to expiration of any timing standard, recovery to a less severe
       error is possible.
       5.2.4.2. If the MCCM-A transmits an incorrect command, incorrectly accomplishes an
       internal command or test, trips an incorrect circuit breaker, the error is consummated
       immediately upon the action taken and recovery is not possible.
       5.2.4.3. Momentary mistakes due to status monitoring, inadvertent actions, or
       miscalculations that are immediately corrected, and do not result in system degradation,
       or degradation to a redundant system, may be recoverable to a lesser severity of error.
5.3. Critical Errors. Assess a critical error when evaluatee actions result, or would reasonably
be expected to result, in operational mission failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury,
or death.
   5.3.1. A mission-critical error results in the crew member being restricted and unqualified
   for all ALCS positions. The crew member may not perform unsupervised ALCS duty until
   successful completion of a requalification evaluation.
   5.3.2. Some examples of critical errors are as follows:
       5.3.2.1. Failure to comply with warnings or technical order safety precautions that could
       reasonably be expected to result in endangerment of human life, serious injury, or death.
       5.3.2.2. Violation of two person concept or no-lone zone requirements. This includes
       failure to report violations of two person concept or no-lone zone requirements.
       5.3.2.3. Taking the weapon system off-line when not required or allowing or requesting
       the weapon system to be taken off-line when not required. This includes volatilization of
       one or both Volatile Keying Assemblies (VKAs) when not required.
       5.3.2.4. Failure to enter the correct Translate Code value when required. Error is only
       critical for primary or secondary commits, major for tertiary and on. Error severity may
       be reduced one level if command is correctly reaccomplished after inserting correct
       values.
AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                                    23


       5.3.2.5. Violation of any nuclear weapon system safety rules in accordance with AFI 91-

          Program (AOP) with S-Data (AOP/S) prior to successful completion of WSSR tests
          (AOP Crypto Sumcheck (CSC), Fail CSC, Fail Code Processor Equipment (CPE),
          CPE Test, Decrypt Test Sequence) unless directed by fault procedures or Emergency
          Action Sequence (EAS).
          5.3.2.5.2. Failure to accomplish WSSR tests (AOP CSC, Fail CSC, Fail CPE, CPE
          Test, Decrypt Test Sequence) following replacement of the ALCS Controller
          Processor Chassis (ALCSCP), ALCS Controller Expansion Chassis (ALCSCE),
          Portable Storage Unit (PSU), or CPE.
          5.3.2.5.3. Failure to lock the CPE in such a manner as to secure the VKAs and
          prevent use of the Classified Command Control (CCC) switch when the operational
          CV is loaded, unless ―in EWO.‖
          5.3.2.5.4. Placing the ALCC switch to ON, or the CCC switch to ENABLE, or
          activating the ALARM OVERRIDE switch with VKAs installed in the CPE and/or

          5.3.2.5.7. Failure to ensure CLF (i.e., aircraft is at cruise altitude, in level flight, and
          free of malfunctions that could be dangerous to flight) when required.
          5.3.2.5.8. Failure of the MCCM-A to maintain proximity (i.e., within the battlestaff
          compartment) to VKAs and CPE when VKAs are removed while airborne.
          5.3.2.5.9. Accomplishing EAS when not ―in EWO.‖
          5.3.2.5.10. Locking the CPE in the mounting tray with one or more combination
          locks when VKAs are safed or removed while airborne when not ―in EWO.‖
       5.3.2.6. Failure to accomplish fire/overheat procedures for any ALCS fire or overheat
       indications.
   5.3.3. Reference AFGSCI 13-5302v4 for classified critical errors.
5.4. Major Errors. Assess a major error when evaluatee actions result, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, degradation to the operational mission or personnel injury.
   5.4.1. Some examples of major errors are as follows:
       5.4.1.1. Exceeding an asterisked Level A time standard, unless error is listed under
       paragraph 5.3.
       5.4.1.2. Failure to comply with cautions or T.O. safety precautions not covered by

     5.4.1.3. Failure to maintain optimum or established system configuration resulting in a
     mission degradation, or degradation to a redundant system, or degradation that delays
     accomplishment of non-time-critical mission requirements. This includes failure to note
     or report indications of mission degradation or degradation to a redundant system. This
     also includes failure to accomplish required corrective actions.
     5.4.1.4. Failure to verify equipment configuration and/or operability upon return from
     maintenance or testing. This includes failure to accomplish required upload tests or
     verifications. This applies whether preparing an aircraft for flight, or cocking an ALCS
     aircraft on alert.
     5.4.1.5. Improperly configuring or failing to configure a sortie, and the result does not
     warrant a critical error.
     5.4.1.6. Locking the CPE in the mounting tray with one or more key locks when VKAs
     are safed or removed while airborne when not ―in EWO.‖
     5.4.1.7. Failure to report a change in system status or correct change in system status,

     manner:
        5.4.1.8.1. Electronically loading the operational CV into the CPE.
        5.4.1.8.2. Failure to safe the ALCS by clearing the operational CV from the CPE or
        turning the ALCS POWER switch to OFF.
        5.4.1.8.3. Turning the ALCS POWER switch to ON, when the OFF position is
        required to safe the ALCS.
     5.4.1.9. Failure to ensure security measures are accomplished.
        5.4.1.9.1. Communications Security (COMSEC). Examples include losing control of
        COMSEC materials, compromise or possible compromise of COMSEC materials,
        and failure to report compromise to a responsible agency.
        5.4.1.9.2. Information Security (INFOSEC) and Operations Security (OPSEC).
        Examples include loss of control of classified and passing classified information over
        an unsecure line, except when authorized by applicable directives.
            5.4.1.9.2.1. Failure to pass a Possible Code Compromise (PCC) or Secret
            Procedural Violation (PV) by secure means, when secure means are available and
            required.
     5.4.1.10. Failure to accomplish an operational report or submitting an incorrect
     operations report. This includes failure to notify Mission Commander of a requirement to
     reassign wing assignments due to loss of capability.
     5.4.1.11. Incorrectly configuring any EWO communication equipment. This includes

      5.4.1.12. Failure to report (or task reporting responsibility) indications of a PCC to the
      codes division, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Global Operations Center
      (GOC), or Wing Command Post (WCP).
      5.4.1.13. Incorrectly posting pages to technical orders in sections III, IV, or V of T.O.
      21M-LGM30F-1-24, Airborne Launch Control System Operation Instructions (E-6B) in
      accordance with the A-page. Posting refers to the order and sequence of T.O. pages, not
      annotations or other administrative requirements.
      5.4.1.14. Any action that results in damage to equipment which does not meet the criteria
      of a critical error.
   5.4.2. Reference AFGSCI 13-5302v4 for classified major errors.
5.5. Minor Errors. Assess a minor error for any procedural error, omission, or deficiency
which is not significant enough to meet critical or major error criteria.
   5.5.1. Minor errors will be assessed regardless of operational impact.
   5.5.2. Evaluators may assess a minor error for lack of knowledge when evaluatees display a
   lack of knowledge on a procedural task that is not significant enough to meet critical or major
   error criteria.
5.6. Evaluation Documentation. Evaluation documentation provides a means to identify
trends, track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s
supervisor and serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
   5.6.1. A standardized evaluation report will be used for each evaluated individual to
   document details of administered evaluations/observations.
      5.6.1.1. In addition to evaluator and evaluatee information, the following information
      will be included on the evaluation report:
          5.6.1.1.1. All errors will be documented. Errors will be documented against the task
          or subtask for which the error is attributed.
              5.6.1.1.1.1. If a crew member recognizes the status change but fails to perform a
              required task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that
              should have been performed.
              5.6.1.1.1.2. If a crew member recognizes the status change but performs the
              wrong task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that should
              have been performed. However, give credit to the task or subtask that was
              performed.
              5.6.1.1.1.3. If a crew member does not recognize a status change and a resulting
              task or subtask requirement, document the error against the required task or
              subtask that should have been accomplished.
              5.6.1.1.1.4. When the task or subtask being performed directs transition to
              another task or subtask and the evaluatee fails to perform the subsequent task or
              subtask or fails to identify the requirement to transition, document the error
              against the task or subtask that directed the transition.
              5.6.1.1.1.5. If a crew member performs an unnecessary task or subtask, which
 26                                                   AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011


              causes or results in an error, document the error against the unnecessary task or
              subtask being performed.
              5.6.1.1.1.6. Error descriptions on the evaluation report will be unclassified. The
              625 STOS/ALCS will maintain a separate log for classified error descriptions.
              5.6.1.1.1.7. Following HHQ administered evaluations, HHQ evaluators or
              inspectors will provide evaluation paperwork and will identify errors in writing to
              the unit. The 625 STOS/ALCS will create and coordinate an evaluation report to
              be maintained for documentation purposes.
           5.6.1.1.2. The evaluation report will identify the script presented and evaluators will
           list all tasks and subtasks exposed during the conduct of each evaluation phase.
              5.6.1.1.2.1. A crewmember will receive credit for a JPR by performing any
              portion of a task, regardless if a checklist is used or if all actions are contained
              within another checklist.
              5.6.1.1.2.2. Evaluators awarding JPR credit are documenting the crew was
              exposed to a portion of the task.
              5.6.1.1.2.3. Evaluation reports developed by 625 STOS/ALCS following HHQ
              evaluations or inspections will only list JPRs for which errors are written against.
           5.6.1.1.3. Delinquency date information will be listed on the evaluation worksheet
           even if there is no change.
           5.6.1.1.4. A place must be provided for the 625 STOS/CC to document requirements
           for corrective actions, restricted status, and/or subsequent evaluations as a result of
           the evaluation.
           5.6.1.1.5. An evaluation type must be listed for each individual. Evaluation types
           may be different for each individual on the report. Evaluations must be annotated as
           a no-notice evaluation as applicable.
   5.6.2. Evaluation reports will be maintained in the Individual Qualification Folder (IQF) for
   each evaluatee.
       5.6.2.1. The ALCS Flight will maintain copies of any evaluation report for trend
       analysis.
       5.6.2.2. The evaluation report will be coordinated through all appropriate agencies to

                                          Chapter 6

                                    MISCELLANEOUS

6.1. Operational Performance. When a crew is interacting with the operational equipment and
procedural deviations or errors are discovered or reported, the Chief, ALCS Flight, shall be
notified in writing within 3 working days after occurrence or discovery.
   6.1.1. The TEPS/ETEPS and error definitions in Chapter 5 serve as tools or guides when
   determining corrective action and the individual’s AMR or restricted status.
   6.1.2. When a crewmember’s substandard performance would have resulted in a ―Q3‖ rating
   during an evaluation is either observed or determined, the crewmember will be restricted and
   retrained in all tasks in which they were found to be unqualified.
       6.1.2.1. The Chief, ALCS Flight will determine required follow-on training.
       6.1.2.2. The SQ/CC or SQ/DO may determine any additional corrective action(s),
       evaluation requirements, and any crew force management actions as required.
   6.1.3. Substandard operational performance will not be documented as an evaluation or an
   evaluation error. Therefore, a criticality will not be assigned to the deficiency.
       6.1.3.1. Although critical, major and minor error ratings will not be used, the
       crewmember must understand the severity of the deviations.
   6.1.4. Deviations meeting the criteria in Chapter 5 and AFGSCI 13-5302v4, as critical, will
   be documented as restrictable and will result in automatic restricted status. Deviations
   meeting major or minor criteria will be documented as non-restrictable.
       6.1.4.1. Additionally, recommendations for restriction or training may be made to the
       SQ/CC or SQ/DO, based on deviation severity or deficiency in knowledge, proficiency,
       or professionalism.
   6.1.5. Deviations will be documented using a procedural deviation worksheet which will be
   coordinated through all appropriate agencies.
       6.1.5.1. Procedural deviation worksheets will be maintained in the IQF for the
       appropriate individual.
       6.1.5.2. The ALCS Flight will maintain copies of all procedural deviation worksheets for
       trend analysis.
6.2. New or Upgrade System Requirements. For new or upgraded ALCS systems, the Chief,
ALCS Evaluation will develop the evaluation program to meet requirements within this
instruction, AFGSCI 36-283, ICBM Training System Management, and AFGSCI 10-604, Global
Strike Operational Weapon Systems Management.
   6.2.1. The Chief, ALCS Evaluation will develop specific requirements for planning a new
   evaluation program to include a validation plan and program approval strategy.
   6.2.2. The Chief, ALCS Flight will appoint a limited number of Subject Matter Experts
   (SMEs) in writing. The primary duty of the SME is to develop technical documentation,
   evaluation materials, and to conduct AMR evaluations.
30                                                 AFGSCI13-5302v2 12 OCTOBER 2011


     6.2.2.1. Document SME appointment on the individual’s AFGSC Form 92 or AFGSC
     Form 91/91A. Forward the SME designation memorandum through the chain of
     command directly to HQ AFGSC/A3T and 20 AF/A3N.
  6.2.3. SMEs who conduct AMR evaluations or initial [post-Initial Operational Capacity
  (IOC)] system operations must be AMR certified. To maintain AMR status, they must be
  evaluated on all applicable tasks or complete a qualification evaluation within 60 calendar
  days of removal from SME status or within 90 calendar days from system IOC (whichever is
  sooner).
     6.2.3.1. Once evaluations are complete and an individual is certified, document
     certification on the AFGSC Form 92 or AFGSC Form 91/91A.
  6.2.4. MCCC-As trained by the SMEs will be evaluated within 90 calendar days from
  system IOC.
     6.2.5. Where new operational programs will not meet IOC, HQ AFGSC will staff a
     proposal for that system’s evaluation program.
