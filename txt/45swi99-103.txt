This instruction prescribes the format and lead times for the Range Users submission of telemetry (TLM)
Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) data. The format and lead times are necessary for the Eastern Range
(ER) to prepare, verify and distribute required software and firmware. It applies to all Range users at the
ER, to all personnel associated with or assigned to the ER, and to all contractors and subcontractors on the
ER needing or providing TDM data.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication deletes obsolete Pulse Amplitude Modulation and Pulse Duration Modulation formats
and clarifies lead times for the Range Users submission of TDM format data. A bar (|) indicates a revision
from the previous edition.


1. Terms Explained. For the purpose of this instruction the following terms apply:
   1.1. Range User. Any DoD organization, other US government agency, state or local government;
   civic, private, or commercial organization; or foreign government program approved by the 45 SW
   Commander or designated representative, to use range facilities or resources.
   1.2. Program. A system test, operation, or other activity conducted by a Range User on the ER or
   requiring ER support.

2. Duties and Responsibilities.
   2.1. The Program Support Manager (PSM), 1 Range Operations Squadron (1 ROPS), will determine
   if a meeting between the Range User and ER personnel is necessary to resolve any discrepancies
   between the Range User's requirements and ER capabilities and further, to avoid any misconceptions
   or misinterpretations. This meeting should be held a minimum of ten months prior to the first sched-
2                                                                       45SWI99-103 1 AUGUST 2005


    uled use of the TLM time division multiplexed data and will be called and chaired by the PSM and
    supported by appropriate wing personnel.
    2.2. The Range User will provide the telemetry format information described in the following attach-
    ments (including computer entry tape formatting and data reduction needs) in the Program Require-
    ments Document (PRD); or in a separate document or documents referred to in the PRD. Refer to the
    manuals applicable to the PRD for instructions concerning the information required and the specified
    lead times, as well as to the information and lead times contained in this instruction.
    2.3. Range Users will, in combination with the requirements in paragraph 2.2., be prepared to discuss
    the operations of their internal guidance systems and the manner in which their data is processed and
    telemetered. The Eastern Range uses this data to compute the instantaneous position and predicted
    impact point of the flight hardware and to display them in real time for the Mission Flight Control
    Officer (MFCO).
    2.4. The 45 Range Management Squadron (45 RMS) will manage range operation and maintenance
    contract or range system support issues as agreed to between the Range User and the PSM. RMS will
    appoint project personnel as required to initiate, monitor, and verify modifications or enhancements to
    range contracts and/or range systems to meet validated Range User requirements.

3. Procedures. The ER telemetry data format information requirements for TDM data are shown in
Attachment 1. The Range User must uniquely identify each parameter within the TDM format. The
range user must supply six copies of the format document and two copies of serial magnetic tapes or dig-
ital recording in Eastern Range compatible format to 1 ROPS.
    3.1. Data Submission Timelines. The time required for TDM format submission depends on pro-
    gram requirements. New range users or programs requiring range modification must supply TDM for-
    mat documentation with the PRD. The PRD timeline enables depot level acquisition and test of TLM
    resources supporting Range User requirements. Existing programs having minor operation and main-
    tenance format changes must supply TDM format documentation at least 210 working days prior to
    first scheduled use of range telemetry systems. Programs having TDM format changes affecting only
    Decommutators must supply TDM documentation at least 90 working days prior to first scheduled
    use.

   mission requirements.

                       ER GUIDANCE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. General. The following information is required as a prerequisite to software development and
modification. Because each guidance system is unique, the requirements listed in this attachment are
guidelines to help the range user prepare for meeting the requirements in the basic instruction.

A3.2. Details.
   A3.2.1. Bit weights, register sizes, floating or fixed point number systems, scale factors, etc.
   A3.2.2. Algorithms needed to convert the vehicle guidance coordinate system to the Earth-fixed EFG
   system used at the Eastern Range in which E is positive through Greenwich Meridian, G is positive
   through the North Pole and F completes a right-handed coordinate system. The algorithms must
   account for the need to use telemetered guidance times, and define whether or not they are homoge-
   neous with the vectors. They must take into account the Earth model used, the reference spheroid, etc.
   A3.2.3. Define the delays associated with time-tagging; i.e., time is initially at some value and begins
   to increment some specific time before or after the guidance system goes inertial.
   A3.2.4. Define the alignment of the vehicle coordinate system axes relative to the launch complex.
   A3.2.5. Provide a magnetic tape or digital recording containing the telemetered guidance data inter-
   laced, as on launch day, with other telemetry information. On this tape, the guidance system must be
   made to go inertial, and the inertial conditions provided in an accompanying description. This tape is
   required as a consequence of early testing of the guidance interface with the telemetry system. In addi-
   tion, the Eastern Range must be notified of all tests conducted on the launch complex in which the
   guidance system is commanded to the inertial mode, so the range may make a magnetic tape of the
   resulting telemetry data. This last minute tape will serve as a final validation of our configuration and
   is not a substitute for the earlier tape.
