SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision changes unit designation from 939th Rescue Wing to 939th Air Refueling Wing. A bar ( | )

   of recruiting and retaining qualified, committed reservists to support the wing’s mission. Therefore, a
   wing process action team (PAT) was formed to address identified problems with the previously exist-
   ing newcomers' orientation program. The newcomers' orientation flight was developed as a result of
   this PAT process with an intended goal of making organizational newcomers feel more welcome and
   providing initial training that will render new members an immediate asset to their units.
