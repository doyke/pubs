for reprogramming U-2 electronic warfare (EW) systems to respond to changing threats. It
outlines the responsibilities, alerting procedures, and reporting for Electronic Warfare Integrated
Reprogramming (EWIR) in the event PACER WARE (PW) or SERENE BYTE (SB)
reprogramming is required for U-2 EW systems. Because EWIR requires multiple 9 RW
organizations, operating locations and external agencies to work together, each must comply
with these instructions to ensure reprogramming is timely, accurate and effective. Refer

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and a complete review of its contents is necessary.
This revision was completed to improve EWIR and related processes to aerospace operations.
Tasks assigned to MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, and individual units are changed to reflect current
operating procedures. Additional units formed since the last revision are included.           In
accordance with the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Memorandum for Chief of Staffs,
Use of Defense Message System (DMS) for Official Information (OI) Transfer, 26 Nov 2008,
the Air Force is planning to significantly reduce the operational use of the Defense Message
System (DMS). To further ensure sufficient elimination/reduction, all Air Force Instruction
(AFI) and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) references to DMS that require or otherwise direct
USAF organizations to use DMS for their missions operations need to be deleted or altered so
that the USAF organizations are not required or directed to use DMS. This change updates or
deletes several paragraphs in this AFI. New message procedures are developed and included.

(BEALE) This supplement has been substantially revised and should be reviewed in its entirety.
This revision re-assigns responsibilities for EWIR notification and reprogramming tasks between
contract field service representatives (CFSR) and Air Force maintenance sections accordingly. It
deletes references to System 56-1/29E/29F and refers only to the currently fielded U-2 EW
system, AN/ALQ-221. New information includes updated detail, flowcharts, action worksheets

and requirements for Multi-Service Data Distribution System (MSDDS) access. 9th Operation
Group Commander (9 OG/CC) is responsible for validating any requirement(s), as recommended
by the EWIR action team or 36th Electronic Warfare Squadron (36 EWS/EWM), for
reprogramming of U-2 EW systems. 9 OG/CC is also the final approval

(BEALE) authority for all U-2 EW reprogramming actions (after applicable Implementation
Message (IMP) and/or Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM) is received). Additional changes
are incorporated aligning paragraph numbering with the parent AFI.

                                           Chapter 1

                         PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND PROCESS

1.1. Purpose. Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) is a systematic process
designed to increase aircrew survivability and mission success while operating in an environment
characterized by friendly, neutral and hostile threat systems that use the electromagnetic (EM)
spectrum. EWIR provides a capability to characterize the EM emissions of hostile and other
systems, analyze and model their impact on operations, and to incorporate these characteristics to
enable rapid detection, accurate identification and appropriate response within the EM spectrum.
EWIR functions within the scope of electronic warfare (EW).
1.2. Objectives. EWIR’s ultimate objective is the production and delivery of software and
hardware changes to electronic equipment used to provide an awareness and response capability
within the EM spectrum. Providing an appropriate EW awareness and response capability may
require EWIR to be used in conjunction with changes in tactics, techniques and procedures
(TTP), equipment employment guidance, aircrew training and training devices (e.g., threat
simulators and threat emitters) and other support systems. Attaining this ultimate objective in
support of Combat Air Forces (CAF), Mobility Air Forces (MAF), Special Operations Forces
(SOF), and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) assets requires the Air Force to coordinate with the
Intelligence Community (IC) to:
   1.2.1. Employ an intelligence capability that rapidly collects, identifies, compares, analyzes,
   and distributes all-source intelligence information in support of EW reprogramming during
   peacetime and all phases of conflict.
   1.2.2. Employ Order of Battle (OB) and other databases that provide an "electronic fit" (EW-
   system-to-weapon-system-platform correlation) of threats to generate regional mission data
   (MD). The USAF works with the IC to ensure OB and related databases meet EWIR
   requirements.
   1.2.3. Sustain a modernized integrated set of databases to include the EWIR Database
   (EWIRDB) and others to provide an accurate, timely, and worldwide-accessible observed
   and assessed parametric data (measured to meet power, pattern, and polarization (P-cubed)
   requirements), electronic attack data, communications externals data, platform-emitter fit,
   characteristics and performance data (including engine data), signatures data (antenna pattern
   data, radar cross section, and electro-optic/infrared signatures), Specific Emitter
   Identification (SEI) related data, and additional data as requirements evolve for use in the
   reprogramming of onboard EW/EM sensor systems.
   1.2.4. Support joint applications and joint and combined interoperability by disseminating
   worldwide EW-related data in formats usable by operations and mission planning tools and
   systems. Develop processes and tools for the evaluation of theater and unit EW operations,
   and sufficient analytic capability to plan, monitor and assess EW operations and the impact
   of EW on operations.
   1.2.5. Develop, acquire and sustain facilities, equipment, personnel and resources to gather
   and interpret the required parametric and characteristics & performance (C&P) data for US
   military and FMS systems in accordance with (IAW) CJCSI 3210.03C, Joint Electronic
 6                                                   AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


     Warfare Policy, CJCSI 3210.04, Joint Electronic Warfare Reprogramming Policy, and this
     instruction.
     1.2.6. Develop, acquire and sustain EWIR support structures and processes that include
     doctrine, TTPs, employment guidance, and EWIR training at all command levels.
     1.2.7. Develop, acquire and sustain EWIR reach back procedures and mechanisms.
     1.2.8. Develop, acquire and sustain research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E)
     resources to improve EW reprogramming to ensure effectiveness in an evolving EM
     environment.
     1.2.9. Develop, acquire and sustain facilities, equipment, personnel and procedures to create,
     test, and distribute EW software and hardware changes to provide the capability to detect and
     identify friendly, neutral, and adversary EM signals to improve warfighter response and
     survivability against hostile threat systems that use the EM spectrum.
     1.2.10. Develop, acquire, and sustain timely, worldwide secure, and survivable means to
     send and/or receive reprogramming change information.
1.3. EWIR Process. The EWIR process is made up of four different steps (See Figure 1-1
below). These steps are: 1) detect change; 2) determine impact; 3) reprogram; and 4) field
change. This process is referred to by the unclassified code name PACER WARE. PACER
WARE includes mission data (MD) changes, operational flight program (OFP) changes, or
minor hardware changes that comply with the guidance in AFI 63-131 concerning modifications.
These changes are categorized into 3 priority levels: ROUTINE, URGENT and EMERGENCY.
Routine changes are accomplished as part of normal update cycles. Urgent changes during crisis
periods, are accomplished during normal duty hours, but take precedence over other activities
until complete. Urgent changes should reach the field within 72 hours. However, acceptable
timelines for urgent changes are negotiated between the applicable MAJCOM and
reprogramming center (RC). Emergency changes affecting combat operations, require 24-hour
operations, with the goal of releasing necessary changes within 24 hours. A number of products
are used to implement the EWIR process (see Figure 1-1); procedures for using these products
are described in Chapter 3.

  1.3.1. Detect Change:
     1.3.1.1. The US Intelligence Community collects and evaluates a wide variety of data on
     foreign systems using multiple sources and makes these data available in databases
     accessible by the RCs and other agencies. Of the potential sources for intelligence,
     Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence, Foreign Materiel Exploitation
     (FME) and Open Source Intelligence are the most common used to identifying EM
     characteristics of enemy systems. (This data is referred to as RED [adversary] and GRAY
     [other foreign military] data.) Other data sources may include data acquired via testing
     and evaluation of exported (GRAY) systems.
     1.3.1.2. Along with the RED & GRAY data provided by the Intelligence Community,
     other types of data are essential to programming EW systems to correctly identify and
     respond to signals they detect. These other types of data include characteristics of US
     military systems (BLUE data), and commercial systems (WHITE data). All these data
     types are provided to RCs via EWIRDB and other sources, and are used to program EW
     systems to correctly identify systems by their EM characteristics. See Attachment 3 for
     more information on data types.
     1.3.1.3. Intelligence data is filtered manually or through computer flagging models to
     detect what threats/signals have changed. This is one way to begin the process to
     determine how the change impacts EW systems. Periodic data review IAW CJCSI
     3210.03C also identifies required changes. In addition, EW equipment anomalies
     reported by aircrew in post mission reports (MISREPs) and/or Joint Spectrum
     Interference Reports (JSIRs) may also start this process (see para 2.4.4.2). All-source
     validation assessments by Intelligence and/or Service Production Centers (IPCs/SPCs)
     and observed signals validation assessments by the National Security Agency (NSA) of
8                                                  AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


       signal changes are recommended to assist in the determination that actual EM parameter
       changes have occurred in a given emitter.
       1.3.1.4. Of note: BLUE and WHITE data are produced, databased, and used in
       reprogramming updates. Signal information on USAF platforms, and target/environment
       information obtained to support USAF platforms, needs to be shared through the USAF
       EWIR processes. The purpose of BLUE and WHITE data is similar to that of
       RED/GRAY data--to accurately identify collected EM characteristics.
       1.3.1.5. Additionally, EW software reprogramming updates may be consolidated and
       produced to correct deficiencies and/or make improvements in system performance.
       Typically, these software changes are handled as routine updates, but in some cases these
       changes become more pressing if the operational situation dictates. RCs must maintain
       close coordination with affected MAJCOMs and remain flexible to meet fielding
       requirements.
    1.3.2. Determine Impact:
       1.3.2.1. RCs continue the process of assessing the threat change impact on an EW
       system by performing engineering analysis, as well as laboratory tests.
       1.3.2.2. The RC, in coordination with the affected MAJCOMs and/or COMAFFOR
       (usually JFACC/CFACC’s Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC) as described
       in Joint Publication 3-13.1, Electronic Warfare), determines how to respond to the threat
       change. The response may be:
           1.3.2.2.1. Take no action.
           1.3.2.2.2. Change existing tactics.
           1.3.2.2.3. Reprogram MD and/or OFP system software.
           1.3.2.2.4. Change existing hardware.
           1.3.2.2.5. Acquire new hardware.
       1.3.2.3. The RC reports the impact of the threat change, the effect on the EW system, an
       interim course of action, and recommended course of action to the affected units, the
       MAJCOM and JFACC/CFACC in a System Impact Message (SIM). Critical messages
       may warrant verbal contact with the units, MAJCOM and/or EWCC to facilitate
       “pulling” these SIMs (and other reprogramming messages) from the Multi-Service Data
       Distribution System (MSDDS).
    1.3.3. Reprogram. If changing the EW system MD and/or system software is the determined
    course of action, the RCs:
       1.3.3.1. Notify affected MAJCOM(s) of intent to develop the software and/or MD
       change.
       1.3.3.2. Test the change in the laboratory (hardware-in-the-loop, computer simulation, or
       critical analysis).
       1.3.3.3. Determine MD/system software compatibility with applicable field loading
       equipment [e.g., Program Loader Verifiers (PLV), Memory Loader Verifiers (MLV),
       Enhanced Diagnostic Aide (EDNA), Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                       9


     Equipment (CAPRE)] and applicable O-level support equipment [e.g., USM-670, USM-
     464, PLM-4, APM-427, and Enhanced Automated Special Test Equipment (EASTE)].
     Tests to determine MD compatibility will be performed prior to fielding ROUTINE and
     URGENT changes. EMERGENCY MD changes may be fielded prior to the tests being
     performed. OFP changes will always be tested against support equipment. If the support
     equipment indicates a previously undetected failure with the changed MD/OFP installed
     and the MD/OFP is determined to be the cause of the fault, the following actions should
     occur:
         1.3.3.3.1. Describe the failure in the Maintenance Instruction Message (MIM) /
         Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM) and the appropriate actions/workarounds that
         should be taken (e.g., ignore--does not indicate a true failure mode).
         1.3.3.3.2. Contact the support RC and request a change to the support equipment
         software to eliminate the false failure.
     1.3.3.4. Flight test the change, if required. Conduct testing IAW CJCSM 3212.02B,
     Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training, and
     Exercises. The Air Force Frequency Management Agency (AFFMA) is the focal point
     for frequency management in support of EW within the US and Possessions.
     1.3.3.5. RC making software change will take overall lead to coordinate with Support
     Reprogramming Centers and platform System Program Managers (SPM)s. This process
     is critical to facilitate long lead efforts [i.e., SPM Time Compliance Technical Order
     (TCTO) development, SPM validation/verification, scheduling, etc.].
     1.3.3.6. SPMs must take appropriate steps to ensure MAJCOM A3 directed timelines
     and guidance are adhered to during the implementation process. SPMs are responsible
     to identify and ensure all actions necessary are accomplished for their Mission Design
     Series (MDS). SPMs will also evaluate all software prior to MAJCOM implementation
     decision and notify the MAJCOM if flight or ground testing is required.
     1.3.3.7. Recommend fielding of the software and/or MD change to the MAJCOM and/or
     EWCC. If software affects multiple aircraft (i.e. different MDS with same EW system
     installed), the RC will coordinate with the SPMs prior to making the fielding
     recommendation to MAJCOM.            Fielding recommendations imply that both the RC
     developing the software and the SPM responsible for aircraft configuration have
     completed all necessary actions (i.e., ground/flight/system integration lab testing,
     technical order documentation, etc.), prior to recommending to MAJCOM or EWCC the
     software is ready to install.
  1.3.4. Field Change:
     1.3.4.1. After coordinating with the MAJCOM and/or EWCCs, the RCs distribute the
     software changes to operational units and to platform System Program Managers (SPM)
     electronically through classified organizational PACER WARE SIPRnet email accounts
     as well as posting it on the MSDDS. (The MSDDS is accessible via the SIPRNet at the
     Electronic Combat Support Facility (ECSF) homepage http://ecsf.afsoc.af.smil.mil or
     the EW Toolbox-- http://ewtoolbox.eglin.af.smil.mil and via direct secure
     communications equipment connection to the MSDDS.) Operational unit commanders
     then implement changes based on the guidance in this instruction.
 10                                              AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


      1.3.4.2. OFP software updates are normally implemented through the TCTO process.
      SPMs will staff TCTOs through appropriate MAJCOM A3/A4 offices for approval to
      release OFP software.        MD software is typically implemented by PACER WARE
      message, upon MAJCOM A3 approval. If both MD and OFP software are changed, they
      may be implemented together via TCTO. However, when OFPs are changed in time
      critical circumstances (URGENT & EMERGENCY) the SPMs must coordinate with the
      RCs and release the TCTO in conjunction with approved PACER WARE messages
      within MAJCOM directed timelines. Upon approval to implement or release software for
      fielding, the software will be distributed to EW maintenance shops via MSDDS.
      Installation instructions for MD, and MD bundled with an OFP are typically in the form
      of a Maintenance Instruction Message (MIM) or embedded in a Reprogramming Impact
      Message (RIM). MD only changes are not considered an aircraft modification as
      described in AFI 63-131 Modification Program Management, therefore a Form 1067
      Modification Request is not required. If technical orders are impacted by MD change
      (occurs if changes impact test / walk-around procedures), the 542nd Combat Sustainment
      Group (CBSG) and/or platform SPM will update the technical data and release the update
      in a TCTO.
      1.3.4.3. The MAJCOM and/or EWCC use the RIM, along with previous coordination
      with RCs, to determine whether to install the new software in their units' EW equipment
      and the priority used to implement the change. If the MAJCOM A3 and/or EWCC
      decide to install the software, they authorize the installation using an Implementation
      Message (IMP). The IMP is authorization, not direction, to load software. After
      coordination with the Joint EWCC Command Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO),
      JFACC EWCC and/or Air Mobility Division (AMD) Tactics Section [for Mobility Air
      Forces (MAF)], as applicable, the Wing/Group EWO advises the commander who makes
      the final decision on which software to load.
      1.3.4.4. Once units have installed the software/MD in their EW systems, they report this
      to their MAJCOM, EWCC, and the RCs using the Unit Loading Message (ULM) within
      72 hours of completion, indicating implementation status and issues affecting 100%
      aircraft upload. Instructions and/or contact information for ULM reporting will be
      outlined in applicable documentation (e.g., IMP, SIM, RIM, MIM).
      1.3.4.5. PACER WARE      message        templates              are     available      in
      EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library on the MSDDS.
1.4. Key EWIR Organizations. The following are those organizations with primary EWIR
responsibilities within the USAF:
   1.4.1. 53rd Electronic Warfare Group (53 EWG), 53rd Wing, Eglin AFB, FL. The 53 EWG
   is an operational RC. They develop, modify, and test MD for CAF and Combat Search and
   Rescue (CSAR) aircraft and selected FMS-supported aircraft. They maintain engineering,
   operational, and intelligence expertise and provide technical support for OFP updates and
   testing, fielding of new EW systems, EW-related training, EW system configuration control,
   and other EW and EWIR issues.
      1.4.1.1. 453rd Electronic Warfare Squadron (453 EWS), Lackland AFB, TX. As part of
      the 53 EWG, the 453 EWS conducts parametric and model-based flagging of SIGINT
      data to identify new or modified threat emitters. They also archive data on BLUE
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                         11


     systems/emitters and assigned GRAY and WHITE emitters, and incorporate them into
     the US Electromagnetic Systems Database (USELMSDB), and its follow-on--the US
     Relational Electromagnetic Systems Database (USRELMSDB). They also maintain and
     archive signature data on aircraft radar cross section (RCS), electro-optical/infrared
     (EO/IR) and antenna patterns into the Blue Airborne Target Signatures (BATS) database.
     Additionally, they produce the Combat Support Data Base (CSDB) which combines
     threat system parameters and BLUE aircraft signatures into a cohesive file that is used in
     mission planning systems. They develop and operate analytic capabilities necessary for
     the support of EW mission planning, threat assessments, acquisition, and training. Their
     expertise includes the fields of intelligence analysis (especially SIGINT), engineering
     analysis, data production, modeling & simulation and Distributed Mission Operations.
  1.4.2. 542nd Combat Sustainment Group (542 CBSG), Air Force Materiel Command
  (AFMC), Robins AFB, GA. Two units within the 542 CBSG support reprogramming: the
  EW Avionics Integration Support Facility (EWAISF) and the 562nd Combat Sustainment
  Squadron (562 CBSS).
     1.4.2.1. 542 CBSG EWAISF is a support RC. It develops, modifies and tests OFP for
     most CAF, MAF, and SOF aircraft (except those whose OFP development is contracted
     out). It maintains engineering and intelligence expertise for most US Air Force systems.
     It supports the operational RCs during the building and testing of MD changes.
     1.4.2.2. 562 CBSS acts as an OFP, MD and test support RC for FMS. It conducts
     reprogramming of certain FMS EW systems and acts as an operational RC in this
     capacity. Also, it acts as a support RC in support of other FMS systems and processes.
     This squadron is responsible for some FMS MD development as agreed to with
     AFSOC/ECSF and the 53 EWG.
  1.4.3. Electronic Combat Support Facility (ECSF), HQ AFSOC/A3, Robins AFB, GA.
  ECSF is AFSOC’s and AMC’s operational RC whose primary mission is to develop, modify,
  test and maintain MD for assigned SOF and MAF aircraft. ECSF maintains engineering,
  operational, and intelligence expertise and provides technical support for OFP updates and
  testing, acquisition and fielding of new EW systems, EW-related training, EW system
  modification and configuration control, and other EW and EWIR issues.
  1.4.4. National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) EWIRDB Executive Agent,
  Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The EWIRDB Executive Agent office is responsible for hosting
  and disseminating the EWIR Database. NASIC is also the Air Force Technical Electronic
  Intelligence (Tech ELINT) executive agent and airborne Tech ELINT processing center.
  1.4.5. The Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC), as a field production activity
  under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Directorate for Analysis, is responsible for
  management of the EWIRDB/Next Generation EWIRDB System (NGES) program. The
  program management office is DIA/MSIC/MSD-4.

   survivability. These actions include, but are not limited to:
       2.9.3.1. Notifying aircrews of loss or degradation of EW capability.
       2.9.3.2. Notifying aircrews on use of new EW tactics.
       2.9.3.3. Recommending threat area avoidance tactics.
       2.9.3.4. Advising diversion of attack forces to other targets based on threat assessments.
       2.9.3.5. Advising use of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) assets.
       2.9.3.6. Review of SIM recommendations.
   2.9.4. Distribute reprogramming change information to joint and combined organizations to
   ensure interoperability and avoid EW frequency conflicts.

   2.9.5. Report friendly force anomalies leading to false identifications or inappropriate
   responses and requests supporting IPCs, RCs, SPCs and National SIGINT authorities to
   perform validation assessments of these anomalies.
   2.9.6. Review Operational Reports (OPREP), MISREPs, EWIR messages and flight reports
   (FLTREPs). Ensure applicable theater MISREPs and JSIRs are sent to supporting RCs and
   453 EWS. Analyze these reports and messages to find:
      2.9.6.1. Unusual EW equipment operation.
      2.9.6.2. Changes in engagement tactics.
      2.9.6.3. Changes in successful engagement rates.
   2.9.7. Request 53 EWG/453 EWS provide 24-hour emergency flagging analysis and
   reprogramming as required.
   2.9.8. Ensure units deployed to their theater have the capability to quickly receive and
   upload reprogramming data.
   2.9.9. Ensure deployed units have all required equipment to perform rapid reprogramming,
   to include EW support equipment including PLVs, MLVs, CAPRE, EDNA, secure
   communications devices, mission support facilities, etc.
   2.9.10. As delegated by the JFACC/CFACC, assess the need for and, if deemed necessary,
   coordinate and implement software changes from the RCs for its combat units. Factors to
   consider in determining whether to implement a change include:
      2.9.10.1. Nature and lethality of the threat change within the JFACC/CFACC AOR.
      2.9.10.2. Planned force movement.
      2.9.10.3. Critical timing.
2.10. EWIR Committee and Subcommittees:
   2.10.1. Oversight Committee. This committee provides a forum for the key functions and
   organizations within the EWIR community to exchange information and take action to
   improve EWIR. The committee reviews subcommittee actions and mediates solutions to
   unresolved problems. It advocates EWIR requirements within the DOD and works with
   other services to seek areas of commonality, ensure interoperability, share best practices, and
   minimize duplication. The following are mandates for the committee:
      2.10.1.1. Meetings will convene as necessary and may be conducted in person or through
      virtual collaboration.
      2.10.1.2. Committee membership is detailed in the EWIR Membership Matrix in
      Attachment 2. Other USAF, Joint, DOD, and service organizations may be invited to
      attend.
   2.10.2. EWIR Subcommittees. EWIR subcommittees focus on an aspect of EWIR needing
   greater attention than the Oversight Committee can provide. Action items, including
   recommendations, will be reviewed by the Oversight Committee as required, and
   approved/disapproved for implementation and/or closure.
2.11. EW Acquisition Centers will:
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                             33


  2.11.1. Develop, conduct developmental testing for, produce, and distribute initial
  operational OFPs for all EW systems under development or modification or delegate these
  tasks to the Support Reprogramming Centers (542 CBSG), as required. Also ensure:
     2.11.1.1. Users receive fully developed and tested EW systems including system
     software and mission data meeting the operational capabilities that have been specified
     based on operational need.
     2.11.1.2. Systems in development or under contract that have not been transferred to an
     RC like the 542 CBSG and 53 EWG for OFP and MD support must follow the same RC
     procedures described in this instruction unless a waiver is obtained through HQ
     AF/A5RE.
     2.11.1.3. Appropriate Reprogramming Center (RC) is equipped with MD generators to
     rapidly reprogram the new or modified system prior to DT&E and OT&E. Tools which
     are common across the EW system portfolio will be given precedence in the selection
     process.
     2.11.1.4. Acquisition plans include provisions for these fully tested items, both at the RC
     and in the field as required, prior to IOC:
         2.11.1.4.1. Reprogramming support tools [including Mission Data generators, hot
         bench mock-ups, emulators, support computers, and necessary line replaceable units
         (LRUs) and shop replaceable units (SRUs)]. Tools which are common across the EW
         system portfolio will be given precedence in the selection process.
         2.11.1.4.2. Data transfer/loading equipment and any necessary aircraft adapter group
         (AAG) components. [As of this writing, Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming
         Equipment (CAPRE) is the USAF standard support equipment for this function]. Host
         platform single point reprogramming of installed EW systems should be used when
         possible.
         2.11.1.4.3. Support equipment (field and depot-level) and all aspects of software
         reprogramming and support facilities. End-to-end testing of installed and integrated
         systems including all sensors, receivers, data buses, transmitters, dispensers and
         displays should be used whenever possible to test the system’s capability to detect
         and react to the threat.
     2.11.1.4.4. Software reprogrammable blanking systems to deconflict EW systems and
     other onboard receiver/transmitter systems must be included in the platform integration
     and in the support centers. Blanking directly impacts system performance and blanking
     strategies must balance safety and performance impacts on all affected aircraft systems.
     Any software or hardware changes to aircraft systems that impact transmitted outputs
     from EW or other platform avionics must be evaluated for blanking impacts and any
     required blanking setting changes must be tested and fielded concurrently with the system
     changes.
  2.11.2. Plan, integrate, and acquire new EWIR systems to support the new or modified EW
  system.
  2.11.3. Identify opportunities for acquiring joint systems to perform the operational need.
34                                                AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


  2.11.4. Use the EWIRDB as the primary source for the development of mission data for the
  EW system. (This includes if the EW system is supported via International Agreements). If
  there are information gaps in EWIRDB, coordinate with appropriate RC to identify approved
  information sources to be used to support the development of mission data for the new or
  modified EW system.
  2.11.5. Provide logistics and engineering support for hardware and software elements of new
  or modified EW system and its associated support, training, and range simulator equipment.
  2.11.6. Work with the Support Reprogramming Centers (542 CBSG) and appropriate
  Operational RC to establish facilities and personnel to analyze, develop, and test changes to:
     2.11.6.1. OFP.
     2.11.6.2. EW system support tools.
     2.11.6.3. Support equipment software.
  2.11.7. Facilities for complete EW system laboratory testing.
  2.11.8. Equipment used to transmit EW software changes to units worldwide (e.g.,
  MSDDS).
  2.11.9. Provide MD support when requested by the RC which is developing the mission data
  for test and evaluation of the new or modified EW system.
  2.11.10. Identify, obtain and/or develop EW systems software reprogramming tools and
  blanker reprogramming tools in coordination with the Support Reprogramming Centers (542
  CBSG). Tools which are common across the EW system portfolio will be given precedence
  in the selection process.
  2.11.11. Provide data necessary (including parametric and C&P data) for 453 EWS to
  develop and maintain accurate databases and flagging tools.
  2.11.12. Provide assistance to parent MAJCOM in developing guidance and tasking to 453
  EWS for formulating flagging tools.
  2.11.13. Derive plans from a new or modified system’s Life Cycle Management Plan.
  2.11.14. If applicable, provide EW engineering and logistics support to allied and friendly
  nations through FMS EWIR, as detailed in Chapter 5.
  2.11.15. Notify AF/A5RE and the appropriate MAJCOM, JFACC/CFACC, and NASIC of
  FMS sales of new or modified EW equipment (including software updates).
  2.11.16. Coordinate the foreign release of capabilities/data (including software) with all
  affected MAJCOMs and agencies.

                                         Chapter 3

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

3.1. EWIR Deficiency Reporting. Organizations and individuals performing EWIR must
identify EW deficiencies via the OCR (see PACER WARE Database Users Guide
https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/pacerware). OCR message templates are located in
EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library on the MSDDS.
   3.1.1. EW deficiencies may come from:
      3.1.1.1. New threats.
      3.1.1.2. Changed parameters of existing threats.
      3.1.1.3. Aircrew or maintenance personnel interested in improving system operation
      including support equipment or requests for specific mission data updates.
      3.1.1.4. Changes in operational environment.
      3.1.1.5. Changes in the intended use of the EW equipment.
   3.1.2. OCR Process:
      3.1.2.1. OCRs are typically issued by the operational RCs. However, the Wing/Group
      CSO/EWO/ECP can send an OCR to their MAJCOM and/or EWCC with an
      informational copy to the appropriate operational RC. Units requesting specific MD
      updates should send the OCR to the operational RC with a copy to the MAJCOM.
      3.1.2.2. The MAJCOM or EWCC validates the request and tasks the appropriate RC
      with developing corrective action.
      3.1.2.3. The MAJCOM/EWCC and RC prioritize and evaluate the OCR and suggest
      methods for implementation.
      3.1.2.4. The operational RC may send a software change message (SCM) to the
      supporting RC when the OCR affects the OFP, EW system hardware, etc.
   3.1.3. Prioritizing OCRs. Originators submit OCRs with either an EMERGENCY,
   URGENT, or ROUTINE priority. The priority of the OCR will be included in the text of the
   message.
   3.1.4. Validating OCRs. ACC, as the CAF lead, will validate all CAF OCRs and task out to
   the appropriate RC. ACC will also reprioritize all CAF OCRs as necessary. AMC, as the
   MAF lead, will validate all MAF OCRs and task out to the appropriate RC. AFSOC, as the
   Air Force SOF lead, will validate all Air Force SOF OCRs and task out to the appropriate
   RC. AFGSC, will validate all AFGSC OCRs and task out to the appropriate RC.
      3.1.4.1. Emergency changes are worked, to the exclusion of all other activities, by the
      RCs on a 24-hour basis until complete.
      3.1.4.2. An Urgent OCR should be submitted with a “need” date, and actual timelines
      and level of effort will be determined by negotiation between the submitting MAJCOM
      and the RC. These changes normally take precedence over any other activity except
      emergency changes.
 36                                                 AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


       3.1.4.3. Routine OCRs are normally scheduled and included in block cycle updates for
       the affected EW equipment.
   3.1.5. Originators submit Emergency OCR messages:
       3.1.5.1. To change operational characteristics that might seriously threaten national
       security.
       3.1.5.2. When a condition exists preventing an adequate response to a threat, and the
       situation warrants immediate action.
       3.1.5.3. To change operational characteristics that might result in fatal or serious injury
       or extensive equipment damage or destruction.
   3.1.6. Originators submit Urgent OCR messages:
       3.1.6.1. To change operational characteristics that might seriously threaten mission
       effectiveness.
       3.1.6.2. When a condition exists preventing an adequate response to a threat-associated
       system, and the situation is normal but warrants immediate action.
       3.1.6.3. To change operational characteristics that might result in injury or equipment
       change.
   3.1.7. Originators submit Routine OCR messages when:
       3.1.7.1. The system has a high probability of correctly responding to a threat or can
       compensate for threat and friendly emitter changes but minor deficiencies exist that may
       show an error.
       3.1.7.2. The situation is normal and does not warrant immediate action.
       3.1.7.3. The deficiencies or errors are not a hazard to personnel or equipment.
       3.1.7.4. Changes in training MD are desired.
3.2. Implementing Changes. When directed by appropriate authority, units load software
reprogramming changes to CC (combat) coded aircraft. With Wing/CC (or designated
representative) approval, units will schedule and upload software changes on TF (training) and
CB (test) coded aircraft as soon as possible, on a non-interference basis with programmed
training and testing. A MAJCOM implementation message is authorization, not necessarily
direction, to load new software. The Wing/Group EWO advises the commander who makes the
final decision on which software to load.
   3.2.1. Messages. EWIR messages and data are normally sent in the order listed below.
   However, many factors can affect when an agency/unit receives these messages and in what
   order they are received. These factors include, but are not limited to, priority of the
   change(s), location of the originator, common-user messaging system traffic congestion, unit
   distribution policies, and whether or not the unit has MSDDS capability.
       3.2.1.1. SIM. Usually the first time a unit knows a threat change has occurred. Unit may
       receive one SIM followed shortly by the RIM, MIM or TCTO, and IMP for a particular
       EW system. Or, it may receive a number of SIMs affecting a particular EW system, over
       a period of time, before the RIM, MIM or TCTO, and IMP for that system is received.
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                         37


     3.2.1.2. RIM, MIM or TCTO. During emergency or high priority software changes,
     these messages are usually coordinated to be sent at approximately the same time. Due to
     the factors described above, the actual order the unit receives them may vary. For routine
     changes, the order and time elapsed between messages may vary widely.
     3.2.1.3. IMP. During emergency or high priority software changes, the unit can expect to
     receive the IMP at nearly the same time as, or shortly after, the above messages. For
     routine changes, the timing of IMP release may vary widely. MAJCOMs may choose to
     issue a standing IMP that authorizes loading based on RIM, MIM or TCTO messages.
  3.2.2. EWIR message descriptions.
     3.2.2.1. SIM. The appropriate RC sends the SIM to the units and MAJCOM or EWCC.
     This message:
        3.2.2.1.1. Describes the impact of threat changes on an EW system.
        3.2.2.1.2. Discusses system deficiencies.
        3.2.2.1.3. Recommends interim corrections (e.g., interim tactics, recommended
        employment options).
     3.2.2.2. RIM. The appropriate RC sends the RIM to units and MAJCOM or EWCC.
     This message:
        3.2.2.2.1. Describes in detail how an EWIR change affects an EW system.
        3.2.2.2.2. States the impact of implementing or not implementing the change.
        3.2.2.2.3. Helps aircrews and commanders decide when or whether to implement a
        change.
     3.2.2.3. MIM. The appropriate RC sends the MIM, which provides maintenance
     uploading instructions, to units along with the changes for an EW system.
     3.2.2.4. TCTO. The appropriate Air Logistics Center (ALC) (in most cases, 542 CBSG)
     sends the TCTO to units. This message includes information on:
        3.2.2.4.1. New Block Cycle or OFP.
        3.2.2.4.2. Changes to system Handbooks or Mission Guides.
        3.2.2.4.3. Changes to mission data.
        3.2.2.4.4. Implementation instructions.
     3.2.2.5. Implementation Message. The MAJCOM or EWCC prepares the IMP, which
     notifies units to upload a specific EW software change (see PACER WARE Database
     Users Guide https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/pacerware). This message may also
     include timing criteria and notification instructions. The IMP is also sent to the RCs to
     notify them of the status of the change.
     3.2.2.6. Unit Loading Message.
        3.2.2.6.1. Units send the ULM to the MAJCOM or EWCC and appropriate RCs after
        the units have finished uploading EW software change to all available aircraft
 38                                              AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


         (actual); or when the number of systems has been uploaded as instructed by the
         implementing authority (exercise).
         3.2.2.6.2. Send the ULM within 3 duty days after completion of any reprogramming
         activity. Units report the following information to the MAJCOM or EWCC, RCs,
         and other appropriate addressees. (NOTES: Actual addressees are normally
         identified by the MAJCOM in their IMP for each software change; classification of
         ULMs is IAW individual system or aircraft classification guide; addressees for ULMs
         are normally provided by the implementation authority in the IMP message(s).
         Templates are located in EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library on the MSDDS.)
             3.2.2.6.2.1. A synopsis of reprogramming changes, including start and stop times
             for each reprogramming action.
             3.2.2.6.2.2. Any problems a unit encountered.
             3.2.2.6.2.3. Any MAJCOM specific instructions.
             3.2.2.6.2.4. These reporting requirements are exempt from report control symbol
             licensing IAW AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports
             Management Program: Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force
             Information Collections.
      3.2.2.7. Status Message (STM). The STM is sent by the RCs to the units, MAJCOMs,
      the EWCC, and any other interested parties, during periods of heightened activity or
      exercises. This message provides updates of current reprogramming actions, to include
      estimated time of completion. Send the STM every 72 hours, or as requested by the lead
      MAJCOM, throughout the period of activity or exercise.
      3.2.2.8. Threat Change Validation Request (TCVR). The TCVR is a request to the
      Intelligence Community to provide validation assessments to the RCs. The assessments
      contribute to the knowledge base from which reprogramming decisions are made. RCs
      have the capability to send a TCVR using the Threat Change Messaging Portal (TCMP)
      to the appropriate SPC and the recognized National SIGINT authority regarding collected
      parameters that indicate a change to the reprogramming information for a threat system.
      This message contains information concerning the system and parameters in question and
      a statement of what validation assessments are needed.
      3.2.2.9. Threat Change Validation Message (TCVM). The analysts at the SPC or
      National SIGINT authority will make a technical assessment whether the parameters in
      question are a true capability and/or mode of the threat system, and send a TCVM with a
      determination of the threat change as valid or invalid. TCVMs are sent using the TCMP.
      Timeliness of the threat change validation assessment will be based upon the timeliness
      of the required reprogramming action (ROUTINE, URGENT or EMERGENCY) and
      coordinated with the appropriate RC. RC reprogramming actions will not be delayed
      awaiting a validation assessment and TCVM.
3.3. Timeliness of Reprogramming Actions. All reprogramming messages (e.g., TCVM, SIM,
OCR, RIM, MIM, TCTO, IMP) will include either a ROUTINE, URGENT or EMERGENCY
precedence in the subject line. Recipients (SPCs, RCs, MAJCOMs and flying units) of
reprogramming messages will perform reprogramming actions, if required, based upon the
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                             39


precedence of the message. NOTE: Precedence may change if a crisis occurs, or ends, in the
middle of specific reprogramming action. Use the following criteria when performing
reprogramming actions (see paragraph 3.2 for exceptions):
   3.3.1. ROUTINE.     Treat reprogramming actions as ROUTINE, normal day-to-day
   operations. Flying units may schedule around the daily training/maintenance schedule.
   NOTE: A not-later-than date (NLT) for completion may be given by the implementation
   authority.
   3.3.2. URGENT. Treat as an URGENT reprogramming action. Urgent changes, typically
   accomplished during crisis periods, will be accomplished during normal duty hours, but will
   take precedence over other activities until complete. Urgent changes should, as a goal, reach
   the field within 72 hours. However, acceptable timelines for urgent changes will be
   negotiated between the applicable MAJCOM and reprogramming center (RC).
   3.3.3. EMERGENCY. Treat as an EMERGENCY reprogramming action. Immediately
   perform reprogramming actions as required by the reprogramming message. Emergency
   changes, initiated during combat operations, will necessitate 24-hour operations, with the
   goal of having the RC release the required change within 24 hours. Flying unit commanders
   may determine if training or operational missions can or cannot be flown without
   reprogramming actions being performed. NOTE: During all exercises, MAJCOM/IG
   timelines are used to determine the flying unit’s success in meeting EMERGENCY
   timeliness.
3.4. (Added-BEALE) Special AN/ALQ-221 Reprogramming Procedures. The U-2 EW
AN/ALQ-221 system requires unique reprogramming procedures in the following cases:
   3.4.1. (Added-BEALE) AVP Threat Data File. This mission data file is managed by 36
   EW/EWM and updates will be released via the PACER WARE process. Upon receipt of the
   RIM, and 9 OG/CC approval, maintenance personnel/CFSRs will access MSDDS to
   download the AVP Threat Data File and RIM to appropriately labeled/marked media and
   give it to the avionics specialists. The avionics specialists will be responsible for validating
   and uploading the AN/ALQ-221 Threat Data file to the avionics processor (AVP). Should
   the file be unusable for any reason, the specialist will contact 36 EWS/EWM and request a
   new file be loaded to MSDDS for the download process to occur again. Upon correction of
   the problem, 36 EWS/EWM will notify the specialist who reported the problem that a new
   file is available for download on MSDDS. For reporting, maintenance personnel/CFSRs will
   send completion information to the 9 RW EW POC via a 9 RW PACER WARE/SERENE
   BYTE After Action Worksheet.
   3.4.2. (Added-BEALE) URGENT or EMERGENCY Threat Warning Database
   (TWDB) Updates. The requirement for an URGENT or EMERGENCY TWDB change will
   be communicated using the OCR message format provided in Attachment 17. The timeliness
   requirement for this case will be established by the requesting unit commander following
   AFI 10-703 guidelines for URGENT or EMERGENCY PW actions. The process of
   building, validating, disseminating, and uploading an URGENT or EMERGENCY TWDB is
   shown in the flowchart at Attachment 6 (Added). Because this is a special case
   reprogramming action, the operational need must be justified and approved by the unit
   commander after evaluating the need using appropriate operational risk management (ORM)
40                                           AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


  guidelines.   This process is also manpower-intensive and should be used only when
  warranted

                      EXERCISES AND EVALUATION PROGRAMS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. The USAF must conduct exercises periodically to validate the production and delivery
   of software and hardware changes to electronic equipment used to provide an awareness and
   response capability within the electromagnetic spectrum. These exercises are referred to by
   the name SERENE BYTE. SERENE BYTE exercises may be incorporated into large force
   exercises and be conducted in conjunction with the Electronic Warfare Analysis Program

                           INTERNATIONAL EWIR PROGRAM

5.1. Purpose. The International EWIR program supports building EW capacity for partner air
forces. Its purpose is to foster interoperability for future coalitions and to strengthen partner
countries’ defensive posture. This program provides acquisition, logistics, technical engineering,
and system familiarization services to ensure the effectiveness of EW systems sold to partner
nations. This support program is designed to provide for the standardization and reliability
required to field effective EW systems.
5.2. Scope. There are three basic areas of the International EWIR program: 1) International
agreements, 2) FMS cases, and 3) US government support for Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).
   5.2.1. International Agreements. Agreements such as cooperative research or data exchange,
   joint development programs and/or joint exercises may require FMS EWIR support to
   enhance or maintain their effectiveness between partners.
   5.2.2. International EWIR Programs. The majority of International EWIR programs are
   accomplished using US Government (USG) contracts (FMS cases).
   5.2.3. USG support to DCS programs may encompass EW management and/or oversight of
   EW sales by US industry. EW database support for DCS programs must be provided under
   an FMS case.
5.3. Approach. The International EWIR program follows the USAF EWIR process except for
additional foreign disclosure reviews. Procedures and organizational responsibilities outlined in
chapters 2, 3, and 4 and modified in this chapter form the basis for the International EWIR
program. Hardware and software support should mirror the USAF support processes where
feasible. International EWIR program support is developed IAW USAF policies for security
cooperation, foreign disclosure and technology transfer as well as specific foreign partner
requirements set for in the terms of each FMS case. The key administering agencies are
AF/A5RE, SAF/IAPD, ACC/A3TS, the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), and the
Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) Squadron. The FMS EWIR implementing
agencies are, NASIC, 542 CBSG EWAISF, and the 53 EWG.
5.4. Special Factors. Transferring capabilities through the international EWIR programs
involves several factors.      Program changes requiring supporting documentation (i.e.,
Memorandums of Understanding, FMS cases, bilateral or multilateral agreements, etc.) may
require the purchaser’s agreement before the program can move forward. The purchaser must
fund the International EWIR program while EW activities, such as range testing, may be funded
jointly through international agreements. International EW database support requirements for
Mission Data File (MDF) development must be approved in principle as described in paragraph
5.9.5 before appropriate hardware/software sales are completed through FMS or DCS programs.
5.5. International EWIR Program Disclosure. Transfer of US EW capabilities to
international customers will take place in accordance with applicable USAF, DOD and national
policies and procedures. EW military capabilities can include: deliverable hardware/software,
technical orders, operating manuals, employment considerations, training, databases for mission
 44                                                  AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


data development, deliverable       Mission   Data    (MD),    and   applicable   documentation
(handbooks/annexes).
5.6. EW Systems Support
   5.6.1. US Systems:
       5.6.1.1. Responsibility for MDF development resides with 53 EWG, AFSOC/ECSF, and
       562 CBSS.. The 53 EWG is responsible for MDF development for fighters, bombers,
       and AWACS platforms. AFSOC/ECSF is responsible for MDF development for SOF and
       MAF platforms. 562 CBSS also accomplishes MDF development IAW MOAs with the
       53 EWG or AFSOC/ECSF. Organizations responsible for developing MDF shall
       coordinate with appropriate agencies for technical order development.      Under
       EMERGENCY or URGENT reprogramming conditions, the responsible organization
       coordinates a concurrent delivery with other applicable organizations. Combat
       Commanders and the EWCC will be will be notified of all EMERGENCY
       reprogramming activities accomplished for nations in their respective AOR.
       5.6.1.2. US EW systems installed on non-US platforms or integrated with other non-US
       systems are supported on a case-by-case basis.
       5.6.1.3. The International EWIR program will support EW systems retired from the
       USAF inventory to the maximum extent feasible based on available hardware, software
       and engineering expertise.
       5.6.1.4. MDF development under DCS programs requires proper manpower,
       reprogramming tools, test support equipment, and database support.
   5.6.2. Non-US Systems. EW systems of foreign origin are generally not supported.
5.7. Functional Responsibilities. These specific responsibilities are in addition to those found
in Chapter 2 and cover the International EWIR program.
   5.7.1. Air Force Secretariat:

       (SAF/AQPC) oversees EW system acquisitions.
           5.7.1.1.1. AFPEO/AC (ASC) (Aeronautical Systems Center) develops, transitions
           and acquires EW systems. In support of these efforts, ASC provides USAF EW
           capability planning and weapons system expertise.
           5.7.1.1.2. AFPEO/WP (AAC) (Air Armament Center) develops, acquires, and
           sustains aerial targets and range instrumentation and their related electronic warfare
           (EW) payload systems to test and evaluate weapon systems and conduct realistic
           operational training. In addition, the AAC operates the Multi-Spectral Test and
           Training Environment range at Eglin AFB and provides development testing to allied
           and foreign nations. The AAC is responsible for acquisition of Air Combat Training
           Systems and associated threat simulator interoperability.
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                          45

      Support Measures (ESM) system using 53 EWG-developed E-3 Electronic Database
      (EEDB) mission data.
5.8. FMS Policy AF/A5RE and SAF/IAPD develop positions on new policy, recommend
policy changes and develop guidance/procedures for Air Staff/Secretariat approval and
incorporation into USAF Instructions for the purpose of advocating and overseeing the
export of US EW systems and system support.
5.9. FMS Database Support for EW Reprogramming. The FMS database support program is
designed for EW systems sold through DOD Security Cooperation (SC). This program provides
appropriate data for all EW-related system requiring intelligence-based information for MD
programming. DCS programs may obtain this support, if required and approved, through a
related FMS case. Foreign EW systems are not supported under this program.
   5.9.1. FMS vs. DCS Support. EW database support is only provided through an FMS case.
   SAF/IAPD can assist countries to determine their data requirements, once an FMS case is
   signed. For FMS, database products are developed to meet specific FMS case requirements.
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                          47


  FMS case funding is directed by SAF/IAPD, in coordination with SAF/IAR country desk
  offices. DCS licenses specify that US contractor companies cannot distribute intelligence-
  related products to support the EW system sales. Since intelligence-related products and
  FMS EWIRDB support is synonymous, contractors cannot provide FMS EWIRDB support.
  DCS licenses should stipulate that if a country requires intelligence-related products for its
  EW system, the country should work with the SAF/IAR desk officer for guidance in possibly
  obtaining the required support through an FMS case. Upon approval and funding, the
  required product can be distributed to the appropriate contractor facility or In-Country
  Reprogramming (ICR) center.
  5.9.2. FMS EWIRDB. The FMS EWIRDB is a subset of the US EWIRDB. There are two
  types of FMS EWIRDB products. Depending on a country’s requirements and US disclosure
  guidance, the FMS EWIRDB will either be direct or indirect. SAF/IAPD manages, develops,
  orders production, and requests dissemination of an FMS EWIRDB for USAF FMS and DCS
  programs.
     5.9.2.1. FMS Direct EWIRDB. The direct FMS EWIRDB is a SECRET (REL XXX)
     product delivered "directly" to a country. This product is developed to meet requirements
     of a country that maintains an ICR capability. It is only disseminated to countries
     approved by the US Government to accomplish ICR on EW systems sold through FMS
     or DCS. A DCS program that requires support for ICR activities must have an associated
     FMS case to obtain the direct FMS EWIRDB.
     5.9.2.2. FMS Indirect EWIRDB. The indirect FMS EWIRDB is a SECRET NOFORN
     product distributed only to US EW programming facilities. Other releases will be staffed
     through appropriate government agencies.
  5.9.3. Database Release Authority. The US Intelligence Community and the Military
  Services control the FMS EWIRDB content and are the release authorities. SAF/IAPD
  coordinates FMS EWIRDB specific customer requirements and obtains required IC
  community approval for EWIRDB content.
  5.9.4. Justification for FMS Database Dissemination to International Customers.
  Justification is required for release of FMS EWIRDB products. Prior to developing a
  country-specific FMS EWIRDB, SAF/IAPD must clearly understand the purpose for the
  release of data to develop the required justification. Advance notice of pending EW systems
  sales to SAF/IAPD is the most effective way to ensure required FMS data products are
  developed, produced, and distributed to the appropriate EW RCs.
     5.9.4.1. DCS Program Justification. US Government intelligence-based data products
     may be used only under an FMS case to support EW system sales. SAF/IAPD begins the
     development of a database support program for a specific country after SAF/IA develops
     the appropriate justification for such support and an FMS case is established or an
     existing one is adjusted. To ensure support is available on a regular basis, SAF/IAPD
     must be alerted to DCS licenses that offer EW-type systems.
     5.9.4.2. Special Justification Requirements. In some cases, SAF/IAPD may require
     additional information from a theater command staff and country team to justify
     establishing a country-specific database support program. This special justification could
     apply to either a FMS case or DCS license. Failure to gain the required justification from
 48                                               AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


      a theater command staff and country team may result in selective denial of database
      support for the FMS or DCS program. This could result in a loss of EW system
      reprogramming data.
   5.9.5. Database Support Release Process for FMS/DCS Programs. A release process is
   maintained to ensure that correct database products are developed, produced and
   disseminated to meet FMS/DCS requirements. The process is divided into three phases:
   Phase I - Release in Principle (RIP), Phase II Development of Database Requirements; and
   Phase III – Release in Specific (RIS). The phases are aligned with standard Letter of
   Request/Letter of Acceptance (LOR/LOA) development for FMS cases, but the phases can
   also be used to support Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA)/DSP5 DCS programs.
      5.9.5.1. Phase I – Release In Principle. The RIP is the first phase in development,
      production and dissemination of FMS EW database products to meet stated EW system
      requirements. An approved RIP stipulates that some degree of support for the country's
      requirements will be available if and when an FMS case is signed.
      5.9.5.2. Phase II – Development of Database Requirements. With FMS case signature,
      the second phase begins by accomplishing an analysis of the appropriate AOR and
      developing a concise list of radar emitters for that AOR. This list will be SAF/IAPD's
      recommendation to country representatives during a technical coordination meeting
      (TCM). If an adequate list is not developed during or shortly after the TCM, there may
      be a delay in delivery of the EW database product to the EW RC. After TCM
      completion, the final radar emitter list will be validated against US Government
      disclosure guidelines.
      5.9.5.3. Phase III – Release in Specific. The RIS begins immediately after the final radar
      emitter list is validated. This phase establishes a specific release authority from
      appropriate DOD organizations for parametric data on selected radar emitters.
      SAF/IAPD directs production of the country-specific database once RIS approval is
      received from appropriate DOD organization.
      5.9.5.4. Follow-on Data Support. A follow-on database support program is available for
      international partners. This support complements initial EW database support and
      ensures regular updates of data for changing requirements. In all cases, the process used,
      the funding required and the database provided will be the same, as long as guidance and
      funding is provided in a FMS case. This follow-on support is recommended since radar
      emitters change on a regular basis, radar systems in a specific AOR can change as
      countries update defensive systems, or combat/training mission requirements change.
      The preferred database support program would be defined as initial plus two follow-on
      databases with 12 to 18 month intervals between the deliveries of the three products.
      This type of program ensures the required data is available for the EW reprogramming
      center. A TCM is not mandatory for all follow-on database development.
5.10. Communications.
   5.10.1. FMS EWIR RCs maintain a secure communications capability with USG personnel
   in country or direct to customer points of contact. These links can provide the necessary
   connectivity for transmitting text and binary data between the RC and international
   customers.
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                         49


   5.10.2. Security of International Transmissions. DOD ensures the establishment of secure
   transmission channels for the physical transfer of documents, software and data. Electronic
   transmission is the desired method of transfer. USG personnel supporting international
   partners may receive and transmit reprogramming software and messages via the SIPRNet or
   secure communications equipment.
5.11. FMS EWIR Training and Exercise Support.
   5.11.1. FMS EWIR operational, technical, training and logistics support is provided from the
   following organizations:

Terms
Advanced Lesson Management System (ALMS)— The Air Force system used to collect and
track Lessons Learned from exercises and contingencies. The NIPRNET location is
https://lessonslearned.langley.af.mil.  The        SIPRNet      location         is
http://lessonslearned.af.smil.mil.
Block Cycle— In this process the RC receives software change requests from the user, and other
change requests from organizations, which are associated with the software process. The RC
evaluates these requests and identifies potential solutions. When the user determines that
sufficient changes have been identified to justify the expense of an update, the RC implements
the software changes. Changes are scheduled based on the criticality of the requirement, with
routine updates generally occurring approximately every 18 months for Operational Flight
Programs (OFP) and Mission Data (MD).
BLUE— Associated with US military users.
BRAVE BYTE— The nickname for Army exercise electronic warfare system changes.
Characteristics and Performance (C&P) Data— Developed from parametric data and detailed
analysis of all-source intelligence, C&P data provide descriptive characteristics used to define
the system, its capabilities, and its behaviors. Examples of C&P data include antenna patterns,
RF/EO/IR signatures, EP capabilities, and maximum detection range.
Community On—Line Intelligence System for End-Users and Managers (COLISEUM) -
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) on-line production/requirements management system. It
provides the mechanism for registering and validating requirements, deconflicting requirements,
and assigning / scheduling production within production centers under the purview of DIA. It
provides the ability to track and manage production activities across operational/national
planners and consumers. Production
Requirements / Requests for Information (PRs/RFIs) are used in COLISEUM to register the
intelligence product / service requirement and to assign the requirement to the appropriate
production center(s).
Communications Externals— Technical and geolocation intelligence derived from the
parametrics of intercepted emissions from foreign communications systems.
Data Dictionary/Directory Services— Key computer software tools that manage data and
information resources. Such services provide extensive facilities for recording, storing, and
processing descriptions of an organization’s significant data and data processing resources, and
often provide facilities to use metadata (information about data).
Electronic Order of Battle (EOB)— A country-specific listing which provides the locations
and operational status of land-based electronic facilities and their associated radar equipment.
These facilities normally perform the mission of air defense, space tracking, air & coastal
 58                                                AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


surveillance, navigation, civil & military aviation, meteorology, and scientific testing. The DIA
EOB is a strategic baseline listing which provides only the garrison locations for mobile radar
equipment. Tracking and force disposition of tactical force equipment is maintained by the
responsible COCOMs.
Electronic Warfare (EW)— Any military action involving the use of electromagnetic (EM) and
directed energy (DE) to control the EM spectrum or to attack the enemy. The three major
subdivisions within EW are: electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic
warfare support (ES).
Electronic Warfare Analysis Program (EWAP)— Also known as the COMBAT SHIELD
program, the EWAP evaluates the EW defensive system readiness of CAF aircraft by deploying
test and evaluation teams with specialized equipment to provide senior leadership an independent
assessment of the health of CAF systems and to provide local commanders with on-site analysis
and feedback on the readiness of unit EW jammer and radar warning receiver (RWR) systems.
Electronic Warfare (EW) Baseline for Foreign Sales— The baseline applies to both USAF
inventory and non-inventory EW equipment. It establishes the USAF position on release for
several technology transfer issues, including EW systems, in-country reprogramming, software
source code, non-inventoried systems, High Value Assets, Millimeter Wave Technology, and
Electronic Attack (EA).
Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR)— The process that fully integrates
operations, intelligence, communications, logistics, and other support functions to provide
changes to reprogrammable electronic warfare equipment hardware and software, tactics, and
equipment settings. EWIR gives the Air Force a clear and comprehensive picture of tasks, data,
staffing, and the interrelationships between the agencies that reprogram EW equipment. This
process forms the basis for developing Air Force procedures, organizations, facilities, and
expertise to ensure responsive EW reprogramming during peacetime, wartime, and
contingencies.
Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Data Base (EWIRDB)— The EWIRDB is a
database that contains parametric and select C&P data describing EW systems. It is the primary
source for mission and reprogramming data. It is the primary DOD approved source for technical
parametric and performance data on non-communications electronic emitters and associated
systems. Scientific and technical intelligence and other centers (including NASIC, NGIC, NMIC,
MSIC, 453 EWS, and NSA) provide the data to NASIC for inclusion in the database.
Emergency Reprogramming Center (ERC)— A term used by RCs when 24-hour operations
(both real world and exercise) are established in response to contingencies and combat
operations or as directed by MAJCOM or theater commanders. RCs will send an activation
message announcing the establishment of the ERC and a deactivation message when the ERC
has been deactivated to all organizations and MAJCOMs involved in the reprogramming
process.
Firmware— Software that is permanently stored in a hardware device that allows reading but
not writing or modifying the software. The most common device used for firmware is read-only
memory.
Fit Data—Information about the internal and external equipment associated with a particular
platform. For the example of an aircraft, having knowledge of a specific grouping of avionics
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                                 59


hardware & software, and how the components work together, provides the “avionics fit” for that
platform. Knowing the grouping (configuration) of the hardware & software helps to make the
fit. Similarly, having knowledge of the different possible weapon / launcher / fuel tank load
combinations on an aircraft contributes to the “weapons fit” for that platform.
Flagging—The process of identifying emissions whose parameters are outside of prescribed
limits. There are two methods: parametric-based flagging or model-based flagging. Parametric-
based flagging consists of comparing observed parametric data to the database of known emitter
parameters. Model-based flagging consists of using software-based models to analyze an EW
system’s response to observed parametric data. 453 EWS maintains automated flagging tools for
both methods.
GRAY—Associated with non-US, non-hostile military users. Examples:
    1. Countries/coalitions traditionally identified as US allies (UK, CAN, AUS, NATO, etc).
    2. Countries/coalitions identified as “neutral” or “unknown” in their alliance with US.
    3. US systems sold to other countries through FMS or similar processes.
Literally, a “gray” area, where rules, responsibilities, and collection authorities require
significant attention to law and policy detail. Different organizations may be assigned different
parts of GRAY to comply with existing laws and DOD / Joint / Service policies.
Implementation Message (IMP)—Major command or Joint Forces Air Component Command ,
Combined Forces Air Component Command, or Air Operations Center approval to load a change
that the reprogramming centers have made to electronic warfare systems and sent to the units.
International Agreements—A legally binding agreement between two or more sovereign
governments.
Intelligence Community (IC)—A federation of executive branch agencies and organizations
that work separately and together to conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of
foreign relations and the protection of the national security of the United States. An IC member
organization, or a component within that organization, plays a role in the national intelligence
function. The member organizations of the IC are:
   Director of National Intelligence                   Department of State
   Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence          Department of the Treasury
   Air Force Intelligence                              Drug Enforcement Administration
   Army Intelligence                                   Federal Bureau of Investigation
   Central Intelligence Agency                         Marine Corps Intelligence
   Coast Guard Intelligence                            National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
   Defense Intelligence Agency                         National Reconnaissance Office
   Department of Energy                                National Security Agency
   Department of Homeland Security                     Navy Intelligence


Intelligence Production Center (IPC)—A general term used to describe a subset of the
Intelligence Community which produces and disseminates original intelligence products in support
of (DOD) missions and objectives. IPCs include the COCOM and Service intelligence centers,
and DOD / national production centers.
Mission Data (MD)—Elements or files a computer uses to perform signal discrimination, target a
 60                                                  AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014


threat, or elicit jammer responses, which are selectable, adjustable, or changeable by the using
command with the exception being FMS customers. MD is also called Emitter Identification Data
(EID), Mission Data File (MDF), Pre-Flight Message (PFM), Code Form Message (CFM), or
other related names that vary in function according to the system using them.
Multi-Service Data Distribution System (MSDDS)—The MSDDS is a means of transmitting
digital data and EWIR message traffic to operational locations. Normally, data and messages are
available on the MSDDS almost simultaneously with their transmission over SIPRNet. The
MSDDS uses secure communications equipment to transmit digital data, via commercial or
Defense Switch Network (DSN) voice lines, or SIPRNet, from reprogramming centers directly to
operational locations which possess like equipment and appropriate communications software.
Since the MSDDS is a "pull" system, units must be notified by message or telephone that new
MD software has been loaded on the MSDDS. The MSDDS provides a backup for the
transmission of reprogramming data and EWIR message traffic.
National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP)—An integrated system of the policies,
priorities, procedures and technology used by the Intelligence Community to manage requests
for national level SIGINT products and services. SIGINT collectors satisfy tactical through
national level consumer information needs based on NSRP guidance. Information Need (IN)
statements are used in the NSRP to relay collection requirements to SIGINT collectors and
systems.
NEPTUNE BYTE—The term for Navy exercise electronic warfare system changes.
Next Generation EWIRDB System (NGES)—Follow-on database for EWIRDB,
incorporating improved relational database scheme, better modeling of signals, and other
improvements.
Operational Change Request (OCR)—A formal request to the appropriate major command and
support command facilities that identifies the inability of an electronic warfare system to
meet operational requirements. In emergencies, an OCR identifies the inability to discriminate
or respond to a threat and then requests mission data or operational flight program (OFP) changes
to correct the problem.
Operational Flight Program (OFP)—The executable program resident in computer-
controlled electronic warfare systems that contains the algorithms that receive, identify, process,
and do jamming tasks. This program does not contain any threat-specific data, and operational
commands cannot change the program. The reprogramming centers send a software change
message (SCM) to Air Force Materiel Command to get an OFP modified.
PACER WARE - The term for actual electronic warfare system changes issued during
peacetime, contingencies, or wartime operations. PACER WARE actions can be at the routine,
urgent, or emergency level as required.
PACER WARE Database -53 EWG, working with AFSOC ECSF Reprogramming Center
(RC), developed a secure unclassified website to manage and distribute USAF PW information.
This CAC-enabled database acts as a focal point for all USAF EWIR unit account information
and message release data. Accessible 24/7 by users worldwide, the PWDB provides a backup to
other EWIR communication channels. This system ensures units receive critical updates when
SIPRNet channels are unavailable. The database may be accessed at:
https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/pacerware.
PACER WARE Messages – PACER WARE messages templates and procedures (OCR, SIM,
RIM, MIM, TCTO, IMP, SCM and ULM) are located on the classified MSDDS
(EWIR_OPS_PW_MSG_Templates library) and unclassified PWDB
AFI10-703_BEALESUP_I 8 january 2014                                                           61


(https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil/pacerware).
Parametric Data—Directly measureable factors (such as frequency, pulse width, polarization,
etc.) that help to define a system / waveform and determine its behavior. They are data elements
that describe specific properties and timing. Some parametric data are expressed as a mean value,
or range of values.
Power, Pattern & Polarization (P-Cubed) —A type of analysis and data which concentrate on
three aspects of a radar (or other emitter): effective radiated power (ERP), antenna radiation
patterns, and RF wave polarization of the emitted signal. These features directly affect the

measureable within the electromagnetic spectrum, that consistently recur and uniquely identify a
system, activity, event or person.
Specific Emitter Identification (SEI)—A method to unambiguously identify a particular emitter
or class of emitters by exploiting unintentional / unique features of the emitter signal.
Threat Change Messaging Portal—A SIPRNET-based software portal used for the
purpose of facilitating the Threat Change Validation process. This portal permits TCVR
submittal from Reprogramming Centers of all Services and TCVM replies from
participating Service Production Centers, Scientific and Technical Intelligence Centers,
Information Warfare Centers, Service components, and observed signal centers. When
operational, the portal is the preferred messaging system for TCVR/TCVM traffic. When non-

                                     EWIR DATA TYPES

A3.1. Data Types. An effective EWIR process requires accurate signal/system information, not
all of which can be actively collected or processed by a single organization. Over many years
US laws, policies, and DOD / Joint / Service guidance have created divisions of authority and
responsibility, leading to the development of several data types, or “colors” (RED, BLUE,
GRAY, WHITE), with different communities (Operations, Acquisition, Intelligence) responsible
for different colors. To ensure that the USAF EWIR process obtains and disseminates all
required information, this Attachment defines the different data colors. Note that the type/color
terms are for planning, development and resource allocation purposes only--what is WHITE
today may become RED if hostile forces employ a commercially available system. Systems may
have more than one color. For example, if a currently fielded BLUE military system is sold to a
GRAY country but then political circumstances change and that country employs that system in
a hostile manner, that system is now both BLUE and RED. Differences in configuration will
likely still exist between the BLUE and RED version even though they are the same basic
system. Also, the US military may use the same commercial (WHITE) system a hostile user
(RED) employs. If the US military is a user, those systems are BLUE, the hostile used systems
are RED and if there are commercial users those systems are WHITE.
Table A3-1: EWIR Data Types and Terms.
 TERM               DEFINITION
                         Indicates the general user category of a related set of entities or objects.
 Color Code
                         Can apply to a set of platoons, a set of platforms, or a set of sensor
 User Code
                         systems. The current codes are RED, BLUE, GRAY, and WHITE.
 RED                     Associated with hostile (non-US) users.
 BLUE                    Associated with US military users.
                         Associated with non-US, non-hostile military users. Examples:
                      1. Countries/coalitions traditionally identified as US allies (UK, CAN,
                         AUS, NATO, etc).
                      2. Countries/coalitions identified as “neutral” or “unknown” in their
                         alliance with US.
 GRAY                 3. US systems sold to other countries through FMS or similar processes.

                         Literally, a “gray” area, where rules, responsibilities, and collection
                         authorities require significant attention to law and policy detail.
                         Different organizations may be assigned different parts of GRAY to
                         comply with existing laws and DOD / Joint / Service policies.
                        Associated with non-military, non-hostile users.
                       Note: US Government systems that do not fall under the US Military
 WHITE                  (DEA, Border Patrol, etc.) are considered as WHITE.
                        Note: Can be divided into US-WHITE and NON-US-WHITE if
                        needed.

 Non-US Military            Any military service that is not organized under the US Government.
                            Non-US users treated as threatening to US sovereignty or US people.
 Hostile Users
                            Note: No US users are treated as hostile.
                            US or Non-US users treated as non-threatening to US sovereignty or
 Non-hostile Users
                            people.

A3.2. Data Color Example: Assume the XYZ system is used by US and Country X military
forces. Country X is non-US + non-hostile. Overall, the XYZ system can be described as
BLUE+GRAY. That is, there are BLUE XYZ systems and GRAY XYZ systems, which may
not be identical. The EWIR organization(s) responsible for BLUE data would be responsible for
the BLUE version of XYZ; the EWIR organization(s) responsible for GRAY data would be
responsible for the GRAY version of XYZ. To the maximum extent possible, the BLUE and
GRAY organizations would collaborate to share/compare data across the versions of the XYZ
system. Each organization would ensure that each data set is updated over time as the system(s)
are changed / upgraded.
A3.3. Data Color Designation and Assignment. Much of the information required for the
USAF EWIR process is based on the work of the Intelligence Community, which has established
“lanes in the road” for assigning (primarily RED) systems to various IPCs/SPCs. For other
systems not explicitly assigned within the IC (primarily BLUE/GRAY/WHITE), AF/A5RE will
coordinate with AF/A2, NSA, DIA, 53 EWG (453 EWS), NASIC, and other organizations to
ensure all required systems are assigned a data OPR consistent with current guidance and
organization missions. In general:
    A3.3.1. RED systems are assigned to appropriate IPCs/SPCs for collection and analysis,
    with refinement and/or validation of data made by other supporting EWIR organizations.
    A3.3.2. BLUE system, aircraft signature and antenna pattern data are generated and updated
    by Operations and Program Offices (in association with the system vendors), and provided to
    453 EWS for addition to USELMS / USRELMS and BATS databases, as applicable. BLUE
    data can then be merged into EWIRDB.

  A3.3.3. GRAY system and data issues must be handled on a case-by-case basis. Options
  include:
     A3.3.3.1. Countries/coalitions traditionally identified as US allies may voluntarily
     provide information to support the EWIR process. Information can then be added
     directly into EWIRDB, or merged from other EWIR-related databases.
     A3.3.3.2. Countries/coalitions identified as “neutral” or “unknown” in their alliance with
     the US may be assigned to appropriate IPCs/SPCs for collection and analysis, with
     refinement and/or validation of data made by other supporting EWIR organizations.
     A3.3.3.3. GRAY data for US systems being sold to other countries (through FMS or
     similar processes) are generated by the Program Office (in association with the system
     vendor) and provided to 453 EWS before the system leaves US control. Once the FMS
     system is outside of US control, system data and update responsibilities may be
     transferred to an IPC/SPC, as applicable.
  A3.3.4. WHITE data must also be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Information may be
  provided by or purchased from the commercial vendor(s), or system may be assigned to
  appropriate IPCs/SPCs for collection and analysis, with refinement and/or validation of data
  made by other supporting EWIR organizations IAW intelligence oversight guidance.
  Information can then be added directly into EWIRDB, or merged from other EWIR-related
  databases.
