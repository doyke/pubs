                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Concept. Storage tanks, properly operated and maintained in accordance with
environmental regulatory requirements, perform an essential function in support of the Air Force
mission. Where petroleum and hazardous substances are necessary for use by the Air Force
mission, they may be stored in regulatory compliant underground and aboveground storage
tanks. Tank systems are operated and maintained to comply with the more stringent applicable
Federal, state, local regulations and this AFI requirement.
1.2. Scope. This AFI describes the environmental and engineering requirements for
underground and aboveground storage tanks and associated piping that store petroleum and
hazardous substances. This AFI addresses the environmental compliance requirements associated
with Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 112, Oil Pollution Prevention and 280,
Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for Owners and Operators of
Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) or overseas equivalent, AFI 23-502, Recoverable Fuel and
AFI 23-204, Organizational Fuel Tanks, for instructions on managing organizational fuel storage
tanks. This AFI does not address storage of wastes other than oils. Hazardous waste storage is
addressed in AFI 32-7042, Waste Management, and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-7043,
Hazardous Waste Management Guide.
1.3. Objectives. This instruction provides Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating
Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and installations with a framework for
complying with regulatory requirements for storage tanks and associated piping that store
petroleum and hazardous substances except hazardous and radioactive waste. In the United
States and its territories, use this instruction with applicable Federal, state, and local standards
for storage tanks. For Air Force organizations at installations outside the United States, its
territories, and possessions, implement the applicable portions of this AFI (i.e., all paragraphs
except those with asterisks) in accordance with the applicable Final Governing Standards (FGS)
or, in their absence, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD).
1.4. Applicable Standards and Regulations. The Air Force complies with applicable Federal,
state, and local laws and regulations; Executive Orders (E.O.); DoD and Air Force publications,
technical orders, and policies; and, overseas (OCONUS), with the OEBGD, appropriate FGS,
international agreements, through applicable portions of this AFI. The following description of
regulations applicable to storage tanks describes only the principal requirements and is not
intended to be exhaustive. Air Force personnel are expected to comply fully with the underlying
regulatory requirements of Title 40 CFR Parts 112 and 280, and the applicable state programs.
Other requirements may apply to storage tanks under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Energy Policy Act of 2005 Title XV,
Subtitle B titled Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2005, and other environmental
laws, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and the national codes
and standards listed in Attachment 2 to this AFI.
     1.4.1. Underground Storage Tanks (UST).
AFI32-7044 25 APRIL 2012                                                                       5


     1.4.1.1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Title 42, United States
     Code (U.S.C.), Section 6901, et seq. regulates USTs that contain regulated substances.
     Regulated substances are defined at 40 CFR Part 280.12 and include hazardous
     substances regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
     and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., which are not otherwise regulated
     as RCRA hazardous waste, and petroleum and petroleum-based substances.
     1.4.1.2. The Federal UST standards are found in 40 CFR Parts 280 and 281 (for approval
     of state UST programs.).
     1.4.1.3. Facility Response Plans. The Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.,
     Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan and Facility Response Plan
     (FRP) requirements, found in 40 CFR Part 112, do not apply to USTs that are regulated
     under and comply with applicable portions of 40 CFR Parts 280 and 281, except that
     USTs need to be included in the facility diagram [as provided in 40 CFR Part112.7(a)(3)]
     or if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Administrator otherwise
     requires the USTs to be included in the SPCC Plan [as provided in 40 CFR Part 112.1(f)].
     Section 311(j) of the Clean Water Act requires facilities that because of their location
     could reasonably be expected to cause ―substantial harm‖ to the environment by a
     discharge of oil to develop and implement a FRP. Substantial harm facilities are defined
     in 40 CFR Part 112.
     1.4.1.4. The CAA requirements in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Kb, Standards of
     Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels for Which Construction,
     Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984, apply to USTs as
     pertinent.
  1.4.2. Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST).
     1.4.2.1. The SPCC and FRP requirements, discussed in paragraph 1.4.1.3, generally
     apply to ASTs located where, a discharge could reasonably be expected to reach
     navigable waters (including sewer pathways), unless both: (i) the completely buried
     storage capacity of installation facility has a total aggregate of 42,000 gallons or less of
     oil (see Attachment 1); and (ii) the total aggregate aboveground storage capacity of the
     installation is 1,320 gallons or less of oil. Tanks which are 55 gallons or larger and store
     petroleum, oil or lubricants are subject to SPCC regulatory requirements. Refer to the
     EPA definition of ‗oil‘ in Attachment 1, Terms.
        1.4.2.1.1. The SPCC Plan is the document required by 40 CFR Part 112.3 that details
        the equipment, workforce, procedures and steps to prevent, control, and provide
        adequate countermeasures for a potential discharge. The relevant requirements for
        preparing a SPCC Plan are located in 40 CFR Parts 112.3 – 112.8.
        1.4.2.1.2. A facility shall also determine, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 112.20,
        whether, because of its location, a spill of oil could cause substantial harm to the
        environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining
        shorelines.*
            1.4.2.1.2.1. If the installation (―facility‖ as defined by 40 CFR Part 112)
            determines that it does meet the substantial harm criteria, it shall prepare a FRP as
            provided in 40 CFR Part 112 Appendix F or as required by the EPA Regional
 6                                                                   AFI32-7044 25 APRIL 2012


                Administrator.*
                1.4.2.1.2.2. If the installation (―facility‖ as defined by 40 CFR Part 112)
                determines that it does not meet the substantial harm criteria, it shall complete and
                maintain certification that the criteria do not apply. Even if the substantial harm
                criteria are not met, the EPA administrator has the discretion to require an FRP.*
        1.4.2.2. ASTs that contain used oil, as defined in 40 CFR Part 279.1, must also meet the
        applicable RCRA used oil management requirements of 40 CFR Part 279.
        1.4.2.3. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 112 SPCC Plans must include schedules and
        requirements defined for ―periodic‖ inspections of Shop-Built ASTs (see paragraph
        2.3.3.). 40 CFR Part 112.3 (d) (1) (iii) also requires the SPCC plan has been prepared in
        accordance with good engineering practice including consideration of applicable industry
        standards.
        1.4.2.4. The CAA requirements in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart (K) (b), Standards of
        Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid Vessels for Which Construction,
        Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984 and Part 81 Designation
        of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes apply to ASTs as pertinent.
     1.4.3. States may adopt or enact storage tank regulations as long as those regulations are at
     least as stringent as Federal storage tank regulations. Air Force installations must comply
     with state or local (a) UST regulations: and (b) AST requirements where sovereign immunity
     has been waived. Installations should consult with the installation Staff Judge Advocate to
     obtain guidance on whether state or local government can regulate installation ASTs.
     1.4.4. Air Force activities in overseas locations must implement this AFI in accordance with
     the appropriate FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD. Provisions of this AFI that are marked
     by an asterisk ―*‖ do not apply in overseas locations.
     1.4.5. Guidance on the construction and operation of petroleum storage tanks are governed
     by Unified Facility Criteria (UFC) 3-460-01, Design: Petroleum Fuels Facilities, UFC 3-
     460-03, Operation and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Systems, and DoD standard
     design AW 78-24-27, Standard Fueling Systems; Aboveground Vertical Fuel Tanks with
     Floating Pan and Fixed Roofs, and from other sources including some of the national codes

            systems using a flexible carrier pipe for service stations) may be used. For aviation
            fuel piping, see UFC 3-460-01. See applicable state and local requirements and
            Attachment 2 for national codes and standards.
        2.1.1.3. Release Detection.
            2.1.1.3.1. Release Detection for Tanks. All USTs and ASTs, where required by state
            or local requirements, must have at least one of the following release detection
            monitoring systems:
                2.1.1.3.1.1. Automatic tank gauging.
                2.1.1.3.1.2. Vapor monitoring.

                2.1.1.3.2.1. Non-aviation fuel piping: Install automatic line-leak detection with
                all new pressurized piping. Suction piping operating at less than atmospheric
                pressure that drains the contents back into the tank, with a single check valve
                immediately below the suction pump, does not require release detection. Suction
                piping that does not have leak detection must either be subject to an appropriate
                line tightness test annually or monitor this piping monthly using a release
                detection monitoring method that detects piping leaks. Follow applicable state and
                local requirements, and the appropriate national codes and standards in
                Attachment 2. Underground piping for hazardous substances must be equipped
                with secondary containment (e.g., trench liners, jacketing or double-walled pipe.)
                Automatic line leak detection for pressurized lines may not be available from all
                manufacturers. At some locations, only interstitial monitoring may be available
                for line leak detection for ASTs. Ensure that line leak detection system is installed
                as recommended to avoid interference with operation of AST anti-siphon device.

          2.5.1.1.2. The system. (Note that mechanical automatic line leak detectors and some
          electronic line leak Unusual operating conditions, such as the erratic behavior of
          dispensing equipment, the sudden loss of product from the system, or an unexplained
          loss of product from detectors signal a suspected line leak by greatly slowing down
          the flow of product in the distribution line. This can appear as erratic operation of
          dispensing equipment.) Any of these conditions are considered a suspected release
          unless system equipment is found to be defective but not leaking within the 24 hour
          period allowed for reporting suspected releases and is immediately repaired or
          replaced.
          2.5.1.1.3. Monitoring results from a required tank or line release detection method
          that indicate a release may have occurred must be reported as a suspected release
          unless the following conditions can be met within the allowed 24-hour period. These
          conditions are: the monitoring device is found to be defective and is immediately
          repaired, recalibrated, or replaced and additional monitoring does not confirm the
          initial result.
          2.5.1.1.4. If inventory control shows excessive variance (that is, monthly
          reconciliations using the EPA leak check comparison of book inventories versus tank

      2.8.1.3. Permanent Closure. As per 40 CFR Part 280.71, notify the regulatory agency
      before permanently closing a UST system or effecting a change in service consistent with
      the applicable Federal, state, or local requirements (e.g. 40 CFR Part 280.71(a) requires at
      least 30-day advance notice). Determine if the UST system leaked by sampling for a
      release where contamination was most likely to occur. Basic guidance pertaining to
      closure procedures may be found in UFC 3-460-01, Design: Petroleum Fuels Facilities,
      Chapter 14 and American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice 1604,
      Closure of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks.*
          2.8.1.3.1. If a release is discovered, begin corrective action as provided in paragraph
          2.5.3*
24                                                             AFI32-7044 25 APRIL 2012


        2.8.1.3.2. If no release is found, empty and clean the tank in accordance with UFC 3-
        460-03, Operations and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Systems. Manage
        the materials in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, in consultation
        with CEA.*
        2.8.1.3.3. Except as provided in 2.8.2.4, no UST system shall be closed in place. A
        UST system that is subject to closure shall be properly removed and disposed of
        consistent with applicable Federal, state and local requirements. The tank custodian's
        unit, whether a Wing organization or tenant, is responsible for funding UST removal
        and disposal, including soil testing. EQ funds are not to be used for this purpose. In
        the event of contamination, units shall consult with the environmental restoration
        program (AFCEE/ER) for possible cleanup funding. The removal and disposal cost
        should be an integrated cost of the closing unit, organization, or tenant.
        2.8.1.3.4. USTs may be permissible to be closed in place under extenuating
        circumstances (for example, for UST located under a building) if regulatory approval
        is obtained. Storage tanks closed in place must be managed in accordance with 40
        CFR Part 280.71(b) and applicable state and local regulatory requirements.
  2.8.2. ASTs
     2.8.2.1. Meet applicable Federal, state and local regulatory requirements for temporary
     deactivation and permanent closure. Aboveground storage tanks overseas that have been
     inactivated for 12 months or longer shall be disconnected to prevent loading or unloading
     of petroleum products. See UFC 3-460-01, Chapter 13 for temporary deactivation.
     2.8.2.2. Follow UFC 3-460-01, Chapter 14 for permanent removal and deactivation of
     AST systems.

substance from an underground storage tank into groundwater, surface water, or soil.
Release Detection—Confirmation that an underground storage tank (UST) system has released a
regulated substance into the environment or into the interstitial space between a UST system and
its secondary barrier or secondary containment area. Common release detection methods include:
(1) Inventory Control.—A physical accounting system in which records are kept of input,
output, and daily tank inventories, including:
(2) Manual Tank Gauging. Measuring a tank's liquid level at the beginning and end of a
36—hour time period and calculating the change in volume. Limited to 550-gallon or smaller
USTs when manual tank gauging is used alone.
(3) Tank—Tightness Testing. Use of any approved technology that can measure very small
changes in product volume to find a leak. Civil Engineering (CE) must adjust the results for
