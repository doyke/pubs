     8.1. Requirements for Use: CPC shall be evaluated against the hazards involved and the
     final decision on selection of CPC shall rest with Bioenvironmental Engineering and the
     Hydrazine Team Chief. Generally, the Hydrazine Response Team shall utilize the highest
     protection (Level-A equipment) available when initially mitigating an incident. Level B
     equipment does not provide the same level of personnel protection and shall only be utilized
     after the team chief performs an operational risk assessment.
        8.1.1. During emergency response, after 482 MSG/CEF confirmation of Hydrazine,
        Level-A equipment shall be required. This equipment consists of boots, gloves, SCBA

        8.1.2. During EPU disconnects, EPU purge, spill containment, or clean-up, Level-A or B
        equipment shall be required if Hydrazine is noted.
        8.1.3. During disconnect of a fired EPU, SCBA respiratory protection is required.
     8.2. Training: Only personnel who are trained and task certified shall wear CPC. All
     personnel who respond to hydrazine incidents and who are subject to wear level–A or level-B
     CPC are required to attend task certification training prior to job placement and must attend
     refresher training annually. Training shall be given by 482 MXS fuel system technicians and
     documented in Integrated Maintenance Data Systems upon completion.
     8.3. Care of Protective Equipment:
        8.3.1. Totally encapsulating suits shall require annual visual and pressure checks in
        accordance with manufacturing instructions. Because of the 480-minute usage time of
        the suit, the user shall be required to document the date, time and name of wearer prior to
        storage. All Level-A suits shall be serial number controlled.
     8.4. If eyeglasses are required, contact 482 Medical Squadron (MDS).
9. Hydrazine Procedures for Aircraft Deployment.
     9.1. A qualified H-70 response team with a complete spill kit shall be sent with every F-16
     deployment going to any other than an established F-16 base, or as determined by 482
     MXG/CC.
     9.2. Immediately upon arrival at the deployment location, the senior 482 MXG Maintenance
     Officer or Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) shall make arrangements with the host base
     commander for a briefing of host base personnel on Hydrazine and procedures for spills and
482FWI21-127 4 APRIL 2012                                                                    7


   leaks. Host Base Agencies that should be represented for the briefing include, as a
   minimum: Host Base Maintenance Officer, 482 MXG/MOC, 482 MXG Quality Assurance
   (482 MXG/MXQ) branch, 482 MDS, 482 MSG/CEF, 482 MSG Emergency Management
   (482 MSG/CEX), 482 FW/SE, 482 MSG Environmental Engineering (482 MSG/CEV), and
   482d Security Forces Squadron (482 SFS).
10. 482 MSG/SGPB shall:
   10.1. Provide assistance in the selection of appropriate personal protective equipment.
   10.2. Assess any occupational exposures to Hydrazine and brief Medical Services on
   incidents/accidents involving Hydrazine, via the 482 FW Occupational Health Working
   Group (OHWG) or other means.
   10.3. Provide technical assistance in the neutralization and disposal of neutralized
   Hydrazine.
   10.4. Be responsible for ensuring that all Hydrazine has been completely neutralized and
   properly disposed of after clean-up operations.
11. 482 FW/SE shall: Observe from outside the cordon area and assist as necessary to ensure
that safe and accepted practices are adhered to throughout the course of the emergency.
12. 482 MDS/PES shall: Ensure all personnel assigned to Hydrazine maintenance duties have
pre-placement, annual and termination occupational health physicals. From these physicals, 482
MSG/SGPB shall assess any occupational exposures to Hydrazine maintenance personnel.
Medical Services shall review all incidents/accidents involving Hydrazine to evaluate any
needed follow-ups for exposed personnel.
13. 482 MSG/CEV: 482 MSG/CEV is responsible for proper disposal of fully neutralized
Hydrazine after clean-up operations.
