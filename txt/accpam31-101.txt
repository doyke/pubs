SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Security Protection Level System updated; Security Reporting and Alerting System information updated;
and control of entry and movement of personnel within restricted areas information updated.

Section A—Physical Security Awareness Training

1. Objective. The objective of security awareness training is to instill in every Air Force member a sense
of responsibility for securing protection level resources. This sense of responsibility enables us to react
quickly and correctly to threats against protection level resources. Commanders expect personnel receiv-
ing security awareness training to attain the necessary skills to apply proper security techniques within
their area of responsibility. For example, an administrative specialist who does not work either on a
flightline or in a restricted area does not need the same depth of understanding as an aircraft maintenance
specialist whose place of duty is within a restricted area.

    1.1. Concept. Along with the security forces, all ACC members shoulder their share of security
    responsibilities. HQ USAF/XOF assigns protection level 1, 2, 3, or 4 to Air Force resources based on
    a number of factors listed in paragraph 2.1.3.1. Protection level 1 resources receive the largest share
    of security forces and physical security aids. Protection level 4 resources receive the smallest share.
    By their very nature, Air Force protection level resources are attractive targets for those desiring to
    damage or destroy them. Incidents like the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, and Khobar Towers
    bombings should remain fresh in the mind of every Air Force member. Since complacency about
    security awareness is a fatal mistake, everyone in ACC must know the role they play in securing our
    protection level resources. Commanders, supervisors, and trainers must stay abreast of past and
    present security incidents. They must use this information to motivate base personnel to continuously
    improve security awareness. Use the following information as a guide to accomplishing your mis-
    sion.

Section B—Phase 1 Orientation Training

2. Introduction. Welcome to _____(Base)_____. In keeping with Air Force policy regarding security
education and motivation, the HQ ACC Security Forces staff and the _____(Unit)_____ Security Forces
Squadron designed the following orientation not only to introduce you to the ACC Physical Security
Awareness Program but also to point out your individual responsibilities. This training is in compliance
with the provisions of AFI 31-101, ACC Sup 1. To understand these responsibilities, we will first discuss
the general concept of the program and security threats confronting us. We will then examine the security
reporting and alerting system, how to control entry, individual responsibilities, and finally the key instal-
lation security documents.
    2.1. Security Program Concept.
       2.1.1. Purpose. The HQ USAF Security Forces staff designed the Air Force Physical Security
       Program to detect hostile activity against protection level resources, to alert others of this activity,
       to control entry and access to sensitive areas, and finally to defeat a hostile force if necessary. We
       will achieve the proper level of deterrence by understanding the threat, developing a security plan,
       and conducting security operations presenting hostile persons or groups with unacceptable risks if
       they attempt to breach the security system.
       2.1.2. The System. The ideal system to counter the threat of hostile activities is to post Security
       Forces on all resources and to install electronic sensors to detect unauthorized entry. The reality is
       budgetary constraints and limited manpower makes this an unfeasible approach to protection level
       resource security. Security of our protection level resources is a shared responsibility. All person-
       nel who work in or around restricted areas support the security effort by being the eyes and ears of
       the physical security program. To accomplish this task each individual must be knowledgeable of
       security procedures within their specific work areas. Additionally, since there are not enough
       resources to secure every piece of material and equipment in the same manner, resources are pri-
       oritized using a protection level system.
       2.1.3. The Protection Level System. The USAF uses the protection level system to prioritize
       resources to determine the level of security provided. The four levels of security are Protection
       Level 1, Protection Level 2, Protection Level 3, and Protection Level 4.
           2.1.3.1. Factors of Protection Level Designation. The assigned level reflects:
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                                  3


            2.1.3.1.1. The importance of the resource to the overall United States warfighting capabil-
            ity.
            2.1.3.1.2. The known or postulated threat to the resource.
            2.1.3.1.3. The alert status.
            2.1.3.1.4. The existence of local paramilitary groups who have the capability and intent to
            damage or destroy the resource.
            2.1.3.1.5. The political significance to the United States.
            2.1.3.1.6. The number of operational resources available in the Air Force.
            2.1.3.1.7. The location of the resource in relation to probable threat or damage.
     2.1.4. Protection Level Assignments.
         2.1.4.1. Protection Level 1 is assigned to any USAF resource for which the loss, theft, destruc-
         tion, misuse, or compromise would result in great harm to the strategic capability of the United
         States. Protection Level 1 resources on the installation are:
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         2.1.4.2. Protection Level 2 is assigned to any USAF resource for which the loss, theft, destruc-
         tion, misuse, or compromise would cause significant harm to the warfighting capability of the
         United States. The Protection Level 2 resources on the installation are:
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         2.1.4.3. Protection Level 3 is assigned to USAF resources for which the loss, theft, destruc-
         tion, misuse, or compromise would damage the United States warfighting capability. The Pro-
         tection Level 3 resources on the installation are:
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         2.1.4.4. Protection Level 4 is assigned to USAF resources which do not meet the definitions
         of protection level 1, 2, or 3 resources but for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse or com-
         promise would adversely affect the operational capability of the Air Force. The Protection
         Level 4 resources on the installation are:
         ___________________________________________________________________________
         ___________________________________________________________________________
  2.2. Threat Types.
     2.2.1. We must take all threats against our protection level resources seriously. The enemy has a
     history of using the tactics mentioned in this pamphlet and knows how to apply them to their
     advantage. You may have heard of them before today, but let’s take a closer look at some of the
     different threat types and examine how they may affect operations. The following threats have
4                                                                     ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000


    been used against the United States, and we can reasonably expect them to be used again in the
    future.
       2.2.1.1. Terrorism.
           2.2.1.1.1. In the light of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, Federal Building in
           Oklahoma City in 1995, and the bombing of Khobar Towers in 1996, one can expect ter-
           rorism to be directed at DoD facilities within the United States. Transnational terrorist
           groups have the capability to travel to the United States and perform virtually any type of
           violent act. Extremists of every persuasion receive training in terrorist methods in any
           number of countries considered state sponsors of terrorism. Traditionally, terrorists have
           used bombings, aircraft hijackings, and assassinations to further their particular aims. One
           motivation for terrorist groups is to gain publicity for their cause. Other motivations
           include forcing political concessions and either embarrassing or simply instilling fear into
           a populace. The 1995 poison gas attack in Tokyo, Japan, demonstrated the capability of a
           determined group to instill fear and to inflict harm on a large segment of a population.
           2.2.1.1.2. Since the United States is an open and free society, we are vulnerable to all types
           of attack from those who wish to steal our secrets (espionage), destroy our assets (sabo-
           tage), and commit acts of terrorism to further their cause. Detection and neutralization of
           these activities are of prime importance in the defense of Air Force assets, resources, and
           personnel.
       2.2.1.2. Espionage.
           2.2.1.2.1. Largely because of its clandestine nature, the human element remains the most
           difficult of the intelligence disciplines to detect and neutralize. It presents the most serious
           threat facing the interests of the United States.
           2.2.1.2.2. The demise of the Soviet Empire has not diminished either the intentions or the
           capabilities of the Russian intelligence services and their former Warsaw Pact counter-
           parts. Although many of their efforts are now directed toward gaining technology to
           improve their economic situation, these services remain an active force in the collection of
           United States military information. In fact, the Russian military intelligence service has
           actually increased their collection activities directed at the United States military services.
           The People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continue
           to use all available means to obtain intelligence concerning the United States.
           2.2.1.2.3. It recently came to light that nations friendly to the United States have directed
           their intelligence collection activities at the United States. There are no travel restrictions
           on any representatives of foreign governments posted to the United States. This gives their
           intelligence officers not only free rein to roam across the United States in pursuit of intel-
           ligence data, but also the opportunity to recruit agents who have access to desirable infor-
           mation.
       2.2.1.3. Sabotage.
           2.2.1.3.1. During wartime, adversary forces use sabotage either to cripple or to destroy our
           capability to wage war. Nearly all of our potential adversaries have special forces units
           specifically tasked to perform sabotage missions on a wide spectrum of targets. Their tar-
           gets include communications centers, aircraft, and missile facilities. It is likely these acts
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                                5


          of sabotage would occur either shortly before hostilities are initiated or in the first hours of
          the conflict.
          2.2.1.3.2. Within the United States, the peacetime threat comes from domestic political
          activists like the Plowshares, who have a proven record of anti-United States military
          destructive activity. Plowshares have damaged missile silos, DoD aircraft, and even a sub-
          marine in dry dock. There is a number of other pacifist groups who engage in disruptive
          activity at DoD installations; however, these groups normally refrain from violent or
          destructive activities.
          2.2.1.3.3. A threat possibly overlooked may come from someone you work with
          day-to-day. The expression, “It must have been an inside job,” is a reasonable description
          of this type of threat. This threat can manifest itself at anytime. For example, the threat
          could possibly come from an enemy agent who has infiltrated our ranks or from a disgrun-
          tled coworker who purposely damages Air Force resources. Our ability to assess this
          potential threat to military operations is difficult. Our best defense against this type of
          threat is increasing our awareness of its potential existence.
       2.2.1.4. Minimizing the Threat. What can you do to minimize these threats?
          2.2.1.4.1. Maintain an awareness of the enemy’s aims, objectives, and subversive tech-
          niques.
          2.2.1.4.2. Develop a sense of personal dedication to national policy.
          2.2.1.4.3. Report to and discuss with your supervisor any activity appearing to be subver-
          sive or suspicious.
          2.2.1.4.4. Employ entry and internal control of personnel within your restricted area.
          2.2.1.4.5. Guard against the possible use of force to gain entry into a restricted area.
          2.2.1.4.6. Know the security procedures within your duty area. Contact your immediate
          supervisor when in doubt on any security policies.
          2.2.1.4.7. Know your security reporting and alerting procedures.
          2.2.1.4.8. When a suspicious hostile or a possible hostile event occurs, call either the Law
          Enforcement Desk (LED) or Central Security Control (CSC), ext (_____________). If no
          phone is available but you have radio contact through your control center, have your con-
          trol center contact the LED or CSC. Another option is to flag down security forces.
          DON’T HESITATE.
          2.2.1.4.9. Avoid complacency. Be aware that individuals intent on damaging Air Force
          resources will use an assortment of different methods to gain entry into a restricted area.
          For example, the use of impersonations may be attempted. A person looking, talking, and
          acting as either a bona fide officer, airman, telephone repair person, or a fire inspector may
          in reality be an enemy agent.
          2.2.1.4.10. Establish control systems to ensure only those with a NEED TO HAVE
          ACCESS to our protection level resources or classified information are granted access.
          Employ physical safeguards like safes, fences, lights, and anti-intrusion alarms to hinder
          espionage activities.
6                                                                       ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000


              2.2.1.4.11. Question anyone you either do not recognize or do not see wearing their
              Restricted Area Badge (RAB). Check all persons in your duty area for proper identifica-
              tion to include badge and proper area number designator. Just because someone has a
              RAB does not necessarily mean they are authorized into a particular restricted area.
                  2.2.1.4.11.1. Know the proper area number on the badge for entry into the restricted
                  area. When checking someone’s RAB, look it over carefully and make certain the
                  number for the area is not blotted out. Know your base’s locally devised codes for
                  RABs. If you discover an individual has a badge, and either the proper area number is
                  not open or some other portion of the badge is incorrect, contact security forces and
                  have the individual checked out. Don’t be quick to accept an individual’s claims or
                  excuses. Individuals either TDY or transiting your base may be using their home-sta-
                  tion RAB. When checking the RAB of an individual from another installation, ensure
                  the individual is listed on a current Entry Authority List (EAL) authenticated by a
                  supervisor from the local Security Forces Squadron.
                  2.2.1.4.11.2. Look for additional information concerning the use of RABs and EALs
                  in AFI 31-101, Chapter 9. If some uncertainty exists in any situation, contact the secu-
                  rity forces before letting the individual proceed. Be alert and don’t take anything for
                  granted.
                  2.2.1.4.11.3. Remove and secure your RAB upon departing the restricted area to
                  reduce the possibility of unauthorized use or counterfeiting.
              2.2.1.4.12. Knowing the Threat. Our mission is weakened as long as our base is vulnera-
              ble to clandestine activities like terrorism, espionage, and sabotage. We can eliminate this
              weakness only by YOUR active participation in our security system. To accomplish this,
              you must be knowledgeable of the local threat. (Identify any unclassified local threat
              information. Nuclear units must include the threats listed in DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear
              Weapons Security Manual).
    2.3. The Security Reporting and Alerting System. An integral part of the Physical Security Program
    is the Security Reporting and Alerting System. This section acquaints you with the system and your
    responsibilities.
       2.3.1. Purpose of the System.
           2.3.1.1. The Security Reporting and Alerting System is a rapid security communications sys-
           tem integrating all USAF bases and commands through a series of up-channel and down-chan-
           nel reports. Through this system either a hostile or possibly hostile event at one location, or a
           pattern of seemingly unrelated happenings at several locations, can serve as a basis for swift
           security alerting or warning throughout the USAF.
           2.3.1.2. It provides the earliest possible indication of enemy clandestine operations. It also
           enables us to capitalize on any timing error by an enemy attempting to coordinate widespread
           clandestine operations against individual bases.
       2.3.2. Reports and Conditions. By using up-channel reports, down-channel reports, and Threat
       Conditions (THREATCONs), we keep personnel at all levels informed of activities affecting the
       security of our protection level resources. Understanding when and how they are used is essential
       to the effectiveness of the Security Reporting and Alerting System.
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                               7


        2.3.2.1. Up-Channel Reports. The two types of up-channel reports used to alert command
        centers of possible and actual hostilities are nicknamed HELPING HAND (HH) and COV-
        ERED WAGON (CW).
            2.3.2.1.1. HH. This is an unclassified message CSC or the LED relays to the installation
            command post. It identifies unusual incidents, possibly hostile, affecting Protection Level
            1, 2, or 3 resources at an installation or dispersed site.
                2.3.2.1.1.1. Most installation command posts don’t relay this report to higher head-
                quarters since it reflects a situation not fully investigated or analyzed.
                2.3.2.1.1.2. Incidents must be investigated by security forces. A security team deter-
                mines if the event is hostile. It may turn out to be a procedural violation when an oth-
                erwise authorized individual fails to wear a RAB. In this case the HH report will be
                cancelled. Security forces record the incident using the proper incident report form.
                2.3.2.1.1.3. For HH situations determined to be hostile, the on-scene security forces
                immediately notifies LED or CSC who up-channels the CW report to the installation
                command post. The installation command post up-channels the CW report to the HQ
                ACC Command Center.
            2.3.2.1.2. CW. This initially is an unclassified up-channel telephone report (designator
            IMMEDIATE or FLASH) sent up the same communications channel and in the same for-
            mat as a HH report. CW reports inform higher-level headquarters that an unusual incident
            affecting Protection Level 1, 2, or 3 resources, probably or actually hostile, occurred at an
            installation or dispersed site.
                2.3.2.1.2.1. Based upon further investigation by security forces, a CW report may
                result from an upgraded HH. Regardless of severity, the installation command post
                accomplishes a CW report if they suspect intent to either damage protection level
                resources or disrupt the mission. The ACC Command Center requires a CW report if
                actual damage to protection level resources occurs. An example is hammering or
                splashing paint on an aircraft.
                2.3.2.1.2.2. When security forces declare a CW, each unit implements increased secu-
                rity measures based upon the appropriate Terrorist THREATCON procedure in their
                ISP.
     2.3.3. THREATCON. A Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff-approved program standardizing the mil-
     itary services’ identification of and recommended response to terrorist threats against United
     States personnel and facilities. This program facilitates inter-service coordination and support for
     AT activities. THREATCON is the standard term used to identify the security posture of each
     installation. The installation commander or higher authority may implement them whenever nec-
     essary. The increased security procedures implemented for a higher THREATCON are designed
     to build on the actions of a lesser condition. Detailed guidance on actions required under specific
     THREATCONs are found in AFI 31-210, its ACC supplement, and your ISP. There are five
     THREATCONs:
        2.3.3.1. THREATCON NORMAL: A general threat of possible terrorist activity exists, but
        warrants only a routine security posture.
8                                                                   ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000


       2.3.3.2. THREATCON ALPHA: This condition applies when there is a general threat of pos-
       sible terrorist activity against personnel and facilities, the nature and extent of which are
       unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of THREATCON
       BRAVO. The measures in this THREATCON must be capable of being maintained indefi-
       nitely. The following increased security measures can be expected upon implementation of
       THREATCON ALPHA:
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       2.3.3.3. THREATCON BRAVO: This condition applies when an increased and more predict-
       able threat of terrorist activity exists. The measures in this THREATCON must be capable of
       being maintained for weeks without causing undue hardship, affecting operational capability,
       and aggravating relations with local authorities. The following increased security measures
       can be expected upon the implementation of THREATCON BRAVO:
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       2.3.3.4. THREATCON CHARLIE: This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelli-
       gence is received indicating some form of terrorist action against personnel and facilities is
       imminent. Implementation of measures in this THREATCON for more than a short period
       probably create hardship and affect the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel. The
       following increased security measures can be expected upon implementation of THREAT-
       CON CHARLIE:
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       2.3.3.5. THREATCON DELTA: This condition applies in the immediate area where a terror-
       ist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a
       specific location or person is likely. The following increased security measures can be
       expected upon implementation of THREATCON DELTA:
       ___________________________________________________________________________
       ___________________________________________________________________________
    2.3.4. Down-Channel Alerting. The Threat Condition Alerting Message (TCAM) is a down-
    channel alerting order that sets in motion an increase in security readiness posture. When either
    the number of active up-channel reports, or intelligence indicators show actual or the potential for
    coordinated or widespread hostile activities, a TCAM is used to alert installation commanders of
    the need to increase their security readiness.
       2.3.4.1. The Air Force Operations Support Center or ACC Command Post transmits a TCAM
       electronically to installations.
       2.3.4.2. As a general rule, the message does not implement a theater-wide or Air Force-wide
       THREATCON. The message provides a synopsis of the situation leading to the release of the
       message and recommended courses of action. The TCAM provides commanders the flexibil-
       ity to tailor their THREATCON implementation actions to their local situation. However, if
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                                 9


         the alerting message mandates the implementation of a certain THREATCON, then imple-
         mentation is mandatory and can only be canceled by the originator.
  2.4. Security Reporting and Alerting System in Action. (Scenario)
     2.4.1. What appears to be a bullet hole is detected in the wing of an alert aircraft. Immediately
     someone calls CSC or the LED and initiates the alarm. This results in an automatic HH report to
     the installation command post.
         2.4.1.1. CSC/LED notifies and dispatches a patrol to the scene of the incident to investigate.
         The investigation confirms a bullet hole. The patrol notifies CSC/LED who, in turn, upgrades
         the situation to a CW. The Wing Command Post relays the report directly to the ACC Com-
         mand Post. The local base authorities implement the appropriate THREATCON.
         2.4.1.2. The ACC Command Center receives, logs, and evaluates the report. Reports received
         by the ACC Command Center from other installations indicate the possibility of coordinated,
         widespread hostile activity. Subsequently, the ACC Command Center sends a down-channel
         TCAM to all ACC installations describing the incidents and recommending THREATCON
         ALPHA actions be considered at those locations where incidents have not occurred. Most
         installations choose to implement THREATCON ALPHA. Since the alerting message did not
         mandate THREATCON implementation, the others chose to brief the incidents to the base
         populace and not to implement a THREATCON unless the local situation changes.
         2.4.1.3. The Most Essential Feature. What factor enables us to oppose unfolding, widespread,
         enemy clandestine operations with maximum possible preparedness? In one word--SPEED.
             2.4.1.3.1. Speed of initiating the proper reports at base level.
             2.4.1.3.2. Speed of reporting to higher headquarters and the subsequent analysis by higher
             headquarters.
             2.4.1.3.3. Remember, any circumstances delaying the receipt of HH and CW reports
             decreases the possibility of a timely reaction to the opening phase of a coordinated, wide-
             spread enemy attack.
  2.5. Control of Entry and Movement of Personnel Within Restricted Areas. An essential part of the
  security program is controlling personnel entry into restricted areas and their movement once inside.
  Entry into restricted areas, and movement of personnel within restricted areas, must be limited not
  only to those absolutely requiring entry to perform their official duties, but also to those who have
  been granted specific authority.
     2.5.1. Entry Authority. The two types of entry authority to restricted areas are escorted and
     unescorted.
         2.5.1.1. Escorted Entry. Visitors having an official need to enter a restricted area, but not on a
         frequent basis, must be escorted. In these instances, an escort official for the restricted area
         must validate the visitor’s need to enter the restricted area. The escort official is responsible
         for the visitor’s actions while inside the area and ensures the safe and secure conduct of the
         visitor.
             2.5.1.1.1. An escort official authorized to escort personnel within a specific area is identi-
             fied by an “E” typed next to the open restricted area number on the USAF RAB. EXCEP-
             TION: For restricted areas containing Protection Level 3 resources, any person having
10                                                                     ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000


            unescorted entry authority for the area may perform duties as an escort official. The escort
            official does not require an “E” printed next to the open area on the RAB.
            2.5.1.1.2. The escort official meets the visitor at the entry control point, verifies their iden-
            tity and need to enter the restricted area, registers the visitor on an AF Form 1109 ,Visitor
            Register, and gives a briefing on security procedures prior to entry.
            2.5.1.1.3. The escort official may designate another person to escort the visitor while in
            the area. The designated person must have unescorted entry for the area and cannot dele-
            gate this escort duty to any other personnel. The original escort official is still responsible
            for the visitor while the visitor is in the restricted area.
        2.5.1.2. Unescorted Entry. Authority is based on the frequency of a person’s need to enter the
        restricted area and personnel security qualifications. Those who have unescorted entry are
        issued a USAF RAB to facilitate entry control.
     2.5.2. Entry and Internal Circulation Controls.
        2.5.2.1. Entry Control. The USAF RAB serves as an official document issued to personnel
        who have been granted unescorted entry authority. RABs are designed with a series of num-
        bers, which are either open or blocked out, to indicate specific restricted areas a person is
        authorized to enter unescorted. There are two types of badge systems used to control entry to
        USAF restricted areas. The exchange badge system is designed for nuclear restricted areas. It
        is a positive entry control method based upon the exchanging of one RAB for an identical
        badge maintained at the entry control point of the area to be visited. The single-badge system
        designed for nonnuclear areas is the most frequently used. Since the single-badge system can
        be defeated with relative ease, the Security Forces entry controller uses at least one of the fol-
        lowing supporting identification or verification techniques prior to allowing entry.
            2.5.2.1.1. Personal Recognition. This is the most reliable means of verification if the
            number of personnel is relatively small.
            2.5.2.1.2. Signature and Credential Checks. A person can be asked to sign their name,
            recite their SSN, or show an ID card. The security force entry controller can use supple-
            mentary identification credentials other than the ID card.
            2.5.2.1.3. EAL. An EAL gives the following information on all authorized personnel:
            name, rank, last six numbers of the SSN, organization, RAB number, clearance status,
            dates of visits if applicable, and expiration date. The Security Forces entry controller
            maintains an EAL at the entry control point.
            2.5.2.1.4. Telephone or Radio Verification. The procedure for using telephone or radio
            verification here at (identify installation) is (identify local procedure).
            2.5.2.1.5. Sign and Countersign. The procedure for using sign and countersign here at
            (identify installation) is (identify local procedure).
            2.5.2.1.6. Code Words. The procedure for using code words here at (identify installation)
            is (identify local procedure).
        2.5.2.2. Duress Codes. A duress code is a predetermined word passed during normal conver-
        sation indicating a duress situation. All personnel working within Protection Level 1 and 2
        restricted areas will know the duress code and how to use it. Unless required by the Installa-
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                                   11


           tion Security Council, personnel other than security forces working within Protection Level 3
           restricted areas are not normally required to know the code. The local Chief of Security
           Forces establishes the duress code and all personnel must protect the code against inadvertent
           disclosure. If someone passes you the duress code, immediately contact security forces at ext
           (_____________) and report a duress situation in progress. DO NOT alert others in the area
           of your intentions to contact security forces if this might endanger their lives.
           2.5.2.3. Internal Circulation Control. The fundamental objective of an entry control proce-
           dure is to establish the identity of each person who seeks to enter. Security doesn’t stop there.
           Movement within the area must also be monitored and is the purpose of internal controls. If a
           saboteur or terrorist is able to penetrate the outer perimeter undetected, the last line of defense
           is those working within the area. In other words--YOU.
              2.5.2.3.1. Be watchful for either suspicious or careless acts or people in the area without a
              RAB.
              2.5.2.3.2. DON’T be fooled by persons in the area who use excuses like, “I forgot my
              badge” or “It must have fallen off.” Be alert. Everyone must have a badge or be properly
              escorted.
              2.5.2.3.3. Effective internal controls, supported by you, are extremely effective against
              clandestine actions. The very purpose of internal controls is to make the interior of a
              restricted area as hazardous an environment as possible for any unauthorized person.
              2.5.2.3.4. Security in a restricted area is a cooperative effort. Who knows better than
              another tug operator if someone is operating a tug in a manner potentially damaging to a
              mission aircraft? Who knows if an engine mechanic is properly performing aircraft main-
              tenance better than another mechanic? No restricted area is intruder proof; however, we
              can make it as secure as our system allows by working together and being alert to suspi-
              cious activity.

Section C—Additional Security Awareness Information

3. Individual Program Responsibilities.
   3.1. The one basic requirement for everyone is IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION AND REACTION
   TO HOSTILE ACTS. Here are the actions necessary to effectively control and counter either hostile
   or possibly hostile events. What follows is a simplified effort to explain HOW YOU can meet your
   security obligation while performing duties in a restricted area.
       3.1.1. First and foremost, you must be ALERT. Know who and what is going on around you at all
       times. Be alert for unauthorized personnel in the area. As you approach individuals, look for their
       RABs. If they have proper badges, and you recognize them, resume your duties. If they have
       badges, but are not recognized, check the RABs further. Determine if they have not only the
       authority but also an official reason for being in the area.
       3.1.2. DETECT hostile acts possibly affecting our protection level resources. Look for abnormal
       equipment conditions to include cut wires, improper positioning, and visual signs of tampering.
       Be alert for damage to protection level resources to include bullet holes, gouges from objects used
       to strike the resource, or other types of damage.
12                                                                      ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000


        3.1.3. Upon detection, ALERT OTHERS in the immediate area. Yell “HELPING HAND” loud
        and clear! Alerting others in the area will bring assistance. If you hear the “HELPING HAND”
        alarm, safety permitting, stop what you are doing and assist. Either noise levels or extreme dis-
        tances may prevent personnel from hearing the alert. In these situations visual signals are neces-
        sary. The day and night “HELPING HAND” signals for this installation are:
        ______________________________________________________________________________
        ______________________________________________________________________________
        3.1.4. After alerting others in the area when an unidentified person is found, you have the twofold
        responsibility of reporting the incident to LED or CSC by phone or radio through your control
        center and detaining the individual. Accomplish these tasks simultaneously to the best of your
        ability.
        3.1.5. Your responsibilities become relatively simple if other personnel are immediately available.
        You obtain their assistance to detain and move the unidentified person away from the protection
        level resources in the area. You then run to the nearest telephone or vehicle radio and report the
        nature and location of the incident to CSC or LED. If a Security Forces patrol is in the area and
        readily available, attract their attention.
        3.1.6. What if no other personnel are available to assist?
            3.1.6.1. The obligation of detaining an unauthorized person, and promptly reporting the inci-
            dent, may require you to accomplish one task at the expense of another. In such instances, you
            must accurately evaluate the number of suspects, and in the case of a lone individual, the sus-
            pect’s comparative physical stature. You must quickly determine if they possess weapons and
            the extent of damage they could possibly inflict on our critical resources. These consider-
            ations must be compared with the time it would take you to report the incident to CSC or the
            LED and receive assistance from the security forces. Accomplish both tasks simultaneously if
            possible.
            3.1.6.2. If the situation is obviously beyond your capability to control, report the incident to
            CSC or LED as rapidly as possible. Stay cool and speak plainly when reporting. Don’t omit
            the WHAT and WHERE of your report. Security Forces require these two factors when dis-
            patching the help you need.
            3.1.6.3. After you make the report, return to the area where the suspect was last seen. Attempt
            to relocate the suspect and keep this individual under observation. Look for the Security
            Forces patrol and attract their attention so they will arrive on scene at the earliest possible
            moment. Meet the Security Forces patrol and REPORT the incident along with any other per-
            tinent information you have. Explain what happened. The information you give the Security
            Forces is the basis for their necessary counteractions. The Security Forces may call upon you
            to assist in searching the area as required.
        3.1.7. It is no exaggeration when we say our combat capability is placed in unnecessary jeopardy
        if we fail to carry out our individual security responsibilities. It is everyone’s responsibility to
        DETECT and REPORT hostile or possibly hostile events, and DETAIN unauthorized persons
        when possible.
     3.2. Key Installation Security Documents.
ACCPAM31-101 25 MAY 2000                                                                                 13


     3.2.1. ISP.
         3.2.1.1. Purpose. This is the basic planning document for contingency operations. Each base
         routinely supporting protection level resources publishes an ISP.
         3.2.1.2. What it Contains. There are several annexes and appendices to the ISP. If not pub-
         lished separately due to being classified, these contain the base threat analysis, as well as tasks
         and responsibilities for organizations during increased THREATCONs and contingency oper-
         ations. The installation commander makes every attempt to ensure the ISP covers as many
         scenarios as possible affecting the operational status of protection level resources on the instal-
         lation.
     3.2.2. Installation Security Instruction (ISI).
         3.2.2.1. Purpose. The ISI forms the foundation for security operations at your base. Each
         installation either possessing or routinely supporting protection level resources is required to
         have a security instruction. The installation commander issues, approves, and ensures imple-
         mentation of the ISI as an installation directive.
         3.2.2.2. What it Contains. The ISI describes normal security operations. For example, the
         requirements for permission to enter restricted areas are addressed. It designates each
         restricted area, its location, and entry and internal control procedures for each area. Your
         installation commander is the primary authority for granting unescorted access to restricted
         areas on base. This responsibility may be delegated to commanders having direct control over
         the resources within the restricted area. In the case of Security Forces personnel, the Security
         Force unit commander may be the designee for this responsibility. The ISI identifies the indi-
         viduals authorized by the installation commander to grant unescorted entry into restricted
         areas. The ISI also includes a list of all protection level resources on the installation in order
         of importance, the security responsibilities for supporting force (owner/user) personnel, and
         the Security Forces posting priority chart.
  3.3. Conclusion. A lack of emphasis on security awareness training will ultimately create a compla-
  cent attitude among the personnel working near our protection level resources. Commanders and
  supervisors have the responsibility of ensuring personnel are working together as a team against
  threats to our protection level resources. Individuals and groups who make plans to carry out threats
  against the United States Air Force are only as successful as we allow them to be. Your active partic-
  ipation in the Physical Security Awareness Program is a vital part of making our resources as unattrac-
  tive a target as possible.
