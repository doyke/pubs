SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Paragraph 1.5.10.12 was changed to reflect a change from Corrosion Control Manager (CCM) to
Wing Corrosion Program Manager (WCPM). Also all references to the CCM were changed to
WCPM. Paragraph 7.3.5. was changed to remove reference to soap being used for washing the
static aircraft. Deleted paragraph 1.5.10.4.4 to comply with AFI 84-103. Changed paragraph
7.3.6 to identify the HPC as the maintainer of the aircraft records.
1.5.10.3. 366 FW/CV (Vice Commander) is the approval authority for installation HPA.
1.5.10.4.3. (Added) The 366th Maintenance Group Commander (366 MXG/CC) will designate
the installation Historical Property Custodian (HPC) in writing and provide a copy to the HPC
and ACC/HO.
1.5.10.4.4. (Added) The 366 FW/HO (Wing Historian) is the alternate HPC. 366 FW/HO will
perform the record keeping function for any Historical Property as outlined in paragraph 6.14
and 7.3.6. 366 FW/HO does not possess the skill sets necessary to perform the duties of the
primary HPC.
1.5.10.12. (Added) The 366th Maintenance Group Commander (366 MXG/CC) will designate
the Wing Corrosion Program Manager (WCPM) in accordance with ACCI 21-105.
4.5.5. In coordination with 366 FW/CV and the 366th Comptroller Squadron, Financial
Manager (366 CPTS/FM), HPC will establish a separate funding account for the conservation,
preservation, and maintenance of static displays. This includes, but is not limited to: funding
provided for cleaning equipment, paint, and any other required consumable materials; this
funding also applies to contracted washes, if applicable. Note: Funds must be approved by the
installation commander (refer to AFI 84-103, Chapter 4).
7.3.1. WCPM will annually inspect the structural integrity and paint condition of all static
display aircraft and document all discrepancies on AF Form 3581, USAF Museum Aerospace
Vehicle Static Display Maintenance Log. Perform this inspection no later than 1 March each
year so maintenance can be accomplished during summer months. Paint or touch up aircraft as
determined by WCPM. In addition, a representative from the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron
(366 CES) will annually inspect and maintain aircraft display areas, which include concrete pads,
display stands, lighting, descriptive plaques, and landscaping as needed. Brief safety related
items immediately to 366 FW/SE (Safety Office) and HPC.
7.3.1.1. (Added) The HPC and WCPM will establish guidelines for a civilian contractor to paint
aircraft as determined by the annual corrosion inspection by WCPM. In the event a contract is
not in place, or an immediate need for aircraft to have small areas painted or corrosion repaired,
HPC will, through the 366th Equipment Maintenance Squadron, Maintenance Supervision (366
EMS/MXM), coordinate with WCPM to schedule a date for work to be accomplished. Note:
WCPM or designated representative will coordinate time, date, and oversee all aspects of aircraft
painting to ensure safety and environmental guidelines are followed. Ideally, aircraft should be
painted between 15 March–15 June, or 15 September–15 October, to maximize weather
conditions. Also, the WCPM is responsible for coordinating the use of required maintenance
stands, portable air compressors, etc. Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM) Section orders all
supplies and funded from the established Airpark fund account.

7.3.5. HPC and WCPM will establish guidelines for a civilian contracted wash schedule. In the
event a contract is not in place, or there is an immediate need for the aircraft to be washed (e.g.,
very important visitors (VIP) visits, special functions, or changes of command), HPC will,
through 366 EMS/MXM, coordinate with the 366th Operations Group (366 OG), 366 MXG, the
366th Mission Support Group (366 MSG), and the 366th Medical Group (366 MDG) Group
Enlisted Managers (GEM) for manpower support. A minimum of four personnel are required
from each group to wash aircraft. Note: The WCPM or designated representative will
coordinate time, date, and oversee all aspects of aircraft washing to ensure safety guidelines are
being followed and a quality job is performed. All materials utilized for static display washes
will be environmentally friendly products from the Quality Products List (QPL). Ideally, all
aircraft should be washed during the same week to maximize utilization of maintenance stands
and related equipment, and minimize damage to landscaping. WCPM will supply all wash
equipment to include: scrub handles, pads, protective equipment, and portable aircraft washing
unit. WCPM is also responsible for coordinating the use of required maintenance stands,
portable air compressors, etc., if required. Supplies are funded from the established Airpark
account.
7.3.6. A copy of the AF Form 3581 for each aircraft along with a record of true tail numbers is
maintained By the HPC. Also, in addition to requirements in paragraph 6.14.1.3., 366 FW/HO
will schedule annual photographs of all historical property and maintain them in their office.
