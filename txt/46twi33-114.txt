Sustainment Life Cycle Management). This instruction applies to all 46 TW organizations. No
waivers of any kind shall be granted for any part of this publication. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; Route AF IMT 847s from
the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the      Air      Force     Records      Disposition      Schedule    (RDS)       located      at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the removal of all references to outdated requirements levied by the certification and
authentication process, including roles and responsibilities associated with the IT Lean process in
the Enterprise Information Technology Data Repository.

1. Purpose. This instruction provides the guidance and procedures that personnel must use to
plan, develop, use, maintain, and support 46 TW software applications in order to effectively and
efficiently complete their assigned missions. It applies to software developed for unique 46 TW
purposes (other than software internal to a weapon system; see AFPD 63-1).
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. 46 TW Plans Office, Information Systems Division (46 TW/XPI), establishes and
     oversees computer software management regulatory and policy guidelines for the 46 TW.
        2.1.1. Coordinates with the host communications unit or servicing Network Control
        Center before implementing any software.
        2.1.2. Establishes a software reuse library or repository for internal sharing of the
        reusable software components developed at the 46 Test Wing.
        2.1.3. Supports 46 TW Program Managers (PMs) in registering their software into the
        Enterprise Information Technology Data Repository (EITDR) and maintaining
        information in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act
        (FISMA) requirements.
     2.2. System Information Assurance Manager (IAM): Ensures that all locally developed
     software is compliant with all DoD, AF, and AFMC policies.
        2.2.1. Enforces the Certification and Accreditation process, roles and responsibilities,
        and review and approval thresholds and milestones for 46 TW locally developed
        software, according to established DoD, AF, and AFMC policies.
        2.2.2. Implements DoD, AF, and AFMC recommendations for acquisition and use of
        computer software and for monitoring and combating the use of unauthorized computer
        software.
        2.2.3. Ensures that all TW production software is installed and operated on only IT
        systems that have received official certification and accreditation (C&A) from their
        responsible Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA) and has been approved for use by
        the IT system’s Configuration Control Board (CCB).
     2.3. TW Organizations: Develop local computer application software only when quality,
     cost, performance, schedule, or interoperability requirements cannot be met with Commercial
     Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) software.
        2.3.1. Provide an approved mission needs statement to 46 TW/XPI and follow guidance
        for software acquired under DoD 5000-series acquisitions before developing software
        requiring over 6 man-months of effort, costing in excess of $50,000, or operating on the
        AF Global Information Grid.
        2.3.2. All software that is developed must comply with federal, DoD and Air Force
        certification requirements, including AFPD 33-2, Information Assurance (IA) Program,
        and the Air Force 33-200 series publications, such that IA is integrated into the software
        at all points throughout its development lifecycle.
3. Software Developed Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software Tools. Test Wing
computer users at Eglin AFB or 46 Test Group, Holloman AFB NM, may need to use their
licensed COTS office software (i.e., Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, etc.) to increase their
46TWI33-114 14 JUNE 2012                                                                        3


individual professional productivity and overall unit effectiveness. Prior to initiating any local
development software, Eglin AFB user-developers must coordinate their networked or “group”
productivity tools with 46 TW/XPI. 46 TG user-developers must coordinate with 46 TG/XPI.
This requirement precludes future impact on network and server capacity, avoids duplication of
effort on similar software tools within the Wing at either location, and ensures continued support
after departure of one or more of the original user-developers. Test Wing user-developers shall:
   3.1. Ensure the 46 TW retains property rights to the software tools developed in the course
   of their duties.
   3.2. Not by-pass computer/network server operating systems, security systems, or access
   controls provided by higher authority.
   3.3. Ensure that locally-developed software will accommodate network infrastructure
   considerations into its systems design and internal code, such that it does not overtax the
   infrastructure on which it relies and operates.
   3.4. User-developers at Eglin AFB requiring 46 TW server access, even shared access
   drives, shall request access from 46 TW/XPI using the Server Utilization Request Form
   (SURF). The request must include:
       3.4.1. The author or point of contact, organization, telephone number, and email address.
       3.4.2. The PM’s name, funding POC’s name, and Security Accreditation POC’s name.
       3.4.3. A descriptive unclassified application name and acronym with version number as
       the first delivery (use Version 1.0).
       3.4.4. A brief unclassified description of the software’s functionality and what mission it
       will be used to accomplish.
       3.4.5. How source code will be maintained.
       3.4.6. Number of test users expected during development.
       3.4.7. Initial database size estimation.
       3.4.8. Estimated number of actual users once software is in production.
   3.5. User-developers at 46 Test Group shall coordinate their server requirements through 46
   TG/XPI.
   3.6. Once software has been approved and developed, a brief user’s guide must be
   submitted. The user’s guide should include:
       3.6.1. Any unique hardware configuration required.
       3.6.2. The supporting software required, including the operating system and (if any)
       supporting COTS software with version release number.
       3.6.3. Compiling and linking instructions, if applicable.
4                                                             46TWI33-114 14 JUNE 2012



    3.6.4. Descriptions of the software installation process, required hardware setup, menus,
    and software capabilities and functions.
    3.6.5. Samples of print products produced (if any).
    3.6.6. Other information useful for continued effective use and maintenance of the
    mission application software.
