                                        OPERATIONS

1.1. Air Force Fitness and Sports Program. Air Force Fitness and Sports Program has a two-
tiered mission. The primary mission is to support unit commander fitness programs which entails
liaison with unit Physical Training Leaders (PTLs), support the Fitness Improvement Program
(FIP) and provide on-site, interactive customer service with equipment and facility orientations.
The secondary mission is to provide core fitness and sports programs to all authorized users.
Refer to AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility for program participation priorities.
Where military facilities are not available, use appropriated funds (APF) to contract with
specified local facilities (refer to AFI 65-106 Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs).)
   1.1.1. Funding. Core fitness and sports programs in Air Force Fitness Centers (FC) are
   Category A activities. The Air Force goal is 100 percent APF support where authorized in
   Category A activities. Enhanced sports programs are Category B activities. Category B
   activities are supported with APFs and nonappropriated funds (NAF). Revenue generating
   activities such as vending and resale services are Category C activities. Category C activities
   must function with the use of NAFs only. NAF expenditures should be appropriate to the
   number of participants. Effective planning and budgeting are essential to ensure successful
   execution of activities and future projects. Fees and/or charges for enhanced instructional
   classes and special events are authorized only to offset verifiable NAF expenses for these
   services. NAF funds can be used for transportation costs and entry fees but not for food or
   lodging for varsity sports (see Table 2.3). Funds generated from fundraisers may be used to
   offset the costs of enhanced sports programs, e.g. varsity sports reference, in accordance with
   AFI 34-201, Use of Non Appropriated Funds. APFs must be used where authorized. The
   fitness center director (FCD) should coordinate with the resource management flight chief
   (RMFC) for expenditures with NAFs from either the installation MWR Fund and /or higher
   HQ NAFs.
   1.1.2. Golden Eagle Standards. Golden Eagle Standards (GES) ensure a uniform level of
   service is provided to our customers and establish mandatory technical material and
   operational specifications for all Services programs and activities. Compliance with GES is
   mandatory. Current Fitness GES can be found on the Air Force Fitness and Sports website
   https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/FT/Standard.htm.
   1.1.3. 5 Star Recognition Program. The Fitness 5 Star Recognition Program is an annual
   assessment determining superior achievement for those fitness centers that have
   demonstrated excellence in the areas of operations, programs, training, facilities, and
   customer service. The program provides an incentive to exceed standards and achieve
   excellence. 5 Star bases will be recognized during the Air Force Fitness and Sports Awards
   ceremony.
1.2. Fitness Center Hours of Operation. Main FCs will be open 112 hours per week; Reserve
bases will be open 70 hours per week. Hours of operation must be displayed within view of
customers outside the FC. Installation commanders also have the discretion to alter operation
hours based on available Services personnel and installation mission requirements. Expanding
 6                                                AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011


hours beyond the Air Force standard requires resources (manpower and funding) at the local
level. If expanded hours are preferred, consider civilian overhires, NAF memorandums of
agreement and Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel as delivery methods. Prior to
expanding hours of operation, consider the availability of all alternate exercise avenues (running
tracks, bike trails, par course, unit physical training facility (UPTF), etc.). FCs should usually be
open on federal holidays, especially New Year’s Day. Recognizing the unique place
Thanksgiving and Christmas hold in American family tradition, the installation commander may
elect to close FCs on these days.
     1.2.1. After-Hour Use at Main Operating Base (MOB) Fitness Facilities. Unsupervised,
     after-hour use of Services primary or satellite/annex fitness facilities at MOBs, by units or
     individuals is prohibited. Unsupervised after-hour use promotes an unsafe environment and
     puts the customer in jeopardy. The use of facilities after hours increases the opportunity for
     damage and theft and often interferes with custodial contract cleaning. Use other exercise
     avenues (running tracks, bike trails, par course, UPTF, etc.) after-hours.
     1.2.2. (Added) After-Hour Use at Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) Facilities. Air
     Force mission requirements often place Airmen in duty locations where main operating base
     fitness facilities are unavailable, while Airmen remain accountable for maintaining Air Force
     physical fitness standards. Unsupervised after-hours use of geographically separated satellite
     facilities is permitted at geographically separated locations/installations. MAJCOM A1S
     fitness staff may assist installations/units to determine the appropriate classification of their
     installation facility as pertains to this policy. Prior to implementation of this policy, host
     installation commanders must conduct and document an Operational Risk Management
     assessment, document the local wingman policy, and post written instructions specific to the
     standards for unsupervised after-hours use of the fitness facility. For added safety, the
     facility must have a readily available first-aid kit, and automated external defibrillator
     (AED), and a phone with 24-hour emergency contact information posted.
1.3. Alternate Services Fitness Facilities.
     1.3.1. Additional Fitness Centers. Additional FCs operate a minimum of 30 hours a week
     and contain the full complement of equipment. These facilities include all courts, group
     exercise areas, fitness equipment areas (cardiovascular, free weight, and selectorized), steam
     or sauna rooms, showers, lockers, and equipment issue for customer use. Single areas that are
     separate from, but in proximity to, the primary fitness center such as ball courts (basketball,
     volleyball, wallyball, racquetball, etc.), weight rooms, and aerobic or group exercise areas,
     do not qualify as additional fitness center facilities; these areas (annexes) are considered part
     of the primary fitness center.
     1.3.2. Satellite Fitness Facility. A single satellite fitness facility operates a minimum of 30
     hours per week, is geographically separated from the primary fitness center, is established to
     provide additional capabilities during peak periods and must be operated by the fitness center
     staff on a no-fee basis. Use of these facilities will not be restricted to specific units. Typically
     these facilities provide more than one area such as ball courts (basketball, volleyball,
     wallyball, racquetball, etc), weight rooms, locker rooms, and aerobic or group exercise areas.
     NOTE: Satellite facilities provide several core activities, but are not considered full-service
     primary fitness centers or annexes.

   1.3.3. Unit Physical Training Facility (UPTF) (Note: UPTF supersedes the term mini
   fitness center). The Installation commander authorizes UPTFs (unit owned, funded and
   maintained fitness areas not operated by the Services squadron/division) when he/she
   validates the installation’s fitness facilities cannot meet the requesting unit’s requirements.
   The number of UPTFs should be kept to a minimum and approved only when circumstances
   warrant their existence. Requests for a UPTF are submitted by the unit commander through
   the Services commander/director. UPTF fitness equipment must meet GES. Units approved
   to operate a UPTF will coordinate with the FCD to purchase equipment and maintenance
   contracts using Allowance Standard (AS) 410, Allowance ID: 410COOB, and in accordance
   with manufacturer’s recommendations. For detailed procedures see AFMAN 23-110, USAF
   Supply Manual.
   1.3.4. Air National Guard (ANG) Fitness Rooms. Facility size normally ranges from 600
   to 2600 square feet and is defined in ANG design guides. The Fitness Room normally
   provides areas for cardiovascular, free weights, and selectorized equipment. The installation
   commander will set the hours of operation based on mission requirements.
1.4. Minimum Age Limit. Age limitations are established and must be displayed in each FC to
ensure a safe environment for all FC customers. The Air Force standards are consistent with
guidelines established by medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP), American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (NSCA). Installation commanders should use caution when lowering
the minimum age for unsupervised use of FCs. All deviations from the standard must be
documented in a written base policy. Children of any age may be spectators during sports
competitions or special events if immediately supervised by an adult.

                                          special event.

NOTES:
* Interactive supervision requires adult and child to participate in/perform activity together at all
times.
** The AAP, ACSM, and NSCA recognize youth vary in emotional and physical levels of
maturity. Youth typically need more gradual, carefully organized, and structured training
programs than adults. Caution is required while supervising youth in these areas.
*** AAP, ACSM, and NSCA guidelines point to clear and definite risks for youth in the
cardiovascular and resistance training areas. Guidelines can be found at https://www-
r.afsv.af.mil/FT/links.htm.
1.5. Fitness Center Staff (FCS). Personnel include: active duty military, full-time ARC
personnel, APF and NAF civilians, local national workers, contractors, and volunteers. Training

blood borne pathogen, equipment. A minimum of two staff members must be on duty during all
hours of operation for emergency response capabilities (this does not apply to ANG).
     1.5.1. Volunteers. The use of volunteers is beneficial for effective programming.
     Individuals and groups from nearby communities, schools, colleges, family members, as well
     as off-duty military are excellent sources of volunteers. Do not use volunteers to perform
     duties that are recurring in nature and normally performed by the staff, but use volunteers to
     supplement the established work force. Develop effective training programs to maximize
     volunteer talents. Provide and document volunteers’ training. Recognize volunteer efforts by
     nominating them for local and Air Force level awards.
1.6. Uniforms. FCS (military, APF and NAF civilian employees) and contracted personnel
(with the exception of personal services contractors and resale contract services) will wear the
AF Informal Uniform in accordance with the guidelines posted on the HQ Services Agency

1.14. Funds Management. All Department of Defense personnel paid with either APF’s or
NAFs have an individual responsibility for the proper collection, protection, and controlling of
funds.
   1.14.1. Funds Protection. Funds assets must be protected IAW AFI 34-202, Protecting
   Nonappropriated Fund Assets, and local resource protection plans. The RFMC ensures that
   managers implement internal control procedures for protection of assets. FCD must establish
   written procedures for the handling and safeguarding of fund assets.
   1.14.2. Budgets. Budgets are financial plans. Proper and timely planning, and valid
   historical data are essential factors in the budgeting process. The process of budgeting also
   includes consolidation and refinement of the various activities’ priorities made within the
   planning process. The more thoroughly you document your requirements and justifications,
   the more likely requirements will be funded in a consolidated budget. Begin the budget
   process several months prior to the beginning of the fiscal year and coordinate with your
   RMFC and Resource Advisor. Accumulate data to support past operating expenses.
       1.14.2.1. Category A. Mission essential programs are authorized 100% APF support.
       Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-106,

       Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs and
       Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities for guidance on APF funding support. When
       APFs are not available submit any capital or operational needs for which APFs are
       authorized, but not available, as unfunded requirements in the APF budget.
       1.14.2.2. Category B. Enhanced sports programs are authorized APF and NAF support,
       e.g., varsity sports, MAJCOM Sports Competitions, Air Force and Armed Forces Sports.
       1.14.2.3. Category C. These activities are fully funded with NAFs (direct support), e.g.,
       resale services and vending operations.
   1.14.3. Approval Authority. NAF budgets are reviewed by the NAF Council and approved
   by the installation commander. The installation commander also approves the APF budget.
   1.14.4. Procurement. Basic knowledge of the Government Purchase Card (GPC) Program,
   the supply system, and both local and applicable higher HQ processes for each type of
   procurement, NAF and APF, are important. Refer to AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-
   Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program, for information concerning procurement.
1.15. Outdoor Maintenance. The FCD is responsible for developing a written annual grounds
maintenance plan for the upkeep and maintenance of all outdoor facilities. This function can be
contracted or performed in-house. Certain tasks may be performed by the Base Civil Engineer
(BCE) such as grass cutting, application of insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Safety is also
a major concern when maintenance is performed on outdoor facilities. Ensure that proper
equipment and tools used for outdoor maintenance are in good repair.
1.16. Running Tracks. Refer to the USAF Fitness Facilities Design Guide for indoor track
specifications. For outdoor tracks, refer to UFC 4-750-02, Outdoor Sports and Recreational
Facilities, http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc_4_750_02n.pdf. FCS must periodically
inspect the entire track for damage regardless of track surface, following the manufacturer’s
guidelines on preventive maintenance. Qualified technicians must accomplish repairs and
preventative maintenance; coordinate actions with BCE. At least one outdoor exercise area
(running trail/track, par/obstacle course, etc.) must be available, in good condition, and clearly
marked.
1.17. Marketing and Promotions. The FCD will use CORPORATE PRISM data to develop a
comprehensive marketing plan and work with the marketing staff to develop promotional,
advertising, commercial sponsorship, and publicity strategies. Complete local needs assessments
and/or local surveys annually to determine customer needs and incorporate these findings into
the annual program/marketing plan. Coordinate marketing/promotions efforts with HAWC
personnel. Use customer feedback to promote program changes and justify expenditures.
1.18. Continuity Folder. Maintaining up-to-date and accurate records is necessary to plan
future programs. A continuity folder provides a comprehensive historical overview of the
operation and eases the transition of incoming and outgoing personnel. It should contain
information on operations, finances, personnel, fitness and sports programs, after-action reports,
facilities, equipment and a marketing plan. The FCD determines additional contents and
develops and maintains a current continuity folder. The Fitness and Sports website provides
additional continuity folder information at https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/FT/ContinuityBook.htm.

                                         PROGRAMS

2.1. Size of Program. Design the activities at the FC to support core services and programs.
The number of program offerings is based upon the size of the military installation (e.g. a small
base should offer a minimum of 10 group exercise classes/week). The criteria for determining
base size is the total number of assigned military personnel (including Air Force and other U.S.
military personnel and full-time ARC personnel assigned to the base), inter-service support
agreements with other U.S. services, and 50 percent of family members (age 13 years or older).
For Air Education Training Command (AETC), authorized permanent change of station (PCS)
students must be added to the permanent party figures for all bases. For Pacific Air Forces
(PACAF) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), TDY personnel assigned for more
than 30 consecutive days may be added to the permanent party figures for all bases. Outside of
the Continental United States (OCONUS) also includes civilians assigned to the bases and 50
percent of their family members age 13 and over. Small bases have a total military population of
less than 1,000; medium bases have 1,000 to 5,000, and large bases have more than 5,000
people. Reserve and ANG bases, GSUs and MUNSS will meet programming standards
established by the MAJCOM.
2.2. Core and Enhanced Fitness Programs. FCs will provide core programs at no cost to their
customers and where resources are available, provide enhanced programs. Core fitness program
requirements must be met prior to conducting enhanced programs.

Table 2.1. Core Fitness Programs

1. Group Exercise Classes              A minimum of 10 offerings per week at small bases
                                       and 15 offerings per week at medium and large
                                       bases, e.g. step aerobics, strength conditioning, low
                                       impact aerobics, cardio boxing. *
2. Equipment Orientations              Trained FCS must provide orientations on proper
                                       equipment usage (how to use each machine as well
                                       as safe positioning and execution) for all cardio and
                                       strength machines on an appointment basis or
                                       through regularly scheduled classes.
3. Fitness Assessments                 Must offer to first term Airmen and other active
                                       duty and ARC members free of charge. Program
                                       may be offered to other customers as time and
                                       resources allow.
4. Fitness Improvement Programs Offer a combination of aerobics and strength
                                conditioning classes based on local needs to support
                                AF Fitness Program.
5. Incentive Programs                  4 per year, e.g. cycle and swim program, jogging
                                       club, etc.
 16                                           AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011


6. Special Events                       4 per year, of which one should be family oriented,
                                        e.g. walk/runs, sports days, etc.


NOTE: * Classes should provide aerobic, strength, and flexibility conditioning appropriate for
fitness development. Careful consideration should be given to providing a variety of classes
meeting these requirements. Examples are high/low impact, cardio-kick boxing, group cycling,
circuit training, ―abs‖ classes, and group strength training. Class offerings above the minimum
may be provided with NAFs and customers charged a fee accordingly.
2.3. Group Exercise Instructors. Group exercise instructors must have and maintain a primary
instructor certification by an organization listed on the GES web page https://www-
r.afsv.af.mil/FT/Training.htm. Instructors must obtain the additional necessary specialized
certifications for step, group cycling, and cardio kickboxing classes. These may be received from
other than primary certification organizations. Yoga and aquacise/water instructors may have a
specialized certification without a primary aerobics certification if yoga or aquacise is the only
class they teach. Group exercise instructors for core programs are an APF expense. Group
exercise instructors will also maintain current First Aid, BLS/AED (American Heart) or
CPR/AED (Red Cross) certification.
2.4. Fitness Assessments. Fitness staff can conduct assessments and provide exercise programs
for active duty personnel upon request. Fitness assessments measure cardiorespiratory fitness,
muscular strength and endurance, body composition, and flexibility using either a manual or
computerized system. Examples of assessment modules include a step or sub-maximal cycle test,
sit and reach, sit ups and push ups, and skin fold calipers. Fitness assessments must be conducted
only by contract personal trainers and/or trained fitness staff who, at a minimum, have completed
the AETC Fitness Specialist Course.
2.5. Fitness Improvement Programs (FIP). These programs target active duty personnel who
do not meet Air Force fitness standards for aerobic fitness, muscular strength and circumferential
tape measurement. IAW AFI 10-248, these individuals must have priority in FIP classes, but
classes may be open to other individuals as space allows. The FC must offer the appropriate
number of FIP classes (this will be determined by the number of individuals who are enrolled in
the base FIP) in addition to core group exercise classes. Schedules must accommodate day,
swing, and midnight shift personnel. Consider scheduling FIP during ―non-peak‖ hours. Both
aerobic and strength classes must be offered as part of this program and be marketed as ―FIP.‖
Qualified FCS may conduct FIP classes. Recommendations for FIP include, but are not limited
to, supervised walking/jogging groups, aerobics classes, equipment-based classes, and strength
conditioning classes, ―abs‖ classes, ―spinning‖ classes, circuit training, or a combination of
these. Use APFs to support installation FIP. Coordination with the HAWC FPM is required to
ensure appropriate class format, instruction, and document attendance.
2.6. Enhanced Fitness Programs. Programs that provide enhanced fitness opportunities may
be offered at the discretion of the squadron commander or division director. Fees may be charged
for all enhanced programs; these may include, but are not limited to, group exercise classes
beyond the core (e.g., group cycling, Tai Chi, Yoga, Aquacise, etc.) and one-on-one personal
fitness training.
AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011                                                             17


   2.6.1. Personal Training Instructors. Personal training may be offered on a fee-for-service
   basis through a personal trainer contract. Contract personal training instructors must have
   verification of at least 100 hours of individual fitness program experience to include fitness
   assessments and cardiovascular and strength conditioning programs, and have current
   certification by an organization listed on the GES web page (https://www-
   r.afsv.af.mil/FT/Training.htm). Personal training instructors will also maintain current First
   Aid, BLS/AED (American Heart) or CPR/AED (Red Cross) certification.
2.7. Sports Programs. FCs will provide core sports programs for eligible customers and, where
resources are available, provide enhanced programs (see Table 2.2). Sports calendars will be
developed annually at the beginning of the fiscal year and made available to customers.
Calendars will give an overview of sports offered at the installation and include start dates, letter
of intent due dates, coach’s meeting dates, and projected end dates.
   2.7.1. Youth Sports Partnership. The Fitness Center Sports program and the Youth Sports
   program will maintain separate operations. However, where and when feasible, both
   programs are encouraged to partner together for cost savings and program efficiency in areas
   such as sharing sports fields, ordering and storing equipment, and ordering trophies.
       2.7.1.1. Security Checks. In reference to securing sports officials (volunteer or
       contractors) for joint programs, background checks should be conducted IAW AFI 34-
       804, Air Force Youth Sports Program 4.1 Effective Volunteer Management and DODI
       1402.5 Criminal History and Background Checks on Individuals in Child Care Services.
   2.7.2. Outdoor Fields. The FCD must team with representatives from safety, BCE, and
   Military Public Health and perform a pre-season and post-season inspection.

2.8. Core Sports Programs. Core sports programs are Category A and promote organized
sports and esprit de corps.
   2.8.1. Intramural Sports. The intramural program is recreational in nature. The installation
   commander determines participation which may include active duty, full time guardsmen and
   reservists assigned to base units, adult family members (18 years or older), Department of
   Defense (DoD) civilians (including NAF employees), base contract personnel, and active
   duty foreign nationals. Active duty military personnel always have first priority in intramural
   sports participation (follow eligibility criteria established in AFI 34-262). Other categories of
   customers may participate in the intramural program if their participation is needed to offer a
   particular program. Sports programs should include individual and team sports for men and
   women as well as co-ed teams where possible.
      2.8.1.1. Intramural Director. The FCD appoints an intramural director who works for
      the SD at installations with large sports programming. It is not a mandatory position but
      often used on an as needed basis. The intramural director must be available to visit with
      participants, evaluate officials, and ensure playing conditions satisfy safety and program
      standards. The intramural director or designated representative will be available to
      resolve any questions or conflicts that may arise during the course of play. Most
      intramural programs are seasonal and are scheduled using collegiate schedules. Location
      and weather conditions may affect some sports schedules.
      2.8.1.2. Intramural Folder. The SD creates an intramural folder for each active sport
      and includes up-to-date schedules, a copy of the bylaws, points of contact, and phone
      numbers for all coaches/assistant coaches, first sergeants, and fitness and sports advisory
      representatives. These folders and their contents must be understood by and available to
      the entire staff at all times to keep customers informed. The SD also creates an after-
      action report at the completion of each program and includes a detailed expense listing
      (i.e., officials and supply items such as chalk, scorebooks, flags, down markers, balls,
      trophies, etc.), final results, improvement areas, and noteworthy achievements. Historical
      information will help determine requirements for the next season.
      2.8.1.3. Sports Bylaws. These local rules supplement the playing rules established by
      the sports National Governing Body (NGB) or any other recognized organization such as
      the National Federation of State High School Associations, the National Collegiate
      Athletic Association, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, or the
      United States Slow Pitch Association. Overseas MAJCOMs may use international rules,
      if appropriate. Bylaws will be developed in coordination with the Fitness and Sports
      Advisory Council (refer to paragraph 2.10 of this AFI) and approved by the FCD. They
      must include rules for postponements, make-up days, protests, composition of the protest
      committee, ejections/disqualifications, uniform requirements, eligibility, safety, awards,
      notification of cancellation times, and other pertinent aspects not covered in the game
      rules. Inform sports coaches of bylaws prior to the beginning of the season.
      2.8.1.4. Preseason. Prior to the beginning of each season, the FCD must ensure the
      following tasks are accomplished:
AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011                                                          19


        2.8.1.4.1. Develop and coordinate officials contracts through the resource advisor
        and the contracting office for funding and award.
        2.8.1.4.2. Develop and coordinate bylaws for the sport with the Fitness and Sports
        Advisory Council in accordance with paragraph 2.10.
        2.8.1.4.3. Publicize the deadline for submitting letters of intent.
        2.8.1.4.4. Develop practice schedules.
        2.8.1.4.5. Conduct rules meetings/training for coaches and officials.
        2.8.1.4.6. Conduct preseason safety inspections of the sports fields.
        2.8.1.4.7. Hold coaches meetings and distribute final schedules.
     2.8.1.5. Letters of Intent. Squadrons must submit letters of intent IAW locally
     established timelines prior to the start of the season. The letter of intent should state the
     name of the unit, the number of teams the unit will field, the number of players on the
     each team(s) and should be signed by the unit’s sports advisory council representative.
     Once letters of intent have been accepted, play format is determined.
     2.8.1.6. Play Format. The number of teams/individuals and available funds determine
     the number of games played. Special participation fees (e.g., golf fees, bowling fees) are
     to be paid by participants. To determine the number of games, use the following
     formulas. N equals the number of individuals or teams entered. Refer to Attachment 6 for
     tournament examples.
        2.8.1.6.1. The round-robin tournament consists of individuals or teams playing each
        entry an equal number of times. Round-robin tournaments are not ideal with a large
        number of entries, unless individuals or teams are broken up into smaller pools for
        round-robin play.
        2.8.1.6.2. In the single round-robin tournament, each team plays one game with
        every other team.
            2.8.1.6.2.1. Single round robin: N x (N - 1) / 2 = number of games
        2.8.1.6.3. In a double round robin, each team plays two games with every other team.
        This type of competition is usually referred to as league competition. Leagues usually
        consist of 8 teams or less, because it is hard to manage team play in larger leagues.
        League play usually extends over a longer period of time than other types of
        competition and the planning and organizing must be done well in advance of the
        starting date for the tournament.
            2.8.1.6.3.1. Double round robin: N x (N - 1) = number of games
        2.8.1.6.4. Implementation of the single-elimination tournament is straightforward.
        Once players have been seeded, they can be entered on the draw sheet.
            2.8.1.6.4.1. Single elimination: (N - 1) = number of games
        2.8.1.6.5. The top level of double elimination tournament is very much the same as
        that of a single elimination tournament, with only the final game slightly different.
            2.8.1.6.5.1. Double elimination: (N x 2) – 1 = number of games
 20                                            AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011


           2.8.1.6.6. Additional information regarding tournament set-up can be found at:
           https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/FT/Tournaments.htm.
       2.8.1.7. Game Schedules. Once the number of games is determined, develop the
       schedule, keeping the following factors in mind:
           2.8.1.7.1. Holidays, wing exercises, down-days, recalls, AEFs, etc.
           2.8.1.7.2. Make-up days. Consider using Friday and/or Saturday as a make-up day.
           2.8.1.7.3. Coordinate with other activity managers when fields are shared.
           2.8.1.7.4. Print and distribute schedule to all coaches and officials.
           2.8.1.7.5. Use of a software program may minimize scheduling challenges.
       2.8.1.8. Tournaments. When resources permit, consider a preseason tournament. This
       gives participants and officials a chance to prepare for the regular season. Include the
       expenses for this tournament in the APF budget. Typical expenses include officials fees
       and awards. Conduct a coaches and officials meeting at the conclusion of the tournament
       to resolve any challenges and to confirm the regular season schedule. When participation
       is limited, consider offering a tournament in lieu of a complete sport season.
2.9. Fitness and Sports Advisory Council. This mandatory council meets at least quarterly
and functions as an advisory body to assist, coordinate, and assemble installation resources to
support comprehensive fitness and sports programs (to include HAWC programs). The
chairperson will be the FCD (a non-voting member). The council should include a primary and
an alternate representative from each unit or tenant of the installation. Bases should consider
implementing a Commander’s Trophy initiative to promote participation in their sports program.
Participation at meetings should be recognized as another way to earn Commander’s Trophy
points. Coordinate the meeting minutes through the commander/director for approval. Provide a
copy of the approved minutes to all council members.
2.10. Sports Equipment. FCDs must ensure appropriate equipment is purchased with APFs
and provided for the following sports: volleyball, basketball, soccer, softball and flag football.
   2.10.1. Jerseys. The FCS provides jerseys or bibs for intramural volleyball, basketball,
   soccer, and flag football. Enough sets should be available to issue clean jerseys to each team.
   Purchase quality jerseys; a recommended type is a mesh tank top, reversible with numbers on
   both sides. Purchase the following minimum number of jerseys/bibs for each set:
   Volleyball=12, Basketball=15, Flag Football=25, Soccer=25.
       2.10.1.1. For bibs, one size usually fits all. For jerseys, each set should include sizes
       ranging from small to XX large. Sign jerseys out to team coaches before the game on a
       hand receipt and collect immediately after each game. Wash the jerseys/bibs immediately
       to extend the life of the material. Strict control must be exercised in order to prevent loss.
   2.10.2. Game Equipment. Consider the following recommendations when determining
   how much equipment to issue for each sport. Issue two softballs per game to the scorer. Issue
   one basketball, two footballs, two volleyballs, two soccer balls, to the game officials. Issue
   twenty-two sets of flags for football. Issue three tennis balls per match to players. Issue two
   shuttlecocks per match to players. Officials will return equipment to the FCS.
AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011                                                             21


2.11. Officials. Head officials must be certified/trained through a recognized and approved
NGB for the particular sport; FCDs will verify certification. In the event contracting for certified
officials is not possible, the FCD is responsible for recruiting and the head official is responsible
for training officials. APFs are authorized for sports officials for Category A and B sports IAW
AFI 65-106. For guidance on developing contracts, refer to the APF Official Contract Training
Aid on the AFSVA website at https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/.
   2.11.1. Officials Fees. Fees vary in different parts of the country, as well as in overseas
   areas. FCDs must survey local associations, to include local off-base leagues, and determine
   an equitable pay scale.
   2.11.2. Other Training and Experience. The commissioner or FCS should evaluate
   officials periodically. Conduct officials meetings as necessary to discuss unusual situations
   and review rules and mechanics. Rules knowledge and mechanics can be taught and applied
   correctly through study, observation and training.
   2.11.3. Composition. The FCD must ensure the minimum numbers of officials are
   available. Encourage volunteers to assist with these programs.
       2.11.3.1. Basketball:     Intramural: 2 referees/1 scorer/timer = 3 total
                                 Varsity:        2 referees/1 scorer/1 timer = 4 total
                                 Extramural: 2 referees/1 scorer/timer = 3 total
       2.11.3.2. Softball: Intramural: 1 umpire/1 scorer = 2 total
                             Varsity:        2 umpires/1 scorer = 3 total
                             Extramural: 1 umpire/1 scorer = 2 total
       2.11.3.3. Volleyball:    Intramural: 1 referee/1 scorer = 2 total
                                 Varsity:        1 referee/1 umpire/1 scorer = 3 total
                                 Extramural:     1 referee/1 scorer = 2 total
       2.11.3.4. Soccer:    Intramural: 1 referee/2 lines persons = 3 total
                            (When league rules call for less than 9 players per team, no lines
                            persons are required.)
                            Varsity:        1 referee/2 lines persons = 3 total
       2.11.3.5. Flag Football: Intramural: 2-3 referees/teams provide downs keeper = 3-4
       total
                                   Varsity: 4 referees/ teams provide downs keeper = 5 total
2.12. Prizes and Incentive Awards. Refer to AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and
Procedures, section 4.29. Awards and Gifts for guidance.
2.13. Extramural Sports. This program is an extension of the intramural program and may be
conducted when demand exists and resources allow. The program is recreational in nature and
has the same administrative, funding, and execution guidelines as intramurals, with the exception
of fees for some sports. Participation may include active duty, reservists, DoD civilians, family
members, base contractors, and local foreign nationals.
 22                                          AFI34-266_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 11 APRIL 2011



2.14. Enhanced Sports Programs. These sports programs provide opportunities for base
athletes to compete off base, with other base, civilian, university and club teams. Financial
guidance is provided in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), AFI 65-106,
Appropriated Fund Support of Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated
Fund Instrumentalities, and DoDI 1015.10, Programs For Military Morale, Welfare And
Recreation (MWR). APFs should be used where authorized. NAFs required to support these
programs must be included in the NAF budget and submitted for approval by the NAF Council
and installation commander, with the exception of Air Force or Armed Forces programs.
   2.14.1. Varsity Sports. Varsity sports programs are optional and based on number of
   adequate participants and availability of resources (see Table 2.3). Varsity sports offer
   skilled active duty athletes an opportunity to compete off base in competitive programs and
   serve as a feeder program into higher-level Air Force competition. Other DoD ID cardholders
   must have installation commander approval to participate.
       2.14.1.1. Varsity Program Support. Support for varsity programs may include
       purchase of uniforms, scheduling games with local teams, and paying entry fees for local
       leagues or tournaments. If competition is located out-of-town, transportation support is
       authorized, entry fees may be paid with NAFs, and a daily personal maintenance
       allowance may be allocated. Funding availability will determine payment of expenses.
       For away games, varsity staff will arrange transportation and lodging, confirm game
       times, process duty releases/permissive TDY orders or permissive leave, process
       entry/game fees, and provide uniforms and applicable playing equipment. Hosting
       requirements for varsity events require careful coordination. Ensure Booster Clubs
       comply with AFI 34-223, Private Organization Program.
   2.14.2. Air Force Marathon. Installations may treat the Air Force Marathon as a varsity
   event. Installation tenant organizations such as MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, with the
   approval of their hosting installation commander, may competitively select active duty
   individuals/teams not selected for installation varsity representation to participate in the
   marathon. These participants can be provided the same permissive TDY and NAF support as
   varsity teams. The installation, MAJCOM, or other organizational commander (or
   equivalent) providing NAF funding determines the amount of such funding to be provided
   for the participants as well as the number of participants supported for each marathon.

       **** - Personal Maintenance Allowance (similar to Per Diem)
 NOTE: NAF’s can be used for transportation, entry fees, miscellaneous, uniforms and
 equipment expenses but the FC must budget for all NAF expenditures. The FCD will go
 through the RMFC to authorize any expenditure of NAF funds to support varsity sports.


2.15. Tournaments. Tournaments (other than intramural/extramural) are a Category B activity.
Fees may be charged to cover the NAF costs of officials, awards, and incidentals. Hosting
requirements of tournaments are extensive and varied and include proper field of play, necessary
supplies and equipment, officials, awards, clearly defined rules of play, and timely posting of
results. After-action reports should be written for historical purposes and include documentation
of unexpected problems and the resultant solution. Ensure financial records are accurate and
accounts are closed with the RMFC. Include the after-action report pertinent data in the
continuity folder.
   2.15.1. MAJCOM/Air          Force     Training        Camps       and     Armed  Forces
   Championships/Tournaments. Guidelines are required for all local, varsity, MAJCOM,
   Air Force, Armed Forces or open invitational tournaments. When hosting MAJCOM, Air
   Force Training Camps, and Armed Forces Championships, there are additional requirements
   such as coordinating, announcing the host site, and funding arrangements.
       2.15.1.1. Coordination. The decision to host major tournaments must be based on a
       commitment from all base agencies whose support is required. Written approval must be
       obtained from the installation commander and include base support requirements. The
       host project officer must conduct a meeting with representatives from base engineers,
       transportation, hospital, security forces, legal, services, public affairs, and protocol and
       any other agencies providing support. Identify exact requirements and ensure everyone
       involved understands the support required.
       2.15.1.2. Selection of Host Site. The scheduling authority for Air Force level events
       (HQ AFSVA) announces the selected host sites approximately six months prior to the
       first event. This gives time for advance planning and coordination for the event.
       2.15.1.3. Funding Arrangements. A budget allocation will be provided to the host base
       outlining the authorized expenditures. Close coordination must be maintained between
       the host project officer, the RMFC, and the MAJCOM or HQ AFSVA project officer.
       Authorized expenditures usually include an icebreaker, officials, lodging,
       equipment/supplies, refreshments, and personal maintenance expense allowance for
       higher levels of competition.
       2.15.1.4. Unforeseen Events. Host staff must be prepared to face unforeseen problems
       with transportation, weather, sick personnel, incorrect orders, recalls and emergency
       leaves.

programs flight chief. The installation commander must approve the OI. There must be a 30‖
high clear partition, e.g., one-half inch thick shatterproof plexi-glass, allowing for direct line-of-
sight supervision, with an entry/exit that can isolate the child play area completely from other
areas. Local policy should be posted in the PCA that address the following: children must be
supervised by their own parents/legal guardians; parents/legal guardians must maintain direct
line-of-sight supervision of their children at all times; the maximum capacity of children and
adults in the PCA; the age limit for the children using the PCA and indicating whether users
must sign in at the reception desk acknowledging PCA policies. It is recommended that adults
bring toys for their children; toys must be of a non-violent nature. If the FC provides toys or
other play objects, they must be sanitized daily with bleach and water solution (1/4 cup liquid
household bleach and 1 gallon of tap water) or other approved sanitation solution IAW with
Child Development Center standards. Allow toys to air dry. Other surfaces cleaned with this
solution should be allowed to air dry or be dried with a paper towel after the solution has been in
contact with the surface for two minutes. If a TV is provided, include guidelines in the OI, e.g.,
only child-appropriate stations will be shown; only G-Rated videos will be played. Provide a
protective shield for the TV to prevent damage from children and flying projectiles. Secure the
remote or channel control from children. When possible provide safety enhancements such as
cipher locks to the PCA to restrict use from unauthorized customers, as determined in the OI.

                   FACILITY MAINTENANCE AND HOUSEKEEPING

5.1. Annual Maintenance Plans. The FCD or appointed FCS members develop an annual
maintenance plan with thorough checklists for each facility. For checklist template, refer to the
Services Agency web site (https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/FT/checklists.htm). The plan prescribes
maintenance requirements for equipment, buildings, and other facilities. The plan is useful for
developing budgets for maintenance requirements. Note: AFSVA Checklists are not all
inclusive; documents provide minimum requirements and they may be altered to meet local
requirements.
5.2. Cleaning and Appearance. High traffic/use areas command more frequent attention and
inspections, especially during peak hours. High traffic/use areas include: restrooms, showers,
saunas, steam rooms, spas, cardiovascular, weight rooms, and locker rooms. FCs will have APF
janitorial support IAW the base contract. The FCD must work with the chain of command to
obtain the highest level of APF custodial support. Refer to the GES for custodial cleaning.
5.3. Exercise Rooms and Court Floors. Exercise rooms are used to conduct a variety of
exercise classes. Keep the exercise area and all equipment clean and ready for use by disinfecting
daily. FCS must pay particular attention to the maintenance of court floors, as they require
special care.
   5.3.1. Refinishing/Resurfacing. Refinishing/resurfacing can be contracted or accomplished
   by BCE. Consider refinishing every 2 years and resurfacing every 6 years based on wear and
   tear.
5.4. Exercise Equipment. The FCS should keep records to indicate which equipment is
covered under a maintenance contract and adhere to the contract terms to maintain warranties.
The FCS should ensure a documented equipment maintenance plan following manufacturer
guidelines is in place for all equipment and adhere to the manufacturer’s proper
recommendations for maximum equipment function and durability. An equipment
recapitalization tool is available on the HQ AFSVA Fitness and Sports web page, https://www-
r.afsv.af.mil/FT/FitnessToolbox.htm. The tool is a standardized fitness tracking and planning
tool used to document equipment requirements. This tool serves as a 5-year equipment
replacement and funding requirements planning document.
   5.4.1. Customer Cleaning. The FCS should encourage customers to clean equipment after
   each use to provide a clean surface for the next user. The FC will provide paper or cloth
   towels and cleaning solutions (as locally determined) to sanitize equipment after use.
   5.4.2. Broken Equipment. When possible, the FCS should remove broken equipment from
   the area. If the equipment cannot be removed, a professionally designed "Out of Order" sign
   should be placed on the machine with sections to indicate the date the equipment was placed
   out of service and the anticipated date it will be back in service. Handwritten signs are
   prohibited except as an immediate interim measure.

6.1. Safety. The combat support flight commander supports the FCD to ensure facilities and
programs meet safety requirements. The FCD coordinates a medical emergency plan with the
director of base medical services (DBMS). Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFI 91-301, The US
Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Prevention, and Health (AFOSH)
Program, for safety standards.
6.2. Emergency Procedures. Address the following areas when developing an emergency
plan:
   6.2.1. Emergency care personnel must have access to all areas of the facility.
   6.2.2. Develop an incident report to document information and ensure FCD follow-up.
   6.2.3. Establish major and minor incidents protocol; consider medical procedures and
   response times.
   6.2.4. Establish bleeding and potential blood-borne pathogens procedures IAW local policy.
   6.2.5. Establish an effective communication system to contact emergency response
   personnel and post signs identifying locations throughout the facility.
   6.2.6. Establish an emergency checklist detailing specific duties of each staff member.
   6.2.7. Practice the emergency plan and document at least quarterly.
6.3. Incident reporting. In addition to notifying relevant local officials or agencies (e.g., the
base commander, Security Forces, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, legal) the
installation Services commander / chief will report to their MAJCOM/A1S, AFSVA/CC and
AF/A1S (within 1 hour if possible) all serious incidents such as the following:
   6.3.1. Any major property damage to Services assets (e.g. fire, natural disaster, etc.).
   6.3.2. Any serious employee or patron injury resulting in death or hospitalization.
   6.3.3. Any sensitive incident such as theft involving Services employees or assets.
6.4. Notification. Initial notification should be provided to HQ AFSVA and AF/A1S as
indicated below. Provide the following information: date, time, location and nature of the
incident, names and status of individuals (active duty, retired, civilian, dependent, etc.), extent of
injuries, and status of incident and expected actions. Provide the name, grade, and phone
numbers where the base Services point of contact may be reached, day or night.

                         voice mail at DSN 332-9300 or 1-800-
                         833-3879. When prompted for 10-digit
                         telephone number, enter 7031053663

                         2. Also send e-mail notification to:
                         incidentreport@pentagon.af.mil

NOTE: * Within 24 hours of the initial telephone notification, fax or e-mail any new

AFSVA/CC (FAX DSN 487-5056) and HQ AFSVA/SVPAF (FAX DSN 487-4739). Continue
fax/e-mail updates at 24-hour intervals as necessary.
6.5. First Aid Kit. The FCS may provide limited medical attention when participants suffer
injuries or illness during FC programs. Coordinate procedures with the DBMS to determine
extent of assistance and proper training. Each fitness facility will maintain APF purchased first
aid kits. Contents will be determined by the DBMS. The FCD will need to coordinate with the
HAWC for procurement and maintenance of AEDs at each fitness facility and/or annex. Funding
for the procurement and maintenance of AEDs is determined locally
6.6. Medical Considerations. Physical contact or collision sports participants must have
clearance from a doctor of medicine or osteopathy prior to participation. The DBMS determines
the medical evaluation.
   6.6.1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Participants in sports and recreational
   programs that may result in physical contact are highly encouraged to use PPE (i.e. mouth
   guards, eye guards, knee ankle braces). These devices help reduce and eliminate injury.
6.7. Customer Protection. FCD will have a monitoring system (cameras or a duress alarm if a
camera is not appropriate) installed in FC areas where staff or contractors do not have direct line
of sight. This also applies to areas where staff/contractor may be alone with a customer. This
does not apply to changing rooms, rest rooms or showers.
6.8. Forms Adopted. Air Force Form 49, Application for MPA Man-day Tour, Air Force Form
303, Request For Specialized Sports Training, Air Force Form 938, Request and Authorization
for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour, AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist and DD Form
1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel. All prescribed forms may be
manually or digitally signed (if available). Note: Once digital signatures are added, the form
―locks‖—no changes can be made to preceding information in the form unless the signature(s)
are removed.
