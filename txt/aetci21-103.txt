                                           Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Objective. The objective of this instruction is to establish aircraft maintenance training
policy and procedures for military aircraft and munitions maintenance organizations.
1.2. Terminology. When using this instruction, the following applies:
   1.2.1. Must – Indicates a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.2. Will – Indicates a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.3. Should – Indicates a preferred or recommended method or option.
   1.2.4. May – Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option.
1.3. Maintenance Training Flight (MTF). Refer to AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training, for
MTF organizational structure and responsibilities.
1.4. Security Assistance Training Program (SATP). International students receive aircraft
and support equipment task, and familiarization training at AETC units. Typically, training
requirement dates and lengths of instruction cannot be easily changed; therefore, accomplish
adequate preparation and course planning prior to the student’s arrival. The following SATP
management responsibilities apply:
   1.4.1. The Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron originates the training request
   and forwards it to HQ AETC/A4MMR for action/training support.
   1.4.2. HQ AETC/A4MMR identifies the specific unit to conduct the training, and
   coordinates with the MTF to determine their capability to support the tasking. Once the MTF
   verifies it can support the tasking, it provides information to the unit about the student, and a
   list of specific requested training requirements.
   1.4.3. Training provided will usually be to the ―B‖ or ―2b‖ level. See the proficiency code
   key at Attachment 2.
   1.4.4. The base international military student officer is responsible for student administration
   and coordination of student activities.
   1.4.5. Since international students may not possess security clearances, take precautions to
   ensure they are not exposed to classified material/equipment.
1.5. Maintenance Orientation Training. The MTF will:
   1.5.1. Schedule all personnel assigned to the MXG to attend an MTF-conducted
   maintenance orientation course within 60 days of arrival in the workcenter.
   1.5.2. Develop the maintenance orientation to consolidate maintenance training requirements
   into one or more consecutive training sessions.
1.6. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS), Contractor Engineering and
Technical Services (CETS), and/or Field Service Representatives (FSR):
   1.6.1. Use AFETS, CETS, and/or FSR personnel to conduct specialized systems/equipment
   training, and integrate them within the MTF instructional effort.
 6                                                            AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


     1.6.2. Coordinate courses developed or taught by AFETS, CETS, and/or FSR personnel
     through the MTF to ensure courses meet curriculum standards.
1.7. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Training Program. Conduct AGE training in
accordance with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. Operation of
powered AGE, by model and type, requires initial qualification training and a practical
evaluation by AGE personnel. Upon assignment to the unit, non-AGE personnel who are
required to operate AGE must receive initial qualification training. Previous qualifications
require a supervisory evaluation during the initial evaluation process. During this evaluation, the
supervisor determines whether the individual is still qualified to operate the required equipment
or if refresher training is needed. Only designated personnel are authorized to conduct initial and
refresher training.
1.8. AFTO Forms 781 Documentation. The MTF will develop and administer an AFTO Form
781 documentation training program for all aircraft maintenance personnel. (AFTO Form 781 is
prescribed by TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.) Include,
as a minimum, maintenance documentation procedures, types of discrepancies constituting
grounding of aircraft, procedures for clearing discrepancies, and in-process inspection
requirements and procedures. Emphasize the importance of individual maintenance, and include
automated forms and their use. Document completion of the training in the maintenance
information system (MIS).
1.9. Civilian/Contractor Training. Procedures to procure training for civil service employees
and contractor personnel are outlined in the Education and Training Course Advisory (ETCA)
located at https:// etca.randolph.af.mil.
1.10. Major Command (MAJCOM) Mandatory Course Listing (MMCL). Each MAJCOM
has determined mandatory courses for each mission design series (MDS) by establishing the
MMCLs. The purpose of the MMCLs is to ensure that all military personnel assigned to a
specific MDS receive the same training and have the same training requirements throughout the
Air Force. AETC units will comply with the lead command MDS MMCL for each assigned
aircraft. Exception: 314 MXG personnel do not have to complete AMC required Maintenance
Qualification Training Program (MQTP) courses. If no lead command MMCL has been

production software for hands-on training use. Access to the UPE will be granted to unit POCs
upon request to the MAJCOM POC.
3.5. Role Assignments: Actions in TBA are accomplished through various user ―roles‖, to
include trainee, trainer, supervisor, etc. Various ―power roles‖ are assigned to selected
individuals in each organization to manage the system. Refer to AFI 36-2232 and the TBA users
guide for additional information about roles and their capabilities. AETC/A4MMR will
periodically make available to field units a Gunter developed role report. MTFs will use this
report to monitor and manage role assignments. Elevated role assignments have a higher level of
impact on managing the unit training program and consist of Unit Training Manager, Analyst,
Personnel Manager, and Role Manager. Designation of elevated roles is limited. Exceptions to
the following limitations must be approved in writing by the MTF and maintained in file. Note:
UTMs may be authorized all available roles in TBA as they must train each type of user in their

   employee as part of that employee’s duty position. Active tasks have been trained, certified,
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   15


   and signed off in TBA with dates and supervisor/employee/trainee initials and are expected
   to be performed by an individual.
   3.6.2. Archived tasks in TBA are considered inactive and individuals are not qualified or
   authorized to perform those listed tasks when in archive status. Archived tasks are those
   tasks an individual was formerly qualified to perform but is no longer signed off and not
   authorized to perform until a qualified supervisor or trainer either trains the individual or
   ascertains that the individual is qualified to perform the task, and then the task must be
   signed off and placed into ―active‖ status.
3.7. Problem resolution: Users follow their TBA chain of command to resolve problems and
receive assistance. Users contact their MTF for assistance and MTFs elevate problems as
required. MTFs refer software related problems to the Field Assistance Service (FAS) team,
DSN 596-5771 option 1 then 4 and 2 or by email at 754.dom.team4@Gunter.af.mil. MTFs
contact the MAJCOM POC for assistance with policy and procedure matters.
3.8. Records Lock Out Procedures: In the event of a Class A mishap incident, the MXG/CC
will determine if TBA training records require lock out. When directed by the MXG/CC, the
MTF will contact the Field Assistance Service (FAS) at DSN 596-5771 to open a remedy ticket
and request users be locked from accessing TBA due to Class A mishap. Identify either specific
user employee numbers (records) or a specific TBA organization (which will cause a lock out of
all employees in that organization) and the date of the incident. The MTF will also notify HQ
AETC/A4MMR of the requested action on the first duty day following the request to the FAS.
The FAS will open a ticket and forward the request to level II (TBA Program Office). Level II
will lock out all requested employee records. Any user whose account has been locked by the
TBA program office will receive a "locked" notice if they attempt to access TBA. The records
will remain locked until the MXG/CC directs otherwise, at which point the MTF will notify the
FAS to unlock the records and close the ticket.

                    INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (ISD)

4.1. Application of the ISD Process:
   4.1.1. Apply the ISD process to all maintenance training programs. The governing
   publication for ISD is AFI 36-2201. Additional information on ISD development can be
   found in AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development, and AFH 36-2235, Volume
   11, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems—Application to Unit Training.
   4.1.2. Use the ISD process to plan, develop, and manage instructional programs. Before
   instruction begins, identify task statements and develop learning objectives and tests to
   support them. Identify the instructional methods to be used along with the required supplies
   and resources. Evaluations provide valuable information and are established to determine
   course validity and the student's attainment of the learning objectives. Feedback from both
   internal and external sources provides a continual source of data upon which course revision
   decisions can be made.
   4.1.3. Use an ISD project plan (or facsimile) during initial development or revision (20
   percent or more of the objectives change, or a change of 8 hours or more is required) for all
   structured maintenance training courses that provide task qualification or certification.
   Maintain the completed plan for historical purposes with the respective CCDs. Retain only
   the initial and most current ISD project plan on file.
4.2. ISD Project Management. Manage the status of ISD projects through the various stages
of production and coordination. Monitor this information through the use of wall charts,
automated products, general purpose forms, etc. Regardless of the method used, keep the
program status current at all times, and include the information identified below, as a minimum:
   4.2.1. Course number.
   4.2.2. Course title.
   4.2.3. Start date.
   4.2.4. Required completion date.
   4.2.5. Project SME or office of primary responsibility (OPR).
   4.2.6. ISD phase (development only).
   4.2.7. OPR office symbol.
   4.2.8. Status.
4.3. File Plan. Establish a file plan in accordance with AFI 33-322, Records Management
Program, and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records. As a minimum, keep the following
items current, and maintain (paper-based or electronic) in the development element:
   4.3.1. Master CCD inventory log.
   4.3.2. Master sets of CCDs.
   4.3.3. Master visual information inventory log.

requirements for a specific course of instruction.
   4.4.1. Structured formal maintenance training provided by the MTF will have CCDs, for
   example, egress, engine trim, weapons load training, borescope, etc., or when directed by
   publications, higher headquarters, MXG/CC, or when recommended by the Curriculum
   Advisory Committee (CAC), and approved by the MXG/CC.
   4.4.2. Identify CCDs by course number, course title, and date (Attachment 4). Contents will
   include, as a minimum:

   CCAF (if applicable) for evaluation purposes. Pen and ink changes are allowed to all pages
   of the CCDs or POI, as applicable, as long as the instructional content is not changed. If the
   cover memorandum’s signature page course content is changed, send the CCDs or POI
   through the appropriate approval process at the time of the change. The development section
   will publish pen and ink page changes to the course documents, and provide necessary
   changed page copies to the instructor for updating personalized copies. The development
   element will update the master copy of the CCDs or POI as applicable. Up to 5% of total
   course time may be changed without rerouting CCDs for re-approval.
   4.4.4. Maintain data for each audiovisual training program and include, as a minimum:
      4.4.4.1. Script (if available).

       number of students, attitude of students, comments noted from student critiques,
       assessments, or questionnaires, and QA evaluation results (as applicable).
   4.5.2. Do not begin the coordination process until all required information and
   documentation are received to prevent review process duplication.
   4.5.3. Forward completed class packages to the MTF commander or chief for review and
   coordination, and dispose of them after the 24-month review is accomplished. Note: Report
   CCAF applicable class packages to CCAF prior to disposal. Maintain non-CCAF-accredited
   courses according to the Air Force RDS. Maintain course graduate data for CCAF accredited
   courses as directed by CCAF Campus Affiliations Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines
   (PPG), paragraph 17, located at http:// www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf.
4.6. Course Catalog:
   4.6.1. MTFs will develop and maintain a current catalog that shows available courses, course
   numbers, course durations, a brief synopsis of each course, and course prerequisites. The
   catalog will be of local design and include, as a minimum, a listing of:
       4.6.1.1. AFETS, CETS , and FSR-conducted courses (if applicable).
       4.6.1.2. MTF courses offered.
       4.6.1.3. ICW and CBT programs.

       available).
   4.6.2. Catalog distribution (display electronically on the local intranet in lieu of distributing
   hard copies if desired). If not in an electronic format, provide a copy to each commander,
   UTM, and workcenter. Provide an electronic or paper copy to HQ AETC/A4MMR at least
   every 24 months.
4.7. Curriculum Advisory Committee. The MTF CAC will:
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     19


   4.7.1. Consist of the development element (chairperson), MTF commander or chief
   (optional), UTM (as required), SMEs, TD (as required), and all applicable workcenter
   supervisors and superintendents.
   4.7.2. Convene when a requirement to develop a new course is identified. Note: Units must
   identify their requirements (in writing) to the MTF commander or chief.
   4.7.3. Use the ISD process to determine if a training need exists.
   4.7.4. Identify training constraints and possible workarounds.
   4.7.5. Discuss possible alternatives to satisfy the training request.
   4.7.6. Determine the most cost-effective and efficient methods to conduct training.
   4.7.7. Identify tasks that may be certified (Go-level) during training.
   4.7.8. Recommend to the MTF commander or chief the training agency that is in the best
   position to conduct requested training.

   4.7.10. Publish minutes and coordinate inputs and/or recommendations with appropriate
   organizations.
   4.7.11. Forward written minutes and recommendations to the MTF commander or chief for
   approval or disapproval.
   4.7.12. File all documented results in the development element in accordance with the Air
   Force RDS.
4.8. Course Chart/Training Standard. The CC/TS is an official CCD that defines the training
specifications for a particular course. It prescribes qualitative requirements in terms of tasks,
knowledge, and proficiency levels. The signature page identifies the course training number,
MIS course code, date, course title, purpose, course description, qualitative requirements,
attachment tables, and recommendations. Entries on Table I of the CC/TS consist of course
number, OPR, security classification, course length, effective date, instructor to student ratio,
student prerequisites, and a summary of course content that is broken down by time blocks or
units. This data correlates with the applicable POI. Entries on Table II consist of course number,
required equipment, administrative, operational, and facility support, and summary of changes.
Use the CC/TS as the basis for the development of the POI. As a minimum, the CC/TS will
contain the following:
   4.8.1. Cover memorandum/approval page. Prepare the cover memorandum/approval page.
   4.8.2. Proficiency code key. Use the standard proficiency code key and overprint on the
   reverse side of the approval page (Attachment 2).
   4.8.3. Table I. (Attachment 7).
   4.8.4. Table II. The format for Table II is determined by the type and amount of equipment,
   administrative, operational and facilities support detail needed to obtain/schedule course
   support (see format at Attachment 8). The development element establishes the format and
   content of the course support resources list.
 20                                                         AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


4.9. Plan of Instruction. Use POIs to manage and conduct training programs, and to convert
task and knowledge statements identified in the CC/TS into behavioral objectives. Each unit of
instruction will have criterion objectives that include a condition, behavior and standard
statement, teaching steps, CC/TS references, student measurement, duration, support materials,
and other guidance factors as applicable.
   4.9.1. Course Orientation Units. POIs must have a course orientation unit (unmeasured)
   that is limited to a maximum of one hour. If necessary, provide student handouts to
   supplement orientation and introductory material.
       4.9.1.1. As a minimum, the course orientation will cover course overview, completion
       criteria, student critique and assessment program, and benefits/credits awarded by the
       CCAF (if applicable).
       4.9.1.2. Include the following subjects in the course, if applicable: conservation of
       energy; environmental awareness; Privacy Act; MIS; fraud, waste, and abuse; security;
       and forms documentation.
   4.9.2. Instructional Units. Except for the orientation and graduation units, instructional
   units will contain one or more objectives, supporting teaching steps, and instructional
   guidance.
   4.9.3. Other Requirements. Integrate job-oriented safety, occupational health,
   environmental issues, forms documentation, MIS inputs, the Air Force technical data system,
   and other publications applicable to the Air Force specialty throughout the course.
   4.9.4. Instructional Times. Actual instructional times may vary due to difference in class
   size or student ability.
   4.9.5. Printing POI. Print POI pages on one side only.
   4.9.6. POI Content. The standard POI contains the following pages:
       4.9.6.1. Cover Page. The cover page may be of local design with unit aircraft or emblem
       (Attachment 9).
       4.9.6.2. Page A (Attachment 10).
       4.9.6.3. Page I signed by MXG/CC (Attachment 11).
       4.9.6.4. Orientation and introduction (Attachment 12 through Attachment 15).
   4.9.7. POI Continuation Sheets. Center the heading COURSE CONTENT
   (CONTINUED) at the top of the page, and type the POI course number, block, unit, date, and
   page number at the bottom of the page.
   4.9.8. Criterion Objectives. Each unit of instruction should cover one or more criterion
   objectives. Begin each criterion objective statement on a separate POI continuation sheet.
   Each objective within a unit of instruction begins at the top of a continuation sheet followed
   by its teaching steps and instructional guidance.
   4.9.9. Outlining POIs. When outlining POIs, apply general outlining rules. For example, if
   using a "1," you must use a "2"; if using an "a," you must use a "b," and so forth. When
   numbering multiple blocks of instruction, each unit of a new block of instruction will start
   with the number 1. For example, Block 1, Units 1 through 5, Block 2, Units 1 through 3, etc.
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       21


   4.9.10. Time. Enter the time that corresponds to the hours shown in Table I of the CC/TS.
   Enter the time to the right of each objective if the unit of instruction contains more than one
   objective.
   4.9.11. Teaching Steps. These are steps of learning, presented in statements of subject
   matter content or in behavioral (action) terms, that lead to the attainment of a criterion
   objective. Each teaching step should be directly related to and support the objective.
   4.9.12. Instructional Guidance. Instructional guidance is required for each criterion
   objective and provides standardized guidance to instructors on how to develop the lesson. Do
   not introduce new material that should be included as teaching steps or repeat teaching steps
   unless further explanation is required. Include the following instructional guidance in the
   course orientation for all courses that contain progress checks (PC) for task performance
   objectives:
       4.9.12.1. Inform the students that instructors will assess accomplishment of each course
       objective through the use of a progress checklist.
       4.9.12.2. The instructor is the evaluator and does not become involved in student
       performance unless, in the instructor's judgment, an assist should be given to prevent any
       violation of technical data or action that could result in personal injury, damage to
       equipment, or render the equipment unreliable.
       4.9.12.3. An instructor assist will also be accorded when the student is unable to proceed
       toward the accomplishment of the objective due to lack of knowledge.
       4.9.12.4. Inform the students they are being evaluated, and how many instructor assists
       will be allowed before each PC.
   4.9.13. Special Instructions. Include any needed special instructions; for example, use of
   audiovisual aids, specific use of equipment, use of host technician assistance, safety
   precautions, occupational health hazards, environmental awareness, foreign object damage
   prevention, and administration of egress checks, etc. When students use egress-equipped
   aircraft or cockpit-configured trainers to perform course objectives, include the following
   statement: "The instructor will demonstrate egress safety inspection procedures during the
   first course objective that requires cockpit entry. The instructor will observe the student
   performing egress safety inspections on each additional objective requiring cockpit entry."
   4.9.14. Course Critique and Graduation Page. Entries shown in Attachment 16 reflect
   the items that are normally covered in all courses.
4.10. Course Validation Process. Validate new or existing MTF courses that require major
revisions (a change in 20 percent or more of the criterion objectives) prior to approval. Course
validation is a process by which curriculum materials, instructional procedures, training media,
and training materials are reviewed for instructional accuracy, adequacy, suitability for
presentation, and training effectiveness. Validation is a process that assesses the effectiveness of
a course as it is developed and is a quality improvement tool that helps identify problems during
development so revisions can be made. Accomplish validation while developing segments, units,
or blocks of instruction.
 22                                                           AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


   4.10.1. Develop a plan prior to the start of the course validation process. This plan provides
   curriculum developers and instructors with a roadmap for validating the course. Include the
   following:
       4.10.1.1. Description of the course to be validated (objectives, method, and media).
       4.10.1.2. Individuals used to validate the course.
       4.10.1.3. Validation procedures.
       4.10.1.4. Validation schedule.
       4.10.1.5. Number of tryouts conducted.
       4.10.1.6. Number of students used in small group tryouts.
       4.10.1.7. Sources of how results are documented.
       4.10.1.8. How problems are resolved.
       4.10.1.9. Revision schedule.
   4.10.2. Prior to the course validation process, develop a tentative POI and have the
   development element review it before the start date of the first validation class.
   4.10.3. Avoid training deficiencies, and ensure training conducted during validation satisfies
   all course proficiency codes or behavioral statements listed in the training standard.
   4.10.4. As a minimum, conduct two small group tryouts (selected students) during course
   validation to determine whether the instruction is appropriate and effective for the targeted
   student population. Award course credit to students upon completion of the small group
   tryout. Note: If problems arise during small group tryouts, convene a working group to
   resolve.
   4.10.5. Conduct one operational tryout on the target population. Award course credit to
   students upon completion of operational tryout.
   4.10.6. After validation has been completed and revisions accomplished, coordinate the POI
   with appropriate agencies prior to final MXG/CC approval.
   4.10.7. Maintain validation documentation with the master CCD.
4.11. Dating of CCDs. Normally, the CC/TS and POI have the same date. If changes are made
to the POI that do not affect the CC/TS, only the POI needs to reflect the most current date (dates
on the CC/TS will not change). Initially, to ensure that the POI, CC/TS, and AF IMT 1768 have
the same dates, do not date the course control documents until they are completely
coordinated, and submitted to the MXG/CC for approval.
4.12. Numbering System for CCDs. Use a standardized numbering system for all local CCDs
(Attachment 4).
4.13. Review and Approval of CCDs:
   4.13.1. All CCDs are subject to a 24-month review with the exception of deactivated
   courses. This 24-month cycle may not apply if the interval for certain courses is prescribed
   by other instructions. (For example, AFI 21-101 requires explosive safety CCDs be
   coordinated through wing weapons safety office annually.)
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  23


   4.13.2. The NCOIC, Development Element, will establish a suspense file to ensure CCDs
   are reviewed on time.
   4.13.3. Use the AF IMT 1768 (Attachment 6) to coordinate both initial and periodic CCD
   reviews. An automated system may be used for coordination. Maintain printed copies of
   automated coordination.
   4.13.4. Completed AF IMTs 1768 are a permanent part of the master CCD files.
   4.13.5. The MTF commander or chief signs the AF IMT 1768. As a minimum, coordinate
   with the following individuals or offices:
       4.13.5.1. SMEs.
       4.13.5.2. QA and MXG/CC, as applicable, for structured maintenance training courses
       that provide task qualification or certification.
       4.13.5.3. Development element.
       4.13.5.4. Wing safety, as applicable.
   4.13.6. Once coordination is complete and the CCDs or POI is approved, file the AF IMT
   1768 in the master CCDs or POI. Update the course documents in the master CCDs or POI
   maintained in the development section. The development section will forward applicable
   course document changes to the instructors. Note: CCAF-affiliated MTFs will forward one
   copy of the master CCD for degree or certification evaluation in accordance with AFI 36-
   2304, Community College of the Air Force.
   4.13.7. If the MXG/CC changes after the course documents have been approved, signature
   pages for the "CC/TS and Foreword" remain valid until the next course revision.
   4.13.8. Coordinate new or revised TD CC/TSs on AF IMT 1768 with workcenters and other
   agencies to ensure course content and accuracy.
   4.13.9. The NCOIC, Development Element, will provide each instructor with the approved
   CC/TSs and POIs for the courses he or she will teach, and ensure the instructor copies are
   current and match the master file set maintained in the development section. Except for
   instructor personalization of the teaching guide (lesson plan part two), no other written
   entries are authorized.
4.14. Test Development. The primary purpose of testing is to assess the student’s attainment of
the behavior specified in the objectives. To ensure tests adequately measure the objective, the
performance required in the test must match the performance required in the objective. Test
development should occur immediately after objectives have been written. For additional
guidance on test development, see AFMAN 36-2234.
   4.14.1. Course developers must consider several characteristics (validity, reliability, and
   usability) when developing tests, and ensure tests measure exactly what they are designed to
   measure every time.
   4.14.2. Test items selected should be clear, concise, and well written to minimize
   misunderstanding. Within AETC aircraft maintenance training, multiple-choice tests are the
   most commonly used type of written test. Use matching, short-answer essay, fill-in-the-
   blank, and true and false questions sparingly.
 24                                                            AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


   4.14.3. Avoid duplicate test items if possible. If circumstances limit the variety of test items
   supporting an objective, reword items, resequence answers, or scramble items on the
   alternate version to deter test compromise.
   4.14.4. Test booklets may be of local design and, as a minimum, will include:
       4.14.4.1. Cover page.
       4.14.4.2. Instruction page.
       4.14.4.3. Control number.
       4.14.4.4. Date.
       4.14.4.5. Test compromise statement.
   4.14.5. Sequentially numbered test booklets. One copy, labeled, as the "MASTER" will
   identify the references used to develop each test question. Also, develop a "MASTER"
   answer key. Note: Structure engine run tests so emergency procedure questions are readily
   identifiable. For example, Part I emergency procedures; Part II - normal engine run
   procedures.
4.15. Test Analysis. Analyze all test items to determine if there are any potential problems or
trends.
   4.15.1. To determine the validity and reliability of written test questions, accomplish an
   ongoing analysis using locally devised manual methods or an automated testing program.
   4.15.2. Analyze both primary (A) and alternate tests (B) to ensure validity and reliability of
   tests. Accomplish this by rotating the test used for each class.
   4.15.3. Maintain the completed test analysis worksheet or automated testing program on file.
4.16. Management of Unclassified Testing Materials. Control test materials at all times to
prevent compromise. Use written or automated tests to evaluate an individual's knowledge and
understanding of information contained in applicable technical data or management directives.
Administer open or closed book; however, closed book is mandated for all courses requiring
certification, for example, engine run. Unit procedures are as follows:
   4.16.1. Store testing materials used for testing in a locked cabinet, and identify them on the
   master test control log.
   4.16.2. Inventory tests quarterly using either the master test control log or a locally
   developed inventory sheet.
   4.16.3. Control tests through a sign-in and sign-out log.
   4.16.4. Review test materials with the respective CCD during the periodic review required
   by AFI 36-2232, or when changes to course objectives warrant a review. Document this
   review on the same AF IMT 1768 used for the periodic CCD review. Identify the test(s)
   separately on the AF IMT 1768.
   4.16.5. If a test compromise is suspected, refer to procedures outlined in Attachment 17.
4.17. Student Training Materials. Student training materials will:
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      25


   4.17.1. Have the following statement placed on the bottom of the cover page of each
   publication in bold lettering: ―FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE ON
   THE JOB.‖ This includes training materials as handouts, programmed texts, and study
   guides.
   4.17.2. Display the course identification number plus one of the following codes:
       4.17.2.1. Handout (HO).
       4.17.2.2. Programmed text (PT).
       4.17.2.3. Study guide (SG).
       4.17.2.4. Workbook (WB).
   4.17.3. Use cover sheets which may be of local design.
   4.17.4. Not contain technical data or serve as a replacement for it. Appropriately mark and
   control classified materials, if used.
   4.17.5. Be referenced in the applicable POI.
4.18. Student Measurement. Student measurement in AETC maintenance training is a
systematic process used to determine whether a student can perform the behaviors specified in an
objective. Use measurement devices such as performance evaluations, written tests, and oral
questions to evaluate student achievement of course objectives. Additionally, use tests to
evaluate an individual's knowledge of procedures contained in applicable technical data or
management directives as applicable. Note: Student measurements (standards) are not required
in behavioral statement for familiarization or orientation criterion objectives.
   4.18.1. The student measurement process will:
       4.18.1.1. Ensure students are measured on course objective before graduation.
       4.18.1.2. Identify students who need special individual assistance or additional training.
       4.18.1.3. Inform students of their progress in the course, stimulate effective learning, and
       reinforce knowledge and skills.
   4.18.2. Certain courses have student measurement requirements. The following courses have
   written tests and, when required, a performance evaluation (or both, in some instances):
       4.18.2.1. Certification courses.
       4.18.2.2. AETC formal courses.
       4.18.2.3. Objectives that require the student to perform a task.
   4.18.3. Subject knowledge evaluations may be written or oral. Note: If oral evaluations are
   used, the instructor must develop a list of questions to ensure standardization for each class.
       4.18.3.1. The number of test questions required is generally determined by the
       complexity and criticality of the subject matter being taught. The test must be
       comprehensive in nature and sample all course objectives. For additional test
       development information refer to AFH 36-2235, Volume 9, Information for Designers or
       Instructional Systems—Application to Technical Training, or AFH 36-2235, Volume 12,
       Information for Designers of Instructional Systems—Test and Measurement Handbook.
 26                                                          AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


      4.18.3.2. Written tests are based on a pass or fail system with 70 percent as the minimum
      passing score. This standard does not apply to other training programs that have different
      requirements already established.
   4.18.4. Students failing a written test must wait at least 24 hours before retesting. Readdress
   students’ weak areas prior to retesting, and provide an alternate test.
   4.18.5. Provide remedial instruction to students failing a behavioral objective, and reevaluate
   on the failed behavioral objective.
   4.18.6. Use task and performance evaluations for criterion objectives that require students to
   perform tasks.
   4.18.7. A criterion objective checklist may be developed and used for task and performance
   evaluations. However, do not use this checklist in lieu of technical data, and measure all
   evaluations using applicable technical reference.
   4.18.8. Base task and performance evaluations on the Go/No-Go system with a 100 percent
   pass rate.
   4.18.9. Students who fail the task and performance evaluation will receive remedial on-the-
   job training and be reevaluated on the failed task. If the student repeatedly fails the
   performance evaluation, the instructor will document the student’s training record showing
   noncertification of that task.
   4.18.10. Refer to AFH 36-2235, Volumes 9 and 12, and AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for
   Air Force Instructors, for further guidance on test development.
4.19. Technical Data for Training:
   4.19.1. Technical data such as technical orders (TO), job guides, inspection workcards, and
   checklists will serve as the primary instructional material when conducting training on
   maintenance or operational aircraft systems and equipment.
   4.19.2. Students will use published technical data when operating or performing
   maintenance on aircraft systems, subsystems, or AGE.
   4.19.3. Supplemental literature may be developed when technical data is unavailable or
   insufficient. Course SMEs will approve this material.
4.20. Course Critiques:
   4.20.1. Course critiques look at the training system from within to determine system
   effectiveness and quality. They are required for all maintenance training programs. Note:
   Critiques of block training and maintenance orientation are optional as determined by the
   MTF. Critiques may be completed individually or as a group. However, individual critiques
   and assessments are highly recommended. Use AETC Form 19, Maintenance Training
   Course Critique. Locally devised critiques are permitted provided they include all items on
   the AETC Form 19 and are approved by the MTF commander or chief. Dispose of course
   critiques and assessments after the periodic course review.
      4.20.1.1. File MTF course critiques and assessments with the appropriate class package.
   4.20.2. The instructor or course administrator will answer negative comments and comments
   recommending improvement. The MTF commander or chief will review and endorse.
AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    27


4.21. Field Questionnaires. Use field questionnaires, if determined necessary, to gather and
analyze data from outside the training environment in order to determine how well recent
graduates are meeting job performance requirements.
4.22. Visual Information (VI) Media (Production and Documentation). Training programs
using videotapes, CBT, and ICW as the primary instructional media are very effective in
satisfying course objectives. The Joint Visual Information Services Distribution Activity
(JVISDA) distributes DOD, Air Force, and MAJCOM videotapes through online ordering on the
Defense     Automated      Visual    Information      Service  (DAVIS)    Web      site   at
http://dodimagery.afis.osd.mil/. For assistance, call DSN 795-7937, or commercial (717) 895-
7937. Use the following information to manage this medium:
   4.22.1. Visual Media Production:
       4.22.1.1. Coordinate video production requests through the base VI manager.
       4.22.1.2. Maintain a copy of the visual production requests according to the AF RDS.
       4.22.1.3. Maintain approval and disapproval documents according to the AF RDS.
   4.22.2. Subject Matter Expert Certification. SMEs will certify all visual programs on an
   AETC Form 17 to ensure they are technically correct prior to use.
   4.22.3. Visual Program Review:
       4.22.3.1. SMEs or a QA representative will review visual programs that support CCDs
       during the 24-month course review. Document the review (can be accomplished on the
       same staff summary sheet used during the CCD 24-month review; however, units may
       use a general purpose form or automated system).
       4.22.3.2. The NCOIC, Development Element, will establish a suspense system to ensure
       visual programs are reviewed on time.
       4.22.3.3. ICW does not require a 24-month review.
   4.22.4. Visual Program and Equipment Control:
       4.22.4.1. If visual programs are not used for a period of 6 months or more, notify all
       users and flight line maintenance agencies that the program may be removed from the
       MTF inventory if not used.
       4.22.4.2. If visual or ICW programs are not used for a period of 12 months or more,
       inform the MTF commander or chief to permanently remove the program from the MTF
       inventory.
       4.22.4.3. Use AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, to sign out visual equipment.
       4.22.4.4. Establish a preventive maintenance inspection program for all visual equipment
       assigned to the MTF.
4.23. Lesson Plans (LP) Personalization. LPs are approved plans for instruction that provide
specific definition and direction to the instructor on the learning objectives, equipment,
instructional media material requirements, and conduct of training.
   4.23.1. Instructors will maintain a current approved LP for each course they are qualified to
   teach.
28                                                         AETCI21-103 5 OCTOBER 2012


  4.23.2. The NCOIC, application element, will approve LPs and annotate the instructor’s
  copy of the course cover sheet.
  4.23.3. LP approval is required prior to initial use or when a course is revised, and/or in
  conjunction with the periodic review required by AFI 36-2232.
  4.23.4. The LP consists of an introduction, body, and conclusion for each topic, task
  knowledge, and subject knowledge statement (Attachment 18-Attachment 20). Incorporate
  the orientation into the course’s first introduction section. The introduction includes the
  attention, motivation, overview, and transition steps.
     4.23.4.1. Use the attention step to gain students’ attention alerting them that the
     instructor is ready to begin the lesson.
     4.23.4.2. Use the motivation step to gain students’ interest in the training, which may be
     combined with the attention step. The instructor should explain why it is important for
     the students to learn the information presented during the training session.
     4.23.4.3. The overview step provides an explanation of what to expect during the lesson
     and normally includes an explanation of the objectives and the major teaching steps. The
     overview provides a roadmap to help the student follow the lesson.
     4.23.4.4. The transition step allows the instructor to move from the introduction to the
     body of the instruction, and it is used to focus the students’ attention on the first major
     teaching step.
  4.23.5. The body identifies the objective, teaching steps, and substeps. Use interim
  summaries for longer blocks and units of instruction, as needed.
  4.23.6. A summary of the information is presented after the last teaching step of each
  objective. The conclusion should contain summary, remotivation, and closure steps.
     4.23.6.1. Use the summary to remind the student of the objective and the major teaching
     steps of the lesson. This step allows the student to review the information learned and
     clear up any misconceptions. The summary should reemphasize safety and the use of
     TOs, if applicable, to reiterate the importance of understanding material presented, and
     summarize key points. Include any other items deemed appropriate by the instructor. It
     should not introduce new material.
     4.23.6.2. The remotivation step allows the instructor to remind the student the
     importance of remembering what was taught and how the information applies to the
     student.
     4.23.6.3. The closure statement lets the student know the lesson is over.
