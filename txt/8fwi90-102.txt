                         DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES

A4.1. The Chief, Command and Control Division (8 FW/CP) will:
   A4.1.1. Manage implementation of TBMCS and associated data on the SIPRNET K: Drive.
   A4.1.2. Ensure that data developed on NIPRNET for the daily Wing Standup meeting is
   available on SIPRNET. Data (primarily in the form of PowerPoint slides) will be moved
   weekly from NIPRNET to SIPRNET by 8 FW/CP personnel. Data will be saved to
   K:\ICC\Sit_Brief\Wing_Standup_Transfer, where it will be available to ICC personnel as a
   reference.
A4.2. SIPRNET K: Drive folder management.
   A4.2.1. Chief, 8 FW/CP will manage folders on the SIPRNET K: Drive to ensure data is
   organized in a logical manner and accessible by all ICC and UCC members.
   A4.2.2. Users will not add any subfolders to the root directory, K:\, of the SIPRNET K:
   Drive, or to the ICC folder, K:\ICC. Users can add subfolders within their own unit folder.
   EXAMPLE: a TBMCS-UL user in the 8 CES UCC could create K:\8MSG\8msg-
   ces\new_folder. Contact the Chief, 8 FW/CP to add folders to K:\ or K:\ICC if necessary.
   A4.2.3. The Library folder, K:\Library, is intended to hold reference material of use to the
   entire ICC as well as each UCC. Reference material should be files that do not change often.
   Working files that change frequently should be housed in other folders, such as K:\ICC.
   A4.2.4. Old files that may be useful references but are no longer currently in use should be
   placed in a subordinate archive folder. EXAMPLE: Files no longer needed in
   K:\ICC\Sit_Rep should me moved to K:\ICC\Sit_Rep\archive if they have value as
   references, or deleted otherwise.
   A4.2.5. Do not create multiple copies of working files in multiple folders. Multiple working
   files will create confusion as to which file is current. Have one working copy, and create
   backup copies as needed in a separate folder (such as an archive).
A4.3. TBMCS link and data management.
   A4.3.1. Each squadron must have its own links and tables in the RMA because data on
   personnel and equipment is input at the squadron level and aggregated at group and wing
   level. Other units that are not squadrons (wing staff, group staff, PATRIOT battery, etc.) can
   have the same links as a squadron if desired by the unit’s group commander or the wing
   commander.
      A4.3.1.1. Standard links for each squadron are: EVENT LOG, FACILITIES,
      PERSONNEL, RECALL, VEHICLES, and CHECKLIST. These links refer to pages that
      are built into the RMA.
      A4.3.1.2. Other pages, links to files on the K: Drive, etc. can be developed to meet the
      needs of each unit. Contact Chief, 8 FW/CP for assistance.
   A4.3.2. Each unit must maintain the data appearing on its pages.

     A4.3.2.1. The VEHICLES page must include all USAF government motor vehicles in
     the unit, except those with an X in their registration numbers. Vehicles with an X in the
     registration number are maintained by the owning unit, rather than 8 LRS, and should not
     be reported.
     A4.3.2.2. The FACILITIES checklist must include every facility where that unit is
     required to do PAR sweeps.
  A4.3.3. Links shown on the left side of the TBMCS-UL page will mirror major elements of
  the folder structure of the K: Drive. There will be links for groups, squadrons, the library,
  the ICC, and other directories as determined by Chief, 8 FW/CP.
