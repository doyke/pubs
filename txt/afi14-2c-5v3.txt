This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and is consistent with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence
Training, AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 14-
202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This publication establishes the minimum Air Force
standards for training personnel performing intelligence duties in C-5 units. This publication
applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) intelligence
personnel supporting C-5 operations. The National Guard Bureau will be considered
functionally as a major command (MAJCOM) for the purposes of this publication. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force Records
Information Management System. This AFI may be supplemented, but all supplements must be
coordinated with the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) prior to certification and approval.
Refer recommended changes to the OPR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication. Route AF Forms 847 through the appropriate functional chain of command. The
authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a tier (“T-
0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications
and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the tier numbers.
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate tier waiver
approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change adds risk factors, known as “tiers” to tasks assigned to organizations below
major command (MAJCOM) level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. It also deletes
references to Statement of Intelligence Interest (SII) as the term is outdated and re no longer a
requirement. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

       areas, etc.); and corrective actions taken. See Attachment 5 for an EIT Report example.
       (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT will be coordinated with the wing or group Tactics
Flight or Officer. Integrate intelligence training of threats and adversary tactics and techniques
with aircrew C-5 tactics and countertactics training. The AIT program will cover, at a minimum,
these topics on an annual basis: (T-2)
   3.3.1. Threat Knowledge.
       3.3.1.1. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
       involvement. Include examples of weapons employment tactics (e.g., enemy use of
       barrage fire, 4-ship flight formations, etc.).
       3.3.1.2. Provide inputs to the lead MAJCOM-developed master question file (MQF).
       3.3.1.3. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide is the primary reference for threat knowledge
       training and ensure training is current with the latest edition. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.C-5 is

       References may be supplemented with other classified and unclassified publications such
       as Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc.
   3.3.2. Visual Recognition (VR).
       3.3.2.1. Ensure VR training includes airframes likely to be encountered in the unit-tasked
