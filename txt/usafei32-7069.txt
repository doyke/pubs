This instruction outlines the overall framework for bases to manage hazardous substance release
prevention and response ensuring consistency across United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE). This instruction applies to HQ USAFE, USAFE installations including main operating
bases (MOB), their geographically separated units (GSU) and those areas leased to the United
States Air Force (USAF) (to the extent required or authorized under applicable agreements). This
instruction applies when USAFE personnel and assets are used to respond to uncontrolled or
unconfined releases of hazardous substances and petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL), from
United States (US) DOD activities within the USAFE area of responsibility (AOR). In cases
where it conflicts with the requirements of applicable international agreements or environmental
annexes to operational directives, this instruction does not apply. This instruction addresses
hazardous material management or the initial response to hazardous substance releases. Such
topics are covered in the country-specific Final Governing Standards (FGS) or, in countries
where no FGS exist, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) and
other USAFE instructions/policies. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) units or to the Air National Guard (ANG). This instruction integrates, or
otherwise employs the concepts of sustainable operations, natural infrastructure management and
is consistent with the USAFE environmental management system (EMS) implementation. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

1. General. The Final Governing Standards (FGS), or the Overseas Environmental Baseline
Guidance Document (OEBGD) for installations where there are no applicable FGS, establish the
initial requirement for installations to prepare, maintain, and implement a Spill Prevention and
Response Plan (SPRP), commonly referred to as a ―Spill Plan‖. The purpose of this policy is to
supplement the FGS spill plan criteria with USAFE-specific requirements regarding spill
program implementation, reporting/recordkeeping criteria, and spill prevention procedures. This
policy establishes reporting and prevention requirements for hazardous substance releases that
shall be included in installation-specific SPRPs. An efficient and environmentally sustainable
Spill Response and Prevention Program provides a foundation for a natural resources saving,
ecologically sound and economic groundwater and soil remediation program.
     1.1. Applicability. This policy primarily applies to spills/discharges on US-controlled
     property such as all USAFE installations including main operating bases (MOBs),
     geographically separated units (GSUs), co-located operating bases (COBs), forward
     operating locations, and all other activities controlled by USAFE organizations (e.g., radio
     relay sites, radar sites, ammunition depots, leased facilities). This policy is not intended to
     conflict with or be less restrictive than the FGS or other (US) DOD or Air Force policy. FGS
     or other (US) DOD or Air Force policy requirements must be applied should this policy be
     less demanding.
     1.2. Definitions.
        1.2.1. Release.    Any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying,
        discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing of a hazardous
        substance or POL leaving the appropriate existing infrastructure to retain such a release.
        1.2.2. Spill. A release of a non-gaseous hazardous substance or POL with impact to the
        environment. An impact to the environment exists when the released hazardous substance
        or POL affects soil, surface water, groundwater, or enters the sewer system.
        1.2.3. Discharge. The release or addition of any pollutant (including contaminated
        waters) to any controlled waters.
        1.2.4. Discharge Permit. Formal written authorization from a competent local authority
        allowing wastewater discharges with certain pollutant concentration and/or volumes to
        municipal wastewater treatment plants or to public waters.
        1.2.5. Discharge Permit Exceedance. Discharges to surface waters not complying with
        the permit criteria.
        1.2.6. Hazardous Substance. Hazardous substances include hazardous materials (as
        defined in the OEBGD or Chapter 5 of the applicable country-specific FGS) and
        hazardous wastes (as defined in the OEBGD or Chapter 6 of the applicable country-
        specific FGS).

   request. The CSPM will coordinate efforts, as required.
   3.5. Environmental Executive Agent (EEA), Host Nation (HN), or Headquarters Air Force
   notification (HAF). Contact CSPM if applicable international agreements or FGS requires
   EEA or HN notification (e.g. when a significant spill cannot be contained within the
   installation boundaries or threatens the local HN drinking water resource). Coordinate with
   responsible installation-level Judge Advocate (JA) and Public Affairs (PA), and
   HQ USAFE/A7AV when providing information about a spill to HN authorities. The CSPM
   will forward applicable spill incidents upon the chain of command to the EEA, to
   USEUCOM or to HAF.
4. Release Prevention.
   4.1. Purpose. The prevention of groundwater, soil and air pollution is of critical importance
   to protect human health and safety, to maintain the mission, to protect natural resources and
   to use resources wisely. The USAFE Spill Prevention Program focuses on efficient spill
   prevention and training measures. It is essential to identify existing or potential deficiencies
   which could result in an impact to the environment, human health and safety, or the mission.
   The program helps to protect the environment and to maximize the military value of the
   installation property. It includes all activities relating to personnel spill training, spill plan
   updates, spill record reviews, and analysis. Spill prevention includes all activities requiring
   field work, site inspections and assessments to identify potential spill areas, and/or structural
   alteration at sites. This identifies problematic sites or processes which could cause a spill,
   establishing a base for an efficient spill prevention program reducing or eliminating the need
   to remediate soil or groundwater resources. Improving spill prevention sustains and
   increases the available natural infrastructure for operational purposes at the installation. This
   chapter provides guidance for:
      4.1.1. The prevention of soil and water pollution by uncontrolled releases.
      4.1.2. Personnel awareness by inspections.
      4.1.3. Identifying potential threats by record analysis resulting from possible operational
      or to be abandoned infrastructure/utility systems deficiencies (i.e. Potential Pollutant
      Discharge Areas (PPDA), Oil Water Separators (OWS), etc.).
      4.1.4. Personnel awareness by training.

    4.2. Release Prevention Inspections. The ISPM:
       4.2.1. Shall be the executive secretary for the ESOHC subcommittee for spill response &
       prevention, supporting the ESOHC Chair for subject matter and defining the roles and
       responsibilities of such a panel.
       4.2.2. Develops a release prevention strategy. This strategy shall be presented to the
       BCE and the ESOHC for approval and actions initiated.
       4.2.3. Determines PPDAs and establish and maintain a PPDA inventory. It is highly
       recommended to use a Geographic Information System (GIS).
       4.2.4. Develops and maintains records of inspections and findings which will be
       provided annually (15 days after FY end) to the CSPM.
       4.2.5. The ISPM inspects the installation annually for:
           4.2.5.1. Locations or sites with a conspicuously elevated release/spill frequency.
           4.2.5.2. New PPDAs and changes to existing PPDAs, i.e., locations where hazardous
           substances could be accidentally released into surface waters, soil or ground water.
           4.2.5.3. Contractor yards at least annually in coordination with HN representatives
           (at installations where companies are contracted through the HN).
           4.2.5.4. Current construction and temporary use areas (e.g. areas where exercises
           take place).
           4.2.5.5. Identifies release/spill prevention deficiencies.
           4.2.5.6. Consults all relevant people (e.g. workers, engineers) regarding perceived
           deficiencies, validate the deficiencies and solicit options for corrective actions.
           4.2.5.7. Documents inspection results and improvements accomplished.
           4.2.5.8. Check that organizations have appointed individual(s) for the maintenance
           and availability of spill kits.
           4.2.5.9. Check that organizations have an up to date inventory of spill response kits
           available.
    4.3. Release Prevention Record Analysis, Response, Metric and Recordkeeping. No official
    reporting, other than success stories and lessons learned and the annual record of inspection
    and findings to the CPSM is required. The ISPM:
       4.3.1. Reviews the base spill plan (SPRP) and site-specific spill plans and provide
       assistance for an update if necessary.
       4.3.2. Tracks non-reportable spills. This facilitates trend analysis and improvements to
