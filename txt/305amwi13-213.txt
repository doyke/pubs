                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept:
   1.1.1. Airfield Management (305 OSS/OSAA) is the (OPR) for the Airfield Driving
   Program. The Deputy Airfield Manager trains and certifies each primary and alternate unit
   Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM) as well as develops the training program that
   unit ADPMs utilize when training unit personnel. The ADPMs train and certify, at unit
   commander discretion, any additional unit airfield driving trainers as well as unit personnel
   required to operate a vehicle on the flight line to fulfill mission requirements.
   1.1.2. Only properly trained and certified personnel will drive on the McGuire airfield. This
   requirement applies to all military and civilian employees who are assigned to or visiting the
   base, and applies to drivers of military, commercial, or privately owned vehicles (POV).
   1.1.3. The host unit administers airfield driver training for TDY military and civilian
   personnel performing unit specific duties. OPRs, designated points of contact, and project
   officers will contact the appropriate host ADPMs to coordinate airfield driving training.
   Airfield Management will provide guidance and training for non-unit specific TDY military
   and civilian personnel.
   1.1.4. This airfield driving instruction is not inclusive. For further information, reference
   AFI 13-213 Airfield Driving.
1.2. Responsibilities:
   1.2.1. 305th Wing Commander (305 AMW/CC):
       1.2.1.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support the airfield driving program
       (ADP).
       1.2.1.2. May reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential
       duties following suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Authority must not
       be delegated.
       1.2.1.3. Approves publication of the Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
       1.2.1.4. Reviews runway incursion incidents and corrective actions taken.
   1.2.2. 305th Operations Group Commander (305 OG/CC).
       1.2.2.1. Reviews Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAV) and corrective actions
       taken.
       1.2.2.2. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group
       (RIPWG) if there are more than two runway incursions within a six month period. Note:
       The RIPWG shall convene within 30 days after the second runway incursion.
          1.2.2.2.1. The RIPWG will include OSS/CC, AOF/CC, Airfield Manager (AFM),
          Wing ADPM, Tower Chief Controller, Wing Safety, Unit Commanders and/or unit
          ADPMs, and other organizational leadership as determined locally. RIPWG shall take
          the following actions:
6                                                       305AMWI13-213         8 JANUARY 2013


              1.2.2.2.1.1. Analyze each runway incursion and corrective actions taken.
              1.2.2.2.1.2. Evaluate the airfield driving operating procedures/standards and
              airfield configuration (to include signs/marking/lighting) to determine if
              corrective actions are needed.
              1.2.2.2.1.3. Develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of runway incursions.
          1.2.2.2.2. When held, provide a summary of the RIPWG’s analysis and
          recommendations during the next Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
          1.2.2.2.3. Publish minutes of the RIPWG and provide an informational copy to AMC
          A3/AP for AO within 30 calendar days.
    1.2.3. Unit Commander or equivalent.
       1.2.3.1. Appoints a primary and alternate unit ADPM in writing (normally the Vehicle
       Control Officer or Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officer) to manage training and
       testing requirements of unit personnel who are required to operate a vehicle on the
       airfield. Forward a copy of the appointment letter to the Wing ADPM.
          1.2.3.1.1. Unit ADPMs must be at least SSgt/7-level or above, or civilian equivalent
          unless manning constraints absolutely prohibit; then use most qualified SSgt/5-level
          or civilian equivalent available. Note: The responsible Group Commander (or
          equivalent), is delegated authority to waive this requirement. Forward a copy of the
          waiver to the Wing ADPM.
          1.2.3.1.2. Ensures a replacement unit ADPM is appointed in writing and trained by
          the Wing ADPM at least 30 days prior to releasing the current unit ADPM.
       1.2.3.2. Ensures unit ADPMs can satisfactorily manage the number of airfield drivers
       within their organization. Large organizations should consider having more than one unit
       ADPM to provide effective program management and quality training, thus reducing the
       potential for airfield driving violations and runway incursions. Conversely, small
       organizations (e.g. normally a flight level or smaller) can combine and or consolidate
       their ADP with a unit.
       1.2.3.3. Appoints unit airfield driving trainers in writing to conduct and document
       practical day and night (as applicable) airfield familiarization training and the practical
       driving test as outlined in this ADI. Trainers must have completed the AF Training
       Course. Forward a copy of the appointment letter to the Wing ADPM. Note: This letter
       may be consolidated with the unit ADPM appointment letter. See Attachment 2 for an
       example appointment letter.
       1.2.3.4. Include out-processing with the unit ADPM as part of the squadron out-
       processing checklist. This will ensure proper tracking of personnel assigned and
       authorized to drive on the airfield within the AMC Airfield Driving database.
    1.2.4. McGuire Field ADPM/Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM).
       1.2.4.1. Acts as the Wing ADPM to provide overall ADP management and oversight for
       airfield drivers at McGuire Field.
305AMWI13-213 8 JANUARY 2013                                                                 7

     1.2.4.3. Monitors unit airfield driver training programs for effectiveness.
     1.2.4.4. Conducts daily spot checks to enforce and monitor compliance with airfield
     driving procedures.
     1.2.4.5. Reports and documents results of spot checks in the ―status of airfield driving
     section of the Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
     1.2.4.6. Monitors radios for proper radio terminology/phraseology and discipline.
     1.2.4.7. Conducts semi-annual review of unit test for compliance.
     1.2.4.8. Inspects each unit ADP for integrity and compliance with the ADI at least
     annually (every 12 months) using ADP self-inspection checklist. (Attachment 4)
     Results are briefed to the 305 OSS/CC, the unit commander and briefed at the next
     quarterly AOB.
        1.2.4.8.1. Provides an annual inspection schedule to unit ADPM’s to advise units
        what month they will be inspected.
        1.2.4.8.2. Provides a written memorandum documenting inspection results for the
        OSS/CC to send to the inspected unit CC.
        1.2.4.8.3. Unsatisfactory results will require a follow-up inspection 30 days after the
        initial inspection.
     1.2.4.9. Briefs all Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAV) at the quarterly AOB.
     1.2.4.10. Notifies 305th Wing Safety (305th AMW/SE) of all CMAV’s in a timely

   (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the Wing ADPM to avoid
   duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield
   Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). See Attachment 10 for McGuire Airfield Vehicle Call-
   signs.
   3.2.6. Use of unconditional instructions (blanket approval) is not authorized when entering
   the runway for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check or other airfield operation. See
   FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control for additional information.
   3.2.7. In the event of vehicle/ATCT radio failure, one of the following should apply:
305AMWI13-213 8 JANUARY 2013                                                                    15


      3.2.7.1. ATCT will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
      operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
      requires them to immediately exit the runway.
      3.2.7.2. A vehicle operator, after vacating the runway, should turn the vehicle toward the
      tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the controller to signal with
      the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know and comply with the following
      signals:
          3.2.7.2.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross, ―Proceed, ―Go.
          3.2.7.2.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved.
          3.2.7.2.3. Flashing Red Light: ―Clear active taxiway/runway.
          3.2.7.2.4. Flashing White Light: ―Return to starting point.
          3.2.7.2.5. Red and Green Light: ―General warning. Exercise extreme caution.
          During alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to
          AM or their work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal
          of contractors will be at the discretion of AM.
      3.2.7.3. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately. Contact
      ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the runway and include any pertinent
      information that might affect safe runway operations by any means available. If not able
      to communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication such as
      a cellular phone (when available). Note: Cellular phone usage is prohibited while
      driving on the airfield. Report incident to AM immediately.

   3.3.3. When proceeding into a CMA, vehicle operators must advise the controller of three
   things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are. Vehicle operators
   must always acknowledge all communications so ground control and other persons know that
   the message was received. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft and ground control
   transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
   3.3.4. Example procedures for proper radio terminology/phraseology and discipline:
      3.3.4.1. Request CMA entry: The vehicle operator will state: ―Ground, (Vehicle call
      sign), request to enter the movement area at Taxiway (taxiway designator).‖ The control
      tower will state: ―(Vehicle call sign), proceed into the movement area, report when out.‖
      3.3.4.2. Request Runway entry: Vehicle operator will state: ―Ground, (Vehicle call
      sign), request to cross/enter Runway XX at Taxiway (taxiway designator).‖ The control
      tower will then state ―(Vehicle call sign), enter/proceed across Runway XX at Taxiway
      (taxiway designator), report when off.‖
      3.3.4.3. Request Approach Zone entry: Vehicle operator will state: ―Ground, (vehicle
      call sign), request to enter the approach zone at Taxiway (taxiway designator).‖ The

       transmission by stating: ―(Vehicle call sign), exiting the movement area.‖ The vehicle
       will state after exiting the movement area: ―Ground, (Vehicle call sign) is out of the
       movement area.‖ The control tower will respond with: ―(Vehicle call sign), roger remain
       outside 100 ft. of all runways‖.
       3.3.4.5. Confirm Runway exit: The control tower will state: ―(Vehicle call sign), exit
       Runway XX at Taxiway (taxiway designator). The vehicle operator will then
       acknowledge receipt of this transmission by stating: ―(Vehicle call sign), exiting
       Runway XX at Taxiway (taxiway designator).‖ The vehicle will state after exiting a
       runway or completing a crossing: ―Ground, (Vehicle call sign) is off runway XX at
       Taxiway (taxiway designator).‖ The control tower will respond with: ―(Vehicle call
       sign), roger remain outside 100 ft of all runways‖.
       3.3.4.6. Confirm Approach Zone exit: The control tower will state: ―(Vehicle call sign),
       exit the approach zone.‖ The vehicle operator will then acknowledge receipt of this
       transmission by stating: ―(Vehicle call sign), exiting the approach zone.‖ The vehicle
       will state after exiting the approach zone: ―Ground, (Vehicle call sign) is out of the
       approach zone.‖ The control tower will respond with: ―(Vehicle call sign), roger remain
       outside 100 ft. of all runways‖.
3.4. Usage and maintaining airfield driving visual aids/decals.
   3.4.1. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following AFVA/decals and
   diagrams:

3.7. Vehicle Parking/Chocking procedures on the airfield & in the Immediate Vicinity of
an aircraft
   3.7.1. Vehicle operators will not leave vehicles unattended on the airfield unless:
      3.7.1.1. The ignition is turned off.
      3.7.1.2. The key is left in the ignition.
      3.7.1.3. The door remains unlocked.
      3.7.1.4. The transmission lever is placed in PARK (automatic transmission) or the lowest
      gear (manual transmission) to take the vehicle away from the nearest aircraft (e.g.,
      headed toward an aircraft, use reverse; headed from an aircraft, use lowest forward gear).
      3.7.1.5. The parking brake is set.
      3.7.1.6. One rear wheel fore and aft on all powered vehicles and all equipment mounted
      on wheels that do not have an integral braking system are chocked. One chock will be
      placed between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. All wheeled AGE and
      maintenance equipment will utilize brakes or be chocked. EXCEPTION: Alert and
      emergency vehicles responding to an alert or emergency are exempt from this
      requirement.
      3.7.1.7. The hazard/flashing lights are left on.
   3.7.2. Vehicles must be backed or parked outside the immediate vicinity (at least 25 feet to
   front, outboard of the engines and 200 feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for
   operations such as loading or unloading, servicing, fueling, deicing or towing. A spotter will
   be in position when a vehicle is backed toward an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will
   be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into aircraft.
      3.7.2.1. Spotters. Vehicles are to operate under the direction of a spotter posted in front
      of the vehicle and slightly to the driver's left to allow the driver an unobstructed view of
      the spotter while looking forward. During backing operations, an additional spotter must
      be posted to coordinate the vehicles rear clearance with the forward spotter. When the
      aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded, position a spotter in a location to prevent
      vehicle from contacting aircraft. The spotter will pre-brief the standard signals to be
      used. Additionally, wheel chocks will be pre-positioned to prevent the vehicle from
      striking the aircraft. The chocks will remain in place until the vehicles leave from within
      the 10 foot safety distance requirement. There will be no exceptions to the spotter
      requirement unless procedurally directed by T.O., AFOSH Standard or AFI. In all cases,
      safety will not be compromised.
   3.7.3. When aircraft engines are operating, no vehicle will be parked or driven closer than 25
   feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear or any aircraft, except as prescribed in the applicable
   aircraft handbook. Vehicles parked at the side of the aircraft will be located clear of the
   wingtips, clearly visible from the aircraft cockpit.
 20                                                       305AMWI13-213       8 JANUARY 2013


   3.7.4. Park all vehicles in the aircraft parking area in the front and to either side of each
   aircraft parking spot. Position vehicles forward and to the left to allow room for additional
   vehicles.
   3.7.5. After approaching an aircraft from the front, vehicles will turn right and park
   perpendicular to the fuselage of the aircraft.
   3.7.6. Do not park unattended vehicles or equipment on an unoccupied aircraft parking spot
   in the area bounded by the wing tips of adjacent aircraft on the sides, and by the security
   boundaries (red lines) on the parking ramp.
   3.7.7. Park bicycles near the nose of a parked aircraft. Position bicycles upright, using a
   kick stand, and park in a position that will not interfere with the maintenance or servicing of
   the aircraft.
   3.7.8. When passengers are loading and unloading aft of the aircraft wings, the vehicle will
   park 20 feet from the passenger steps with the front of the vehicle pointed towards the rear of
   the aircraft. After the vehicle is properly positioned, turn the front wheels away from the
   aircraft and chock the vehicle.
   3.7.9. Do not park vehicles on any portion of the airfield unless the operator is performing
   duties related to the airfield. Personnel performing duties in a building adjacent to the
   airfield will not park on the airfield. Temporary exception may be approved with prior
   coordination and permission from Airfield Management.
3.8. Compliance with fixed and mobile obstacle distance requirements.
   3.8.1. A fixed or mobile obstacle is anything posing a threat to aircraft movements, e.g., fire
   bottles, maintenance stands, vehicles, AGE, etc.
   3.8.2. Obstacles must remain at least 1,000 ft. from runway centerlines, 200 ft. from taxiway
   centerlines, 3,000 ft. from runway ends and 1,500 ft. either side of runway end centerline.
   3.8.3. On taxi lanes, refer to the yellow dashed double lines alongside all taxi lanes and
   remain behind those lines for proper wingtip clearances for moving aircraft. Where the
   yellow dashed double lines do not exist, follow the following apron taxi lane clearance
   criteria:
      3.8.3.1. Primary peripheral taxi lane clearances:
          3.8.3.1.1. Main Parking Ramp, Alpha, Bravo, Romeo and Victor rows is 173 ft.

          3.8.3.3.4. Navy and Marine aprons are 193 ft.
   3.8.4. Equipment may be pre-positioned on parking ramps or hardstands not more than three
   hours before aircraft arrival or three hours after aircraft departure IAW Unified Facilities
   Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01. Examples of such equipment are AGE, electrical carts, forklifts,
   tow-bar trailers, fire extinguisher carts, material-handling equipment, airfield maintenance
   stands, and portable floodlights.
3.9. Vehicle Driving Lanes.
   3.9.1. Vehicle Driving are designed to keep airfield drivers operating adjacent to aircraft
   parking aprons moving in an orderly fashion. The driving lanes will be utilized to the
   maximum extent possible to cut down on vehicle traffic operating in proximity to taxiing or
   parked aircraft to help eliminate the possibility of an incident or accident occurring.
   3.9.2. Certain driving lanes at McGuire do not provide adequate wingtip clearance for
   taxiing aircraft, and in some instances, provide no wingtip clearance at all for aircraft taxiing
   adjacent to them. (See Attachment 13)
   3.9.3. Driving Lanes that either does not provide sufficient wingtip clearance are located:
      3.9.3.1. On the front side of Romeo Row, spots 5-9.
      3.9.3.2. At the Northeast corner of the 3-Bay behind Fox Row.
      3.9.3.3. Adjacent to the transient apron (closest to the buildings) along Alpha and Bravo
      rows.
      3.9.3.4. On Taxiway Lima from the road behind POL to the tower access road.
   3.9.4. Vehicle operators in the driving lanes listed in paragraphs 3.9.3.1-3.9.3.4. should
   exercise extreme situational awareness. If an aircraft is approaching you from either
   direction while at these locations in the driving lanes, take the following actions:
      3.9.4.1. If an aircraft and your vehicle are traveling towards each other on the front side
      of Romeo Row or in the driving lanes adjacent to Alpha and Bravo Row, turn around and
      exit the driving lane at the closest point to your location. Wait until the aircraft passes or
      shuts down in the parking spot, then proceed. If the aircraft is approaching from the rear,
      exit the driving lane. NOTE: A good rule of thumb is to have your vehicle even with the
      building edges along Alpha and Bravo Row, and in an open parking spot in the middle of
      Romeo Row where you are exiting.
      3.9.4.2. If an aircraft is approaching you from the back side of Fox Row adjacent to the
      3-Bay, either turn around heading away from the approaching aircraft or exit the driving
      towards the 3-Bay to an area where you are even with the building.
      3.9.4.3. If you are on Taxiway Lima between the road behind POL and the Tower access
      road and an aircraft and your vehicle are traveling towards each other. Assess whether the
      aircraft is a safe enough distance away to continue (without speeding). If you determine
 22                                                      305AMWI13-213         8 JANUARY 2013


      there isn’t enough distance between the vehicle and the aircraft to continue, turn around
      and exit at your point of origin (Tower access road or the road behind POL) until the
      vehicle passes. As a last resort, exit the taxiway into the grass area at a distance of 200’
      from the taxiway centerline until the aircraft passes. Upon re-entering the taxiway, stop
      and conduct a FOD check of the vehicle tires.
3.10. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
   3.10.1. FOD check signs are located at all Airfield entrances. Inspect vehicle tires (pull
   forward to check tire in contact with pavement). Remove foreign materials (e.g., rocks,
   gravel, etc.) as applicable.
   3.10.2. When vehicles exit unimproved surfaces, another FOD check upon entering aircraft
   operating areas is required.
   3.10.3. Ensure all equipment/tools, parts, and trash is properly fastened down before entering
   the airfield and contained while working on the airfield. Ensure all equipment/tools are
   accounted for before leaving the airfield. FOD is everyone’s responsibility on the airfield. If
   sweeper support is needed, contact Airfield Management Operations at 609-754-2712/2714.
3.11. Restricted Visibility, Night Operations, & Daytime Running Lights.
   3.11.1. Restricted Visibility Operations.
      3.11.1.1. When visibility is less than 300 ft. explosive loaded vehicles will not be
      operated.
      3.11.1.2. When visibility is less than 100 ft., POVs and airfield vehicles will not be
      operated on the airfield. Flashing lights will be used on all vehicles temporarily parked
      on the aircraft parking ramps during periods of low visibility. EXCEPTION: Airfield
      Management vehicles and POVs required for access to work centers located on the
      airfield may be used.
   3.11.2. Vehicle operators will exercise caution to ensure headlights do not point toward
   taxing aircraft or tow operations. Headlights of a stopped vehicle shining toward a moving
   aircraft at night will be turned off immediately so the pilot’s night vision is not affected. The
   vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so the vehicle position is
   highlighted. The headlights of the vehicle will remain off until the aircraft is out of range.
   Headlights will be turned ON prior to putting the vehicle in motion. NOTE: Vehicles with
   daytime running lights will park in a safe location with the ignition off, parking brake set and
   emergency flashers on.
3.12. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations.
   3.12.1. NVG aircraft operations may be conducted in the designated ground operations area
   and on Romeo Row, Victor Row and X Row. NVG aircraft can request taxiway lights be
   turned off while performing NVG ground operations. Note: Tower does not have the
   capability to control the parking ramp lights.
   3.12.2. During NVG Operations vehicular movements are strictly prohibited on Romeo
   Row, Victor Row and X-Ray Row. Units will coordinate with Airfield Management and
   Command Post if vehicular movement is required within these areas. All other areas of the
305AMWI13-213 8 JANUARY 2013                                                                      23


   airfield are under normal operating procedures in accordance with this document during
   NVD operations.

   Lakehurst Airfield".
   3.13.3. Bicycles, motorcycles, mopeds/scooters, and similar utility vehicles are prohibited
   from using the ramp access lane, unless driving to and from work, in performance of duties.
   These vehicles are also prohibited in the CMA.
   3.13.4. All operators must meet applicable safety requirements (i.e., reflectors worn,
   helmets, etc.).
   3.13.5. For night operations, bicycles must have an operable front white light turned on
   (visible for 500 or more feet), rear and side reflectors. Also, when parked at night on the
   airfield, position bicycles so they will not impede the traffic flow of aircraft or motor
   vehicles.
3.14. Disabled Vehicles.
   3.14.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground vehicle
   operator will:
       3.14.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
       3.14.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center”. State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
       3.14.1.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. security forces, civil engineer,
       transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off of the
       airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runway.
       3.14.1.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and
       continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
       3.14.1.5. In the event of a disabled vehicle in the CMA, the vehicle operator will
       immediately notify ATCT and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious
       removal of the disabled vehicle from the CMA.
 24                                                       305AMWI13-213         8 JANUARY 2013

   prior to Lima and Hotel rows.
3.19. Vehicles equipped with supplemental traction devices.
   3.19.1. Vehicles equipped with tire chains may be used on airfield pavements after obtaining
   approval from the AFM, 87 WG/SE and CE. The requesting agency will conduct a risk
   assessment with the above agencies when evaluating the need for tire chains to minimize the
   pavement damage and FOD.
   3.19.2. Vehicles with studded tires are not authorized on the airfield.
3.20. Vehicle Escorts. When a non-qualified airfield driver requires access on the airfield, host
unit will provide an escort that is authorized/certified to drive on the airfield. The escort will be
the driver and the non-qualified driver/member/contractor will ride as a passenger at all times
while on the airfield. The host unit will ensure personnel have a valid AF IMT 483 Certificate of

 REPORTING, VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES, REINSTATEMENT PROCEDURES.

4.1. Reporting Procedures:
   4.1.1. When made aware of or upon notice of a violation, a runway incursion or CMAV
   ATCT or any agency/person noticing the violation will:
      4.1.1.1. Direct violators to hold their position outside the CMA and wait for an Airfield
      Management representative to escort them off the airfield.
      4.1.1.2. If unable to contact the driver either by radio or in person, notify Base Defense
      Operations Center (BDOC). If 87 SFS locates the driver, they will initiate a challenge on
      the vehicle. If it is determined to be only an airfield violation, 87 SFS will escort the
      driver to AM Ops, to complete a report. If the driver is unauthorized on the airfield or
      another security issue is witnessed, 87 SFS will transport the driver to the BDOC and
      conduct an investigation.
      4.1.1.3. If ATCT personnel notice a violation, they will notify AM Ops and document
      the event in daily logs and tracking forms.
   4.1.2. AM Ops will:
      4.1.2.1. Interview the driver to determine the cause off the event, the intended actions
      and the driver’s previous training.
      4.1.2.2. Contact the ATCT to determine if the violation had an adverse impact on flight
      operations.
      4.1.2.3. Determine the type of violation occurred based on the above information.
         4.1.2.3.1. Runway Incursion - Any occurrence involving an aircraft, vehicle, person
         or object that enters any portion of the landing area. A runway incursion is a serious
         violation and action will be taken to eliminate the potential for reoccurrence. AF
         IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report, must be completed and submitted to 305
         AMW/SE within 24 hours (see also AFI 91-202, US Air Force Mishap Prevention
         Program) if the incursion involved an aircraft having to take evasive actions (go
         around, reject takeoff, etc). An AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, must be
         completed and submitted to 87 ABW/SE within 24 hours for all other runway
         incursions.
             4.1.2.3.1.1. The Wing ADPM and 87 ABW/SE will conduct an inspection of the
             member’s Unit ADP. Emphasis will be placed on how the unit trained the
             individual, their compliance with the ADI and the ability to utilize the ADTP.
             The results will be reported to the unit commander.
             4.1.2.3.1.2. Airfield Management will notify AMC/A3AP via e-mail within 24
             hours of the incident. If the incident occurs on a weekend, notification will be
             sent on the first duty day after the incident.
         4.1.2.3.2. CMAV - Any occurrence involving an aircraft, vehicle, person or object
         entering any portion of the CMA without the approval of ATCT. For CMAV an AF

centerline.(MAFB approach zone includes taxiways Zulu, Alpha and portions of Golf.)
Clear—ATC term used between pilots and air traffic controllers, not authorized for use by
personnel operating motor vehicles on the airfield.
Controlled Areas—Controlled areas are legally defined areas containing Protection Level 4
resources. Only authorized personnel, designated by a unit commander, have access to
controlled areas.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic
Control Tower (ATCT) approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the ATCT).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific ATCT
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
