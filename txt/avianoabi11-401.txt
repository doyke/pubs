1. General
     1.1. Higher headquarters guidance regarding orientation flights is primarily located in AFI 11-
     401_USAFESUP_1. This instruction provides additional guidance that is specific to orientation
     flights conducted in 31 FW aircraft at home station and at deployed locations. The 31 Operations
     Group Commander (31 OG/CC) has the primary responsibility for overseeing the program. 31
     Operations Support Squadron Current Operations Scheduling (31 OSS/OSOS) will track and
     manage the 31 FW Orientation Flight Program. Commanders must keep the official United States
     Air Force (USAF) intent of the Orientation Flight Program clearly in mind. These flights are not a
     right, and the privilege of providing them must be protected. It is imperative this program be
     managed and executed IAW all applicable directives and this instruction.
     1.2. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and motivate individuals (incentive
     orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular weapon system and its role,
     or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF.
     1.3. 31 OSS/OSOS will track all orientation flights and maintain current listings of personnel who
     have flown and personnel who remain to be flown. 31 OSS/OSOS will maintain annual
     orientation flight records to ensure equitable distribution between all participating units. Records
     that are older than 5 five years are no longer required to be kept.
     1.4. AFI 11-401 defines four types of orientation flights applicable to the 31 FW:
AVIANOABI11-401 4 MARCH 2013                                                                            3


        1.4.1. Incentive Orientation Flights. Provide a visible reward to military personnel for
        outstanding service and to motivate others to similar performance levels.
        1.4.2. Familiarization Orientation Flights. Familiarize individuals who normally have
        aviation-related responsibilities with aircraft and missions.
        1.4.3. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. Display USAF weapons systems to individuals
        so they can gain a better understanding of the particular aircraft and mission.
        1.4.4. Spouse Orientation Flights. Familiarize military spouses with the unit aircraft and
        mission so as to enhance their understanding of the military memberâ€™s role and contribution
        to the USAF mission.
  1.5. Flight surgeons and aerospace physiologists hold aeronautical orders and are not covered
  under this regulation.
2. Incentive Orientation Flight Program.
  2.1. Incentive orientation flights may be flown at home station or at approved deployed locations.
  Incentive orientation sorties executed at deployed locations must be accomplished IAW 11-
  401_USAFESUP_1.
       2.1.1. Names of the intended fliers will be included in the pre-deployment brief. If names
       were not submitted during the pre-deployment brief, then written or electronic coordination is
       required to gain 31 FW/CC approval. Reference section 7 for guidance concerning request.
  2.2. Annual incentive sorties are dedicated to assigned 31 FW personnel.
       2.2.1. Annual and quarterly awards eligible to receive an incentive orientation sortie are
       quarterly and annual award winners from the 31 FW, USAFE, and USAF level. This
       includes the following categories: Airman, Non-commissioned Officer (NCO), Senior Non-
       commissioned Officer (SNCO), Company Grade Officer (CGO) and First Sergeant (annual
       only). These members are the primary pool of incentive orientation flight candidates.
  2.3. Incentive orientation flights in fighter aircraft will consist of a dedicated, non-tactical sortie.
  Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series for definitions covering air combat or
  surface attack missions.
  2.4. When an incentive orientation sortie is scheduled it takes priority over squadron training on
  the day of execution. The Fighter Squadron (FS) must gain 31 OG/CC approval to cancel an
  incentive sortie.
  2.5. The 31 FW/CC has established a quota for incentive flights to promote equitable distribution
  of flights among wing organizations.
       2.5.1. Quotas may be adjusted as necessary to allow maximum participation and are
       allocated as follows:
               2.5.1.1. 31 FW/CC                        As Required
               2.5.1.2. 31 OG/CC                        4 per Fiscal Year
               2.5.1.3. 31 MXG/CC                       9 per Fiscal Year
               2.5.1.4. 31 MSG/CC                       11 per Fiscal Year
               2.5.1.5. 31 MDG/CC                       4 per Fiscal Year
 4                                                             AVIANOABI11-401 4 MARCH 2013


     2.6. Incentive orientation candidates will be required to complete all training outlined in section 6
     of this regulation.
3. Familiarization Orientation Flight Program.
     3.1. Familiarization orientation flights may be flown at home station or at approved deployed
     locations.  Familiarization orientation sorties executed at deployed locations must be
     accomplished IAW AFI 11-401_USAFESUP_1.
         3.1.1. Names of the intended fliers will be included in the pre-deployment brief. If names
         were not submitted during the pre-deployment brief, then written or electronic coordination is
         required to gain 31 FW/CC approval. Reference section 7 for request guidance.
     3.2. Familiarization orientation flights can occur at anytime during the week as long as it does not
     degrade overall FS training. However, flights will generally be scheduled on Thursdays to align
     currency expiration with flight accomplishment.
     3.3. Fighter familiarization orientation flights should provide the best training opportunity
     possible, while keeping the intent of the familiarization ride in mind. Familiarization orientation
     flights may be performed as a tactical sortie, but the sortie type and G-loading encountered should
     be commensurate with the training goals of the familiarization flier. FS/CC and the Pilot in
     Command (PIC) should consider passenger experience and training when determining which
     mission profiles are applicable and appropriate. Consequently, Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) considerations may limit Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvering
     (ACM), or Aerial Combat Tactics (ACT) familiarization flight opportunities. Refer to the
     appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series for definitions covering air combat or surface attack
     missions.
     3.4. Familiarization orientation flights may be recurring (section 3.7) or one-time (section 3.8),
     depending on eligibility outlined in this instruction.
     3.5. 31 OSS/OSOS is responsible for ensuring that these flights are equitably distributed.
     3.6. Familiarization orientation candidates will be required to complete all training outlined in
     this regulation section 6.5
     3.7. Recurring familiarization orientation flights are authorized for the following personnel:
         3.7.1. Unit training device instructors (civilian) assigned to support 31 FW operations. The
         primary purpose of these flights is to expose unit training device instructors to the differences
         between the flight environments in a simulated scenario versus a real world flight training
         scenario. Funding for the training for these flights will be provided IAW the contract that is
         currently in effect.
         3.7.2. Intelligence personnel (AFSC 1NXXX and 14NX). The primary purpose of these
         flights is to expose intelligence personnel to the impact their intelligence data has on the
         capabilities and mission of 31 FW aircraft.
         3.7.3. Officers Awaiting Pilot Training (APT), per AFI 11-401_USAFESUP_1. These
         flights will not take precedence over normal duties, and individuals should coordinate with
         their chain of command before scheduling a flight. The purpose of these flights is to allow
         these officers to gain valuable operational experience pertaining to their future careers during
         their interim assignment. In addition, the following objectives have been identified:
AVIANOABI11-401 4 MARCH 2013                                                                      5


             3.7.3.1. Exposure to the flying environment, including the dynamics of pilotage,
             radio communications, navigation, and mission accomplishment.

             flying missions in fighter aircraft.
             3.7.3.3. Exposure to the demands of instrument flight in instrument meteorological
             conditions.
     3.7.4. Aerospace Physiologists (AFSC 43A). These flights will allow for a greater
     understanding of the stresses inherent in high G flying and the potential for oxygen
     deprivation.
 3.8. One-time familiarization orientation flights are authorized for the following personnel:
     3.8.1. Air Traffic Controllers (AFSC: 1C1X1 and 13M). The primary purpose of these
     flights is for pattern and air traffic control evaluation purposes, and exposure to instrument
     and pattern procedures. Ideally, the sortie should expose controllers to a North Atlantic
     Treaty Organization (NATO) base and to the wide range of approaches and operations in the
     Aviano area.
     3.8.2. Airfield Management (AFSC: 1C7X1 and 13MX). The primary purpose of these
     flights is to show how the airfield environment impacts daily flying operations.
     3.8.3. Aviation Resource Management (AFSC 1C0XX) personnel assigned to the 31 OSS,
     510FS, and 555 FS who directly contribute to the 31 FW flying mission. The primary
     purpose of these flights is to allow ARM personnel to appreciate the result of their day-to-day
     efforts. These flights will be evenly apportioned between the 31 OSS, 510 FS, and the 555
     FS.
     3.8.4. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFSC: 1P0XX). The primary purpose of these flights is to
     show how important flight equipment is to the pilot in a tactical environment.
     3.8.5. Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) (AFSC: 1C4X1). The purpose of these
     flights is to show the impact and importance of air-to-ground and ground-to-air
     communications in a tactical environment. JTACs may qualify for more than one flight in
     accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the 4 ASOG and 31 FW, see
     attachment 6.
     3.8.6. Army Ground Liaison Teams (GLT). The primary purpose of these flights is for GLT
     members to become familiar with their host unit primary aircraft and mission.
     3.8.7. Weather Forecasters and Observers (AFSC: 1W0XX and 15W). The primary purpose
     of these flights is to expose weather professionals to the environment in which 31 FW pilots
     operate and to show how weather forecasting and observations impact flying training and
     operations.
     3.8.8. Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Specialists (AFSC: 1T0XX). The
     primary purpose of these flights is for SERE specialists to gain the pilotâ€™s perspective and

     operations. The primary purpose of these flights is for the maintainers to gain the pilot's
     perspective and to better understand their critical role in providing combat airpower.
 6                                                             AVIANOABI11-401 4 MARCH 2013


         3.8.10. Operation Air Force Cadets. The primary purpose of these flights is to expose
         potential future USAF officers to USAF flying operations and the support necessary to carry
         out the mission of a fighter wing. These flights will take place on a non-interference basis
         only and will take into account the cadetâ€™s current security clearance level.
                 3.8.10.1. In accordance with AFI 16-1301, cadets are authorized over-water flights if
                 they have completed USAFA Course MT-220 (Basic Combat Survival Training).
4. Distinguished Visitor Flights
     4.1. 31 FW Protocol (31 FW/CCP) will serve as the primary point of contact for DV (O-6 or DV
     Code 7 and above) flights and will work in concert with 31 OSS/OSOS to obtain approval at the
     appropriate level of leadership as per AFI 11-401. 31 FW/CCP will submit a Nomination for
     Incentive or Familiarization Orientation Flight IAW paragraph 7.3 of this instruction.
     4.2. Once approval for the incentive/familiarization flight is granted, 31 FW/CCP will inform 31
     OSS/OSOS and the appropriate FS of any special considerations that must be accomplished
     when hosting the DV.
5. Spouse Orientation Flight Program.
     5.1. Spouse Taxi Ride Program.
         5.1.1. Spouses are limited to taxi rides only in USAF fighter aircraft.
         5.1.2. The Spouse Taxi Ride Program is limited to spouses of the following USAF military
         personnel: pilots, maintainers, flying mission support personnel, and critical specialties as
         defined by the 31 OG/CC. The program will not expand to encompass all USAF members.
         Spouses of USAFE military personnel in non-USAFE units collocated with USAFE units are
         eligible to participate in the program.
         5.1.3. 31 OSS/OSOS will ensure individual training and preparation is properly coordinated
         with 31 OSS/OSL. This training will include a thorough pilot brief for possible emergency
         ground egress.
         5.1.4. Ejection seat pins will not be removed under any circumstances.
         5.1.5. Complete appropriate hot brakes/wheel inspections (as required) between taxi trips.
         5.1.6. Pilots will not exceed 50 knots maximum speed during the acceleration roll.
6. Operating Procedures.
     6.1. Following the announcement of the current annual award winners, 31 OSS/OSOS will create
     a prioritized list of the 31 FW incentive fliers. Priority will be given to those individuals with the
     earliest Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS). This list will be split and passed to
     the two FS/DOS for scheduling in accordance with F-16D model availability and section 3.2 of
     this regulation.
         6.1.1. Quarterly 31 OSS/OSOS will solicit names of the top 5% of eligible familiarization
         orientation flight candidates from each group (MDG, MXG, MSG, OG, as well as 8th
         ASOS). Included in this request should be a summary of applicable guidance as well as the
         previous quarterly list of flyers.
     6.2. Incentive and familiarization orientation fliersâ€™ names for the current week, the following
     week, and the most recent flights accomplished will be reported at the weekly scheduling
     meetings.
AVIANOABI11-401 4 MARCH 2013                                                                           7


  6.3. FS/DOS will contact the orientation flier and the orientation flierâ€™s supervisor via email as
  soon as F-16D model availability is anticipated, preferably two weeks in advance. This e-mail
  will include the checklist in Attachment 2, which lists training locations and times. It is the
  responsibility of the flyer to ensure all training is accomplished and current one day prior to the
  flight.
  6.4. Incentive orientation flights will occur in accordance with squadron Flying Hour Program.
  Operations and maintenance should make every effort to maximize D-model aircraft availability
  on applicable days.
  6.5. Incentive and Familiarization Orientation Flight Training
      6.5.1. All orientation fliers will be required to report to the 31st Medical Group Aerospace
      Medicine Squadron Flight Surgeonâ€™s office to accomplish a passenger physical. Standing
      appointment windows are Tuesdays 0900-1100 and Wednesdays 1400-1600, but must still be
      scheduled by calling 632-5101. This physical is good for 14 days.
      6.5.2. Orientation fliers will arrive at SERE (31 OSS/SERE) in Building 904 at 1300L on
      Wednesdays of the week of the flight for Life Support (LS) Equipment Familiarization
      Training (LL01 and LL06), Egress Training (LL02), and Emergency Parachute Training
      (EPT) (SS06). This training is only valid for 72 hours. This training will occur weekly and
      is mandatory for individuals to remain eligible to receive their flight.
      6.5.3. NLT one day prior to the flight, individuals are to report to the FS Aircrew Flight
      Equipment (FS/AFE) for flight equipment fitting.
      6.5.4. Incentive and familiarization orientation candidates, if participating in a flight that will
      remain below Flight Level (FL) 180, will receive one-time physiological training discussing
      G-forces, hypoxia, motion sickness and trapped gas issues. This training lasts one hour and
      is to be conducted by either a 31 FW Aerospace Physiologist (31 AMDS/SGPT) or Flight
      Surgeon. Normally, this will be accomplished in conjunction with the flight physical by the
      Flight Surgeon. If participating in a flight that will go above FL180, member must
      accomplish training IAW paragraph 6.5.5. of this regulation.
      6.5.5. IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, in order to be eligible
      to participate in flights above FL180, all incentive and one-time familiarization orientation
      fliers will be required to be given instruction specific to risks inherent with high altitude
      flight. This training will be instructed by the 31 FW Aerospace Physiology Flight. If an
      Aerospace Physiologist is unavailable at a deployed location, a 31 FW Flight Surgeon can
      serve as a replacement briefer. This is an in depth brief, and is good for 90 days. Physiology
      will generally conduct one class a month, allowing large groups of flyers to receive training
      several weeks in advance and minimize recurring, lengthy training sessions.
      6.5.6. IAW AFI 11-403, recurring familiarization candidates require altitude training to
      remain eligible for multiple flights. This requires an actual altitude chamber profile be
      accomplished prior to the second sortie.
 6.6. 31 OSS/SERE will provide instructors necessary to accomplish EPT and FS will provide LS
 equipment training and egress training. FS instructors may instruct EPT, if certified, when
 31OSS/SERE instructors are not available.
 6.7. The FS will provide a qualified pilot for egress training. Egress instructors will ensure the
 passenger is properly instructed in accordance with the lesson plan.

 6.8. The FS will provide the individual with all equipment necessary to complete the orientation
 flight.
 6.9. Prior to all orientation flights, the PIC will brief all appropriate items located in the IFG.
 6.10. Completed Orientation Flight Checklists (Attachment 2) will be submitted to the FS duty
 desk prior to stepping for the incentive flight.
         6.10.1. Operations Supervisors (Top 3) will be the final authorizing individual for the
         orientation flier to accomplish their flight.
         6.10.2. FS 1C0(s) will then notify 31 OSS/OSOS of flight completion status by COB for
         record keeping purposes.
 6.11. Orientation pilots will comply with FS security procedures specific to orientation passengers.
 6.12. 31 OSS/OSOS will monitor each individualâ€™s status until incentive orientation flight
 completion by annotating date of scheduled flight. If a scheduled incentive flier is unable to
 complete his/her flight due to maintenance, weather, or any other unforeseen factors, the FS will
 notify 31 OSS/OSOS.
 6.13. 31 OSS/OSOS is responsible for notifying all agencies supporting the incentive sortie of
 training dates, times, and locations. This is normally accomplished via the e-mail sent to the
 incentive flight candidate. These agencies include: orientation flierâ€™s supervisor, FS/DOS, 31
 OSS/SERE, Flight Medicine and Physiology.
 6.14. If an individual declines to fly without extenuating circumstances (i.e. temporary duty, leave,
 emergency leave, pregnancy), the individual will not be rescheduled. If the individual is prevented
 from participating due to any of the above-listed reasons or the FW/CC and/or the OG/CC directs,
 that individual will be rescheduled for the next available incentive sortie.
 6.15. Water Survival Training. Orientation flyers are not authorized over-water flight unless they
 have completed Water Survival Training IAW AFI 16-1301.
         6.15.1. MDS specific training is required prior to over water flight. During the summer
         months, SERE will offer MDS familiarization training to orientation flyers in conjunction
         with regular Continuation Training requirements on a non-interference basis. This training is
         valid for one year.
7. Incentive and Familiarization Orientation Flight Request Procedures.
     7.1. Personnel assigned to the 31 FW who have received special recognition other than the
     criteria lined out in paragraph 2.2 may be submitted by their Group CC for an incentive sortie.
     Personnel nominated by their Group CCs are not guaranteed a flight and will be flown on a space
     available basis. This request will be submitted electronically through 31 OSS/OSOS via the
     template located in Attachment 3.
     7.2. Requests for 31 FW personnel to receive an orientation flight not covered by paragraph 3.7
     or paragraph 3.8 must be submitted for review and approval IAW Attachment 3 of this
     instruction.
     7.3. Requests for DV flights will be submitted according to the intent of the flight.
     7.4. Requests requiring Numbered Air Force approval (such as foreign national media) will be
     forwarded to 31 OG/CC NLT 20 days prior to requested flight using the format in AFI11-

                                   STAFF SUMMARY(V1)
AO: Capt David Gertiser, 31 OSS/OSOS
SUBJECT: FAM Flight Request for Capt Abby Koehler, USAF.

1. PURPOSE: Obtain 31 OG/CC and 31 FW/CC endorsement of the attached memo (Tab 1) requesting
single FAM flight approval for Capt Abby Koehler between 7-10 November.

2. BACKGROUND: Capt Koehler is deployed to Aviano from the Colorado Air National Guard as a
Coalition Maintenance Liaison Officer for OUP. Capt. Koehler has done an outstanding job in her duties
while deployed and would benefit greatly from seeing the F-16 mission first hand. Her unit back home
rarely has the capacity for FAM flights and if given the opportunity, Capt Koehler would likely defer the
opportunity to one of her hard working troops.

3. RECOMMENDATION: 31 OG/CC and 31 FW/CC endorse the attached memo (Tab 1).

MEMORANDUM FOR 31 OG/CC

FROM: 31 OSS/OSOS

SUBJECT: Familiarization Flight Request

1. Request approval for Captain Abby M. Koehler, USAF, SSN XXXX (Last Four), to receive a
familiarization flight in a 31 FW F-16D.

2. Capt Koehler is deployed to Aviano from the Colorado Air National Guard as a coalition maintenance
liaison officer for OUP. Capt. Koehler has done an outstanding job in her duties while deployed and
would benefit greatly from seeing the F-16 mission first hand. Her unit back home rarely has the capacity
for FAM flights and if given the opportunity, Capt Koehler would likely defer the opportunity to one of
her hard working troops.

3. All training and approval (to include the eSSS) will be in accordance with AFI 11-401, USAFE 11-
401, and Aviano 11-401.

4. Capt Koehler has a secret clearance and JPAS will be checked again prior to the flight.

5. POC for this request is Capt Dave Gertiser at extension 632-7826.
