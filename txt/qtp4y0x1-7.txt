Supercedes QTP4Y0X1-7, September 2001
   Introduction ______________________________________________ i

            Volume 7, Clinic Management, contains modules on processing, producing
and maintaining dental reports, preparing management reports, operating instructions and
official correspondence, management of financial requirements, and the evaluation of
staffing requirements. This QTP is designed to enhance 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of
dental assistant personnel. All eight volumes are intended to be used by trainees,
trainers, supervisors, and supervisor/trainer—for conducting on-the-job (OJT) per AFI
36-2201, Air Force Training Program.
        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once
you begin upgrade training you’re required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide continuity to
the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) Basic Skills;
2) Clinical Skills - Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills - Chairside Assisting; 4) Clinical Skills -
Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration – Procedures and Programs; 6) Logistics
Management; 7) Clinic Management, and 8) Supervision and Training. The QTP
modules were written to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. You must
use the QTP modules for training when either: 1) the STS task is a core task (minimum
qualification for the specialty); or 2) you have identified the STS task as a requirement of
the trainee’s job. Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your
goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps,
without assistance, while meeting local requirements for speed and accuracy. QTPs also
aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If you have
local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in
performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.

        Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress record.
This QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee completes each
module. Individuals in qualification/upgrade training must have this QTP progress
record filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress record are similar to
current OJT documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as
prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document and initial each task
completion date in column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and the “date
completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is being recertified on a task
that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification
process.

        Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method
listed in the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the
first half of each module, (i.e., steps in task performance); however, the “performance
checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP
volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized
and methodical approach. This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts.

        When beginning any training process you should first, review the procedures in
each module with the trainee. Second, direct the trainee to review the training references
listed to prepare for task performance. Third, go through the steps in task performance
with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step (some modules may
   Introduction ______________________________________________ ii

take longer to teach). Fourth, evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step--using the
performance checklist at this point will be helpful. Fifth, evaluate the trainee’s
performance and provide feedback on any areas for improvement. Finally, when the
trainee has successfully completed the task you must document and initial both the STS
and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does not accomplish the module, conduct
follow-up instruction until the trainee successfully completes the task.

        The QTP project goal of the 381 TRS/XWAA, Sheppard AFB TX, is to publish a
useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in changes or
revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of
each QTP volume.

service in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not imply
endorsement by the Air Force.
