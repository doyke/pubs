                                            Chapter 2

                                NOTAM CLASSIFICATIONS

2.1. What are NOTAMs? NOTAMs are unclassified notices or advisories distributed by
means of telecommunication that contain information concerning the establishment, conditions
or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of
which is essential to personnel and systems concerned with flight operations.
2.2. NOTAM Classifications. NOTAMs are classified as Military, Domestic, International,
and FDC:
   2.2.1. Military NOTAMs.
       2.2.1.1. DESC NOTAM (―F‖ Series). Defense Energy Support Center issues ―F‖ Series
       NOTAMs for OCONUS locations concerning fuel availability for DoD users.
       2.2.1.2. Local NOTAM (―L‖ Series). Local NOTAMs usually promulgate non-critical
       related information. Airfield Facility Manager shall establish the parameters for
       classifying local NOTAMs.
       2.2.1.3. Flight Safety NOTAM (―M‖ Series). Flight Safety NOTAMs promulgate safety
       related information that is critical for safety of flight, such as aerodrome closures, runway
       closures, or changes in NAVAID availability.
       2.2.1.4. Procedural NOTAM (―V‖ Series). Procedural NOTAMs promulgate information
       concerning published instrument procedures, such as Standard Instrument Approach
       Procedure (SIAPs), Standard Instrument Departure (SID), Standard Terminal Arrival
       Route (STAR), and Departure Procedure (DP).
       2.2.1.5. DAFIF and/or FLIP Change NOTAMs (―W‖ Series). DAFIF and/or FLIP
       Change NOTAMs promulgate changes in DoD FLIP products that provide data/digital
       data for worldwide flight operations.
       2.2.1.6. ―X‖ Series. Reserved for DoD NOTAM Cell use only.
       2.2.1.7. Graphical NOTAMs. Graphical NOTAMs allow NOTAM Authorities to create
       ―M‖ and ―L‖ Series NOTAMs that disseminate like existing NOTAMs and also depict
       NOTAM information graphically on the airport diagram. Note: At OCONUS locations,
       the Graphical NOTAM tool is only available at locations that have host nation approval
       to process NOTAMs through DINS.
       2.2.1.8. Attention Notices. DoD NOTAM Cell and select other agencies, under the
       direction of competent military authority, promulgate regulatory and advisory Attention
       Notices by theater or under the general "ALL" category, i.e., ATTA (All), ATTC
       (Caribbean), ATTE (European), ATTN (North America), and ATTP (Pacific).
   2.2.2. Domestic NOTAMs (Civil).
       2.2.2.1. NOTAM D. FAA issued NOTAMs that promulgate flight safety information
       concerning the NAS, NAS NAVAIDs, as well as all public use airports, seaplane bases,
       and heliports listed in the Airport/Facility Directory.
12                                                              AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011


     2.2.2.2. Pointer NOTAM. FSS issued NOTAMs that highlight or ―point out‖ other,
     potentially obscure NOTAMs, e.g., FDC or PJE NOTAMs. Pointer NOTAMs assist users
     in cross-referencing important information that may not be found under an airport or
     NAVAID identifier.
  2.2.3. International NOTAMs (Civil).
     2.2.3.1. International NOTAM (―A‖ Series). USNOF issues international NOTAMs to
     partner INOs concerning NOTAM D information at major international airports;
     OMEGA, LORAN, and GPS systems; and certain airspace NOTAMs; e.g., ARTCC and
     CARF altitude reservations (ALTRVs) and warning area information. In addition,
     USNOF issues international NOTAMs for select overseas locations and NAVAIDs when
     directed by competent authority.
     2.2.3.2. International NOTAM from Foreign Sources. INOs issue NOTAMs to the
     USNOF using guidance published in the general section of each country’s AIP.
     OCONUS stations may be required to provide and review specific country NOTAM
     Series.
  2.2.4. FDC NOTAM (Civil). USNOF issues FDC NOTAMs, which promulgate regulatory
  information. Examples of FDC NOTAMs include: interim IFR flight procedures, Instrument
  Approach Procedure (IAP) changes, temporary flight restrictions, flight restrictions in the
  proximity of the President and other parties, 14 CFR Part 139 certificated airport condition
  changes, snow conditions affecting glideslope operation, air defense emergencies, emergency
  flight rules, substitute airway routes, special data, US Government charting corrections, and
  laser activity.

                                         Chapter 3

                         COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. USNS. In 1988, FAA and DoD combined the NOTAM systems into a single infrastructure
that receive, store, and display military, international, and domestic NOTAMs. Today, this
system is called the USNS.
   3.1.1. FAA. The FSSs and ARTCCs access NOTAMs through FAA Domestic NOTAM
   Systems.
   3.1.2. DoD accesses the USNS through DINS, which allows authorized users the ability to
   Create, Cancel, or Replace (CCR) NOTAMs via NIPRNet and lets all users query NOTAM
   data via the NIPRNet/Internet. The DoD NOTAM Cell is only responsible for DINS
   NOTAM data.
3.2. Connectivity. DINS is the only authorized DoD avenue for military NOTAM creation and
the primary means of NOTAM retrieval. In addition to DINS Query, all DoD base and flight
operations facilities shall have the ability to CCR NOTAMs.
   3.2.1. NOTAM Accounts and Passwords. In order to create NOTAMs, units shall establish
   an authority account and request a certificate from the DoD NOTAM Cell. NOTAM
   Authorities shall ensure the security of the assigned username and password required to CCR
   NOTAMs.
   3.2.2. Encryption Certificates. DoD NOTAM Cell issues encryption certificates in order to
   prevent unauthorized access to USNS databases. Certificates are valid for one year. Airfield
   Facility Managers should limit certificates to those who regularly author NOTAMs. DINS
   CCR Training Guide details the certificate requisition and installation process.
3.3. Processing Capability. After system connectivity is established, units may connect to
either DINS primary or secondary site via their primary or secondary computer, or by using a
non-LAN dependent computer.
   3.3.1. Primary and Secondary DINS Query sites (https://www.notams.jcs.mil and
   https://www.notams.faa.gov) allow users and NOTAM Authorities to query NOTAMs, link
   to CCR sites, request and install NOTAM certificates, download DINS CCR Training Guide
   and instruction, view DINS updates, as well as link to various FAA and DoD-related
   websites.
   3.3.2. Primary and Secondary DINS CCR sites (https://www.dinsccr.notams.jcs.mil/ccr/
   and https://www.dinsccr.notams.faa.gov/ccr/) allow NOTAM Authorities to CCR
   NOTAMs.
   3.3.3. Alternate Computer. Units should have a second computer with the appropriate
   encryption certificate available for NOTAM processing.
   3.3.4. Backup Facility Procedures: Units shall have a LOA on file with a backup facility to
   act as NOTAM Authority surrogate in case of extended outages or facility closures, thereby
   allowing for uninterrupted NOTAM coverage. Any DoD service may act as a backup facility;
   Airfield Facility Managers should choose a backup facility that is in different geographic
14                                                             AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011


  location and accessible around the clock. USNOF should only be used as an emergency back
  up. Attachment 2 shows a sample LOA.
  3.3.5. Processing Difficulty. Units experiencing NOTAM processing difficulty should
  attempt the following troubleshooting steps:
     3.3.5.1. Ensure user’s browser has a valid certificate.
     3.3.5.2. Attempt accessing both primary and secondary sites, using a secondary
     computer if necessary.
     3.3.5.3. Contact the base communication help desk to ensure base network is functioning
     correctly, e.g., LAN is available, firewall settings have not been modified, etc.
     3.3.5.4. If DINS connectivity is lost for an untenable amount of time, units shall
     coordinate with their designated backup facility to process NOTAMs as required (see
     3.3.4).
     3.3.5.5. If DINS is the only website that is down and if the preceding steps do not
     provide resolution, contact the DoD NOTAM Cell.
AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011                                                                        15


                                            Chapter 4

                         STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

4.1. System Integrity. The following requirements are essential for information integrity and
optimal performance of the DoD/FAA’s NOTAM system; compliance is mandatory.
4.2. DoD NOTAM Qualifications. NOTAMs shall be:
   4.2.1. A hazard to flight safety or may limit military flight operations.
   4.2.2. Published or qualify for publication in FLIP.
   4.2.3. More restrictive than the information published in FLIP.
   4.2.4. Under the jurisdiction of the NOTAM Authority.
   4.2.5. Temporary in nature, not exceeding 90 days. When conditions warrant a longer
   period, initiate required changes to the appropriate FLIP product as soon as practical and
   request reissue of NOTAM. Ensure the NOTAM is cancelled when the changes are published
   correctly in the FLIP.
4.3. Information Specifications.
   4.3.1. Q-Codes are used to standardize format of NOTAMs and, with the exception of ―L‖
   Series, shall be used when drafting NOTAMs.
   4.3.2. NOTAMs shall not exceed 20 lines or 1500 characters in one part.
   4.3.3. Instrument and Microwave Landing Systems. Always use runway designation when
   transmitting ILS and MLS system NOTAMs. Do not NOTAM changes of 0.2 degrees or less
   from the published glideslope.
   4.3.4. Airfield Lighting Facilities. Follow appropriate service guidelines for issuing airfield
   lighting NOTAMs.
   4.3.5. Service Facilities. NOTAM servicing delays only if Airfield Facility Manager
   determines that such delays would impact operations significantly. If sent, NOTAMs should
   specify service and extent of delay.
   4.3.6. Explanations. Reasons as to why a NOTAM condition exists are optional and at the
   discretion of the Airfield Facility Manager.
4.4. Use of Numbers.
   4.4.1. Altitude shall be expressed in feet or established flight level (FL) relative to mean sea
   level (MSL), e.g., 1700 MSL, FL70, and FL550. Specify AGL only when MSL altitudes are
   not known or available, e.g., 500 AGL.
   4.4.2. Latitude and longitude coordinates shall be expressed in degrees and, if necessary,
   minutes, e.g., 39N077E or 3910N07751E.
4.5. Time. NOTAM times shall be expressed in coordinated universal time (UTC) and
indicated to the nearest minute. The day begins at 0000 hours and ends at 2359 hours. ―With
Immediate Effect (WEF or WIE)‖ and ―Until Further Notice (UFN)‖ shall not be used as
 16                                                               AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011


condition effective/expiration times in DINS. Similarly, 0000 is not a valid condition expiration
time.
4.6. Q-Codes. The Q-Code is a five-letter NOTAM code that standardizes subject and
condition text by converting the respective codes into plain language. If a Q-Code exists for a
specific subject and condition being addressed in a Flight Safety NOTAM, use it (see example
below). When the subject/condition text does not exist/apply, complete the Q-code text with
"QXXXX." DINS and CCR web sites both have comprehensive Q-Code listings.

Figure 4.1. Q-Codes Example:




   4.6.1. Additional Condition Text. In order to increase clarity, NOTAM Authorities should
   use amplifying information to augment Q-Codes, such as geographical coordinates,
   frequencies, and runways. Note: When using free text, NOTAM Authorities should use
   both plain language and ICAO approved contractions outlined in FAAO JO 7340.2 to clearly
   express NOTAM conditions. NOTAM Authorities shall not use contractions in a way that
   undermines readability or causes confusion.
   4.6.2. Derived Q-Codes. The Derived Q-Code function allows units to select predefined Q-
   Code combinations to populate the NOTAM Q-line. Q-Code static listing may be used as a
   guideline to determine NOTAM classification.
   4.6.3. Smart Agents. Computer ―smart agents‖ query the NOTAM system for specific
   conditions, Q-Codes, or NOTAM Series. Accordingly, units shall use correct Q-Codes and
   NOTAM Series to classify their condition.
4.7. Duplication Avoidance.
   4.7.1. Do not issue NOTAMs to advertise data already published or charted correctly in such
   media as FLIPS or the FAA Notice to Airmen Publication (NTAP).
   4.7.2. Use the NOTAM system to obtain, format, and disseminate unanticipated or
   temporary changes to airfield or airspace hazards.
   4.7.3. Publish a NOTAM when changes occur rapidly and time does not permit issuing
   notice via FLIP chart or appropriate publication. NOTAMs should display temporary
   conditions which should be corrected before the next FLIP publishing date.
AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011                                                                      17


   4.7.4. At joint-use aerodromes, Airfield Facility Managers shall collaborate with civilian
   counterparts to establish a LOA that specifies NOTAM authoring, handling, and coordination
   responsibilities. The LOA should direct that NOTAM conditions that affect both civil and
   military users (e.g., RWY and TWY closures, NAVAID outages, changes to Aerodrome
   status, etc.) be issued as civil NOTAMs. Conversely, NOTAM conditions that affect only
   military users (e.g., OLS outages, drag chute operations, LOX availability, etc.) should be
   issued via DINS and coordinated with the civilian Airport Manager. All told, duplication of
   NOTAMs shall be avoided as much as possible. (A sample LOA is contained at Attachment
   3.)
   4.7.5. When necessary, TERPS Authorities shall collaborate with appropriate sister service
   and civilian counterparts to ensure that NOTAM authoring, handling, and coordination
   responsibilities are clearly delineated for joint use and overseas locations.
4.8. Timeliness. Timeliness of NOTAM information is critical to flight safety. New NOTAM
information with an immediate effectiveness shall be coordinated and submitted within 15
minutes of receipt or discovery. Exception: TERPS personnel may require additional time to
safely coordinate procedural NOTAMS.
   4.8.1. NOTAM Transmission. NOTAMs shall be submitted no earlier than 3 days prior to
   the expected condition.
   4.8.2. Authorized Delays. NOTAM Authorities may delay transmitting NOTAMs
   concerning NAVAIDs for up to 1 hour and radars for up to 30 minutes, provided the
   aerodrome meets the following conditions:
       4.8.2.1. During daylight hours.
       4.8.2.2. At least 3000 foot ceiling.
       4.8.2.3. At least 5 statute miles visibility.
4.9. Preventative Maintenance Schedules. Preventative maintenance schedules normally
should be promulgated via FLIP. Airfield Facility Managers shall coordinate preventative
maintenance schedules affecting NAVAIDs and radars that are a part of the National Airspace
System (NAS) with the appropriate FSS and affected facilities with at least 5 hours prior notice.
4.10. Specific NOTAM Conditions and Criteria. Conditions affecting the NAS shall be
promulgated to civilian and DoD users via the appropriate NOTAM system. FAAO JO 7930.2
details NOTAM origination and coordination responsibilities for NOTAMs that fall outside of
DINS’ purview. The following procedures shall be adhered to:
   4.10.1. Special Operations. Special operations, such as Aerial Refueling, Parachute
   Jumping/Sky Diving (PJE), Lights Out/Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations in a MOA,
   Unmanned Aircraft Operations, and flight demonstrations, shall be issued by the appropriate
   FAA facility IAW FAAO JO 7930.2.
   4.10.2. Special Use Airspace (SUA). FAAO JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling Airspace
   Matters, describes the various types of SUA in the NAS and FAAO JO 7400.8, Special Use
   Airspace, details the legal definition of all SUA. NOTAMs for SUA shall be processed IAW
   FAAO JO 7930.2.
 18                                                                AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011


   4.10.3. NAS NAVAIDs. Changes in the status of NAVAIDs that make up the NAS shall be
   promulgated through the FAA via civil NOTAMs. Airfield Facility Managers, at locations
   with NAVAIDs and radars that are part of the NAS, shall coordinate civil NOTAM issuance
   with the tie-in FSS IAW FAAO JO 7930.2. If necessary, a replicating ―M‖ Series NOTAM
   may also be issued via DINS.
   4.10.4. Surface Area Hours of Operation. For facilities whose surface area is listed as part
   time in the Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) (e.g., Class D part of the time; Class G another),
   changes in the hours of operation of surface areas require a civil NOTAM. Airfield Facility
   Managers shall coordinate civil NOTAM issuance with tie-in FSS IAW FAAO JO 7930.2.
   Example: The normal operating hours for NAS Key West, FL (KNQX) are 1200-0300 UTC.
   In order to accommodate aircraft operations, the aerodrome and Class D surface area will
   remain open an additional two hours. This scenario requires sending two NOTAMs. First, a
   DINS ―M‖ Series NOTAM shall be sent stating ―AERODROME HOURS OF SERVICE
   ARE…‖ (Q-Code: QFAAH). Second, a civil NOTAM changing the hours of the Class D
   surface area from 0300 to 0500 UTC shall be sent via the FSS. Note: Continuously active
   surface areas (e.g., Class D is always active) cannot be changed by NOTAM action, only
   rulemaking.
4.11. Overseas Operations.
   4.11.1. Host Nation Territory. In order to request NOTAM issuance for activities within
   non-DoD controlled international airspace, using agencies shall submit NOTAM requests to
   the ATS/controlling agency (e.g., ACC/FIR) for the affected airspace at least two weeks prior
   to the scheduled activity. This lead time permits timely promulgation of information in
   accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 15. INOs normally issue NOTAMs 48 to 72
   hours prior to the activity.
   4.11.2. Operations and Firings over the High Seas. Activities that present a hazard to air
   navigation and safety of nonparticipants require coordination with the appropriate ATS
   and/or controlling agency for potential deconfliction and, if necessary, NOTAM issuance.
   Component Commanders shall ensure proper coordination is accomplished (see 1.2.7). DoD
   FLIP General Planning and DODINST 4540.01 detail policy and procedures for ―Operations
   and Firings over the High Seas.‖ Specific NOTAM requirements are as follows:
      4.11.2.1. Activities occurring within correctly scheduled SUA parameters (time and
      boundaries) do not require NOTAM issuance.
      4.11.2.2. Activities occurring outside scheduled SUA parameters (time and boundaries)
      require NOTAM issuance. Using agencies shall coordinate NOTAM issuance with the
      affected ATS/controlling agency. Note: Using agencies should coordinate with
      appropriate Component Commander if the ATS/controlling agency coordination
      procedures in either 4.11.1 or 4.11.2 are not clear.
   4.11.3. Controlled Airspace Outside of the US and Bare-Base Operations. Coordinate
   with HQ AF/A3O-BNE for European Theater operations, as appropriate, to establish the
   temporary authorization to process NOTAMs for locations listed in the enroute supplement
   but are not covered by the USNS, or for unpublished locations (aerodromes, highways used
   for landing, perforated steel planking strips, etc.).
AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011                                                                  19


       4.11.3.1. The European NOTAM office hours are Monday – Friday, 0500Z –
       1500Z+1(+2DT). Standby personnel process NOTAMs on weekends and holidays.
       4.11.3.2. Locations requiring international dissemination of NOTAMs as directed by HQ
       AF/A3O-BNE shall coordinate NOTAMs as follows:
          4.11.3.2.1. During European NOTAM Office Duty Hours (for Urgent and Non-
          Urgent NOTAMs): Units shall provide the following NOTAM information to the
          European NOTAM Office via DSN (314) 480-8092/7257 or email at
          europ.notam@ramstein.af.mil:
              4.11.3.2.1.1. Four-Letter ICAO Identifier.
              4.11.3.2.1.2. Start Date and Time (UTC).
              4.11.3.2.1.3. Expiration Date and Time (UTC).
              4.11.3.2.1.4. Schedule (if applicable, e.g., 0400 – 1800 DAILY; 8, 10, 12 FEB;
              Every FRI, etc.).
              4.11.3.2.1.5. NOTAM Text, e.g., ―TWY F CLOSED DUE TO
              CONSTRUCTION,‖ or ―RWY 7/25 CLOSED DUE TO NUMEROUS HOLES
              ON THE RWY.‖
              4.11.3.2.1.6. Additional information as appropriate.
              4.11.3.2.1.7. Requestor’s name and telephone number.
          4.11.3.2.2. During European NOTAM Office Non-Duty Hours (for Urgent
          NOTAMs): Units shall e-mail the USNOF with the NOTAM information indicated in
          paragraph 4.11.3.2.1.1 – 4.11.3.2.1.7 at 9-awa-notams@faa.gov; verify e-mail
          receipt at commercial: (540) 422-4260/61/62/63 or DSN: (510) 422-4757/58/59.
          4.11.3.2.3. During European NOTAM Office Non-Duty Hours (for Non-Urgent
          NOTAMs): Units shall transmit NOTAM via DINS and email the NOTAM
          information indicated in paragraph 4.11.3.2.1.1 – 4.11.3.2.1.7 to the European
          NOTAM Office.
          4.11.3.2.4. The European NOTAM Office and/or the USNOF will issue an ―A‖
          Series NOTAM. Note: Once the ―A‖ Series NOTAM appears under the location’s
          ICAO within DINS, units shall cancel corresponding ―M‖ Series NOTAM.
   4.11.4. Contingency Operations. During contingency operations, the Task Force
   Commander (US Army) takes overall control over operations and subsequent NOTAM
   issuance. Task Force Commanders may delegate control over air assets and pertinent
   NOTAM issuance to the Combined Forces Air Component Commander (CFACC [USAF]).
   Working together, these authorities shall designate NOTAM authorities necessary to issue
   NOTAMs on foreign airfields, airspace, and territory.
4.12. Instrument Procedures and Changes. Establishing new instrument/radar approaches or
making changes to existing instrument/radar approaches may require publishing procedural data
temporarily via NOTAM. Airfield Facility Managers or authorized TERPS personnel shall
adhere to the following:
 20                                                             AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011


   4.12.1. Promulgate procedural changes only through ―V‖ Series NOTAMs and under the
   direction of TERPS personnel.
   4.12.2. When TERPS office is detached from the Airfield Facility Manager, TERPS
   personnel shall coordinate ―V‖ Series NOTAMs with the Airfield Facility Manager so that
   appropriate local coordination can be accomplished.
   4.12.3. Publish instrument procedures for aerodromes covered by the DoD NOTAM system
   only when waiting for the normal FLIP publication cycle would negatively impact flight
   operations. Instrument procedures shall meet the requirements of AFI 11-230, AR 95-2, or
   OPNAVINST 3722.16.
   4.12.4. Procedural changes made to published approaches shall be more restrictive than
   existing procedures, necessary for safety, and meet criteria set forth in FAAO 8260.3 or
   appropriate service TERPS directive.
   4.12.5. ―V‖ Series NOTAMs shall identify the exact procedure by name. If two or more
   minima values change in any aircraft category, the NOTAM shall state the entire minima
4.13. NOTAM Disposition. Airfield Facility Managers shall retain NOTAM transmission
forms for 15 days after NOTAM expiration. If an accident or incident occurs, retain forms with
the same disposition as historical documents.
4.14. DAFIF Verification. When DAFIF data is changed, which occurs on a 28-day cycle,
NOTAM Authorities shall verify the accuracy of graphical NOTAMs to ensure their validity.
CCR Guide details proper verification procedures.
AFI11-208_IP 3 JUNE 2011                                                                     21


                                          Chapter 5

                              ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

5.1. Notices to Airmen Publication. Published every 28 days, this FAA publication
promulgates current NOTAMs that are considered essential to the safety of flight and known
sufficiently in advance to be published in this format.
5.2. NOTAM Briefings. USNS Specialists, which include both DoD Coordinators and FAA
personnel, do not provide aircrew NOTAM briefings. Likewise, aircrews do not receive FAA
Notice to Airmen Publication information or military NOTAMs from FSS briefers unless
specifically requested during weather and NOTAM briefings.
5.3. International NOTAM Exchange. USNOF exchanges NOTAM data with partner INOs
throughout the world. While DINS pulls and promulgates all NOTAMs received by the USNS,
DINS users need to be aware that USNS may not have received all NOTAMs for a specific
location, which—in turn—could affect DINS coverage. Accordingly, users should check host
nation for supplementary NOTAM information to better ensure complete NOTAM coverage.
5.4. GPS. GPS availability NOTAMs, e.g., ―GPS ONLY NPA NOT AVBL FROM 29 MAY
1500 TIL 29 MAY 1520,‖ appear under location identifiers where GPS approaches are currently
available. GPS NOTAMs are computer generated, self-canceling, and require no action from
Airfield Facility Managers.
5.5. Coordination. Submit aeronautical data affecting FAA publications or airspace to the FAA
through the responsible military authority.
5.6. Online Resources. DINS Query site (https://www.notams.jcs.mil) provides detailed, up-
to-date resources, such as instructions, training manuals and tutorials, which are invaluable in
maximizing DINS’ robust features. To better ensure a NOTAM Authority’s familiarity with
these features, Airfield Facility Mangers should integrate these materials into their respective
training syllabi and check for subject matter mastery prior to qualification.
