SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It’s
rewritten to better align host wing supplement with the current AFI and PACAF Supplement. It
 2                                            AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013


provides a significant rewrite and clarification of Activity Security Manager (ASM) functions at
the unit level. All US Army affiliated personnel should contact the Installation Security
Intelligence Office at 384-3955 for specific guidance on all matters contained herein as
significant procedural differences exist.
2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. Electronic Questionnaire for
Investigation Processing by Design (e-QIP) replaces Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire
(EPSQ) as used throughout the basic AFI.
2.4.3. Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) are required on all civilian/contract employees
assigned to public trust (moderate risk) positions. Background Investigation (BI) are required
on all civilian/contract employees assigned to public trust (high risk) positions.
2.4.4. National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries (NACI) is now the baseline background
investigation required for all civilian/contractor/volunteer personnel assigned to non-sensitive
(low risk) positions or requiring a Common Access Card (CAC) to access Federal facilities,
access to restricted areas that don’t contain classified information or unclassified information
systems on a permanent basis. All Air Force positions that previously required the initiation or
completion of a National Agency Check (NAC) now require a NACI or higher investigation.
2.4.5. Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACI) is
required for all civilian employees assigned to non-critical sensitive positions. National Agency
Check, Local Agency Check and Credit Check (NACLC), and NACI are not sufficient in scope
for personnel assigned to these positions. EXCEPTION: Single Scope Background
Investigations (SSBI) are sufficient in scope for civilians assigned to non-critical sensitive
positions, provided there has been no break in service greater than 24-months.
2.4.6. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC). NACLCs
are required for military and contractor personnel who need access to Secret information.
NOTE: Company Facility Security Officers (FSO) will submit contractors assigned to National
Security positions for appropriate Personnel Security Investigation (PSI).
2.4.8. Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). PRs are investigations conducted at prescribed intervals
for the purpose of updating a previously completed background investigation. NOTE: Because
of significantly improved security clearance investigative/adjudication timelines, effective 24
August 2011, all PRs will not be submitted earlier than 60 days of the anniversary date of the
subject’s current investigation.
2.4.10. (Added) . Special Agreement Check (SAC) is a finger print check that is required with
all initial investigations. The 673 ABW Information Protection Office (IPO) can provide ASM,
and Trusted Agents (TA) the advanced finger print results for CAC card issuance in accordance
with HSPD-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and
Contractors. NOTE: OFI Form 86C, Special Agreement Checks, are required for members who
have a top secret clearance and marry or cohabitate with a Foreign National. In this case, ASMs
must notify IPO as soon as possible for guidance.
3.1. Authority to Designate Sensitive Positions. Commanders and Human Resources Specialist
will use the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) position designation tool at
http://www.opm.gov/investigate/resources/position/index.aspx to aid in position designation.
All position designations must be updated in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
(DCPDS).
AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013                                                            3


3.2. Within JBER, IPO submits all PSI requests. EXCEPTION: Civilian Personnel Flight and
Non-Appropriated Funds Human Resource Office are authorized requesters and submit all PSIs
for new hires. Contractors assigned to National Security positions will have their PSIs submitted
by the company FSOs.
3.2.1. Suitability determinations (no determination made (NDM)) that are returned from the
Consolidated Adjudication Facility (CAF) will be made accordingly:
3.2.1.1. (Added) . IPO sends the case file, NDM memorandum, and OPM Form 79A, Report of
Adjudicative Action, to the unit Commander and appropriate Human Resource Office (Civilian
Personnel Flight (CPF)/ Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF)/Contracting) for action.
3.2.1.2. (Added) . The CPF/NAF Human Resources ((HR) Office):
3.2.1.2.1. (Added) . Determines if the individual is deemed suitable for employment in
accordance with 5 CFR 731.201-202, Suitability Determinations. Coordination/consultation
with the supervisor and or commander may be made.
3.2.1.2.2. (Added) . If employee is determined suitable, CPF/NAF signs off on the OPM
Certificate of Investigation and the form is filed in the individual’s Official Personnel Folder
(OPF) in accordance with AFI 36-114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
3.2.1.2.3. (Added) . If applicant is determined unsuitable, CPF/NAF fills out the OPM Form
79A, and coordinates with the employee’s supervisor and or commander. CPF/NAF forwards
the OPM Form 79A to OPM. NOTE: For contractors, the unit Commander will coordinate
appropriate actions with the Contracting office, ASM, and unit Quality Assurance representative.
3.2.3.4. (Added) . The ASM will be required to update the Joint Verification System (JVS)
with the suitability determination via the Information Technology (IT), Public Trust or Child
Care links.
3.6. The Civilian Personnel Flight ensures a pre-employment waiver is completed by
commanders on all new employees who are designated to fill Non-Critical Sensitive, Critical
Sensitive or Special Sensitive positions, prior to the individual reporting for work. The
individual’s unit of assignment will provide a copy of the pre-employment waiver letter to IPO.
A pre-employment waiver does not authorize the individual access to classified information, IT
systems, a common access card or a restricted area badge. The individual must have a security
clearance for access to classified information or a favorable investigation for access to IT
systems or unescorted entry to restricted areas.
3.10. Security Clearance Authority. The Department of Defense (DoD) CAF is the designated
authority to grant, suspend, deny or revoke personnel security clearances and SCI access.
3.10.1. The CAF issues security clearance eligibility based on the type of investigation
conducted. Commanders grant access to classified information based on the level of position
occupied by the individual. Access must be reflected in Joint Verification System (JVS). If a
member’s security clearance goes “out of scope” the commander must submit a Continuous
Access letter to IPO in order for member to maintain access to classified information pending
submission of periodic reinvestigation to OPM (see Attachment 2, this supplement).
3.11. Interim Security Clearances. ASMs will coordinate interim clearances with IPO prior to
the commander granting an interim clearance. IPO will ensure all interim security clearance
requirements have been met and any potentially derogatory information is identified for the
 4                                             AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013


commander’s review. IPO may make recommendations to the subject’s commander concerning
eligibility. The subject’s commander will determine what is considered to be “favorable” when
determining whether to grant an interim security clearance. Commanders may grant interim
security clearances, through IPO, for Top Secret and Secret access to classified information
when the requirements within AFI 31-501, paragraph 3.11 have been met. Interim clearances
may be revoked at any time based on unfavorable information identified in the course of the
investigation. Interim clearances should be held to mission essential personnel only and strict
scrutiny should be used in granting interim clearances.
3.11.1. Interim Top Secret (TS) clearances must be based on all of the following:
3.11.1.1. IPO must verify a favorable NACI, NACLC, or ANACI has been completed. The
investigation is acceptable if there is no break in service over 24 months.
3.11.1.2. Unit commander or staff agency chief must conduct a review of the subject’s
Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ). Commanders must sign block 26 of the AF Form
2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, and annotate in the remarks section, “I have
reviewed subject’s PSQ and would like to grant an interim TS.”
3.11.1.3. ASM accomplishes the AF Form 2583 requesting local files checks of personnel
records including military personnel information file (PIF) and civilian official personnel file
(OPF), Security Forces, medical records (Public Health), and other security records as
appropriate. The AF Form 2583 is valid for up to 90 days after the last signature.
3.11.1.4. IPO must receive a confirmed receipt of a SSBI request submitted to OPM.
3.11.1.5. ASM submits package to IPO: AF Form 2583 (with all signatures) and a copy of
subject’s PSQ for JVS update. Once JVS is updated, IPO will notify ASM.
3.11.4. Interim Secret clearances must be based on all of the following:
3.11.4.1. Same procedures as for an Interim TS, except IPO must confirm subject has an “open”
investigation (NACLC or ANACI) on file with OPM.
3.11.6. For Civilians:
3.11.6.1. Former military members with a break in service of 24 months or less and SSBIs
within five years do not have to resubmit an SSBI for critical sensitive positions. Periodic
Reinvestigations will be submitted for SSBIs over five years old. SSBIs over seven years, will
require an initial SSBI instead of a periodic reinvestigation. Former military members and
current reserve and guard personnel occupying noncritical sensitive positions must submit an
Access National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACI).
3.11.6.2. Same procedures as for Interim TS and Secret, except ASMs must add pre-
employment waiver memorandum to the interim clearance package.
3.15. One Time Access. Document one time access by using AF Form 2583. Approving
authorities sign Item 26 when granting access. The ASM will maintain the AF Form 2583 until
the access is no longer needed. Complete an AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement,
when access is terminated. Document actions in JVS, when applicable.
3.24.1. The NACI is the minimum investigative requirement for access to restricted areas and IT
systems not involving access to classified information.
AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013                                                              5


3.24.8. Interim access to restricted areas may be granted to military, civilians, and contractors.
Use the same procedures for interim access as established in paragraph 3.11, of this instruction.
3.24.10. IPO submits the applicable background investigation to OPM for contractor personnel
requiring unescorted entry to restricted areas that don’t contain classified information. This only
applies to contractors who do not require access to classified information.
3.27.3. Commanders may recommend to the JBER Communications and Information Systems
Officer (CSO) that interim IT system access be granted. The CSO (673 CS/CC) may waive on
a case by case basis the investigative requirements for access to IT systems pending completion
of a favorable NACI, MBI, BI, NACLC ANACI, or SSBI after favorable review of the
completed personnel security questionnaire for the investigation. The CSO and the Unit
Information Assurance Officer (IAO) will confirm all interim IT system access requirements are
met prior to access.
3.27.3.7.2. IPO submits the applicable background investigations to OPM for contractor
personnel requiring access to unclassified IT systems. This only applies to contractors who do
not require access to classified information.
3.28. Periodic Reinvestigations (PR). PRs are required every five years for Top Secret and ten
years for Secret. The IPO are the designated authorized requester and submits all requests for
reinvestigations to OPM. The earliest IPO can submit a reinvestigation is 60 days from the
subject’s last close date.
3.30. (Added) . Contractor Suitability Determinations. Unit commanders will make
suitability determinations for contractors assigned to their unit who require a favorable
background investigation for contract performance. The unit is responsible for forwarding the
decision to OPM (via OPM Form 79A Report of Adjudicative Action form).
4.1. Prior Federal Civilian Investigations. Investigations previously conducted on civilian
employees are suitable and accepted for granting immediate access to classified information as
long as they are the same position sensitivity, not out of scope and the subject has not had a
single break in service more than 24 months.
4.1.1.3. CPF and Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) human resource office confirms with OPM
that a valid investigation is on file and notifies the CAF. HR can send a message or call CAF
customer service to request CAF order the investigation.
5.1.1. ASMs must maintain an OPM Portal/e-QIP account and JVS account in order to manage
the Personnel Security Program for their organization.
5.1.1.1. ASMs will produce a JVS personnel roster by the 10th of each month. The ASM will
verify all the information on the roster is correct and take actions to correct any discrepancies
such as indoctrinations, non-disclosure agreement (NDA), position sensitivity, and personnel
assigned.
5.1.1.2. (Added) . ASMs will produce a JVS PR report by the 10th of each month and notify
unit members within three duty days that they are due for a PR. ASMs will develop a tracking
system of individual’s notified to complete their e-QIP. ASMs will provide IPO with a copy of
the PR report with all annotations listed. ASMs will notify the commander and supervisor of
individuals who fail to meet their established suspense and initiate a Security Information File if
applicable.
 6                                             AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013


5.4. Request Procedures. The following are investigation request procedures
5.4.1. (Added) . ASMs determine what type of investigation to initiate based on the unit’s
monthly PR report or other applicable documents (mandatory top secret AFSC, assignment
Records on Individual Persons (RIP), position code on Unit Manning Document (UMD) and
checking JVS. NOTE: If subject will retire/separate within 12 months, do not initiate an e-QIP
request, call IPO for guidance.
5.4.2. (Added) . ASMs must conduct a Local File Check (LFC) using the AF Form 2583. Use
the LFC and ASM e-QIP checklist located on the 673 ABW/IPO SharePoint ® site located at
https://jber.eim.elmendorf.af.mil/673ABW/IPO/Personnel%20Security/Forms/AllItems.asp

%2dB4D7%2d16EC587CE0CA%7d to ensure proper e-QIP initiation.
5.4.3. (Added) . ASM will log into the OPM portal and link to the e-QIP agency
https://opmis.xsp.org/member/index.cfm and create an e-QIP initiation request for subject.
5.4.4. (Added) . ASM will notify subject via e-mail or in person of the initiation. ASM will
establish a deadline of 15 days or less and ensure subject understands how to access his/her e-
QIP account and complete his/her questionnaire. If subject breaks the ASM suspense, the ASM
will brief unit Commander and take action as appropriate. NOTE: Failure to complete security
paperwork is grounds for Security Information File (SIF) establishment in accordance with the
Department of Defense (DoD) adjudicative guideline Personal Conduct and AFI 31-501.
5.4.5. (Added) . Once subject submits their e-QIP for review, the ASM must conduct a quality
review of the e-QIP. If the e-QIP is filled out completely, the ASM will submit the e-QIP to IPO
for review/approval. If the form needs corrections, the ASM will reject the form back to subject
and notify subject of corrections needed.
5.4.6. (Added) . Once the ASM releases e-QIP to IPO, at that time the ASM must send the AF
Form 2583, ASM e-QIP checklist and any other applicable documents (assignment RIP, orders,
and so forth) to IPO. NOTE: The AF Form 2583 is only valid for 90 days from the last date it
was signed. IPO will not review/approve an e-QIP unless we have the documents stated above.
5.4.7. (Added) . IPO will review the e-QIP; if errors are found, it will be sent back to the
subject for corrections, if error free, the subject will be notified to schedule an appointment for
finger-printing and to sign the release forms, if applicable.
5.4.8. (Added) . Once IPO submits the e-QIP to OPM, IPO will update the Personnel Security
Questionnaire (PSQ) sent date in JVS and annotate submission on the hard copy of AF Form
2583. The AF Form 2583 will be placed in the ASMs box. ASMs must use the AF Form 2583
as a tracking tool and check JVS within 7-10 days to ensure subjects investigation has opened. If
not, ASMs must contact IPO. ASMs must periodically check JVS to ensure subject’s
investigation closes and gets adjudicated. If an investigation is open longer than 120 days or
pending adjudication longer than 60 days, the ASM must contact IPO for further guidance.
5.4.9. (Added) . ASMs will not sign off on Outbound Assignment Memorandums for
permanent change of station (PCS), unless subject’s investigation meets the PCS requirements or
the new investigation has been submitted (left the base) to OPM. If unsure, contact IPO for
AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013                                                              7


guidance. Unit members are not allowed to receive PCS orders until investigation requirements
have been met in accordance with the members assignment RIP.
7.1.2. All unit commanders will review the security access requirement/position coding
(SAR/PC) codes by 15 February every year for accuracy and document the results in a
memorandum (see Attachment 3, this supplement) and supply IPO with copy. All
authorization change requests (ACR) for SAR codes must be routed through IPO, Civilian
Personnel, and 11AF/CC, if applicable. Any changes to civilian positions require the unit to
follow-up with the civilian personnel office to ensure the position sensitivity gets updated on the
subject’s Position Description (PD) and updated in the Civilian Personnel Data System. The unit
is responsible for all routing of SAR code change requests. An example SAR code change
request memorandum is listed in Attachments 4 and 5, this supplement.
7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual
Exigencies. Home station commanders will coordinate this action with deployed commanders
before granting interim Top Secret access. Document interim Top Secret access by using the AF
Form 2583. Commanders sign Item 26 when granting interim access. The deployed member
will maintain the original AF Form 2583 for use at the deployed location and the home station
ASM will maintain a copy of the AF Form 2583. Access will be discontinued upon return to
home station by executing an AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement. NOTE: If
deployed location will not accept and interim or SCI access is required, the subject must be
submitted for a SSBI.
7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) is now called the JVS.
7.9.5.5. ASMs that have a secret clearance and have completed the JVS training (www.dss.mil)
in order to be given level 6 access. ASMs will “service” all unit members into their Security
Management Office (SMO). ASMs will “service” contractors assigned to integrated visitor
groups supporting their unit. ASMs will manage JVS within their unit by performing the
following actions: In/out process members, indoctrinate/debrief unit members (assign/remove
access level), execute and update SF 312, Non-Disclosure Agreement, if applicable, send/manage
visit notifications, monitor system notifications, maintain a personnel and PR report within the
last 30 days. NOTE: Debrief members within 5 duty days of permanent change of stations,
separation or retirement.
7.12.1. IPO, Civilian Personnel and Non-Appropriated fund HRs, identified by IPO letter, are
authorized callers to the DoD CAF.
8.2.1.4.1. (Added) . If access is suspended, an AF Form 2587 must be accomplished and
included in the Security Information File (SIF).
8.2.1.7. Once all pertinent information is obtained to close a SIF, the commander will request
closure of the SIF in writing to the CAF through the IPO within 120 days of SIF establishment.
Memorandum will include a recommendation whether to grant, reinstate, deny, or revoke
subject’s security clearance. If more time is needed, a SIF extension request memorandum must
be submitted to the CAF through IPO prior to the 120 day deadline.
8.2.2.1. ASMs provide guidance to commanders on SIF establishment. IPO is the OPR for Top
Secret and Secret security clearance SIFs; SSO is OPR for SCI access SIFs.
 8                                            AFI31-501_673ABWSUP 4 DECEMBER 2013


8.2.2.1.1. (Added) . When IPO becomes aware of potentially derogatory information, IPO will
notify the unit Commander via ASM to consider a SIF establishment. If the individual is SCI-
indoctrinated, the IPO will notify the servicing Special Security Office (SSO), who will in turn
notify subject’s commander.
8.2.3.1. (Added) . Unit Commanders, First Sergeants, and Staff Agency Chiefs must confer
with ASMs when derogative information arises and falls within the guidelines set forth in AFI
31-501, paragraph, 8.2.1.3.1, and DoD 5200.2-R, Department of Defense Personnel Security
Program, Chapter 2, paragraph 2-200.
8.2.3.2. (Added) . The ASM will provide IPO with a 60-day update in writing on the status of
the SIF and all supporting documents prior to final SIF closure letter from the Commander.
8.6.3. The ASM is the point of contact (POC) at the unit level and the IPO is the POC at the
Wing level.
8.7. Security Clearance Reinstatement. Submit requests through the IPO after 365 days from
revocation/denial.
10.4. (Added) . File Copy Personnel Security Questionnaires (PSQ). File copy PSQs must
remain under the control of the authorized requester (IPO). Once subjects PSQ is complete, IPO
will send PSQ file copy to subject for their records and destroy file copy. ASMs will not
maintain PSQ copies for unit personnel.
11.1.4.1. (Added) . Wing level IPO will review units’ personnel security program during
annual Information Protection Management Evaluation (IPME).
11.2. (Added) . Information Collections. No information collections are required by this
