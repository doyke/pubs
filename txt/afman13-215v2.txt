                                          Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. Scope and Purpose of this Manual. This manual provides instructions to aid USAF
Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) authorities supporting Airfield Operations (AO)
management in air traffic control (radar and control tower) facilities.
1.2. Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. Chief Controller (CCTLR).
        1.2.1.1. Manages the ATC facility and associated radar systems.
        1.2.1.2. Validates facility MVAC, MIFRAC, MSAW/LAAS suitability, and DVA/non-
        radar requirements in accordance with applicable directives.
     1.2.2. TERPS.
        1.2.2.1. Develops MVAC, MIFRAC, MSAW/LAAS, in accordance with this and other
        applicable guidance in coordination with CCTLR.
        1.2.2.2. Develops DVAs in accordance with this and other applicable guidance when
        requested by the CCTLR.
        1.2.2.3. Assists the CCTLR in the development of facility non-radar program in
        accordance with this manual and AFI 13-204 Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures
        and Programs.
        1.2.2.4. Provides data as required to assist the NCOIC, Airfield Automation Manager
        (NAAM) to develop adaptation, mapping, and MSAW at multi-sensor system locations.
        Note: All charts (MVAC, MIFRAC, MSAW, LAAS and DVAs) must be approved by
        the Major Command (MAJCOM) TERPS authority prior to use.
     1.2.3. Flight Inspection. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducts flight
     inspection of MSAW, LAAS, in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Order
     (FAAO) 8200.1, United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual. MSAW/LAAS checks
     are associated with the corresponding terminal radar system; therefore new/revised
     MSAW/LAAS charts do not require flight inspection prior to implementation.
     MSAW/LAAS inspections are a check of the system, not of the adequacy of specific
     sector/bin altitudes.
1.3. Waivers and Recommended Changes.
     1.3.1. Waiver Authority. HQ USAF/A3O and HQ AFFSA are the waiver authorities for this
     manual. All waivers will be submitted to HQ AFFSA/A3A (hqaffsa.a3a@us.af.mil)
     through the appropriate MAJCOM AO OPR for consideration. Note: Waivers to this
     manual will only be considered when deemed necessary for completion of assigned flying
     mission.
     1.3.2. Waiver Process.
        1.3.2.1. Use AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver, to request waivers to this
        manual for non-instrument criteria. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 5


     bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
     corresponding block number. In addition, units must submit an Operational Risk
     Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 90-
     803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools, or alternate risk mitigation
     procedures with all waiver requests.
        1.3.2.1.1. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) forwards the AF
        IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational Commander (SOC) (e.g., Operations
        Group Commander [OG/CC]) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
        coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA/A3A for final resolution. Note: If TERPS duties
        are accomplished at the MAJCOM, MAJCOM TERPS representatives must
        coordinate with the AOF/CC prior to submitting to the MAJCOM OPR for AO.
        1.3.2.1.2. To ensure a periodic revalidation of waiver requirements, HQ AFFSA
        normally grants AO waivers for two year periods.
        1.3.2.1.3. Waiver renewal requests must reach HQ AFFSA NLT 45 days prior to
        expiration.
     1.3.2.2. Use AF IMT 3980, Instrument Procedures Waiver, to request waivers to this
     manual for terminal instrument criteria. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
     bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
     corresponding block number. In addition, units must submit an ORM Assessment in
     accordance with AFPAM 90-803, or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all waiver
     requests. Note: AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures delegates MAJCOMs the authority
     to approve/deny AF IMT 3980 for terminal instrument criteria.
  1.3.3. Recommended Changes. Submit recommended changes to this manual through the
  MAJCOM OPR for AO to HQ AFFSA using AF Form 847.

                                           Chapter 2

        MINIMUM VECTORING ALTITUDE CHARTS (MVAC) AND MINIMUM
           INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES ALTITUDE CHART (MIFRAC)

2.1. General. MVACs and MIFRACs are developed and maintained by TERPS authorities as
directed by ATC facility management using the Chart Designer module of Global Procedure
Designer (GPD) software. MVACs and MIFRACs do not require flight inspection.
     2.1.1. Minimum Vectoring Altitude Chart. Establish MVACs in accordance with this
     chapter and FAAO JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, Chapter 3, Section 9,
     Other Displays as appropriate. The MVAC is used to determine the lowest useable
     Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) altitude at which an aircraft may be vectored and maintain
     clearance from obstructions, terrain and uncontrolled airspace in a radar environment.
Note 1. Changes in GPD to Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) or chart center location made
after chart construction will result in a condition where the chart cannot be restored.

Note 2. AF locations with TERPS responsibility and where terminal radar service is provided by
the FAA or host nation (e.g., a USAF Visual Flight Rules (VFR) control tower) are not required
to develop a MVAC; however, they are required to obtain a copy of the FAA or host nation
MVAC from the controlling facility for reference during instrument procedure development.

Note 3. TERPS functions required to develop MVACs shall obtain copies of the current MVAC
used by adjacent ATC facilities. Consider the adjacent ATC facilities MVAC when developing
the USAF chart to prevent excessive altitude changes between the two facilities’ adjoining
MVAC sectors.

Note 4. When developing MVACs for Digital ASR (DASR)/Standard Terminal Automation
Replacement System (STARS), enter the DASR magnetic variation (MV) of record for the
DASR, not STARS equipment. In most cases the DASR MV of record will be zero, but some
DASRs were installed with same MV as the airport. Either way, use the actual MV assigned to
the DASR. If unsure of the DASR’s MV of record, contact the appropriate radar maintenance.
     2.1.2. Definitions and chart types.
        2.1.2.1. Terminal MVAC. This chart supports those systems where radar data is
        provided by a feed from a single short range (terminal) ASR or DASR antenna. Develop
        terminal MVACs for legacy analog radars (GPN-12 and GPN-20) and mobile ASRs
        (MPN-14, MPN-25 and TPN-19), and DASR (GPN-30). Terminal MVAC rules may
        also be used for multi-sensor mosaic systems where radar data from a single terminal
        radar is selected or adapted. Develop terminal MVACs for a single-sensor terminal radar
        mode and for designated terminal areas where the area is adapted to utilize a single
        terminal radar. Three nautical mile (NM) lateral separation is provided from terrain and
        obstructions (sector buffer) within 40 NM of the ASR/DASR and 5 NM lateral separation
        is provided 40 NM and greater from the chart center. A terminal MVAC must be
        centered on the terminal ASR/DASR antenna in order for GPD to determine where to
        apply the increase in lateral separation to 5 NM. For a terminal area where ATC has the
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   7


     ability to switch from single-sensor to multi-sensor mode, an enroute MVAC must be
     developed. When operationally advantageous, both a terminal and enroute MVAC may
     be developed.
     2.1.2.2. Enroute MVAC. This chart supports those systems where radar data is provided
     by a feed from one or more long range (enroute) Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR)
     antennas, or a feed from more than one terminal radar. Develop enroute MVACs for
     multi-sensor mosaic systems such as Microprocessor En Route Automated Radar
     (MEARTS) or STARS, except for the adapted terminal area specified in paragraph
     2.1.2.1. When a terminal MVAC is developed for the terminal area or the single-sensor
     mode of a multi-sensor system, develop and maintain both terminal and enroute MVACs.
     Enroute MVACs are also required to provide backup for Center Radar Presentation
     (CENRAP) operations. Five NM lateral separation is provided from terrain and
     obstructions (sector buffer) regardless of the distance from the chart center or aerodrome.
     Chart center is not required to be at any set location, but is normally the center of
     assigned ATC airspace or the Airport Reference Point (ARP) of the primary airport.
     Enter into GPD Data Manager a ‘pseudo’ ASR (named ‘chrt_ctr’) within 5 NM of the
     center of the workspace; when this option is used, enter a magnetic variation of zero.
         2.1.2.2.1. When CENRAP is utilized as a backup to a terminal system separate
         terminal and enroute charts must also be developed.
         2.1.2.2.2. Facility managers may elect to develop a single enroute chart to support
         both normal and CENRAP operations to reduce complexity.
  2.1.3. Standard sector. A sector bounded by two bearings and two ranges (arcs) relative to
  chart center.
  2.1.4. Irregular sector. A more complex sector bounded by more than two bearings and two
  ranges relative to chart center.
  2.1.5. Polygonal sector. A sector defined by the World Geodetic System (WGS)-84
  coordinates of each corner (vertex). There is no limit to the number of sides to this type
  sector.
  2.1.6. Prominent obstacle sector. This is an “all buffer” sector intended to provide the
  required vertical and lateral clearance from a single, isolated, man-made obstacle. When a
  single, isolated, man-made obstacle causes the entire sector altitude to be higher than desired,
  a prominent obstacle sector may be established. A prominent obstacle sector may be
  contained within a single larger sector, or overlap several adjacent sectors and can be based
  on an obstacle that is outside the MVAC radius but within the buffer area of the sector.
     2.1.6.1. This sector type is only authorized to provide separation from an isolated, man-
     made obstacle that is significantly higher than surrounding terrain or obstructions (Figure
     2.1). Note: All obstacles inside the prominent obstacle sector, except those obstacles
     that fall within the horizontal accuracy of the obstacle upon which the prominent obstacle
     sector is based, are evaluated when determining the minimum altitude of the sector(s)
     surrounding or adjoining the prominent obstacle sector.

Figure 2.1. Application of Prominent Obstacle Sector without High Surrounding Terrain




        2.1.6.2. Prominent obstacle sectors cannot be used to provide separation from terrain
        features such as mountain peaks that may or may not have towers or antennas near the
        peak (Figure 2.2).

     2.1.7. Chart design.
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  9


     2.1.7.1. Determine which type chart (Terminal, Enroute, or both) is applicable based on
     paragraph 2.1.2 Establish MVACs irrespective of the flight-checked radar coverage in
     the sector concerned; they are based on obstruction clearance criteria and controlled
     airspace only. It is the responsibility of ATC to determine that a target return is adequate
     for radar control purposes. It is not relevant to MVAC development whether radar
     service in a specific area is provided using primary or secondary radar.
        2.1.7.1.1. For a Terminal MVAC, the area considered for obstacle clearance (chart
        radius) shall encompass the maximum range of the ASR primary radar and be
        extended to include all delegated airspace. This includes adjacent areas where control
        responsibility is assumed because of early handoff or track initiation. EXCEPTION:
        When developing a Terminal MVAC to support the designated terminal area of a
        multi-sensor system (paragraph 2.1.2), the area must only be large enough to include
        the entire terminal area to include the appropriate buffer area based on the distance
        from the ASR/DASR.
        2.1.7.1.2. For an Enroute MVAC, the area considered for obstacle clearance (chart
        radius) shall be large enough to include 20 NM beyond delegated airspace boundaries
        to include adjacent areas where control responsibility is assumed because of early
        handoff or track initiation. When developing an Enroute MVAC, ensure that “Radar
        has CENRAP display” is selected in the chart properties of GPD regardless of
        whether or not the chart is being developed for CENRAP operations to ensure the
        proper buffer size is constructed.
     2.1.7.2. To aid in determining the appropriate chart radius, delegated ATC airspace may
     be entered into GPD Data Manager as a new, unclassified airspace. (See GPD Operators
     Manual, Volume 1, paragraph 13.11.2).
     2.1.7.3. Define the chart properties. Specify whether the default terrain type for the chart
     is designated mountainous or non-mountainous in accordance with (IAW) Subpart B of
     14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) PART 95 in the Continental United States
     (CONUS). Outside the CONUS, review the appropriate host nation Aeronautical
     Information Publication ATC (AIP) or other applicable directives and comply with
     mountainous terrain designations. When the host nation has not explicitly defined terrain
     type designations, evaluate the topography of the area to determine if it is a mountainous
     area as defined by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (3000 feet of terrain
     elevation change within a distance of 10 NM). Additionally, check enroute charts (host
     and National Geospatial Agency (NGA)) to ascertain the required obstacle clearance
     (ROC) applied on air traffic service (ATS) routes and to off-route altitudes such as
     minimum off-route altitude (MORA) and off-route obstruction clearance altitude
     (OROCA). Make a determination which terrain type is appropriate and document the
     rationale in the chart’s user defined notes.
        2.1.7.3.1. When non-mountainous terrain is specified, 1000 feet of ROC will be
        applied as the system default. When mountainous terrain is specified, 2000 feet of
        ROC will be applied as the system default.
        2.1.7.3.2. Where lower altitudes are required in designated mountainous areas to
        achieve compatibility with terminal routes or to permit vectoring to an instrument
        approach, the default ROC may be reduced to 1000 feet for a Terminal MVAC, and
 10                                                    AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014


           1500 feet or 1700 feet for an Enroute MVAC as specified in FAAO 8260.3, United
           States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Volume 1, paragraph
           10.2.5. Annotate each sector with the statement “ROC reduced to less than 2000
           feet” in the appropriate sector defined notes.
       2.1.7.4. Specify the appropriate allowance for trees. This allowance will be applied
       uniformly to the entire terrain model. Where vegetation is sparse, or has variable heights,
       or when using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), it may be preferable to add
       assumptions for vegetation to the sector altitude rather than entering a tree allowance to
       the entire area. Document this choice in the designer notes. For additional guidance
       about vegetation (tree) allowance, see: AFI 11-230, paragraph 2.20.1.4.
       2.1.7.5. Specify standard, irregular, or polygonal sectors or any combination thereof
       based on the terrain, obstacle and airspace environment or other operational requirements
       (radar patterns, noise abatement areas, Special Use Airspace (SUA), etc.). Ensure sector
       coverage over the entire chart with no gaps between sectors. With the exception of a
       prominent obstacle sector, each sector’s boundary must adjoin, but not overlap, the
       boundary of each adjacent sector. In some cases it may be desirable to combine adjacent
       smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude. See
       Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4.
           2.1.7.5.1. Make each obstacle sector, except for prominent obstacle sectors, large
           enough to permit the efficient and safe vectoring of aircraft. Consideration should be
           given to aircraft performance and phase of flight.
           2.1.7.5.2. There is no limitation to what sector types may be developed for either a
           terminal or enroute MVAC. For example, polygonal sectors can be established for a
           terminal chart, and standard sectors can be defined for enroute. However, when
           MVAC sector design impacts MSAW or LAAS, consider low altitude alerting
           development limitations (i.e., MEARTS MSAW sectors can only be defined as
           convex polygons; Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) MSAW sectors can
           only be defined by range and bearing). Coordinate with ATC automation personnel
           when applicable to determine optimum sector design. MVAC sector design has no
           bearing on STARS MSAW.
       2.1.7.6. Specify sector altitudes no less than the minimum altitude. The selected altitude
       shall provide at least the required ROC above obstructions and terrain plus vegetation
       allowance in the sector, including buffer, and must be at least 300 feet above the highest
       floor of controlled airspace (FOCA) in the sector, not including buffer, rounded to the
       higher 100-foot increment.
Note 1: FOCA in mountainous areas or sparsely populated areas may be as high as 14,500 feet
Mean Sea Level (MSL). When the minimum altitude is higher than desired due to a high FOCA,
and when operationally required by ATC (i.e., routinely expected to vector aircraft in Class G
uncontrolled airspace), two sector altitudes may be established. Base one sector altitude on the
FOCA, and the second sector altitude on obstruction clearance.

Note 2. Do not add the vegetation allowance to the terrain values used for FOCA determination.
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    11


Note 3. When a restricted area is active and portions of the airspace within the restricted area are
designated on the VFR Sectional Chart as Class G (uncontrolled) airspace, the FOCA for MVAC
development purposes is the bottom altitude of the restricted area. When the restricted area
becomes inactive, the FOCA reverts to that charted on the sectional and a separate MVAC would
be required.
       2.1.7.7. Host nations may detail FOCA in their AIPs or other sources, however some
       compute this data differently than US criteria. Check with appropriate host nation
       personnel to ensure accurate information is applied. When a host nation does not
       designate the FOCA, controlled airspace shall be considered to begin at the surface.
       Document in the chart’s user defined notes and, when available, include a hard copy
       version of the host nation’s airspace description in the chart package.

2.2. Minimum Instrument Flight Rules Altitude Chart. The MIFRAC is used to determine
the lowest useable IFR altitude at which an aircraft may operate, receive the appropriate
Navigation Aid (NAVAID), and maintain clearance from obstructions, terrain and uncontrolled
airspace in a non-radar environment.
Note 1. Changes to GPD facility location data made after chart construction will result in a
condition where the chart cannot be restored.

Note 2. Minimum IFR altitudes are only intended for off-route and direct-route operations. The
Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA) or Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA) in a
particular area has no impact on MIFRAC design.
   2.2.1. Chart Design. Develop a MIFRAC centered on each omni-directional NAVAID
   (Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), VHF Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation
   (VORTAC), VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) or Non-directional Beacon (NDB)) used
   for non-radar operations.

       2.2.1.1. Do not exceed the standard service volume of the NAVAID. The existence of
       an expanded service volume has no bearing on MIFRAC design unless approved for an
       entire area or sector in which off-route operations are conducted. The area considered for
       obstacle clearance (chart radius) must be large enough to encompass the standard
       NAVAID service volume for the highest altitude where control responsibility is routinely
       assumed. The chart radius shall encompass all delegated airspace to include adjacent
       areas where control responsibility is assumed.
       2.2.1.2. Specify the default terrain type IAW paragraph 2.1.7.3 and the vegetation
       allowance IAW paragraph 2.1.7.4.
       2.2.1.3. MIFRACs must be associated with a MVAC in the chart properties unless
       operationally necessary (i.e., only non-radar operations are conducted). Develop the
       MVAC IAW paragraph 2.1 When defining the MIFRAC properties, associate the new
       MIFRAC with the MVAC.
       2.2.1.4. Specify standard or irregular sectors or any combination based on the terrain,
       obstacle, airspace environment, MVAC and other operational requirements (radar
       patterns, noise abatement areas, SUA, etc.). Ensure sector coverage over the entire chart
       with no gaps between sectors. Each sector’s boundary must adjoin, but not overlap, the
       boundary of each adjacent sector. In some cases, it may be desirable to combine adjacent
       smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude (Figure
       2.6). Note: There is no “Terminal” or “Enroute” distinction for MIFRACs; 5 NM lateral
       separation (buffer area) is provided from terrain and obstructions regardless of the
       distance to the facility.
       2.2.1.5. Specify only one sector altitude in each sector no less than the minimum altitude.
       This minimum altitude shall provide at least the required ROC above obstructions and
       terrain plus vegetation allowance in the sector, including buffer, and must be at least 300
       feet above the highest FOCA in the sector, not including buffer, rounded to the higher
       100-foot increment. The selected MIFRAC sector altitude shall not be lower than the
       highest Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) for that given area. Note 1: When
       determining MIFRAC sector altitudes, do not include MIFRAC sector buffer areas when
       evaluating the associated underlying MVAC sectors.
Note 2: CAUTION: Two or more MVA altitudes may affect a single MIFRAC sector.
Annotate each sector where paragraph 2.1.7.3.2 is applied with the statement “ROC reduced to
less than 2000” (Figure 2.7).
       2.2.1.6. Consider restrictions noted on flight inspection reports or Aviation Standards
       Information System (ASIS) datasheet (i.e., horizontal and vertical NAVAID limitations
       to include unusable sectors) when determining sector design and when specifying sector
       altitudes (Figure 2.5). For example, for the first restriction shown in Figure 2.5, the
       MIFRAC sector from R-130 clockwise to R-160 beyond 29 NM out to the chart radius
       shall not be lower than 9000 feet MSL regardless of the minimum altitude specified by
       GPD. When flight inspection designates that no coverage exists in an area, annotate the
       sector as unusable.

MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (MSAW) AND LOW ALTITUDE ALERTING
                        SYSTEM (LAAS)

3.1. General. MSAW and LAAS use visual and aural alarms to alert the controller when a
radar track target with mode C is at or below (MSAW) or below (LAAS) a predetermined safe
altitude. MSAW and LAAS automatically processes all tracked targets with an operational mode
C unless the controller exempts the target from processing. Manual validation of MSAW and
LAAS data is required whenever the MVAC is re-accomplished. MSAW and LAAS require
flight inspection.
Note 1. USAF PIDP systems do not have Approach Path Monitor (APM) capability; therefore
MSAW flight inspections at USAF PIDP locations consist of a General Terrain Map (GTM)
equivalent check only (no “preflight inspection plans” as outlined in AFMAN 11-225 United
States Standard Flight Inspection Manual are required).

Note 2. The term LAAS may not be understood by flight inspection personnel. When
coordinating with flight inspection, ensure that all correspondence clearly identifies the
requirement as a request for a check of the MSAW LAAS.
3.2. Minimum Safe Altitude Warning.
   3.2.1. Single-Sensor Analog Radar Systems. MAJCOMs submit original and change request
   packages to AFFSA/A4S at least 30 days prior to the effective date. Address correspondence
   concerning MSAW to: hqaffsa.a4s@us.af.mil or HQ AFFSA/A4S, 6500 S. MacArthur
   Blvd, Bldg 4, Room 114, Oklahoma City OK 73169.
   3.2.2. Develop PIDP MSAW using appropriate charts based on processor capability, terrain,
   and local operating needs. After the data is processed, AFFSA/A4S forwards copies of
   computer-generated charts to the facility. These charts represent the data included as part of
   the operational program for the facility. The TERPS authority shall review the printout for
   accuracy, then sign and date. When changes are required, the MAJCOM shall submit
   corrections to AFFSA/A4S.
       3.2.2.1. Step-by-step build of an MSAW package. Figure 3.1 shows the identification of
       runways, Class C/D airspace, along with final, intermediate and/or initial approach areas
       out to the descent point. Figure 3.2 identifies general MSAW areas based on MVAC
       sectors. Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4, Figure 3.5, and Figure 3.6, illustrate the azimuth and
       range identification process. Table 3.1 shows the PIDP MSAW Data Chart in the format
       AFFSA/A4S uses to prepare the operational program tapes.
       3.2.2.2. MSAW packages consist of an Approach Area Detail Map (AADM), a GTM,
       and a completed PIDP MSAW Data Chart. All MSAW map bearings and distances shall
       originate at the ASR antenna serving the airport for which the MSAW is being
       developed. All distances are in NM) and all bearings are magnetic from the ASR
       antenna.
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               19


     3.2.2.3. MSAW coverage shall encompass the ATC facility’s assigned airspace, special
     use airspace, and any areas where agreements with adjacent ATC facilities allow for the
     control of IFR aircraft. The MSAW GTM drawings must clearly depict these areas.
        3.2.2.3.1. Develop two maps centered on the primary airport’s ASR antenna; an
        AADM and a GTM.
            3.2.2.3.1.1. The AADM defines the MSAW circling area and approach courses
            for the primary airport. This map must be large enough (normally 0 – 15 NM) to
            include all approaches out to the applicable descent points (paragraph 3.2.2.4.3).
            3.2.2.3.1.2. The GTM defines all other MSAW areas (i.e., larger, less-detailed
            MVAC sectors). It extends from the edge of the AADM out to the limits of the
            areas defined in paragraph 3.2.2.3
     3.2.2.4. MSAW chart design.
        3.2.2.4.1. Draw all instrument final approach courses to airports within the facility’s
        assigned airspace (Figure 3.1).
        3.2.2.4.2. To define the MSAW exempt areas, draw a 4 NM circle around the ASR
        antenna at the primary airport, and around each satellite airport’s ARP. The altitude
        within these areas will be set at zero. MSAW exempt areas eliminate nuisance alarms
        from aircraft descending on final approach and from aircraft climbing after departure
        or low approach/touch and go.
        3.2.2.4.3. Plot the point on each instrument approach procedure where the aircraft
        descends below the MVA (Figure 3.1). This point shall be referred to as the descent
        point. Determine descent points as follows:
            3.2.2.4.3.1. Work outwards from the airport to find the first published fix with an
            altitude that is equal to or higher than the MVA. If this fix is within the MSAW
            exempt area (4 NM from ASR/ARP), no further action is required.
            3.2.2.4.3.2. When the fix falls outside of the MSAW exempt area and the altitude
            is equal to the MVA, the fix becomes the descent point. If the altitude at this fix
            is above the MVA, work inwards towards the Missed Approach Point (MAP)
            using the maximum authorized descent gradient until reaching the MVA. That
            point then becomes the descent point. If the descent point then falls within the
            MSAW exempt area, no further action is required.
        3.2.2.4.4. Take the following action when the descent point falls outside the MSAW
        exempt area:
            3.2.2.4.4.1. When the descent point falls between the MSAW exempt area and
            the Final Approach Fix (FAF):
               3.2.2.4.4.1.1. Draw all applicable instrument approach procedure final
               segments, including circling only procedures, (primary areas only) from the
               MSAW exempt area outward to the descent point.
               3.2.2.4.4.1.2. The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary
               final segment trapezoid(s) shall be no more than 100 feet below the lowest
               published Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for that runway, and shall
20                                                   AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014


               provide at least 200 feet clearance above terrain and obstructions.
            3.2.2.4.4.2. When the descent point falls between the FAF and the Intermediate
            Fix (IF):
               3.2.2.4.4.2.1. Draw all applicable final and intermediate segments, including
               circling only procedures, (primary areas only) from the MSAW exempt area
               outward to the descent point.
               3.2.2.4.4.2.2. The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary
               intermediate segment trapezoid(s) shall be no more than 200 feet below the
               lowest published FAF crossing altitude and shall provide at least 300 feet of
               clearance above terrain and obstructions. The altitude selected for MSAW
               processing within the primary final segment trapezoid(s) shall be IAW
               paragraph 3.2.2.4.4.1.2. above.
            3.2.2.4.4.3. When the descent point falls between the IF and the Initial Approach
            Fix (IAF):
               3.2.2.4.4.3.1. Draw all applicable final, intermediate, and initial segments,
               including circling only procedures (primary areas only), from the MSAW
               exempt area outward to the descent point.
               3.2.2.4.4.3.2. The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary
               initial segment trapezoid(s) shall be no more than 300 feet below the lowest
               published IF crossing altitude and shall provide at least 300 feet of clearance
               above terrain and obstructions. The altitude selected for MSAW processing
               within the primary intermediate segment trapezoid(s) shall be IAW paragraph
               3.2.2.4.4.2.2. The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary
               final segment trapezoid(s) shall be IAW paragraph 3.2.2.4.4.1.1
            3.2.2.4.4.4. For all other areas, the altitude selected shall be no more than 300
            feet below the MVA and shall provide a minimum of at least 700 feet above
            terrain and obstacles (the minimum is 1,700 feet in designated mountainous
            terrain). Note: When two MVA sector altitudes are established due to
            excessively high FOCA (paragraph 2.1.7.6, Note 1), the MSAW sector altitude
            will be based on the lowest MVA in the sector.
     3.2.2.5. MSAW sector data collection.
        3.2.2.5.1. Define the boundaries of each MSAW sector by two ASR bearings (start
        and stop) and by two ranges (start and stop). Depict all MSAW sectors as either pie-
        shaped, truncated pie-shaped, or circular around a point of origin. Using Figure 3.3.
        and Figure 3.6 as examples, draw bearings to encompass all areas identified in
        paragraph 3.2.1.4. Each bearing originates at the ASR antenna and extends to the
        range of the map being developed (AADM or GTM). Measure the angle of each
        bearing and label. Combine bearings to include/reduce irregularly shaped areas when
        necessary. Continuous sectors shall not cross the 0 degree bearing or the 360 degree
        bearing. Split sectors crossing either the 0 or the 360 degree bearing into two sectors;
        stop the first sector at the 360 degree bearing and start the second sector at the 0
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                 21


         degree bearing.    Bearings from the ASR shall be recorded in whole degree
         increments.
         3.2.2.5.2. Using Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.6 as examples, draw arcs (ranges) from the
         ASR antenna to encompass those areas identified in paragraph 3.2.2.4. Arc ranges
         shall be recorded to the nearest 0.25 NM. Note: Computer memory limitations
         restrict the number of azimuth and range boundaries to 32. Take appropriate action to
         remain within this number, but in no case will aircraft operate below the MVA
         without proper MSAW processing.
         3.2.2.5.3. Label the MSAW altitude for each sector.
     3.2.2.6. Transfer the range, azimuth, and altitude information to the PIDP MSAW Data
     Chart (Table 3.1) as follows:
         3.2.2.6.1. Starting with the zero degree bearing entered in the upper left corner of the
         azimuth block, continuing clockwise, enter selected bearings from both map scales
         (AADM and GTM) in ascending order. The stop bearing for one sector becomes the
         start bearing for the succeeding sector from left to right across the top of the form.
         3.2.2.6.2. On the left side of the chart, starting with zero range, enter each range
         selected in ascending order down the left side of the chart. The stop range for one
         sector is the start range for the next top to bottom down the left side of the form. The
         intersection of each start-stop bearing and start-stop ranges represents a sector. For
         each sector, enter the MSAW processing altitude IAW paragraph 3.2.2.4 in hundreds
         of feet MSL (e.g., 6 = 600 feet, 100 = 10,000 feet).
  3.2.3. Multi-Sensor (Mosaic) Digital Radar Systems.
     3.2.3.1. MEARTS. MSAW parameters are developed during initial site adaptation.
     TERPS personnel shall coordinate with the unit NAAM for revisions, and when making
     procedural changes to instrument approaches that may affect the APM (e.g., changes to
     fix crossing altitudes, approach minimums, addition/deletion of step-down fixes, etc).
     3.2.3.2. STARS MSAW. The applicable operations support facility (OSF) will develop
     STARS MSAW, GTM and APM during initial site adaptation. GTM will be constantly
     updated through the OSF. TERPS personnel shall coordinate with the unit NAAM when
     making procedural changes to instrument approaches that may affect the APM (e.g.,
     changes to fix crossing altitudes, approach minimums, addition/deletion of step-down
     fixes, etc.). There is no action required by the TERPS function when the GTM changes.

                   3.3. Low Altitude Alerting System.
                       3.3.1. LAAS associated with Digital Bright Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE).
                       Only develop LAAS for those DBRITE systems authorized to provide additional radar
                       functions beyond those normally allowed for certified tower displays IAW AFI 13-204
                       Volume 3 and FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. This is not applicable to DBRITE
                       systems deriving radar/automation data from a source with an operational PIDP MSAW or
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                               29


  an FAA equivalent system such as Automated Radar Terminal Systems (ARTS). These
  DBRITE systems process MSAW data exactly like an indicator of the associated system.
  Submit original and change request packages through the MAJCOM TERPS office in time
  for receipt by AFFSA/A4S at least 7 days prior to the effective date. Address email
  correspondence concerning DBRITE LAAS to: hqaffsa.a4s@us.af.mil or HQ AFFSA/A4S,
  6500 S. MacArthur Blvd, Bldg 4, Room 114, Oklahoma City OK 73169
  3.3.2. Develop LAAS using appropriate charts based on processor capability, terrain, and
  local operating needs. After the data is processed, AFFSA/A4S forwards copies of
  computer-generated 15 NM and 60 NM charts to the facility. These charts represent the data
  included as part of the operational program for the facility. The TERPS authority shall
  review the printout for accuracy, then sign and date. When changes are required, the
  MAJCOM shall submit corrections to AFFSA/A4S.
     3.3.2.1. DBRITE LAAS packages are developed in the same manner as MSAW, subject
     to equipment-specific radial/range restrictions (Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.6). Figure
     3.1 shows the identification of runways, Class C/D airspace, along with final,
     intermediate and/or initial approach areas out to the descent point. Figure 3.2 identifies
     general LAAS areas based on assigned airspace and MVA sectors. Figure 3.3 through
     Figure 3.6 illustrate the azimuth and range identification process.
     3.3.2.2. DBRITE LAAS packages consist of an AADM, a GTM, and a completed AF
     IMT 3646, DBRITE Low Altitude Alerting System (LAAS) Data Submission Form. All
     LAAS maps shall be centered on the ASR antenna serving the airport for which the
     LAAS is being developed. All distances are in NM and all bearings are magnetic from
     the ASR antenna.
     3.3.2.3. DBRITE LAAS coverage shall encompass the ATC facility’s assigned airspace,
     special use airspace where ATC controls IFR aircraft and any areas where agreements
     with adjacent ATC facilities allow for the control of IFR aircraft. The LAAS GTM
     drawings must clearly depict these airspace boundaries/areas.
     3.3.2.4. Develop two maps centered on the ASR antenna: an AADM and a GTM.
         3.3.2.4.1. The AADM defines the LAAS circling areas and approach courses to the
         primary airport. This map must be large enough (normally 0 – 15 NM) to include all
         approaches out to the applicable descent points (paragraph 3.3.2.5.4)
         3.3.2.4.2. The GTM (normally 15 – 60 NM) - defines all other LAAS areas (i.e.,
         larger, less-detailed MVAC sectors). It covers the airspace from edge of the AADM
         out to the limits of the areas defined in paragraph 3.3.2.3., not to exceed 60 NM from
         the ASR antenna.
     3.3.2.5. DBRITE LAAS chart design.
         3.3.2.5.1. Draw all final approach courses to airports within the facility’s assigned
         airspace (Figure 3.1).
         3.3.2.5.2. To define the LAAS exempt areas, draw a 4 NM circle around the ASR
         antenna at the primary airport, and around each satellite airport’s ARP. The altitude
         within these areas will be set at zero. LAAS exempt areas eliminate nuisance alarms
30                                                AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014


     from aircraft descending on final approach and from aircraft climbing after departure
     or low approach/touch and go.
     3.3.2.5.3. Plot the point on each instrument approach procedure where the aircraft
     descends below the MVA (Figure 3.1). This point shall be referred to as the descent
     point. Determine the descent point as follows:
        3.3.2.5.3.1. Work outwards from the airport to find the first published fix with an
        altitude that is equal to or higher than the MVA. If this fix is within the LAAS
        exempt area (4 NM from ASR/ARP), no further action is required.
        3.3.2.5.3.2. When the fix falls outside of the LAAS exempt area and the altitude
        is equal to the MVA, the fix becomes the descent point. If the altitude at this fix
        is above the MVA, work inwards towards the MAP using the maximum
        authorized descent gradient until reaching the MVA. That point then becomes the
        descent point. If the descent point then falls within the LAAS exempt area, no
        further action is required.
     3.3.2.5.4. When the descent point falls outside the LAAS exempt area take the
     following action:
        3.3.2.5.4.1. When the descent point falls between the LAAS exempt area and the
        FAF/Precise FAF (PFAF), draw the final approach primary trapezoid from the
        LAAS exempt area outward to the descent point. Note: Assign an altitude for
        LAAS processing within the primary trapezoid that is at or above the lowest
        published MDA for that runway (rounded nearest 100 foot), and that is at least
        200 feet above terrain and obstructions.
        3.3.2.5.4.2. When the descent point falls between the FAF and the IF, draw the
        final and intermediate primary trapezoids from the LAAS exempt area outward to
        the descent point.
            3.3.2.5.4.2.1. Assign an altitude for LAAS processing within the final
            primary trapezoid IAW paragraph 3.3.2.5.4.1.1
            3.3.2.5.4.2.2. Assign an altitude for LAAS processing within the intermediate
            primary trapezoid that is no lower than 100 feet below the lowest published
            FAF crossing altitude for that runway, and that is at least 300 feet above
            terrain and obstructions.
        3.3.2.5.4.3. When the descent point falls between the IF and the IAF, draw the
        final, intermediate and initial primary trapezoids from the LAAS exempt area
        outward to the descent point.
            3.3.2.5.4.3.1. Assign an altitude for LAAS processing within the final and
            intermediate primary trapezoid IAW paragraph 3.3.2.5.4.1.1 and 3.3.2.5.4.2.2.
            3.3.2.5.4.3.2. Assign an altitude for LAAS processing within the initial
            primary trapezoid that is no lower than 200 feet below the lowest published IF
            crossing altitude for that runway, and that is at least 300 feet above terrain and
            obstructions.
        3.3.2.5.4.4. For all other areas, assign an altitude for LAAS processing that is no

            lower than 200 feet below the MVA, and is at least 700 feet above terrain and
            obstacles (1,700 feet in designated mountainous terrain). Note: When two MVA
            altitudes are assigned to the same sector (paragraph 2.1.7.6., Note 1), the LAAS
            sector altitude will be based on the lowest MVA in the sector.
     3.3.2.6. LAAS sector data collection.
        3.3.2.6.1. Define the boundaries of each LAAS sector by two ASR bearings (start
        and end) and by two ranges (start and end). Depict all LAAS sectors as either pie-
        shaped, truncated pie-shaped, or a circle around the point of origin (ASR). Using
        Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5 as examples, draw bearings to encompass all areas
        identified in paragraph 3.2.3.1.5. When able, combine bearings/ranges to reduce the
        number of bearings and ranges used. Continuous sectors shall not cross the 0 degree
        or 360 degree bearings. Split sectors crossing either the 0 or the 360 degree bearing
        into two sectors; stop the first sector at the 360 degree bearing and start the second
        sector at the 0 degree bearing. The sector end bearings must be at least 8 degrees
        from the start bearings and specified in whole degree increments.
        3.3.2.6.2. Using Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.6 as examples, draw arcs (ranges) centered
        on the ASR antenna to encompass areas identified in paragraph 3.3.2.5. On the
        AADM, arc ranges shall be recorded to the nearest .25 NM. On the GTM, arc ranges
        shall be recorded to the nearest whole NM. The sector end range must be at least 4
        NMs from the start range and specified in no less than .25 NM increments.
        3.3.2.6.3. Up to 128 sectors may be defined using azimuth and range start – end
        combinations. On complicated charts, it may be necessary to make compromises to
        conserve bearings and ranges from the ASR antenna. The geographic boundaries of
        each altitude warning sector in the map are defined by two azimuth boundaries and
        range boundaries (range start and range end). The map for a given site may include
        up to 32 different azimuth boundaries and up to 32 different range boundaries. Each
        azimuth boundary value or range boundary value may be used as the start or stop
        azimuth limit for a number of different sectors. No more than 128 sectors can be
        defined. Take appropriate action to remain within this number, but in no case will
        aircraft operate below the MVA without proper LAAS processing.
        3.3.2.6.4. Label the LAAS processing altitude for each sector and transfer to the AF
        IMT 3646.
     3.3.2.7. AF IMT 3646 completion instructions:
        3.3.2.7.1. Section 1- FACILITY. On the first line, enter the four-letter ICAO
        identifier for the ASR facility (e.g. KTIK). On the second line, enter the unit and
        location. Enter the name and Defense System Network (DSN) phone number of the
        person submitting the information. Enter the name and DSN phone number of the
        person at the MAJCOM level who reviewed the package.
        3.3.2.7.2. Section 3 - ANTENNA DATA. Enter the latitude and longitude of the
        radar antenna to the nearest arc second. Enter the slave angle (MV of record) of the
        radar antenna to the nearest 1/10th degree and indicate antenna magnetic variation
        east or west.

        3.3.2.7.3. Section 5 - TRANSITION ALTITUDE. Enter the transition altitude in
        hundreds of feet above MSL.
        3.3.2.7.4. Section 6 - BASELINE ALTITUDE. Enter the lowest MSL altitude that
        activates LAAS processing. This is the default LAAS processing altitude for areas
        not otherwise specifically defined. The baseline altitude is the lowest safe altitude for
        all areas not included in a programmed map segment, or zero if there are expected
        significant areas where low altitude alert alarms would activate for legitimate reasons,
        but are not of concern. Entering an altitude equal to or lower than the actual surface
        elevation in a segment means the LAAS alarm will never activate in that area (i.e.
        low altitude training areas and nearby airports not serviced by the facility).
        3.3.2.7.5. Section 8 - SEGMENT DATA. For ease of future data modification, enter
        each identified segment in some order. Identify the exact order by segment number
        on all maps and drawings submitted with the LAAS package. Begin with 001 and
        proceed sequentially to the system limit of 128.
           3.3.2.7.5.1. Azimuth Start. Enter the segment-starting azimuth (also called the
           “left” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The start azimuth is the one the plan
           position indicator (PPI) sweep passes first as it rotates from the ASR magnetic
           360 bearing in a clockwise direction. Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north.
           3.3.2.7.5.2. Azimuth End. Enter the segment-ending azimuth (also called the
           “right” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The end azimuth is the azimuth the
           PPI sweep passes last as it rotates from the ASR magnetic 360 bearing in a
           clockwise direction. This value must be at least 8 degrees greater than the
           segment start azimuth.
           3.3.2.7.5.3. Range Start. Enter the segment range closest to the antenna to the
           nearest 0.25 NM increment.
           3.3.2.7.5.4. Range End. Enter the segment range farthest from the antenna to the
           nearest 0.25 NM increment. This range must be at least 4 NM greater than the
           segment start range.
           3.3.2.7.5.5. Altitude. Enter the lowest altitude at which an aircraft may operate
           without activating the LAAS. Enter this data in hundreds of feet (e.g., enter 2800
           as 28). Enter an altitude of 25,500 or above as 255 (the system maximum).
  3.3.3. LAAS Associated with Mobile and Selected Fixed Radar Systems. The following
  information pertains only to LAAS associated with AN/GPN-12, AN/GPN-20, AN/TPN-19,
  or AN/MPN-14 radars.
     3.3.3.1. Function. This LAAS feature operates identically to the DBRITE LAAS except
     that only one code can be inhibited.
     3.3.3.2. Data Submission. Packages include AADM and GTM, and a completed LAAS
     Data Collection Sheet for Mobile and Selected Fixed Radar Systems (Table 3.2). Take
     the following action for:
        3.3.3.2.1. AN/GPN-12 and AN/GPN-20 Fixed facilities (i.e., Aviano AB, Dobbins
        ARB, Incirlik AB, Soto Cano AB, and Thule AB). Provide approved data to radar
        maintenance personnel for input into the 980B computer.

        read-only memory (PROM) chips. Submit data for mobile facilities at least 30 days
        prior to the desired effective date.
     3.3.3.3. Data Collection and Package Development. Draw LAAS charts for these
     systems in the same manner as for DBRITE LAAS except the chart design must account
     for different bearing and range restrictions based on equipment limitations.
     3.3.3.4. Complete LAAS Data Collection Sheet for Mobile and selected Fixed Radar
     Systems (Table 3.2) as follows:
        3.3.3.4.1. SITE NAME: Enter the four-letter ICAO identifier and name for the

        by sector number on all maps and drawings submitted with the LAAS package.
        Begin with 001 and proceed sequentially to the system limit of 128.
           3.3.3.4.5.1. Range Start. Enter the sector range closest to the antenna to the
           nearest whole NM.
           3.3.3.4.5.2. Range Stop. Enter the sector range farthest from the antenna to the
           nearest whole NM. This range must be at least 2 NM greater than the sector start
           range.
           3.3.3.4.5.3. Azimuth Start. Enter the sector-starting azimuth (also called the
           “left” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The start azimuth is the one the PPI
           sweep passes first as it rotates from the ASR magnetic 360 bearing in a clockwise
           direction. Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north.
           3.3.3.4.5.4. Azimuth Stop. Enter the sector ending azimuth (also called the
           “right” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The stop azimuth is the azimuth the

                       DIVERSE VECTOR AREA DEVELOPMENT

4.1. Diverse Vector Area.
   4.1.1. When requested by IFR facility management or host nation aviation authorities, the
   TERPS authority will use GPD, FAAO 8260.3, Volume 4 and the following guidance to
   develop a DVA. EXCEPTION: When an operational advantage can be gained, manual
   application of FAAO 8260.56, Diverse Vector Area (DVA) Evaluation is authorized. Prepare
   a DVA package regardless of the diverse departure obstacle assessment results.
   Coordination with IFR facility management and the AOF/CC will be documented by
   obtaining their signatures on the AF IMT 4342, Approach/Departure Signature Page.
   MAJCOM TERPS review and approval is required prior to DVA implementation. DVAs do
   not require flight inspection. Note: When the USAF provides IFR air traffic services to an
   airport that the FAA has TERPS responsibilities, contact the appropriate FAA instrument
   procedure designer for a list of the non-Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) penetrations
   of the diverse departure assessment area for each runway. These results will include the
   location, description, and elevation of all 40:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS)
   penetrations. USAF TERPS will use this information when developing the DVA.
4.2. DVA Design Methods:
   4.2.1. Establish sectors with or without a climb gradient where radar vectoring is allowed.
   Include the horizontal accuracy for the penetrating obstacle(s) when establishing sector
   boundaries.
      4.2.1.1. Prohibited areas within the DVA shall be depicted on a radar video map.
      4.2.1.2. Areas outside of established prohibited areas within the DVA are “free vector
      areas”.
      4.2.1.3. Ensure sector boundaries are established at least 3 NM from the penetrating
      obstacle when the penetrating obstacle is less than 40 NM from the radar antenna.
      4.2.1.4. Ensure sector boundaries are established at least 5 NM from the penetrating
      obstacle when the penetrating obstacle is 40 NM or more from the radar antenna.
      4.2.1.5. Sectors with penetrations to the OCS, other than low, close-in obstacles, that
      encompass the departure runway or in areas where the departing aircraft will be vectored
      immediately after departure will disqualify that runway from DVA consideration unless
      paragraph 4.2.3. is applied and the climb gradient eliminates the need to isolate the
      penetrating obstacle (paragraph 4.2.2).
Note: The DVA must accommodate a climb to 400 feet above the departure end of runway
(DER) prior to any turns.
   4.2.2. Isolate the penetrating obstacle(s). Include the horizontal accuracy for the penetrating
   obstacle(s) when establishing the boundary of the buffered area.
      4.2.2.1. When isolating obstacles, the boundary of the buffered area shall be established
      3 NM or 5 NM when the obstruction is 40 NM or more from the radar antenna.
AFMAN13-215V2 6 FEBRUARY 2014                                                              37


       4.2.2.2. When operating with multi-sensor mosaic radar systems or with a CENRAP,
       apply a 5 NM buffer area around all penetrating obstacles throughout the entire DVA.
   4.2.3. Develop a climb gradient (CG). CGs associated with the DVA shall be calculated
   IAW AFI 11-230, paragraph 1.16.6. Design the DVA to eliminate vectoring through
   multiple sectors that require different CGs.
4.3. When the DVA is complete, provide the radar facility manager all required
restrictions to include a statement that turns prior to the aircraft reaching 400 feet above
DER are not authorized. Include the dimensions of the entire DVA; describe each DVA sector
and buffered area and any required CG. Provide the MSL height of any isolated obstruction plus
the obstacle accuracy. The facility manager will use this information to describe the DVA
adequately to ATC in a facility operating instruction.

IFR facility CCTLR. Non-radar programs will be developed/maintained in concert with the
supporting TERPS authority. This TERPS authority may be located locally or at the MAJCOM.

Note 1. Most TERPS designers are not certified in the IFR facilities they support and may have
no practical experience working in a non-radar environment. However, they do have the ability
to plot NAVAIDs, holding patterns, radials, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) points, fixes,
transfer of control points, airspace boundaries, arcs about NAVAIDs, and airspace to be
protected, etc., as requested by facility management.

Note 2. See Figure 5.1 for an example of a non-radar drawing and AFI 13-204 Volume 3 for
non-radar board content.
5.2. IFR facility CCTLR. During the non-radar program development, the IFR facility CCTLR
shall contact the TERPS authority and request support.
5.3. IFR Facility Manager will supply the following as applicable:
   5.3.1. Depiction of any current non-radar board.
   5.3.2. Current non-radar program details.
   5.3.3. List of requested holding fixes, to include minimum and maximum holding altitudes.
   5.3.4. List of departure routings (NAVAID radials) and or Standard Instrument Departures
   (SIDs) for each runway, to include altitudes and associated transfer of control points.
   5.3.5. List of arrival routings (NAVAID radials) or Standard Terminal Arrival Routes
   (STARs) for each runway, with required altitudes and any associated transfer of control
   points.
   5.3.6. List of instrument procedures required to support non-radar operations for each airport
   and runway.
   5.3.7. List of NAVAIDs required to support the non-radar program.
   5.3.8. Airspace description (Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) delegated, adjacent ATC
   facility and SUA).
   5.3.9. Copies of Letters of Agreement with adjacent facilities that describe actions during
   radar outages.

5.4. TERPS Authority (Unit or MAJCOM). When requested by the IFR facility CCTLR,
TERPS will plot:
   5.4.1. On appropriate scale aeronautical chart (electronically or manually) the requested non-
   radar routings (radials, arc, SIDs, approaches, missed approach segments, etc.). Note: When
   plotting radials, use the MV assigned to the NAVAID.
   5.4.2. The largest holding templates (or patterns for ICAO/North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) as requested by ATC (maximum altitude) to display the airspace to be
   protected.
      5.4.2.1. When drawing the airspace to be protected around a holding pattern, do not
      include a secondary area.
      5.4.2.2. When drawing the airspace to be protected around a holding pattern, use GPD
      shape files, plastic holding templates, or manually draw the appropriate
      templates/patterns IAW FAAO 7130.3, Holding Pattern Criteria, or PANS-Ops/NATO
      criteria.

  5.4.3. Apply FAAO JO 7110.65 to display airspace to be protected for arrival/departure
  routings, and arcs about NAVAIDs.
  5.4.4. Assist ATC to determine DME points where lateral separation stops and vertical
  separation must exist.
  5.4.5. Assist ATC to validate or develop diverging courses for non-radar routings as
  required.
  5.4.6. Validate routings, altitudes and holding against the MAJCOM approved MIFRAC for
  each NAVAID.
  5.4.7. Assist ATC to de-conflict the airspace to be protected around non-radar routings,
  holding patterns, approaches, missed approaches, and SIDs as requested by facility
  management.
     5.4.8. Clearly label all NAVAIDs, radials (magnetic), arcs about the NAVAIDs, fixes
     (include coordinates), holding airspace with minimum and maximum authorized altitudes,
     and airspeed, as required.
     5.4.9. Forward the completed scale drawing to the requesting IFR facility CCTLR.
