This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all B-52H ACC units. This addendum applies to Air National Guard (ANG) or Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members.   Maintain records created as a result of
prescribed processes in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), available from the Air Force
Portal at the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) link. Contact supporting
record managers as required. Send recommended changes or comments on AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A4F52, 230 E. Flight Line Rd., Suite
132, Langley AFB VA 23665-2787, and send information copies to the applicable OCR.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changed
system/subsystem from EVS to FLIR. New qualifying notes added for Combat Network
Communications Technology (CONECT) equipped aircraft. Deleted notes from systems.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC)
aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
2                                            AFI 21-103_ACCSUPADMD 10 FEBRUARY 2009

     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
     code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
     across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
     applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and
     therefore it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are
     applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded
     aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to
     their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report
     status using only the FSL and TNG columns , and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would
     determine and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded
     aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual
     aircraft assignment code.
