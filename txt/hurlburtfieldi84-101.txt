    craft may be signed out from 16 MXG or designated Airpark crew chief. If special tools or equipment
    are needed, contact 16 EMS/MXM at least 48 hours in advance so equipment can be made available
    for use (i.e., air compressors, maintenance stands, etc).

9. Preparation Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles.
    9.1. Information. This instruction covers the requirements for the preservation and preparation of air-
    craft for exhibition or storage by an Air Force organization within the USAF Museum System
    (USAFMS), and by federal, state, municipal and civilian museums borrowing aircraft from the
    USAFMS. The term aircraft, as used in this instruction, refers to all aerospace vehicles.
       9.1.1. These requirements are designed to return and/or maintain the aircraft in as near original
       configuration as possible, and to render them suitable for display.
       9.1.2. Generally, all reconditioning, repairing, and refinishing will be accomplished in accordance
       with current Air Force directives and instructions. However, when it is unfeasible to return items
       to a completely serviceable condition, they will be processed so as to be suitable for display pur-
       poses. Deviations from this standard must be requested in writing and approved by the USAFM.
    9.2. Security requirements. Aircraft on display and undergoing preparation for display shall be kept
    secure from unsupervised personnel. The aircraft will be maintained with sufficient security to insure
    it is protected from vandalism and theft, or unauthorized removal of components.
       9.2.1. Any theft or unauthorized removal of components shall be immediately reported to the
       security forces. This must be followed by a report of the incident investigation within 30 days to
       the AF Museum.
       9.2.2. To prevent unauthorized entry, all canopies, doors, access hatches, and access plates,
       except for one entrance door, will be permanently sealed shut by any of the following methods:
           9.2.2.1. Bolting through the hatch to internal crossbars placed across the opening. These can
           be fabricated from sturdy steel strapping, channel iron, or other appropriate material.
           9.2.2.2. Riveting the door securely to the jamb section.
           9.2.2.3. Attaching hasps internally and securing with an inside padlock.
           9.2.2.4. Whatever method is employed to secure doors and access hatches, the crevices
           remaining will be filled with caulking compound or elastic putty to prevent internal damage
           from weather.
           9.2.2.5. The access door (that is not permanently sealed) must be secured by a hasp, welded or
           riveted in place. Multiple locks (two or three) are preferable, each with a separate key or com-
           bination. This technique will reduce the possibility of unauthorized access, but will provide
           emergency entrance for authorized personnel.
    9.3. Maintenance Records.
       9.3.1. Whenever items are permanently removed, the removal and disposition of such items shall
       be annotated on the AF Form 3581.

        9.16.3. USAFM/MUS will require certification of completion of the radiation survey when an air-
        craft is initially acquired for display, with periodic monitoring and radiation logs maintained in
        accordance with AFI 84-103, Chapter 9.
        9.16.4. Explanatory information regarding the radiation survey is provided in AFI 84-103, Chap-
        ter 9 and Attachment 4. Further questions may be directed to USAFM/MUR (Radiation), (513)
        255-6930 or DSN 785-6930.
        9.16.5. Surveys of aircraft displayed at civilian or non-USAF-operated museums will be accom-
        plished by the USAF Museum Radiation Safety Officer, or an authorized USAF representative.
        9.16.6. Following the required removal by USAF Museum radiation personnel of certain radioac-
        tive components from USAF owned aircraft and artifacts displayed at civilian or non-USAF oper-
        ated museum, no radioactive components will be reinstalled by the borrowing museum. This
        prohibition also applies in cases when the aircraft arrives at the borrowing museum with a certifi-
        cation of no radioactivity (such as from the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center
        (AMARC)). If radioactive items are found to have been reinstalled during later inspections, the
        loan will be terminated.
     9.17. Final Preparation.
        9.17.1. Entire aircraft will be cleaned and refinished as required.
        9.17.2. Secure aircraft by attaching tie down restraints to surface attaching points and to a major
        structural part of the item. Tie-down restraints, including surface attaching points, should be of
        sufficient strength to withstand the expected wind condition for the locality.
        9.17.3. Place aircraft on a concrete or asphalt surface of sufficient strength to support its weight.
        This will not apply if the recipient, with the permission of the USAFM, has mounted the aircraft
        on a pylon attached to the aerospace vehicle’s structural members.
        9.17.4. Aircraft inside or outside that are normally supported on pneumatic tires should be placed
        on display stands of sufficient height to provide approximately 1 inch of clearance between the tire
        and the display surface; tires should be inflated and checked to maintain normal tire shape, or tires
        should be filled with a permanent tire filling compound which will maintain their inflated shape
        and support the weight of the item for the life of the casing.
        9.17.5. Remove all antenna wires that could serve as a bird roost.
        9.17.6. Install bird-proofing on all aircraft openings, including intake and exhaust covers.
