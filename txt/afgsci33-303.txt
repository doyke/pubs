     1.6.2. Ensure accurate, thorough and complete coordination of the required action. Develop
     responses in a timely manner. High-quality staff work should be the fundamental goal, while
     at the same time meeting the established suspense date.
     1.6.3. Work through the chain of command to the directorate executive officer or designated
     workflow manager.
     1.6.4. Responsible for ensuring the package is tracked from cradle-to-grave using
     administrative procedures within this instruction. AOs are responsible for the action until the
     package is approved, coordinated and signed by the required office and the package has been
     submitted and received by the originator. All intermediate and follow-on personnel must
     keep the AO informed of status by listing the AO in the courtesy copy (Cc:) block of all e-
     mails. If AOs are required to hand-carry written staff packages through the coordination
     process, ensure the executive officers are kept aware of the status of the package.
     1.6.5. Ensure the directorate chain of command and DS, as appropriate, receive task status
     updates throughout the tasking process.
     1.6.6. If OCR, review task and work with the OPR for required inputs and coordination.
     1.6.7. Ensure staff packages are error-free, grammatically correct and written and staffed
     IAW this instruction.
     1.6.8. Request suspense extensions for tasks internal to AFGSC by working through the
     chain of command to the appropriate authority within the tasking directorate.
     1.6.9. Request suspense extensions for tasks external to AFGSC by working through the
     chain of command to AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
     1.6.10. Ensure coordination with each staff office that has a functional interest, regardless of
     whether or not they are included in the tasker as OCRs.
     1.6.11. Oversee, monitor and coordinate with all OCRs throughout the duration of the
     tasking process.
     1.6.12. Coordinate with outside organizations, when appropriate. Note: AOs are authorized
     to engage with AOs from outside organizations, but are not permitted to officially task
     outside organizations.
1.7. All Personnel:

                                            Chapter 2

                               INFORMATION WORKFLOW

2.1. Workflow Process.
   2.1.1. To the greatest extent possible, all information workflow (the process of tasking,
   coordinating and staffing packages) within AFGSC is accomplished electronically (see
   Chapter 8 for specific instructions). The AFGSC Tasker Workflow is the central point for all
   taskers, and is the tasker inject point for the MAJCOM.
   2.1.2. Organizational Workflow E-Mail Addresses.
      2.1.2.1. All AFGSC directorates and other staff offices, AFGSC NAFs, and AFGSC
      wings shall have a central workflow address.
      2.1.2.2. The format for organizational workflow address is:
          2.1.2.2.1. (Unit) .TaskerWorkflow@us.af.mil / (Unit).Workflow@us.af.mil.
          2.1.2.2.2. (Unit) .TaskerWorkflow@base.af.smil.mil/(Unit).Workflow@base.af.s
          mil.mil
          2.1.2.2.3. Some examples are: AFGSC.TaskerWorkflow@, 8AF CS Workflow@,
          20AF.TaskerWorkflow@, 341 MW Workflow@, 509 BW.TaskerWorkflow@
   2.1.3. IAW AFMAN 33-152, all official correspondence shall be sent to and from Global
   Address List (GAL) organizational workflow e-mail addresses.
   2.1.4. The workflow process can originate from any level, however, only directors, deputy
   directors, executive directors or O-6s (or the NAF/CCs, NAF/CVs or NAF/CSs) sign staff
   summary sheets (SSSs) going to the Command Section.
   2.1.5. AFGSC Tasker Workflow assigns, tracks, sends updates and receives inputs/replies
   for AFGSC suspenses through TMT or the AFGSC Tasker Workflow organizational
   mailboxes (NIPRNet and SIPRNet). However, TMT is the primary task management tool
   and shall be utilized first and to the fullest extent possible. Each directorate and special staff
   down to at least the branch level must have a TMT organization and an e-mail workflow
   mailbox on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet for receiving, transmitting and responding to taskers.
   NAFs and Wings must have an e-mail workflow account on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet for
   receiving, transmitting and responding to taskers. Once TMT is implemented throughout the
   command, the NAFs and Wings must have a TMT organization and e-mail workflow
   mailboxes. All packages/correspondence will include the task number.
      2.1.5.1. All unclassified packages requiring AFGSC Command Section action are routed
      using      the      Task       Management       Tool   (TMT)       or      NIPRNet
      (AFGSC.TaskerWorkflow@us.af.mil).
      2.1.5.2. All classified packages are processed via SIPRNet except those exempted in
      paragraph 3.5. All classified tasks are tracked using TMT and managed using SIPR
      Outlook.
2.2. Task Process.
AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013                                                                  11


  2.2.1. Tasks or action items may be initiated in various ways and may result from several
  sources such as meetings, conferences, etc.
  2.2.2. The primary source for internal AFGSC tasks and action items is at the direction of
  the CC, CV, DS, DSK, CCC or the Commander’s Action Group (CCX).
     2.2.2.1. Directorates/special staffs are responsible for taking action on these items and
     for delivering appropriate responses in a timely manner to the originating offices.
     2.2.2.2. Assigned POCs (AOs or designees) are responsible for all actions and
     coordination required for meetings and events and work directly with CCX, Protocol
     (DSP), Public Affairs (PA) and other directorates as necessary.
  2.2.3. Other sources for internal AFGSC tasks and action items may be initiated at different
  levels as follows:
     2.2.3.1. AFGSC directors may initiate tasks that require direct support and action from
     other directors to complete (e.g., A5/8 working an acquisition issue that requires input
     and coordination from A1 for manpower inputs, A3 for operations and training inputs and
     A4/7 for aircraft or weapons maintenance issues). This is known as MAJCOM 2-letter
     coordination.
     2.2.3.2. AFGSC division chiefs may initiate tasks that require direct support and action
     from other division chiefs to complete; also known as MAJCOM 3-letter coordination.
     Three-letter tasks flow from one division workflow to another division workflow. Task-
     originating division chiefs may also directly send 3-letter tasks through OCR directorate
     workflows to ensure relevant divisions are tasked.
     2.2.3.3. AFGSC branch chiefs may initiate tasks that require direct support and action
     from other branch chiefs to complete; also known as MAJCOM 4-letter coordination.
     Four-letter tasks flow from one branch to another branch workflow. Task originating
     branch chiefs may also directly send 4-letter tasks through OCR branch workflows to
     ensure relevant branches are tasked.
     2.2.3.4. NAF/CCs (or designees) may initiate tasks that require support and/or
     coordination from AFGSC Directors and above. These tasks will flow to the AFGSC
     Tasker Workflow via TMT or the Organizational workflow NIPRNet/SIPRNet e-mail
     workflow account.
     2.2.3.5. Tasks to organizations external to AFGSC (including AFGSC NAFs and below)
     must originate from a directorate workflow or higher. Tasks requiring NAF/CC signature
     must originate from the AFGSC Tasker Workflow, the CV or CC. The below paragraphs
     define signature authority requirements.
         2.2.3.5.1. NAF/CC signature: Signed out by AFGSC Tasker Workflow, CV, or CC.
         2.2.3.5.2. NAF/CV signature: Signed out by task-originating director or higher.
         2.2.3.5.3. NAF/director signature: Signed out by task-originating deputy director or
         higher.
         2.2.3.5.4. NAF/division chief signature:   Signed out by task-originating division
         chief or higher.

           2.2.3.5.5. Wing CC signature: Signed out by task-originating deputy director or
           higher.
           2.2.3.5.6. Wing CV(or lower) signature: Signed out by task originating division
           chief or higher.
           2.2.3.5.7. Other MAJCOM/director signature: Signed out by task originating deputy
           director or higher.
           2.2.3.5.8. Other MAJCOM/division chief signature: Signed out by task originating
           division chief or higher.
           2.2.3.5.9. HQ/AF/director: Signed out by AFGSC Tasker Workflow, CV, or CC.
           2.2.3.5.10. HQ/AF/division chief signature: Signed out by task originating deputy
           director or higher.
           2.2.3.5.11. HQ/AF/branch chief signature: Signed out by task originating division
           chief or higher.
           2.2.3.5.12. AOs will not send taskers to the NAFs or Wings or other MAJCOMs.
2.3. Suspense Dates.
   2.3.1. Use the general guidelines illustrated in Table 2.1. to determine suspense dates.
   However, not all taskers will fit these guidelines. Suspense dates may be shortened or
   modified as needed based on availability of the CC or CV and based upon Headquarters Air
   Force (HAF)/higher headquarters (HHQs) requirements. If the levied suspense will not
   allow for complete coordination, AFGSC Tasker Workflow will attempt to either coordinate
   an extension or provide specific guidance in the task of what areas of the task can be
   streamlined/curtailed in order to meet the suspense. Tasks which require a response within
   48 hours will be followed with a phone call to confirm notification.

   2.3.2. Extensions. Request for extension with rationale explaining why the extension is
   needed should be made immediately if a suspense date is unreasonable or cannot be met. Do
   not wait until the last minute or after the suspense deadline. Request extensions in writing
   (e-mail), through TMT, or direct verbal communication with the tasking authority/OPR.
      2.3.2.1. External tasks. The directorate OPR (Director, Deputy Director, Executive
      Officer or designee) submits a request to AFGSC Tasker Workflow, DDS or DS as early
      as possible but NLT 24 hours prior to the established suspense date using the TMT
      suspense extension capability, e-mail or telephone.        Only under extraordinary
      circumstances are extensions approved inside of 24 hours from the suspense date. The
      AFGSC Tasker Workflow, DDS or DS has the authority to terminate/deny the extension
      request. If the extension request is approved by the external agency, AFGSC Tasker
      Workflow will inform the command OPR.
      2.3.2.2. Internal tasks. The command OPR makes a request to the internal task
      originator as early as possible, but NLT 24 hours prior to the established suspense date.
      OCRs may request an extension to the OPR, who will, in-turn, make the request to
      AFGSC Tasker Workflow or the task originator. However, the OPR can grant an
      extension to an OCR if they can still meet the overall task suspense. If the extension is
      approved, the suspense date will be amended.
2.4. Handling and Processing Sensitive or Classified Information.
   2.4.1. Communication is considered sensitive when referring to negative or adverse
   information on an individual or program (e.g., personnel or inspector general (IG) actions)
   when it contains personal identifying information (PII), or when it contains operations
   security (OPSEC) related material. Likewise, if there is a requirement for only certain
   individuals to view the information, it should be considered sensitive and marked “private” in
   TMT or not processed within TMT. Packages considered sensitive will be staffed IAW
   governing regulations and have the appropriate markings and classifications.
   2.4.2. For staffing classified information, AOs will use the paper-based process or electronic
   staff summary sheet (eSSS) workflow process on SIPRNet (up to SECRET). For internal
   coordination of SECRET tasks, create and use a folder in “Z-Drive\Internal Tasker Coord.”
   For staffing TOP SECRET or Special Compartmented Information (SCI) tasks, organizations
   with the proper information technology (IT) infrastructure (e.g., JWICS) can provide the AO
   with POC contact information, else the paper-based staffing process is required. All
   personnel shall comply with security classification instructions, markings and safeguarding
   according to DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401. But remember, electronic staffing is the
   preferred method.
 14                                                            AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013


   2.4.3. No classified information or correspondence will be processed over NIPRNet or TMT.
   OPR/OCRs will be notified via TMT for packages coordinated via SIPRNet. SIPRNet tasks
   will be tracked through TMT by referencing the task number and location on the SIPRNet.
   Following completion of a SIPRNet task, the AO will annotate in TMT that the SIPRNet task
   was completed. TMT will be the source system for OPR and OCR suspensing, and will take
   precedence over any suspense disagreement with non-TMT communications.
2.5. Staff Packages that Require Rework.
   2.5.1. All packages which require rework will be returned with instructions to the OPR.
   2.5.2. When the Command Section returns a package for additional work or coordination, it
   will go to the directorate workflow for action. It may include an amended suspense date
   (depending on the criticality of the information required) or retain the original suspense date.
   The AO should expedite and route the changes through the chain of command to AFGSC
   Tasker Workflow, with the original annotated material to include any guidance
   memorandums and additional suspense notes.
2.6. Staffing Direct Liaison Authority (DIRLAUTH) within AFGSC.
   2.6.1. AFGSC has a unique advantage to collaborate and produce decision quality products
   at a pace much faster than most MAJCOMs and the AF at large. The clear focus of AFGSC
   and its lean six-wing structure enables quick responses to operational, programmatic and
   installation needs.
   2.6.2. The standard rule is to flow AFGSC taskings to and through the NAFs. This allows
   the NAFs to quickly provide a consolidated weapons system and/or force answer. The NAFs
   can further task one or more wings for the exact data required while keeping an agile
   information flow.
   2.6.3. To further optimize the AFGSC information advantage, staffing DIRLAUTH in
   specific mission areas is authorized. The NAFs are not manned, nor designed, like the
   headquarters (HQ) structure with some functional specialties clearly residing at the wing
   level.
      2.6.3.1. When tasking wings, all tasks must be sent to the each Wing’s tasker workflow
      and tasked IAW paragraph 2.2.3.5. Never directly task a group or squadron. All tasks
      must flow through the wing’s tasker workflow. The applicable NAF workflow (8AF CS
      Workflow, 20 AF Tasker Workflow) must be included as a Cc:/info addressee.
      Responses to AFGSC from wings/wing units should include their respective NAF
      workflow as a Cc:/info addressee.
      2.6.3.2. The specific mission areas authorized for DIRLAUTH are:
          2.6.3.2.1. A1 (8 AF specific): Civilian Personnel, Education, Equal Opportunity,
          Manpower, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-Day Management,
          Promotions, Readiness, Services and Special Trophies/Awards.
          2.6.3.2.2. A1 (20 AF specific): Services. All personnel-related tasks shall go to 20

                                COORDINATION PROCESS

3.1. Coordination: Coordination gives affected organizations an opportunity to contribute to
and comment on packages. AFGSC uses top-line (director or higher), bottom-line (division or
lower), and horizontal coordination (between directorates). Note: It is inappropriate for a branch
or division to officially task a director or deputy director. Task at the appropriate level IAW
Section 2.2.
3.2. Requirements.
   3.2.1. Begin the coordination process by identifying other staff offices (within and outside
   the OPR directorate) which have an interest in the package. These will be the OCRs for the
   task. The process must allow enough time for thorough coordination. OCRs respond
   directly to the OPR, who, in turn, adjudicates and resolves comments from all coordinating
   officials.
   3.2.2. Once staff coordination is complete, the OPR routes the package through the
   organization’s chain-of-command as appropriate.
   3.2.3. When a consolidated response is required, the primary OPR should contact OCRs,
   establishing an internal suspense and provide a SSS for coordination, if applicable.
   3.2.4. Staff packages going to the Command Section must show all coordination
   accomplished as well as opposing views (e.g., view of others).
   3.2.5. Do not give OCRs an option of non-response. OCRs must provide an answer to a
   tasker, regardless if they concur or non-concur. In other words, when assigning an OCR to a
   task, you cannot say, “Non-response to subject task shall be considered concurrence.”
   3.2.6. The OPR AO is responsible for ensuring formal coordination is accomplished with
   each directorate having a functional interest.
   3.2.7. For tracking purposes, all staff packages must reference the Task Management Tool
   (TMT) task number. All associated e-mails must reference the TMT task number and title in
   the subject line and any other subject information the OPR deems necessary.
3.3. Bottom-Line Coordination: The AO conducts bottom-line coordination (division or lower
levels) with sections that have a connection with the task. AOs will perform this task as one of
the first steps in the coordination process, resolving differences before seeking top-line
coordination. Coordination with organizations outside AFGSC is frequently required. It is
recommended AOs expedite coordination by making simultaneous distribution to all
coordinating offices.
3.4. Top-Line Coordination: After bottom-line coordination, the AO conducts top-line
coordination with those 2-Ltr offices that have a connection with the task. Top-line coordination
is defined as directorate level or above coordination. All top-line coordination packages will
include the consolidated adjudicated CRM of bottom-line coordination as a tab. Note: AOs
should not send SSSs or other staff packages to directorates or equivalents without first
accomplishing bottom-line coordination. However, there are occasions when sufficient time is
not available to conduct a separate bottom-line coordination. When this occurs, it is permissible
 18                                                           AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013


to conduct a top-line coordination only. This could also be referred to as a simultaneous bottom-
line/top-line coordination. But remember, although permissible, simultaneous coordination
should be the exception, not the norm.
3.5. Joint Capabilities Integration Document System (JCIDS) / Information and Resource
Support System (IRSS).
   3.5.1. AFGSC/A5PP is the focal point for all JCIDS and IRSS documents.
   3.5.2. The management, routing and coordination of JCIDS documents are delegated to
   AFGSC/A5PP.
   3.5.3. Coordination of JCIDS requires that AOs have specialized training to interpret the
   relevance of various JCIDS documents to potential stakeholders within their directorate, and
   also to submit comments to HAF via specialized JCIDS software programs. In order to
   streamline the internal coordination of JCIDS documents, the routing of JCIDS documents
   does not require an associated TMT task.
   3.5.4. IRSS is the AF-designated portal used to coordinate, upload, and store JCIDS
   requirements documents. AFGSC/A5PP is responsible for receiving and sending out
   applicable documents to all directorates for review. This review will be conducted via
   normal SIPRNet e-mail. In order to meet restrictive timelines in the JCIDS process, the
   TMT will not be used for IRSS review notification and tracking. Due to the specific focus
   and high volume of JCIDS documents, this process will be used in lieu of TMT in order to
   streamline IRSS document coordination with previously identified and trained directorate
   stakeholders.
   3.5.5. AFGSC/A5PP will request review of subject document via SIPRNet. A SIPRNet e-
   mail will be sent to directorate workflows directing them to the appropriate IRSS document.
   A CRM will be provided for every IRSS document. All CRM inputs with substantive or
   critical comments must be reviewed and endorsed by the appropriate O-6 or 3-Ltr.
   3.5.6. All directorates will be given approximately 21 days to review and respond. This is a
   formal HAF suspense. No response by the stated suspense will be indicated as “Copy
   Provided” for that agency for reporting purposes to AF/A5PP. This is a nominal timeframe
   and may be shortened, as needed, by AF/A5PP direction.
3.6. Nuclear Enterprise Management Tool (NEMT).
   3.6.1. The NEMT employs a “Strategy-to-Task” hierarchy that traces all levels of data
   (findings, analyses, action plans, measurements, etc.) from the Air Force nuclear enterprise
   (strategic level) all the way down to action plans and recommendations (tactical level) and
   back again. NEMT users are able to trace connections and interdependencies of any or all of
   the previous levels of information within the Air Force nuclear enterprise.
   3.6.2. DS.
       3.6.2.1. AFGSC’s NEMT manager.
       3.6.2.2. Conducts NEMT task reviews through monthly (DS chaired) and quarterly (CV
       chaired) working group meetings.
   3.6.3. AFGSC/DSK / AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013                                                                 19


     3.6.3.1. Receives initial task assignment from AF/A10.
     3.6.3.2. Assigns NEMT tasks to directorate NEMT Representatives (Team Leads).

     OPR.
     3.6.3.4. Ensures assigned NEMT tasks are updated at least once every 30 days for every
     task where AFGSC is designated as OPR.
     3.6.3.5. Administers NEMT using the AF/A10 NEMT Rules of Engagement (ROE).

     3.6.6.2. Administers NEMT using the AF/A10 NEMT ROE.
  3.6.7. NEMT Principles / Task Authority.
     3.6.7.1. The CV is the task authority for all tasks generated from Nuclear Operations
     Boards (NOB), Nuclear Issues Resolution and Integration (NIRI) Board and from any
     source not specifically identified or assigned to a principle.
     3.6.7.2. The A3 is the task authority for all tasks generated from Nuclear Working
     Groups (NWG).
     3.6.7.3. The A6 is the task authority for all tasks generated from NC3 Working Groups.

   PERSONALIZED LETTERS, OFFICIAL MEMORANDUMS, STATIONERY AND
                         ELECTRONIC MAIL

4.1. AFGSC Templates: Always use the current AFGSC templates. Template documents are
available on both SIPRNet and NIPRNet. Templates can be found on the both the NIPRNet and
SIPRNet shared drives in the AFGSC Action Officer Tools folder, at the AFGSC SharePoint site
(unclass only) in the Action Officer Tools folder and in TMT.
4.2. Font Sizes.
   4.2.1. Use Times New Roman, 12-point black for the font type, size and color for all
   Command Section correspondence. Eleven-point font is acceptable in order to keep a memo
   to one page.
   4.2.2. When creating ready-to-send (RTS) e-mails for the CC, CV or DS, create them using
   HTML format and Century Schoolbook font 12. This only applies for RTS e-mails created
   using Outlook (NIPRNet or SIPRNet). When using TMT to create proposed e-Mails, use the
   TMT default format.
   4.2.3. When creating e-mails to the CC, CV or DS, create them using HTML format and
   Century Schoolbook font 12.
4.3. Personalized Letters.
   4.3.1. See AFMAN 33-326 and AFH 33-337.
   4.3.2. Address the letter at the left margin, spacing three lines below the Command Section
   return address element. Begin the salutation one line space under the receiver’s address. The
   salutation is normally in the format “Dear Xxxxx.” The complimentary close is normally in
   the format “Sincerely.” The complimentary close is typed one line space below the text of
   the letter and three spaces to the right of page center. Both the salutation and the
   complimentary close are typed without punctuation.
4.4. Official Memorandums: Follow the guidance in AFMAN 33-326 and AFH 33-337.
4.5. Letterhead: Use AFGSC color letterhead with the “Deter and Assure” tagline for
correspondence signed by the CC, CV or DS.
4.6. Star Stationery: This stationery is reserved for the CC and CV. Only use if the Command
Section has specifically levied this as a requirement.
4.7. Dating Memorandums and Letters: Date retirement letters on the day of the retirement
ceremony (contact the commander’s or vice commander’s secretary (CCS or CVS) for
exceptions). Hint: It is a good idea to check with your executive officer/secretary to see when
the CC/CV will be available to sign your letter. All memorandums printed on regular, preprinted
letterhead will not be dated. The letters will be date stamped on the day they are signed.

             PACKAGES FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND SECTION

8.1. General Information.
   8.1.1. Guidelines. Specific guidelines for the preparation and staffing of packages are
   provided in this chapter. Packages that do not comply with the guidelines will be returned to
   the directorate for correction. Helpful hints and a checklist for putting together a good staff
   package are contained in Attachments 3 and 4.
   8.1.2. Transmittal documents. AFGSC uses AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, as the
   primary transmittal document to prepare and staff packages for members of the Command
   Section. Anything presented to the AFGSC commander, vice commander, director of staff or
   a director that requires their approval, concurrence or signature must be presented in the form
   of an eSSS or SSS with the eSSS being the preferred method. There are some instances,
   however, when informal transmittal documents such as a Buck Slip or an Item of Interest
   (IOI) are appropriate to use in lieu of the Staff Summary Sheet. For example, a Buck Slip
   could be used to request signature on a civilian time card. An IOI could be used for
   answering a CC or CV question posed during a staff meeting.
   8.1.3. For SSS directions, see paragraph 8.2.2. For Buck Slip directions see paragraph 8.2.3.
   For IOI directions see paragraph 8.2.4.
   8.1.4. Classified and Sensitive Information. See paragraph 2.4.
   8.1.5. Font Requirement: See paragraph 4.2.
   8.1.6. Templates are available at the AFGSC SharePoint site, the AFGSC Shared Drive, and
   within TMT.
8.2. Preparation of Transmittal Documents.
   8.2.1. Transmittal documents are brief, to the point and limited to one page if possible. They
   should stand alone and include sufficient information to provide the DS, CV and CC a
   thorough understanding of the issue, background, and recommendation. Subject titles are
   short and classified information is avoided in the title. Note: Use of acronyms and
   abbreviations in the subject line, without spelling them out even though it is the first time
   they are used, is acceptable.
      8.2.1.1. Content. Follow the guidelines outlined in AFH 33-337, AFMAN 33-326, and
      this instruction to develop the appropriate content.
          8.2.1.1.1. Funding issues. All command section packages and briefings involving
          current or future funding issues must include a concise statement on how the initiative
          will be funded. The package must outline how the current year requirement will be
          financed, how the requirement will be accomplished in the financial plan, and what
          program objective memorandum (POM) impact will be incurred, if any.
          8.2.1.1.2. Signature. Transmittal documents for all packages to members of the
          command section are signed/approved by the director/deputy director or equivalent.

         8.2.1.1.3. Changes. If it is necessary to make significant changes to packages, a new
         package is prepared for re-coordination and includes an explanation of why the
         package is being re-coordinated, a summary of the changes and a copy of the original
         SSS. The original and revised packages are kept for record by the AO.
         8.2.1.1.4. Content changes. Authority for making content changes resides with the
         OPR director. Changes are clearly and unambiguously annotated by the director.
         Each directorate, division, and branch may grant appropriate individuals the authority
         for making content changes. In cases involving major changes or changes to policy
         or guidance, returning the task to the OPR for reconciliation may be required.
         8.2.1.1.5. Comments. If a reviewer concurs with the overall action of a SSS, but has
         additional comments for clarification, then those comments are returned to the OPR
         for consideration on the SSS. The OPR should indicate disposition of the comments
         either in the discussion section of the SSS or in a CRM. If the comments constitute
         only administrative changes (spelling, punctuation, grammar, or format), the reviewer
         annotates the CRM and continues the coordination process.
         8.2.1.1.6. Directorate-Level Non-Concurrence. The non-concurring organization
         prepares a memorandum or CRM stating reasons for non-concurrence and sends it
         with the staff package to the originating directorate. The reviewer writes in ink, “See
         Memo” in the coord block. If the non-concurrence cannot be resolved, the
         originating directorate notes the reason for non-concurrence in paragraph four of the
         SSS, View of Others.
         8.2.1.1.7. Pen and ink changes. Any document that is destined outside AFGSC must
         be error free without pen and ink changes. Pen and ink changes are acceptable at the
         discretion of the DS, CVS, CVE, CCS, CCE, CV or CC for documents remaining
         within the headquarters.
         8.2.1.1.8. Corrections/rework. All packages that require corrections and/or rework
         are returned with instructions to the AO. Corrected/reworked packages are expedited
         and staffed back through the chain of command with the original annotated material
         to include any guidance memorandums and additional notes.
  8.2.2. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS). The SSS is used to introduce, summarize,
  coordinate or obtain approval and/or signature on packages for members of the command
  section. Follow AFH 33-337, AFMAN 33-326, and the instructions in this AFGSCI to
  prepare the staff summary sheet, tabs, and accompanying correspondence.
     8.2.2.1. Staff Summary Sheet (SSS).
         8.2.2.1.1. Electronic: The preferred format for processing staff summary sheets
         (SSS) is electronic using TMT or e-mail. For unclassified tasks, use TMT. For
         classified tasks, draft the eSSS in the body of a SIPRNet the e-mail and attach tabs.
         Use the text-based eSSS format depicted in Atch 5.1 (A.5.1) for both unclassified
         (TMT) and classified (SIPRNet e-mail) tasks. Number the tabs and attach them in
28                                                           AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013


         numerical order. Number the tabs as 1. Title 2. Title, etc. See attachment A.5.1 for
         example numbering.
         8.2.2.1.2. Paper/Hard Copy: Templates are available at the AFGSC SharePoint site,
         the AFGSC Shared Drive, and within TMT.
     8.2.2.2. All SSSs must have the following paragraph headings.
         8.2.2.2.1. 1. PURPOSE: To provide a simple statement describing the purpose of
         package. For example: “Obtain AFGSC/CC signature on Tab 1” or “CSAF directed
         MAJCOM/CC coordination on the New START implementation guidelines (Tab 1).”
         8.2.2.2.2. 2. BACKGROUND: Why is the package needed? For instance, “AFI-
         XXX requires annual recertification of X by AFGSC/CC” or “HHQ requested X.”
         8.2.2.2.3. 3. DISCUSSION: Be succinct. If subparagraphs are required, do not
         indent. Place all paragraphs, subparagraphs, signature blocks and tabs flush left.
         8.2.2.2.4. 4. VIEW OF OTHERS: Explain concerns of others that represent a
         dissenting or opposing view to the recommended course of action. If there are no
         opposing views, then indicate with “N/A.” If too lengthy, give a snapshot here and
         then reference tab(s) for lengthy inputs from any directorates.
         8.2.2.2.5. 5. RECOMMENDATION: What you recommend the person on the
         bottom of the coordination line do. For instance, “AFGSC/CC sign letter at Tab 1” or
         “AFGSC/CC approve implementation of COA 1.” The recommendation section must
         align with the purpose and should be the action you want the final reviewer to
         accomplish.
     8.2.2.3. Tabs. All tabs (with the exception of the original tasker) listed at the bottom of
     the SSS must be referred to in the body of the SSS. The tab order is as follows:
         8.2.2.3.1. Tab 1: Actionable. If more than one, the next actionable document will be
         Tab 2, and so on.
         8.2.2.3.2. x: Supporting. All supporting documents such as CRM, SSS showing
         coordination, etc., are included as tabs and listed in the order they are referred to in
         the SSS.
         8.2.2.3.3. x: Authority/Reference. All authority/reference documents are included as
         tabs and listed in the order they are referred to in the SSS. Note: Do not provide
         entire documents such as AFIs. Provide and highlight only the specific portion of the
         AFI that is applicable.
         8.2.2.3.4. x: Incoming letter, e-mail, directive, or other document, if any, that
         prompted the preparation of the SSS. This is often referred to as the “Original
         Tasker”.
  8.2.3. Buck Slip. The Buck Slip is a short, informal transmittal document used by directors
  or equivalents on packages that provide information to members of the command section and
  do not require decision.
     8.2.3.1. Headers. All Buck Slips must have the following headers. Each header must
     have text or “N/A.”
AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013                                                                   29


          8.2.3.1.1. BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front (A quick “down and dirty” of the issue.)
          8.2.3.1.2. Discussion: Discuss the issue with details and enough basic information to
          provide a good understanding of the issue before looking at the supporting
          documentation.
          8.2.3.1.3. Recommendation: What you want the responsible party to do (sign,
          approve, concur, info only, etc.)
          8.2.3.1.4. Font: Times New Roman 12
   8.2.4. Item of Interest (IOI). The Item of Interest is an informal transmittal document used
   by directors or equivalents on packages that provide responses to questions or requests for
   information made by the CC, CV, DS, Director, etc. The IOI is typically one-page. It
   provides a summary of an event or position and may include attachments with relevant
   background information. The package is sent via e-mail from the director to the CC or CV
   without review by the command section staff. Provide a courtesy copy of all IOIs to the
   AFGSC Tasker Workflow with the exception of “Eyes Only” packages. If the IOI is in
   response to a formal task, include the task number in the subject line. Font: Century
   Schoolbook 12.
8.3. Coordination of Packages.
   8.3.1. Process. All coordination must be complete prior to submitting to the AFGSC Tasker
   Workflow for staffing to the Command Section. If the package is substantively changed
   during the coordination process, route back through the chain of command for coordination
   prior to submitting to the AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
   8.3.2. Time requirements. See Table 2.1. If a package requires immediate staffing through
   the Command Section, then, the director, OPR or AO should be physically present to answer
   questions from the CC, CV and/or DS.
   8.3.3. Levels. Coordination is commensurate with the signatory of the SSS. See paragraphs
   2.2.3. and 3.1. through 3.4.

                   TASK MANAGEMENT TOOL (TMT) GUIDELINES

9.1. TMT (https: //tmt/afgsc.af.mil): AFGSC standard tool for conducting task management.
9.2. Task Responsibilities.
   9.2.1. AFGSC Tasker Workflow will assign the directorate OPR and directorate OCR(s).
   9.2.2. Taskers to the NAFs, Wings or other MAJCOMs must originate from the AFGSC
   Tasker Workflow, a Directorate Workflow, or Special Staff Office Workflow. AOs will not
   send taskers to the NAFs or Wings or other MAJCOMs. See Section 2.2. for specific details
   and tasking authorities.
   9.2.3. OPRs:
       9.2.3.1. Assign OCRs, give them a suspense date, and clearly state what is expected.
       This could be in addition to the OCRs assigned by the DS or AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
       9.2.3.2. Ensure SSS provided for command section coordination meets AFGSC
       requirements.
       9.2.3.3. Draft proposed e-mail for the final task approver/releaser (if required).
   9.2.4. OCRs are required to accomplish the assigned task by the suspense date.
9.3. Sending Packages to AFGSC Tasker Workflow for Command Level Coord using
TMT. (Use these TMT commands)
   9.3.1. Complete Tasker: When Tasker Workflow initiates the task.
   9.3.2. Lateral Coord: When the tasker was initiated by someone other than AFGSC Tasker
   Workflow and requires command section signature or approval.
   9.3.3. Hand-Off Draft: When the creator of the task does not have sufficient position
   authority to task other organizations.
   9.3.4. Cancel: When the task has been made in error or is overcome by events (OBE) before
   completion.
9.4. TMT and Non-TMT Users.
   9.4.1. Only AFGSC and 8 AF have TMT capability.
   9.4.2. 20 AF, 90 MW, 91 MW, 341 MW, 2 BW, 5 BW, 509 BW, 576 FLTS and
   AFGSC/MEO do not have TMT capability. AFGSC considers these organizations to be non-
   TMT users. However, AFGSC is working towards full TMT implementation throughout the
   command.
   9.4.3. Even though other Air Force organizations such as HAF, SAF, ACC and AFMC use
   TMT, AFGSC considers them to be non-TMT users.
   9.4.4. Task non-TMT users using Outlook e-mail.
AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013                                                                    33

   address in all correspondence to the NAFs/wings (for non-TMT tasks).
9.5. Information a Non-TMT User Receives When Tasked via TMT. Note: This section is
provided as information only. Non-TMT users shall be tasked using Outlook e-mail (paragraph
9.4.4.). However, if a non-TMT users are tasked using TMT, the following paragraphs describe
what the non-TMT user will receive while paragraph 9.6. details responsibilities of the task
initiator with respect to tasking non-TMT users in TMT.
   9.5.1. A non-TMT user will receive two e-mails generated by TMT.
       9.5.1.1. The first e-mail will contain the task instructions (as listed in TMT’s General
       tab).
       9.5.1.2. The second e-mail will contain all documents stored in Original Documents.
       Note: TMT will not send the second e-mail to a non-TMT user if there aren’t any
       documents in the Original Docs folder.
9.6. Task Initiator’s Responsibilities When Tasking a Non-TMT User.
   9.6.1. When tasking a non-TMT user, it is the task initiator’s responsibility to:
       9.6.1.1. Ensure that both TMT-generated e-mails have been delivered to the appropriate
       workflow and to ensure that the task is understood. Note: TMT will not send the second
       e-mail to a non-TMT user if there aren’t any documents in the Original Docs folder.
       9.6.1.2. Accept the task on behalf of the non-TMT user.
       9.6.1.3. Enter response on behalf of non-TMT by using the “My Response” tab, then
       save.
       9.6.1.4. Complete the task on behalf of the non-TMT user.
9.7. Accepting, Rejecting or Completing Tasks.
   9.7.1. Anyone and any organization that is a TMT user can accept taskers.
   9.7.2. Only the directorate’s/special staff’s executive officer or workflow manager may
   reject a task from the command section and other directorates/special staffs. Pre-
   coordination with AFGSC Tasker Workflow or the applicable directorate/special staff is
   required. If the rejecting office is the OPR, they must recommend who the OPR should be
   along with their rationale for requesting the change in OPRship.
   9.7.3. Completing Tasks. Before completing / closing a TMT task, a copy of the response e-
   mail shall be saved in the Tabs folder. The file name of the response e-mail shall begin with
   the word “Response.”

                        WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT PROCESS

A2.1. The Workflow Process.
   A2.1.1. May originate at any level within AFGSC.
   A2.1.2. Many actions originate external to AFGSC (e.g., HAF, NAFs, Wings, Centers, other
   MAJCOMs, etc.).
   A2.1.3. The SSS is the primary tool for use when coordinating/staffing packages within
   AFGSC. The SSS contains the following headers: 1. Purpose, 2. Background, 3. Discussion,
   4. View of Others and 5. Recommendation. The eSSS is the preferred method for
   transmittal, however, the paper SSS may be used when necessary. See paragraph 3.2.2.1.1
   for specific details on drafting an eSSS.
   A2.1.4. AFGSC organizational workflow e-mail boxes or TMT will be used to flow taskers.
   A2.1.5. AFGSC Tasker Workflow, or designee, is the day-to-day MAJCOM tasking office
   for AFGSC.
   A2.1.6. AFGSC DS oversees the management of AFGSC information flow and tasking
   process.
A2.2. AFGSC Command Tasks (Inclusive of tasks sourced from the commander, vice
commander, director of staff and external sources. ) Note: The package must be delivered
to the AFGSC Tasker Workflow on or before the assigned suspense date.
A.2.2.1. STEP 1: AFGSC Tasker Workflow creates a tasker based on input from a Command
Section office (CC, CV, DS, CCC, designee, or from an external source). This input will
typically be presented to AFGSC via the AFGSC.TaskerWorkflow@us.af.mil organizational
mailbox.
A.2.2.2. STEP 2: Task is created, given an AFGSC task tracking number and tasked to a
directorate or special staff. All tasks are sent to a directorate workflow. The AFGSC internal
suspense is based upon needs of the CC, CV, DS, or CCC. Exception/extensions to the suspense
may be granted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
A.2.2.3. STEP 3: The directorate organization receives taskers in a directorate workflow or
TMT and identifies and assigns the appropriate OPR. (Directorates should attempt to assign the
tasker to an AO as quickly as possible.) If the OPR director (or directorate-level designee)
believes that the task was incorrectly tasked, they are responsible for alerting AFGSC Tasker
Workflow and should provide input to the recommended OPR. Note: The director or
directorate-level designee originally assigned will continue as OPR of the task until formally
relieved of responsibility by AFGSC Tasker Workflow.
A.2.2.4. STEP 4: Directorate logs tasker into a tracking database (maintained and monitored by
the directorate) for internal status tracking.
A.2.2.5. STEP 5: Directorate OPR assigns other directorates, NAFs or Wings as OCR, if
required. Note: The OPR assigned by AFGSC Tasker Workflow will be the primary liaison for
that task. The OPR is responsible for meeting the AFGSC Tasker Workflow assigned suspense.
 38                                                           AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013


A.2.2.6. STEP 6: AO works the tasker. Note: Once an AO is assigned by the directorate, that
AO has cradle-to-grave ownership and responsibility for said tasker.
A.2.2.7. STEP 7: When the AO has completed work on the package, it will be routed up through
the OPR directorate. Once the directorate is satisfied that the completed package is ready for
Command Section routing, to include a well-written and thorough SSS (electronic or paper), it is
sent to AFGSC Tasker Workflow. Oftentimes, the task can be closed out at lower level. When
this occurs the OPR shall save a copy of the response e-mail shall in the Tabs folder before
completing/closing the TMT task. The file name of the response e-mail shall begin with the
word “Response.”
A.2.2.8. STEP 8: AFGSC Tasker Workflow logs the package in, does a thorough process and
format quality control check to ensure all business and staffing rules were adhered to and then
routes the package for Command Section coordination. Note: Prior to submitting the package to
the AFGSC Tasker Workflow, all directorate coordination and OCR inputs must be completed
and noted on the SSS. If a previous SSS was used for directorate coordination, insert that SSS
into the package as a tab (this verifies both internal and external coordination). If sufficient,
DSK or DDS will route the package to DS for coordination. If insufficient, DSK or DDS will
send the package back to the OPR directorate for additional work.
A.2.2.9. STEP 9: If sufficient, DS will route the package to the CV or CC. If insufficient, DS
will send the package back to the OPR directorate, through AFGSC Tasker Workflow, for
additional work.
A.2.2.10. STEP 10: The CVE and/or CCE will do a final review/quality check of the package
and forward it for CV and/or CC action, respectively. Note: All packages that require action
from the CV or CC will have either Appr, Sign or Info on the SSS. The final approver is never
listed on the AFGSC SSS as coord.
A.2.2.11. STEP 11: CV and/or CC reviews, signs or sends back to the DS, AFGSC Tasker
Workflow or OPR directorate with questions, concerns, or corrections.
A.2.2.12. STEP 12: Upon completion, the package is returned to the AFGSC Tasker Workflow
for logging, scanning, and transmitting of the actionable document(s). For internal tasks,
AFGSC Tasker Workflow will transmit/return the completed staff package to the OPR
directorate. For external tasks, when AFGSC Tasker Workflow transmits the AFGSC response,
the OPR directorate and the AO will be included as a Cc: address. The package is then filed
IAW recordkeeping procedures.
A2.3. Directorate Originated Staff Packages. A.2.3.1. STEP 1: The directorate OPR will
fully staff the package for coordination and inputs. The package is then forwarded to the director
(or designee) to review and sign or approve for release.
A.2.3.2. STEP 2: The package is routed to the directorate executive officer, secretary or
administrative personnel, where it is logged and delivered to the AFGSC Tasker Workflow either
electronically (preferred) or in hardcopy.
A.2.3.3. STEP 3: AFGSC Tasker Workflow logs the package in, does a thorough process and
format quality control check to ensure all business and staffing rules were adhered to and then
routes the package for Command Section coordination. Note: Prior to submitting the package to
the AFGSC Tasker Workflow, all directorate coordination and OCR inputs must be completed
AFGSCI33-303 6 MARCH 2013                                                                        39


and noted on the SSS. If a previous SSS was used for directorate coordination, insert that SSS
into the package as a tab (this verifies both internal and external coordination).
If sufficient, DSK or DDS will route the package to DS for coordination. If insufficient, DSK or
DDS will route the package back to the OPR directorate for additional work.
A.2.3.4. STEP 4: If sufficient, DS will route the package to the CV or CC. If insufficient, DS
will send the package back to the OPR directorate, through AFGSC Tasker Workflow, for
additional work.
A.2.3.5. STEP 5: The CVE and/or CCE will do a final review/quality check of the package and
forward it for CV and/or CC action, respectively. Note: All packages that require action from
the CV or CC will have either Appr, Sign or Info on the SSS. The final approver is never listed
on the AFGSC SSS as Coord.
A.2.3.6. STEP 6: CV and/or CC reviews, signs or sends back to the DS, AFGSC Tasker
Workflow or OPR directorate with questions, concerns, or corrections.
A.2.3.7. STEP 7: Upon completion, the package is returned to the AFGSC Tasker Workflow for
logging, scanning, and transmitting of the actionable document(s). For internal tasks, AFGSC
Tasker Workflow will transmit/return the completed staff package to the OPR directorate. For
external tasks, when AFGSC Tasker Workflow transmits the AFGSC response, the OPR
directorate and the AO will be included as a Cc: address. The package is then filed IAW
recordkeeping procedures.

            HELPFUL HINTS FOR DEVELOPING A GOOD STAFF PACKAGE

A3.1. Do:
   A3.1.1. Do make every effort to limit all SSSs to one page that are staffed to DS, CV and
   CC. Communications must be concise but completely clear as to the action requested,
   background data and rationale, view of others, and the recommendation by the
   AO/directorate.
   A3.1.2. Do reference all tabs that are included in the package in the text of the SSS.
   A3.1.3. Do spell out all acronyms in the SSS the first time they are used before using the
   acronym in the package unless exempted in the AFGSC approved acronym list.
   A3.1.4. Do make Tab 1 the document that requires action (memo to be signed, slides to be
   reviewed or approved, bullet background paper (BBP) for info, etc.).
   A3.1.5. Do use AFGSC templates. They are available to all AFGSC personnel are located
   on both the NIPR and SIPR shared drive, SharePoint, and in TMT.
   A3.1.6. Do accomplish a thorough quality check of the entire package prior to delivering it
   to the Command Section. This will ensure a smooth routing of the package. If a package has
   substantial edits due to failing to follow AFGSC staffing rules and business practices, it will
   be returned to the directorate for correction.
A3.2. Don’t:
   A3.2.1. Don’t abbreviate an individual’s grade or title in the address or text of a document
   for personal letters to Air Force personnel.
   A3.2.2. Don’t quote members of the Command Section unless prior approval has been
   obtained.
   A3.2.3. Don’t use phrases such as “The Commander” or “The Vice Commander” when
   preparing responses that will go outside the Command. Use AFGSC/CC or AFGSC/CV or
   use their names.
   A3.2.4. Don’t use first person singular “I” in official correspondence, or the possessives
   “my” or “mine” when referring to AFGSC personnel. Instead, use first person plural “we”
   and the possessive “our.”
   A3.2.5. Don’t use names or phrases such as “this headquarters requests” or “Maj Doe
   requests.”
   A3.2.6. Don’t use abbreviations (including military rank) in correspondence where style,
   elegance and formality are important.
   A3.2.7. Don’t mix division (3-ltr) and directorate (2-ltr) coordination in the same staff
   package. Although accomplishing division-level coordination is customary and highly
   recommended (best practice), it is not always feasible. When time constraints prevent
   distinct division-level coordination, it is permissible to jump right to the directorate-level
   coordination.
