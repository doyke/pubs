 AFGSC/A2X. ARC units will submit via their NAF and MAJCOM (AFRC and or NGB) to AFGSC.
 1.3.2.3.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2Q will develop and maintain an Intelligence Formal Training Unit
 (IFTU) course to provide specialized substantive conventional and nuclear bomber and ICBM
 intelligence training related to primary jobs for bomber units, ICBM units, Numbered Air Forces
 (NAFs), Air and Space Operations Center (AOCs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and AFGSC in
 order to fill in gaps from basic intelligence training. This course, taught at the SCI-level, will be
 offered four to five times annually at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.

 1.3.2.3.1.1 (Added) Intelligence personnel assigned to bomber units, ICBM
 units, Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), Air and Space Operations Center (AOCs),
 Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) prior to the transfer over to AFGSC will
 maintain mission qualification status and are not required to attend the IFTU;
 however, the intelligence personnel are encouraged to attend.

 1.3.2.3.1.2 (Added) Intelligence personnel being assigned to AFGSC subordinate
 bomber units, ICBM units, Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), Air and Space Operations
 Center (AOCs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and HQ Staff are required to
 attend the IFTU as initial qualification training. All waivers for not
 attending the training will be approved by AFGSC/A2.

 1.3.2.4.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2 will coordinate formal courses for intelligence personnel relevant to
 the mission. Training may include, but is not limited to, courses at the Defense Threat Reduction
 Agency (DTRA), Defense Nuclear Weapons School (DNWS), Combat Targeting Course (CTC), and
 Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Operations Course (IROC). Additional organizations
 and formal courses will be added to meet mission requirements as needed.
 1.3.2.4.1.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2 encourages assigned intelligence personnel to attain at least a Basic
 Nuclear Weapon Certificate through the Nuclear Weapons Certification Programs taught at the
 DNWS. Those in key positions within intelligence organizations are recommended to attain the
 Advanced Nuclear Weapons Certificate.
 1.3.2.4.1.1.1. (Added) The Nuclear Weapons Certification Programs are designed for personnel with
 responsibilities dealing with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons policy, nuclear weapons operations,
 and nuclear weapons surety. These certifications are particularly valuable for personnel working
 within the nuclear weapons enterprise such as: nuclear weapons intelligence, nuclear weapons
 maintenance, nuclear weapons operations, and nuclear weapons security. The certifications include
 on-line CBTs and in-residence classes, and range from basic to advanced nuclear weapons
 certificates. More information is available at https://dnws.abq.dtra.mil/:
 1.3.2.4.1.1.2. (Added) Unit personnel will conduct familiarization visits/training with

 part of their training requirements.
AFI 14-202V1_AFGSCSUP 1 AUGUST 2010                                                                    3


1.3.2.4.2 (Added) AFGSC/A2XF will maintain an on-line listing of training opportunities such as
COCOM Regional Joint Intelligence Training Facilities (RJITF) and on-line CBTs to include Joint
Intelligence Virtual University (JIVU) and Joint Imagery Analysis Courseware (JIAC).
1.3.2.6.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2 IFTU instructors will monitor students who are not progressing
satisfactorily or fail to achieve passing grades during the course. Extra study time and preparation
time will be afforded to those students within reason. Students who do not pass the IFTU course will
be sent back to their home unit without being designated as IQT. The individual will retake the IFTU
course at a future time as determined by the individualâ€™s chain of command and course availability
within AFGSC/A2.
1.3.5. (Added) External training in support of contingency, crisis and wartime tasks is required at
NAFs, wings and squadrons. Intelligence staffs will develop training initiatives for missile crews, air
crews, and those missile, and aircrew personnel that are deployed in support of mission tasks.
Training should include crew information requirements, situational awareness, threat briefings,
supporting intelligence data, systems and programs usage, and available intelligence resources.
1.3.5.1. (Added) At least annually, intelligence personnel assigned to HQ 20AF and associated
missile wings, should observe a missile crew "check ride" and alert crew duties (to include pre-
departure briefing, deployment, and crew changeover) for orientation purposes and to develop a
familiarity and methodology in order to provide an adequate external training program. However, all
Launch Control Center (LCC) visits by unit intelligence personnel will be accomplished at the
discretion of the OG/CC. Intelligence personnel will not observe and/or be present when the missile
crew conducts Emergency Action Message (EAM) processing or Positive Control Material (PCM)
inventory.
1.3.5.2. (Added) Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) at AFGSC wings will serve as the external
intelligence training program manager. NAFs will appoint in writing an external intelligence training
program manager to oversee program execution.
1.3.5.3. (Added) The unit external intelligence training operating instruction will be coordinated with
any agency (e.g., Weapons/Tactics, SERE, ALS) that assists intelligence personnel in providing
training to crews. This OI will also be coordinated with any agency for which intelligence provides
training (e.g., Security Forces, Civil Engineers, etc.).
1.3.5.4. (Added) The unit training plan will ensure each training item is taught at least annually or as
specified in the applicable AFI 14-2(MDS)V1. Specific threat systems will be listed individually in
the training plan. The training plan will also list specific training objectives for each major area of
intelligence training. Training methods can include, but are not limited to: threat-of-the day briefings,
current intelligence briefings, academic training sessions, theater orientation briefings and weapons
system videos.
1.3.5.4.1. (Added) AFGSC units will use AFTTP 3-1 and other documents identified in the AFGSC
Standard Intelligence Document List (SIDL) as primary training references.
1.3.6. (Added) Internal training is required for all DRU, NAF, wing and squadron personnel with
Intelligence Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). In addition to conducting and supervising the AFSC
skill-level (enlisted) upgrade training program, units will develop a duty position qualification and
certification program for all assigned intelligence and intelligence support personnel. Design the
4                                                    AFI 14-202V1_AFGSCSUP 1 AUGUST 2010

 program to ensure personnel are assigned and certified on specific tasks and duties, in addition to the
 five intelligence core competencies.
 1.3.6.1. (Added) Provide oversight and training of intelligence participation in unit force protection
 working groups.
 1.3.6.2. (Added) Conduct Intelligence Staff Training (IST) IAW AFI 36-2201V3, Air Force Training
 Program on the Job Training Administration, if applicable. Ensure supervisors conduct and
 document an initial evaluation on every individual within 10 days of the individual reporting for duty,
 including individuals who change duty positions within the organization or PCA/PCS. Air National
 Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) organizations will complete the initial
 evaluation within 60 days of the individual reporting for duty.
 1.3.7. (Added) AFGSC DRUs, NAFs, wings and squadrons will consolidate training requirements for
 all assigned intelligence personnel. Wings will submit unit and wing training requirements to parent
 NAF. NAFs will provide an annual consolidated NAF, wing and squadron Formal Training
 Requirements Package to the AFGSC Command Training Manager, AFGSC/A2XF. DRUs will
 submit directly to AFGSC/A2XF. Failure to provide the required information prevents the command
 from programming and budgeting required resources. Submit training requests as soon as the
 requirement has been identified. All units will use AF Form 3933, MAJCOM Mission Training
 Request, to request specific training slots. Unit personnel may work directly with the Command
 Training Manager (AFGSC/A2XF) for specific course training. ANG units will submit training
 requirements through ANG channels.
 1.3.7.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF, ISR Forces, is responsible for developing the Command
 Intelligence Education Training Plan and policy for formal schools. A2XF will coordinate input with
 the AFGSC/A2Q, A2X, and A2O, as appropriate to support the development of a comprehensive
 program. A2XF will also collaborate with USSTRATCOM J2 and other Joint Force Command J2s to
 ensure AFGSC is providing forces required. AFGSC/A2 will approve final command requirements.
 1.3.7.2. (Added) Supervisors should submit training requests as soon as the requirements have been
 identified. Active duty units will coordinate all requests for training through the wing/group SIO to
 AFGSC/A2XF and AFGSC/A2Q. Active duty wing/group SIOs will submit a consolidated annual
 training requirement using the method prescribed by AFGSC/A2XF, with a courtesy copy to
 AFGSC/A2Q. Failure to provide the required information prevents the command from programming
 and budgeting required resources and will result in the unit funding the required training. ANG units
 will submit annual training requirements through their Base Education and Training Manager
 (BETM). AFRC units will submit annual training requirements through HQ AFRC/DOI.
 1.3.7.2.1. (Added) AFGSC assigned intelligence personnel who attend training funded by
 AFGSC/A2 will prepare an after action report (AAR) on the training to AFGSC/A2X and A2XF.
 A2XF will provide the AAR format.
 1.3.7.3. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF is responsible for establishing command intelligence training policy,
 developing a command training plan, assisting units in obtaining and developing training which is
 required, but not locally available, validating training requirements and ensuring command
 intelligence personnel are familiar with training opportunities and deficiencies.
 1.3.7.4. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF is the command lead for Air Education Training Command (AETC)
 intelligence-related Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW).
AFI 14-202V1_AFGSCSUP 1 AUGUST 2010                                                           5


1.3.7.4.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF may request highly experienced and qualified intelligence
personnel (Active Duty, ANG or Reserve) from across the command to attend AETC ISR U&TW.
1.3.7.4.1.1. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF will provide the SME with supporting material and training prior
to participation in the U&TW. This may be conducted in-person or electronically.
1.3.7.4.1.2. (Added) The AFGSC SME will prepare an AAR on the AETC ISR U&TW to
AFGSC/A2X and A2XF. A2XF will provide the AAR format.
1.3.7.4.2. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF will coordinate the AFGSC/A2 command training requirements to
be advocated by the AFGSC/A2 staff and AFGSC SMEs attending ISR U&TWs. This is to avoid
anecdotal requirements to maximize AFGSC ISR requirements for limited AETC training resources.
1.3.7.4.3. (Added) AFGSC/A2XF will maintain an on-line listing of training requirements and
training solutions for submission and tracking.
