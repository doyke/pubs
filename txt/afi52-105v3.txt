ings Fund.

gram responsibilities are defined in Chapter 4.

    Defense as a whole and is managed by the DoD Purchase Card Program management Office
    (PCPMO).
    1.5.2. Level 2. The second reporting level identifies the military service. The Level 2 reporting level
    mandating policy for the AF GPC Program is SAF/AQC. SAF/AQC is designated as the focal point
    for the GPC Program and serves as a liaison between the AF, DoD PCPMO, the Bank, and General
    Service Administration (GSA).
    1.5.3. Level 3. The third reporting level of the HC reporting hierarchy is the Chaplain Service Pro-
    gram Coordinator (CSPC) who is responsible for the AF Chaplain Service CTOF GPC Program as a
    whole. The CSPC is assigned to the Office of the Chief of Chaplains and serves as the Head Contract-
    ing Activity between the AF Chaplain Service, the Bank, SAF/AQCO, and CSAC APCs.

  1.5.4. Level 4. The fourth reporting level with the program identifies each Chaplain Service
  Accounting Center (CSAC). The CSPC appoints an NF IV or NF III to act as the CSAC Agency Pro-
  gram Coordinator. The APC will be responsible for the overall CTOF GPC program administration
  for all chapels under their control.
  1.5.5. Level 5. The fifth reporting level with the program identifies each installation chapel. Each
  chapel appoints an approving official (Account Manager) to serve as the Level 5 agent. Military, DOD
  employees, and CTOF NAF employees will serve as approving officials. Primary responsibilities
  include CTOF GPC administration for the chapel, including approval/disapproval of all purchases
  subsequent to reconciliation by the cardholder, funds accountability, and surveillance of all cardhold-
  ers within the approving official’s account. The approving official serves as the liaison between the
  CSAC Agency Program Coordinator, and the Bank

  include making authorized transactions, logging and reconciling of transactions, and validating trans-
  actions made with the CTOF GPC in support of chapel programs and activities.

able to resolve problems by contacting the vendor. If problems cannot be resolved with the vendor within
45 days of the charge appearing on the cardholder’s statement, the cardholder must submit a CSQI form
to the Bank. The Bank allows up to 60 days to submit a CSQI. For certain problems, cardholders should
delay submission of a CSQI until they receive the next month's SOA. Other problems may dictate imme-
diate submission of a CSQI. Notify the APC when purchases, credits, and billing errors with the Bank are
identified. For additional guidance on disputes see US Bank Agency/Organization Program Coordinator

       ically suspended in accordance with DoD policy.

                             CTOF GPC ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

Surveillance is one of the cornerstones of a strong, viable CTOF GPC Program. It is imperative an
impartial review of all accounts is conducted to ensure CTOF are being used correctly for valid chapel
requirements. As an aid to your surveillance reviews, questions such as these may be used to review
accounts and document compliance with procedures associated with use of the GPC. This is not an
all-inclusive guide. MAJCOM and/or local installations may supplement this checklist as needed. This
information (along with local supplemental questions) may be incorporated as an AF form by overlaying
the information onto an AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, as an overprint.
