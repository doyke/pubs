                                            Chapter 1

                     AETC STRATEGY MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

1.1. Introduction. AETC uses the balanced scorecard (BSC) process to manage its strategy
execution program. The BSC is a strategy management process using a disciplined framework
to help organizations establish, communicate, execute and track strategy. The goal of the strategy
management process is to efficiently and effectively identify those key areas that warrant senior
leadership visibility, monitoring and/or decision authority. The process itself must be a value
added tool in the strategic outlook of the respective areas captures; maintaining flexibility and a
mindfulness of the evolving communities that it serves. AETC used the BSC construct to
develop the initial headquarters-level strategy map in the fall of 2005. The AETC Strategy Map
and supporting documentation depict where the command is, where it wants to be and how it
plans to get there. Air University (AU), 2 AF, 19 AF, and Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS)
have also developed cascaded strategy maps aligned with the command strategy map. In
addition, strategy maps were cascaded to 15 of the command’s wings and 3 independent groups
(see units highlighted in gray, Figure 1.1).
1.2. Overview:
   1.2.1. The AETC strategy map is based on the command strategic plan. While both
   documents include strategic objectives, the strategy map and BSC process provide short-term
   direction, guidance and progress assessment. This approach helps ensure the command
   executes a unified strategy in support of its diverse recruiting, training, and education
   mission. Strategy maps alone do not produce desired results. Robust, on-going governance is
   required for all strategic execution elements to come together. A governance process that
   includes regular strategy reviews provides senior leaders with analytical insight, and enables
   them to effectively prioritize and allocate resources.
   1.2.2. AETC strategy maps have four distinct perspectives: vision and mission, mission
   impact, operational drivers, and develop and support our people. Organizational strategy
   maps, using a balanced set of interrelated objectives and performance measures, are critical
   to successful strategy management programs. Objectives declare what must be accomplished
   in each perspective to execute strategy and the mission successfully. AETC Airmen must
   strive for continuous improvement of processes associated with each objective. Each
   perspective and objective represents an important factor in establishing strategic cause and
   effect relationships throughout the map. Strategy map objectives should not be viewed in
   isolation, but rather as interconnected pathways that help the command move toward its
   ultimate vision.

                      STRATEGY MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE

2.1. Corporate Process. HQ AETC uses its corporate process to provide strategy management
oversight. Specifically, this oversight is conducted through the AETC Strategy Map Committee
(SMC), the Strategy Review Board and the Strategy Review Council structure. The corporate
process is designed to increase management effectiveness and improve cross-functional
decisionmaking. It provides a forum where senior leaders can apply their collective judgment
and experience to improve major programs, objectives, and issues.
   2.1.1. Strategy Review Council. The AETC Strategy Review Council has decisionmaking
   authority on issues submitted by the AETC Strategy Review Board. The AETC Commander
   (CC) normally chairs the council, which determines the final command position on issues
   presented. Voting members are restricted to the incumbents from these HQ AETC offices:
   A1, A2/3/10, A4/7, A5/8/9, A6, ED (AU/CC), RS (AFRS/CC), FM, HC, IA, IG, JA, PA, SE,
   and SG; and from 2 AF/CC and 19 AF/CC. The HQ AETC/HO, Air National Guard advisor
   to the commander (CG), and Air Force Reserve Command advisor to the commander (RF)
   may also attend, as desired, but not as voting members. When the council addresses topics
   concerning the Air Force Reserve components, the respective component’s advisor (CG or
   RF) may then attend as a voting member.
   2.1.2. Strategy Review Board. The Strategy Review Board provides director or special
   staff level review of strategy issues. Topics presented to the board should be limited to those
   requiring corporate consideration and resolution. The board shapes and refines proposals,
   issues, and decisions prior to presentation to the council. In addition, the board has decision-
   making authority over issues submitted by the SMC. The HQ AETC/A5/8/9 director chairs
   the AETC Strategy Review Board. Board members include command deputy directors and
   numbered Air Force (NAF) CVs. Others will attend by invitation of board members. Voting
   is restricted to the incumbent from these HQ AETC offices: A1, A2/3/10, A4/7, A5/8/9, A6,
   ED (AU/A5/8), RS (AFRS/CV), FM, HC, IA, IG, JA, PA, SE, and SG; and from 2 AF/CV
   and 19 AF/CV. When the board is addressing topics concerning the Air Force Reserve
   components, the respective component’s advisor (CG or RF) may attend as a voting member.
   The HO may also attend, if desired.
   2.1.3. Strategy Map Committee (SMC). The SMC is the initial point of entry for strategy
   management issues requiring board or council attention. The SMC reviews and prioritizes
   issues, and develops options for presentation to the board. The HQ AETC/A8PS branch chief
   chairs the committee. Primary committee members include action officers from these HQ
   AETC offices: A1, A2/3/10, A4/7, A6, ED (AU/A5/8X), FM, IA, PA, RS, SE, and SG; and
   from 2 AF and 19 AF. Committee meetings convene as needed.
2.2. Battle Rhythm. Regularly scheduled strategy reviews are used to assess command strategy
execution progress. In order to achieve strategic synergy throughout the command, the
AETC/CC directed all subordinate units also conduct quarterly strategy reviews. Headquarters
strategy reviews are scheduled for the month following quarter closeout. NAFs, AU, and AFRS
will conduct strategy reviews approximately one week prior to the headquarters review. Wing
and independent group commanders will participate in all NAF reviews, and will conduct
6                                                       AETCI90-1101 16 NOVEMBER 2009


wing/group reviews before NAF strategy reviews. Organizations will elevate unresolved
strategic issues to higher headquarters for resolution through the review process. HQ AETC and
its subordinate units will hold biennial strategy workshops to validate their respective strategy
maps and ensure continued alignment with higher headquarters’ strategic intent.
2.3. Business Process Integration. The AETC strategy management process links performance
measurement to strategic objectives, and in turn to resource allocation (see Figure 2.1). Using
this process, performance gaps are proactively addressed and managed through the AETC
corporate process, which oversees the various resource need requests and resource allocation
processes. This ensures leadership involvement in continuous process improvement initiatives,
and links initiatives designed to close strategic performance gaps to the strategic plan, internal
execution processes, and resource allocation.

Figure 2.1. AETC Business Process Integration.




    2.3.1. Initiatives. Initiatives may be generated from various sources. Typically, strategic
    initiatives are long-range actions derived from higher headquarters planning guidance and
    outlined in the command strategic plan. These initiatives usually require significant funding
    or manpower resources to achieve the intended results. These long-range resource requests
    are prioritized through the program objective memorandum (POM) process, managed by HQ
    AETC/A8PP. Initiatives may also be proposed out of the strategic plan cycle, through the
    strategy management process. Normally, these initiatives are shorter-term actions identified
    as a result of monitoring strategy map performance measurements. Initiatives identified
    through the strategy management process may or may not require funding and/or manpower
    (see Figure 2.2).
    2.3.2. Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21). Initiatives can also
    be generated using an AFSO21 rapid improvement event (RIE) to address performance gaps
AETCI90-1101 16 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                  7


   on a strategy map. An RIE is a short-term, high-intensity effort to address a specific process
   problem using the Air Force eight-step problem solving process. The eight-step process is a
   structured, systematic approach to identify and eliminate waste by using baseline
   performance measures, current and future end-state maps, and key metrics to help develop an
   action plan. RIEs are sometimes identified during value stream mapping or enterprise value
   stream mapping. RIEs are typically no/low-cost propositions, although resulting action plans
   may require resources. Strategy management generated initiatives that require resources
   outside the POM process must compete for resources in the current budget execution year
   and enter competition through the budget execution report (BER) process managed by HQ
   AETC/FM.

Figure 2.2. AETC Initiative Process.




2.4. Strategy Review Process. Periodic strategy reviews assess how well an organization is
executing its strategy. Measures indicate how well an organization is doing on strategic
objectives (see Figure 2.3). Gaps between performance and desired targets drive initiative
development.

Figure 2.3. Strategy Analysis.




    2.4.1. Strategic Objectives. The first step in running an effective strategy management
    program is to establish meaningful objectives. Objectives are manageable, single focus
    components that drive long-term strategic success. They focus on ―what,‖ not ―how.‖ Good
    objective statements are concise, easy to understand, memorable, inspirational, and promote
    strategic direction.
       2.4.1.1. Objective champions are responsible for managing strategic objectives. Any
       objective statement or description changes must be approved through the AETC
       corporate process.
       2.4.1.2. To ensure command wide execution, AETC subordinate unit strategy maps will
       align with specific objectives on the HQ AETC Strategy Map. Aligned objective wording
       does not have to be exact, but the intent of the objective will be the same. Aligned
       objectives are primarily in the mission impact and develop and support our people
       perspectives.
    2.4.2. Strategic Measures. Measures are essential to the strategic planning and execution
    process. A strategic measure is a quantitative means of assessing an organization’s
    performance on achieving an objective. A measure is strategic if it communicates the intent
    of the strategic objective and reflects how performance desired results will be achieved.
    AETC uses a two-tiered approach.
       2.4.2.1. Tier 1 represents enduring measures, long term and enterprise-like in nature.
       Any enduring measure change requires AETC corporate approval. In addition, proposed
       changes to a measure’s stoplight criteria must go through the AETC corporate process.
       2.4.2.2. Tier 2 represents short term measures based on initiatives, projects or special
       interest items the objective champion chooses to track. Tier 2 measure changes do not
AETCI90-1101 16 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                 9


       require AETC corporate approval. However, changes to Tier 2 measures used to compute
       Tier 1 measures require AETC corporate approval.
       2.4.2.3. As with aligned objectives (see paragraph 2.4.1.2), AETC subordinate units
       must align with specific measures on the HQ AETC Strategy Map. Aligned measures can
       support any objective on a subordinate unit strategy map. Subordinate units may have
       more measures than those required for objective alignment.
   2.4.3. Targets. Targets are quantitative performance expectations for assessing relative
   success. Stretch targets, or goals beyond the standard target, are highly encouraged.
   Objective champions will use stretch targets to motivate the workforce and encourage
   continuous process improvement efforts. Good stretch targets are set to a value that is not
   historically or easily attained.
   2.4.4. Initiatives. Initiatives are the product of a good strategy management program. They
   represent efforts beyond core processes or ―business as usual,‖ and are designed to change
   the performance level of an objective.
2.5. Units Without Strategy Maps. Some organizations within AETC are not required to
develop cascaded strategy maps. Those units must align under their parent organization strategy
management efforts.
   2.5.1. Subordinate units shall review and comprehend all the strategic objectives on the
   parent organization strategy map.
   2.5.2. Unit senior leaders will examine organization roles and responsibilities, and align
   them against specific strategic objectives on the parent organization strategy map. It is not
   necessary to align with all parent organization strategic objectives.
   2.5.3. Once specific strategic objectives have been identified for alignment, subordinate
   units must develop meaningful measures. Since strategic measures on the parent organization
   strategy map may not be applicable, subordinate unit measures may vary.
   2.5.4. Subordinate units must conduct periodic reviews prior to the parent organization’s
   scheduled strategy review. Issues requiring higher-level visibility or assistance may be
   discussed in the parent organization’s strategy review meeting.
