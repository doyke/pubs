3. Airfield Services
     3.1. 100 OSS/OSW provides dedicated weather services for RAF Mildenhall.
        3.1.1. Standard operating hours are Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and
        down days) from 0400L until the end of the duty day based on the local flying schedule.
        During weekends, holidays and down days, opening and closing times will be dictated by
        the local flying schedule. During standard operating hours 100 OSS/OSW can be
        contacted at DSN: 314-238-4502.
        3.1.2. Limited Duty. The weather station is manned to provide weather support services
        24-hours a day, 7 days a week and operates on a ‘limited duty’ schedule with personnel
        on telephone standby whenever the flying schedule has no posted flights for the day.
            3.1.2.1. Information pertaining to standby support is outlined in the Weather Flight
            Standby memorandum. It will be e-mailed to the applicable squadron leadership of
            primary customers, base agencies and 21 OWS as required. This memo is produced
            monthly and posted on the 100 OSS/OSW ICE Page.
            3.1.2.2. Deviations to operating hours can be made by the Weather Flight
            Commander, 100th Operations Support Squadron Commander (100 OSS/CC), 100th
            Operations Group Commander (100 OG/CC), or 100 ARW Commander (100
            ARW/CC) as required to support mission needs.
            3.1.2.3. The standby weather technician can be recalled by contacting the Wing
            Command Post (100 ARW/CP) via DSN 314-238-2121. Once the standby weather
            technician is contacted, he or she will report to open the weather station no later than
            one hour after being recalled.
            3.1.2.4. Outside of normal duty hours, supported units will contact 21 OWS at DSN
            314-489-2134 or access the OWS web page at https://21ows.us.af.mil/ for weather
            services.
        3.1.3. Weather observations are disseminated 24 hours a day.
        3.1.4. Weather forecasts (to include resource protection) are provided for the local
        airfield and for missions launched from RAF Mildenhall.
MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014                                                              5


     3.1.4.1. 21 OWS is open 24 hours a day and issues all terminal aerodrome forecasts
     (TAFs) and Watches, Warnings and Advisories (WWAs) for RAF Mildenhall (including
     when the 100 OSS/OSW is closed).
  3.2. Weather Observing
     3.2.1. 100 OSS/OSW utilizes the FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observation
     System (AMOS) and the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) to make and disseminate
     automated observations. A certified observer continuously maintains situational
     awareness of current weather conditions and is available to augment the AMOS via the
     use of JET during standard operating hours and upon recall during standby hours.
     3.2.2. Observation Sites. The primary AMOS observation sensors are located on both
     ends of the runway. When required, the AMOS will be augmented by a certified weather
     technician. The official augmentation observation location is the taxiway light located
     about 50m across from the weather station cipher lock door, bldg. 669.
     3.2.3. Types of Observations
        3.2.3.1. Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METAR) will be disseminated IAW
        AFMAN 15-111, Chapter 2, between 55 and 59 minutes after each hour.
        3.2.3.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) is an unscheduled
        observation completed and transmitted when any mandated/coordinated special
        criteria (including augmentation of the AMOS) have been observed or detected.
            3.2.3.2.1. SPECI Criteria for RAF Mildenhall has been derived from AFMAN
            15-111, the terminal Flight Information Publications (FLIP), MILDI 13-204 and
            AFI 11-202, Vol. 3 Flying Operations. They have been consolidated for ease of
            use and are outlined in the ‘Unique Cig & Vis Speci’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall
            Resource Protection Datasheet.
            3.2.3.2.2. A SPECI will contain all data elements found in a METAR plus any
            additional remark(s) that elaborate on special criteria in the body of the report.
     3.2.4. Augmentation of Observations
        3.2.4.1. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified weather technicians
        manually add and/or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited AMOS.
        There are two augmentation processes used by 100 OSS/OSW personnel:
        supplementing and back-up.
        3.2.4.2. During local flying, whenever reported conditions are unrepresentative and
        significant to flight safety and/or operations, the weather technician will err on the
        side of caution and augment accordingly.
            3.2.4.2.1. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological
            information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the
            AMOS to detect and/or report. An observation will be supplemented when any
            phenomena IAW AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.1. Summary of Mandatory
            Supplementary Weather Conditions, Attachment 3 (of this document) occur.
            3.2.4.2.2. Supplementing the AMOS by a certified weather technician is
            mandatory when the airfield is open and the weather conditions are observed.
6                                                  MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014


           Weather forecasters will be ready to supplement observations if conditions in
           Table 3.1 are forecast to occur within one hour.
           3.2.4.2.3. There is no requirement to supplement the AMOS when the airfield is
           closed, unless tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur. Personnel are
           required to log on to JET and be prepared to supplement an observation whenever
           a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic activity.
           3.2.4.2.4. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data
           and/or dissemination of an AMOS observation when the primary automated
           method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication
           failure. A certified weather technician is mandated to provide AMOS back-up
           when the airfield is open and weather conditions require back-up. An observation
           will be backed-up IAW AFMAN 15-111 attachments 2 and 3 and will take into
           account SPECI criteria as required IAW the ‘Unique SPECI Criteria’ tab in the
           RAF Mildenhall Resource Protection Datasheet.
               3.2.4.2.4.1. Manual observing methods will be used when performing back-
               up operations.
    3.2.5. Limitations to observing
       3.2.5.1. The AMOS weather sensors are located in close proximity to both ends of
       the runway and provide accurate airfield weather observations.
       3.2.5.2. When the AMOS is partially or completely inoperable and back-up weather
       observation equipment is used (i.e., AN/TMQ-53 or Kestrel 4000/4500NV), there
       will be degradation to some weather elements due to the equipment’s location.
       3.2.5.3. Wind and pressure values from any piece of back-up equipment (other than a
       properly sited and maintained AN/TMQ-53) will be estimated. IAW AFMAN 15-111
       observations will include “WND DATA ESTMD” and “ALSTG/SLP ESTMD” as
       appropriate with respect to back-up for wind and pressure.
       3.2.5.4. There is a clear view of the entire runway from the official augmentation
       observation location. Weather approaching from the north side of the airfield is
       obstructed by The RAF Mildenhall PAX Terminal, building 559, building 669 and
       the Air Traffic Control tower obstruct weather approaching from the north side of the
       airfield. Collaboration with tower personnel and an alternate observation site located
       on the roof of building 669 negate this limitation.
    3.2.6. Alternate Operating Location (AOL)
       3.2.6.1. The 100 OSS/OSW AOL is located in Building 778. Evacuation procedures,
       AOL operation procedures and contact information are outlined in local procedures.
       3.2.6.2. If 100 OSS/OSW must evacuate to the AOL, the CEF will use the phone to
       communicate observations, augment AMOS observations, coordinate WWA
       dissemination with the 21 OWS, and relay time-critical data to the appropriate
       agencies as outlined in the ‘Dissemination Tree’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall Resource
       Protection Datasheet.
MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014                                                                  7


         3.2.6.3. For the convenience of all agencies requiring contact with the weather
         station, the main DSN telephone number, 238-4502, is routed to the AOL.
  3.3. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW)
     3.3.1. Duty and/or mission priorities may delay the CEF from detecting and immediately
     reporting weather changes as they occur. Air Traffic Control (100 OSS/OSAT)
     personnel are trained to assist 100 OSS/OSW personnel by way of Cooperative Weather
     Watch (CWW) to alert the CEF of significant weather changes that occur between
     scheduled observations.
         3.3.1.1. The CEF will determine if the information should be included in the official
         observation.
         3.3.1.2. Of primary concern is the report of lightning, reporting of a sector visibility,
         local PIREPS, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that
         could affect flight safety or local operations.
         3.3.1.3. Weather technicians will re-evaluate weather conditions when 100
         OSS/OSAT or reliable sources, such as pilots, local law enforcement, etc., report
         weather conditions different from the last disseminated observation. The CEF will
         generate a SPECI observation or include information in the next METAR
         observation, as required.
     3.3.2. 100 OSS/OSW leadership will assist 100 OSS/OSAT personnel in creating
     appropriate guides to perform CWW. This will include day and night visibility marker
     guides as well as a listing of all SPECI observation criteria. This information will be
     reviewed annually by weather leadership or whenever significant changes occur.
  3.4. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)
     3.4.1. The RAF Mildenhall (EGUN) TAF is a coded weather bulletin providing forecast
     information for the aerodrome complex to facilitate flight planning and command and
     control. TAFs are prepared and issued by 21 OWS and formatted IAW AFMAN 15-124
     Chapter 1, Meteorological Codes, and amended IAW AFMAN 15-129, Vol. 1 Chapter 3,
     Air and Space Weather Operations-Characterization. The EGUN TAF is valid for areas
     within a 5 NM radius of the center of the aerodrome and is issued daily at 0400z, 1200z
     and 2000z.
     3.4.2. The CEF collaborates with 21 OWS to provide feedback and coordinate changes
     to the TAF.
         3.4.2.1. The CEF will alert 21 OWS of any developing situations not coded in
         meteorological reports that could drive amendments to forecast products from the 21
         OWS or impact flight safety. TAFs will be amended according to the criteria outlined
         in the ‘TAF Criteria’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall Resource Protection Datasheet.
  3.5. Limitations to forecasting services
     3.5.1. Forecasting services are subject to prioritization of shift duties; therefore, some
     forecasting service requests may occasionally be provided by other weather units (i.e. 21
     OWS). 100 OSS/OSW will attempt to notify affected agencies when this is likely to
     occur and arrange alternate support for services temporarily beyond its means.

    3.6. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) radio
       3.6.1. The PMSV is constantly monitored by the CEF during standard operating hours.
       100 OSS/OSW’s designated UHF frequency is 284.425 MHz with reception and
       transmission capabilities out to 170 NM.
       3.6.2. 100 OSS/OSW operates this program IAW AFMAN 15-129 Vol. 2, and uses
       standard phraseology from the FAA JO 7110.10W Flight Services, Chapter 12. PMSV
       support information is also listed in the RAFM FLIP.
       3.6.3. The CEF will respond to all PMSV contacts and solicit PIREPS to provide
       aircrews the most current weather information.
       3.6.3.1. 48 OSS/OSW can respond to PMSV contacts when 100 OSS/OSW is not
       available and provides back-up service during outages.
    3.7. Pilot Reports (PIREPS)
       3.7.1. It is impossible for ground-based weather technicians to report the weather that
       aircrews see or experience while on a mission. Reports of weather as observed from
       airborne aircraft, especially reports of hazards to air operations, are therefore very
       beneficial to forecasters and other aircrews.
       3.7.2. PIREPs will be transmitted locally and longline via JET.
    3.8. Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories (WWA)
       3.8.1. Weather WWAs will be issued when any of the specific criteria listed on the
       ‘Unique WWA Support’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall Resource Protection Datasheet is
       occurring or is expected to occur within a 5 NM radius (unless otherwise specified) from
       the center of the RAF Mildenhall runway.
           3.8.1.1. The computation point will remain the center of the RAF Mildenhall runway.
       3.8.2. 100 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS will provide all resource protection products for RAF
       Mildenhall.
       3.8.3. Definitions
       3.8.4. A Weather Advisory is a special weather product to alert an end user of the
       occurrence or imminent occurrence of weather conditions impacting operations.
       3.8.5. A Weather Watch is a special weather product to facilitate resource protection
       decisions. Weather Watches provide advance notice to designated agencies of the
       existence of a potential for weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to
       life or property for which the agency should consider taking protective measures. A
       watch will be upgraded to a warning when dangerous or mission limiting weather is
       expected to occur, or is occurring.
       3.8.6. A Weather Warning is a special weather product to facilitate resource protection
       decisions. Weather Warnings alert designated agencies to the imminent or actual
       occurrence of weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or
       property for which the agency must take immediate protective actions.
       3.8.7. Issuing and Canceling
MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014                                                                  9


         3.8.7.1. The 21 OWS will issue all forecast WWAs and the 100 OSS/OSW will issue
         all observed WWAs during hours of operation.
            3.8.7.1.1. The 21 OWS will issue Observed WWAs when the weather station is
            closed.
            3.8.7.1.2. The CEF will notify 21 OWS upon opening and closing of the duty
            section to coordinate the transfer of responsibility for Observed WWA support.
            3.8.7.1.3. 100 OSS/OSW will act as the “eyes forward” for the 21 OWS and will
            keep it apprised of local conditions. 100 OSS/OSW has the ability to issue WWAs
            if there is an immediate threat to life or property and there is no time to coordinate
            with 21 OWS (e.g. tornado) or if system outages at the 21 OWS require 100
            OSS/OSW backup.
         3.8.7.2. When a WWA is issued, Mildenhall Tower, Mildenhall Airfield
         Management, 100 ARW/CP (Command Post) and 352 SOSS/A3W (SOG Weather)
         will be notified immediately via phone dissemination through the Integrated Weather
         Warning Capability (IWWC) voice system administered by 21 OWS. The 100
         ARW/CP will notify all appropriate base agencies of the WWA.
     3.8.8. WWAs will consist of the type (watch, warning or advisory), sequential
     numbering for the WWA (two-digit month and three-digit number for that specific WWA
     - beginning with 001 at the start of a new month), location from RAFM, beginning and
     ending times (in Zulu), and reason the WWA was issued. Examples of each are:
         3.8.8.1. Weather Advisory 06-006 for Mildenhall (EGUN) valid 7/1045Z (7/1145L)
         to UFN observed crosswinds greater than or equal to 25kts. Observed at 30 kts.
         3.8.8.2. Weather Watch 06-007 for Mildenhall (EGUN) valid 7/1100Z (7/1200L) to
         7/2000Z (7/2100L) Potential for lightning exists within 5 NM.
         3.8.8.3. Weather Warning 06-003 for Mildenhall (EGUN) valid 7/1200Z (7/1300L)
         to 7/1600Z (7/1700L) high winds from 35 to 44 kts. Forecast value 37 kts are
         forecast.
     3.8.9. All WWA criteria and respective lead times are outlined in the ‘Unique WWA
     Support’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall Resource Protection Datasheet.
  3.9. Dissemination of weather data
     3.9.1. JET is the primary system to disseminate weather observations, TAFs, PIREPs,
     and WWAs to agencies that control the local air traffic (i.e. 100 OSS/OSAT, Airfield
     Management (100 OSS/OSAA) and 100 ARW/CP).
     3.9.2. During JET outages or when data is unavailable via NIPR, telephones and hotlines
     are the secondary methods to disseminate weather data.
         3.9.2.1. 100 OSS/OSW will disseminate METAR, SPECI and LOCAL (as required)
         observations and WWAs to 100 OSS/OSAT, 100 OSS/OSAA and 100 ARW/CP first.
         3.9.2.2. Weather observations will, at a minimum (but not limited to), contain the
         following information: time of observation, wind direction and speed in knots,
10                                                  MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014


        visibility, current weather (as applicable), sky condition, temperature, dew point and
        pressure.
        3.9.2.3. Any additional observation data will be provided as required IAW AFMAN
        15-111.
     3.9.3. E-mail via base Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) LAN
     will be used as a tertiary system.
     3.9.4. 100 OSS/OSW will conduct back-up dissemination as the situation warrants.
     3.9.5. All base agencies can display current weather observations and WWAs via the
     JET website.
  3.10. Tropical Weather. 100 OSS/OSW will not deviate from current and forecasted
  information provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the 21 OWS as the
  situation applies to RAF Mildenhall and/or the flying mission.
     3.10.1. 100 OSS/OSW will provide the necessary forecast services for the installation
     commanders to make mission execution decisions, such as evacuation and resource
     protection.
     3.10.2. 100 OSS/OSW will follow installation public affairs policies and procedures
     regarding the release of tropical cyclone forecasts to the general public.
  3.11. METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH
     3.11.1. A METWATCH (meteorological watch) is a deliberate process for monitoring
     the terrestrial weather or space environment in an area or region. The purpose of
     METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge
     from forecast conditions and determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast
     product or group of products and notify designated agencies.
     3.11.2. A MISSIONWATCH is a deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or
     the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may
     adversely impact missions in execution. The CEF will identify previously unidentified
     environmental threats and alert decision-makers at the operational unit and/or airborne
     mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission profiles that may mitigate the
     environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission success.
  3.12. Severe Weather Actions. 100 OSS/OSW is responsible for conducting semiannual
  exercises of the Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) IAW AFI 10-229. These exercises will
  be coordinated with 100 OSS/OSAT, 100 ARW/CP, RAPCON, 100 OSS/OSAA and the
  21 OWS. Real-world events that require use of the SWAP will meet the requirement for
  semiannual training/exercises.
     3.12.1. Severe Weather Recall Criteria
        3.12.1.1. Prior to or during a severe weather event, additional 100 OSS/OSW
        personnel may be needed and can be recalled when any of the following severe
        weather events are observed or forecast to occur:
            3.12.1.1.1. Tornadic activity
            3.12.1.1.2. Winds equal to or greater than 45 knots
MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014                                                                 11


             3.12.1.1.3. Hail equal to or greater than 1/2 inches in diameter
             3.12.1.1.4. Freezing precipitation
             3.12.1.1.5. Rain/snow accumulation greater than 2 inches in 12 hours
             3.12.1.1.6. A severe weather signature is detected on radar from any source.
         3.12.1.2. Severe Weather Action Plan. During a severe weather event, 100
         OSS/OSW will open the weather station, if closed, and implement the following:
         3.12.1.3. Expand our “eyes forward” role to ensure 21 OWS has the most accurate
         weather information possible for RAF Mildenhall.
         3.12.1.4. Augment automated weather observations, as required.
         3.12.1.5. Promptly notify 352 SOSS/A3W on-duty personnel or standby personnel as
         appropriate.
         3.12.1.6. Enhance MISSIONWATCH and METWATCH to ensure 351 ARS and
         95 RS operators are informed with the most accurate and timely weather information
         and to meet resource protection needs for RAF Mildenhall.
         3.12.1.7. Collect severe weather reports not normally available through standard
         weather observations. These include reports from base personnel, local law
         enforcement and local news media. Severe weather reports can be relayed to 100
         OSS/OSW by phone at DSN 238-4502.
         3.12.1.8. Pass all reliable severe weather reports to the 21 OWS via 100 OSS/OSW
         immediately or as soon as practical after fulfilling any local distribution requirements.
         3.12.1.9. Provide appropriate weather related information to the 100 ARW/CP for
         OPREP-3 reporting when significant weather occurs and results in Class A damage,
         base closure or mission degradation.
         3.12.1.10. During 100 OSS/OSW standby hours, a recall will be accomplished IAW
         the monthly OSW standby memorandum, which is distributed to key offices via email
         and posted on the 100 OSS/OSW ICE Page.
4. Operational Support
   4.1. 100 OSS/OSW will produce a Mission Weather Product (MWP) as required per the 100
   ARW and 95 RS flight schedules:
      4.1.1. The MWP consists of two parts, a planning document produced/updated daily to
      support local flying and a verbal briefing provided to each aircrew based on individual
      mission weather thresholds. These two parts combined are the equivalent to a DD Form
      175-1, IAW AFMAN 15-129 V2.
      4.1.2. The MWP provides a 24-hour forecast that is broken down into two-hour
      increments. The product contains the forecasted surface, climb and flight level winds,
      surface temperature, surface visibility, ceiling heights, surface pressure, solar and lunar
      data, flight hazards, forecasted and active WWAs, forecasts for active air refueling (AR)
      tracks and landing forecasts for four alternate airfields.
12                                                  MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014


     4.1.3. The MWP is tailored to each mission, including scheduled AR tracks and any
     other active mission areas. Specific attention is given to mission-limiting weather
     parameters.
     4.1.4. Area of Operation. Local flying areas are over England, Wales, Scotland, the
     North Sea, Scandinavia and mainland Europe.
     4.1.5. The MWP is updated daily (when the weather station is open and flying requires)
     at 0400z, 1200z and 2000z.
        4.1.5.1. The MWP will be amended:
            4.1.5.1.1. When the TAF is amended or a WWA for RAF Mildenhall is issued,
            cancelled or amended.
            4.1.5.1.2. When there is a Mission Limiting Criteria threshold (affecting the
            351 ARS or 95 RS mission) that has or is expected to be crossed which had not
            been previously forecasted or briefed. These criteria are outlined in sections
            4.2.3.3.3. and 4.2.3.4.3.
               4.1.5.1.2.1. Aircrews will be specifically notified (if possible) whenever the
               MWP is amended for Mission Limiting Criteria.
               4.1.5.1.2.2. 100 OSS/OSW will contact 100 ARW/CP to relay notification to
               aircrews of MWP amendments when direct contact cannot be established
               (example: thunderstorms in an AR track over Germany not previously
               forecast).
        4.1.5.2. 95 RS MWPs are tailored to individual mission requirements as specified in
        a Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) or Secure Internet Protocol Router
        (SIPR) email request.
     4.1.6. The current MWP is posted on the 100 OSS/OSW ICE Page for planning purposes
     only.
     4.1.7. The 100 OSS/OSW Flight Commander or Flight Chief will coordinate proposed
     changes to content or format on the MWP with the 351 ARS/CC and 95 RS/CC.
     4.1.8. 100 OSS/OSW standard briefing format is PowerPoint and/or paper hardcopies.
     Aircrews will receive the MWP along with a “package” consisting of:
        4.1.8.1. The 21 OWS Meteorological Satellite analysis and prognosis charts valid for
        the mission time.
        4.1.8.2. Flight hazard charts
            4.1.8.2.1. Thunderstorm charts

            4.1.8.5. Provided whenever Volcanic Ash is present in the EUCOM AOR or near
            the mission’s planned route of flight.
         4.1.8.6. Any other products pertinent to the mission, as required.
  4.2. Flight Weather Briefings
     4.2.1. Briefing Procedures. The Video Teleconference (VTC) is the primary means the
     CEF briefs the MWPs to the aircrew, and by telephone as back-up. Paper copies of the
     briefing will be printed, e-mailed, or faxed. The verbal briefing finalizes the flight brief
     prior to departure and will be documented by the duty forecaster.
         4.2.1.1. 175-1 Briefings. The 21 OWS and 100 OSS/OSW will prepare a DD Form
         175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, IAW AFMAN 15-129, Vol. 2 for aircrews departing
         RAF Mildenhall and terminating at another location. The 21 OWS prepares 175-1
         weather briefings when 100 OSS/OSW requires backup.
         4.2.1.2. 151 Briefings. The 100 OSS/OSW will prepare a Form 151, Flight Weather
         Briefing, IAW AFMAN 15-129, Vol. 2 for aircrews departing RAF Mildenhall that
         have an air refueling mission and then terminate at another location.
         4.2.1.3. All of the charts listed in section 4.1.8. will accompany the form 175-1 and
         151 briefings.
         4.2.2. Unless stated otherwise in this instruction, the minimum notification time
         required to request briefing support is 24 hours. Short-notice requests will be fulfilled
         as duty priorities dictate and/or as weather personnel are available.
         4.2.2.1. Local Flying. 351 ARS and/or transient aircrews performing local flying,
         defined as flights departing and returning to RAF Mildenhall, may obtain a flight
         weather briefing in person at the weather station or over the VTC using the local
         MWP.
         4.2.2.2. Cross-Country/Trans-Atlantic Flights. 351 ARS and 95 RS aircrews
         departing RAF Mildenhall whose final destination is not RAF Mildenhall will contact
         100 OSS/OSW to obtain the necessary weather briefing. 351 ARS and 95 RS
         aircrews departing another location may contact the 100 OSS/OSW, the 21 OWS or
         other pre-arranged weather sources (USN, AFCENT, ACC, etc.).               Contact
         information for the 21 OWS flight weather briefing desk is DSN 489-2133/6145, e-
         mail at ows.briefings@us.af.mil or submitting a flight weather briefing request via
         the AF/Army Briefing Request link on the 21 OWS website: https://21ow.us.af.mil.
         4.2.2.3. Transient Aircraft. 100 OSS/OSW will provide transient aircrews weather
         briefings via a DD Form 175-1 upon request when a CEF is on duty and time allows.
         When no CEF is on duty or when higher duty priorities preclude it, the 21 OWS will
         provide the flight weather briefings. Instructions on how to complete a request may
         be found on the 100 OSS/OSW ICE page.
         4.2.2.4. Open Skies. Weather briefing requests pertaining to Open Skies flights are
         either submitted to 100 OSS/OSW or directly to the 21 OWS for production. The
         Form 175-1 will only be created by 100 OSS/OSW if the CEF can establish that there
         is sufficient time to complete the brief without interfering with support to primary
         customers. Weather planning briefs are submitted by the Open Skies POC to the 21
14                                              MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014


     OWS for production and then forwarded to the 100 OSS/OSW for presentation on a
     scheduled date and time. 100 OSS/OSW will provide a point of contact for RAF
     Mildenhall and briefing support as required.
     4.2.2.5. Coronet Briefings. 100 OSS/OSW provides support to all Coronet aircraft
     movements departing from RAF Mildenhall with planning and mission weather
     briefings if requested. 100 OSS/OSW will coordinate Coronet support with the lead
     weather unit (normally the ACC Air Ops Group Weather Element) as appropriate.
     4.2.2.6. Operational Risk Management (ORM) will be utilized in METWATCH and
     MISSIONWATCH to complete the six-step process focused on Resource Protection
     and 100 ARW daily flying mission areas, IAW AFMAN 15-129 V1.
     4.2.2.7. 100 OSS/OSW personnel will apply ORM principles and processes to daily
     weather operations. This aids in prioritization of missions and allocation of weather
     resources to better exploit environmental conditions, mitigate mission delays, and
     enhance the overall effectiveness of operations. Severe Weather Response Actions
     and Mission Limiting Environmental Condition Response Matrix for the 351 ARS, 95
     RS, 100 MSG, 100 MXG and 727 AMS can be found within the RAF Mildenhall
     Weather Limitations Data Sheet.
     4.2.2.8. 100 OSS/OSW will MISSIONWATCH for the entire duration of each
     primary customer mission.
        4.2.2.8.1. Missions will be identified as “High,” “Some,” or “Low” risk based on
        the Mission Limiting Criteria. Those missions with routes of flight, operational
        areas, final destinations (primary and alternate), etc. that the CEF has considered
        to be “High” and/or “Some” risk will be continuously monitored for significant
        changes. The CEF will also spot check “Low” risk missions for situational
        awareness.
        4.2.2.8.2. If the CEF determines the need to notify aircrew of weather changes
        discovered during MISSIONWATCH, they will immediately contact 100
        ARW/CP and relay the pertinent information for possible relay to the aircrew(s).
     4.2.2.9. 100 OSS/OSW will provide METWATCH/MISSIONWATCH for all
     weather briefs created by 100 OSS/OSW for the 351 ARS.
        4.2.2.9.1. Aircrews will be notified via 351 ARS dispatch office phone, 100
        OSS/OSAT, 100 ARW/CP or PMSV whenever Mission Limiting Criteria is
        forecast or observed and was not originally forecast during the briefing
        process.
        4.2.2.9.2. The criteria that dictate amendments for the TAF are listed in the ‘TAF
        Criteria’ tab of the RAF Mildenhall Resource Protection Datasheet.
        4.2.2.9.3. For the KC-135 airframe, the following constitute Go / No Go Mission
        Limiting Criteria and will be reviewed and updated at least once a year:
            4.2.2.9.3.1. Tornadoes anywhere along route
            4.2.2.9.3.2. Thunderstorms anywhere along route. Must be avoided by 10 NM

  4.3. Specialized Support
     4.3.1. Pre-deployment/Deployment/Contingency Planning. 100 OSS/OSW can provide
     in-squadron briefings in support of deployments and/or contingency operations. General
     information required for briefing support is briefing time, take-off time, route, AR track
     (time and location) and destination.
     4.3.2. Situation Briefings. Situation briefings are briefed upon request and may also be
     used for Pre-Deployment Planning purposes. Content varies depending upon the
     situation.
     4.3.3. Climatological Support. Requests for climatological data and studies should be
     sent to the Weather Flight Commander.
     4.3.4. Wing Standup. A 100 OSS/OSW representative will present a weather briefing at
     the weekly wing staff meeting. Briefings will consist of a satellite analysis, general
     operational forecast within the United Kingdom, and the 5-day outlook (and any
     applicable climatological data or additional information as needed or requested).
     4.3.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). Presented to aircrews when requested by the
     IRC instructor which includes UK weather related hazards, climatology, and weather
     services/operations.
     4.3.6. Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE). Upon request, a three-day
     weather forecast product will be produced and disseminated to the requesting instructor.
     4.3.7. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM). 100 OSS/OSW will provide weather
     information for creation of CDMs upon request.
     4.3.8. Extended Weather Outlook. The 21 OWS produces and updates 5-day outlook for
     RAF Mildenhall each day. Only the first 30 hours has a ‘forecaster in the loop’ (which
     means the forecaster adds input to the forecast instead of relying solely on model data). It
     contains graphics and text for a plain language weather forecast. This product provides
     planning weather and is not intended for operational use. 100 OSS/OSW provides a 5-day
     outlook specifically tailored for RAF Mildenhall which is included in all staff briefings
     and is available upon request. This product has a ‘forecaster in the loop’ for the entire 5-
     day outlook.
     4.3.9. Solar/Lunar Data. 100 OSS/OSW provides detailed solar/lunar data via 100
     OSS/OSW ICE Page. Data includes sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, civil twilight,
     and nautical twilight.
     4.3.10. Safety Investigation Support. 100 OSS/OSW will provide 100 ARW Safety
     Office (100 ARW/SE) weather information for safety or accident investigations and
MILDENHALLI15-101 13 JUNE 2014                                                               17


      reports IAW the local Mishap Response Plan 91-204. In addition, will provide 100
      ARW/SE a representative, E-7 or higher, to serve as an advisor on safety
      investigation/accident boards as required.
      4.3.11. 100 OSS/OSW attempts to satisfy all requirements. When requests for weather
      support exceed 100 OSS/OSW abilities, the CEF and/or flight leadership will strictly
      enforce the duty priorities. Prioritized duties are outlined in attachment 2 of this
      document. 100 OSS/OSW will seek back-up support from the 21 OWS or AFWA. Non-
      standard weather briefings or requests for weather information can be provided upon
      request and availability of personnel.
5. Limitations to Weather Services
   5.1. Interruption of the normal receipt of alphanumeric and graphic data via JET, NIPRNET
   or Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) can severely degrade forecasting
   capabilities.
   5.2. The 100 OSS/OSW uses a combination of data from 100 OSS/OSAT personnel, radar
   and lightning products from the 21 OWS, and/or PIREPs to determine if precipitation and/or
   thunderstorms are within 5, 10, 15, and 25 nautical miles of the base.
   5.3. Many flying areas are located over unpopulated or large water regions. The lack of
   weather data from such areas may limit the weather watch capabilities of the duty forecaster.
   PIREPS are extremely useful over data sparse areas.
   5.4. Forecasts beyond 24 hours can quickly diminish in accuracy, and it is advisable to
   obtain updates whenever possible.
   5.5. Due to local terrain and man-made features near the runway, sensor wind speeds
   between the 11 and 29 approach ends of the runway may differ by several knots. This is an
   acceptable variance and no corrective action is warranted.
   5.6. Back-up Power Requirements:
      5.6.1. Weather services are highly dependent upon data reception and transmission
      capabilities. Under wartime or other adverse conditions, communications may be
      severely limited, resulting in a degradation of capabilities.
      5.6.2. All operational 100 OSS/OSW computers and communications equipment in
      building 669 are required to have uninterruptible power to prevent loss of critical
      operational weather data. The 100th Civil Engineer Squadron (100 CES) maintains
      emergency power with diesel back-up generators.
      5.6.3. The AMOS is required to have internal battery back-up power for its Field Data
      Collection Units. These are serviced and maintained by the 100th Communications
      Squadron Airfield Systems shop (100 CS/SCOA).
6. Reciprocal Support:
   6.1. In order for the 100 OSS/OSW to provide the best weather support possible, it is
   necessary to receive reciprocal support from various organizations.
