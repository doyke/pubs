(919 OG) aircrew members assigned or attached in the flying squadrons, and 919 OG Life
Support personnel. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Information Management Tool (AF
IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, route the AF IMT 847s from the wing

Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. To avoid
duplication this instruction removes or changes guidance that has been added to AFI 21-101
dated 13 January 2011 to include lost tool procedures.
1. Responsibility: Policy, standardization procedures for security, control, and accountability
of tools and equipment.
 2                                                           919SOWI21-110 1 November 2011


     1.1. Squadron maintenance officers/superintendents have responsibility. However, authority
     may be delegated to the Aircraft Maintenance Support Section (MXAS) tool room or to a
     Composite Tool Kit (CTK) custodial monitor for direct control in each work center.
     1.2. Work centers that do not perform maintenance on aerospace equipment and/or are not
     involved in flight/maintenance operations are excluded from the CTK program. These
     include Maintenance Operation Center (MOC), Small Computer Management, Analysis,
     Training, Maintenance Supply Liaison, Programs and Mobility, Transportation, Supply and
     Contracting.
     1.3. Tool issue sections will be limited to no more that one per work center.
     1.4. All CTK’s, their contents, dispatchable tools or equipment will be marked using the
     standard nine-digit worldwide identification code as the Equipment Identification Designator
     (EID) according to figure 1-1 and loaded into the Tool Accountability System (TAS) referred
     throughout this instruction as the Tool Asset Management Software (TCMax). Tool issue
     sections will determine the last five characters of the identification (ID).
     1.5. Canvas bags are not to be used as dispatch kits, with the exception of Hostile
     Environment Repair Kit (HERP) kits: Canvas bags may be included in a CTK or signed out
     from tool rooms. In these instances, the CTK is taken to the aircraft and the required tools
     placed in the bag at the work site. When the job is complete, the tools and bag (if included)
     must be placed in the CTK at the work site and inventoried.
     1.6. Stored locations of special items such as shop/industrial equipment, sub-components,
     test equipment, etc., that are not part of a CTK, are arranged in a manner to conform with the
     show/know concept.
     1.7. Test Measurement Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) items will be identified with an EID
     in accordance with paragraph 1.4.
     1.8. Locally manufactured tools or equipment will be controlled/managed under the CTK
     program In-accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
     Management and this instruction.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. MXAS is the central location for collecting all unserviceable tools within the
     maintenance organization.
     2.2. Broken tools under the warranty tool program are managed by MXAS for exchange
     through the manufacturer’s representative.
     2.3. Crashed Damaged and Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) CTK’s and equipment
     will conform to the procedures in this instruction.
     2.4. Procedures for Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERP):
        2.4.1. Operations Personnel will stow the HERP kit above the galley, secured to the
        aircraft and sealed to prevent access by unauthorized personnel.
        2.4.2. HERP kits will be inventoried and sealed by operations personnel prior to
        placement on aircraft. Tools in the HERP will be tracked/identified in the Tool
        Accountability System (TAS). A tool list will be enclosed in each kit.
919SOWI21-110 1 November 2011                                                                    3


     2.4.3. Prior to each flight, the crew Flight Engineer (FE) will be responsible for ensuring
     the aircraft HERP kit is sealed and attached to the aircraft. In the event the seal is broken,
     the FE will inventory the kit prior to flight. If the kit is complete, a new seal will be
     placed on the HERP kit and the kit will be appropriately stowed. If an item is missing,
     the FE will notify the Aircraft Commander (AC) and place a red “X” in the aircraft forms
     with a description of the tool. A search will be conducted prior to flight. If the item is
     not located, the FE will follow procedures in the Lost Tool/Item section of the
     instruction.
  2.5. Replacement tools may be maintained in tool rooms or work centers. These tools will
  be secured in a cabinet or locker. The work center supervisor or written designated
  representative is the only person authorized to procure and issue replacement tools. An
  inventory of all replacement tools is accomplished and documented quarterly.
  2.6. Post Aircraft taxi/Takeoff Procedures for Lost Tools: If a tool is discovered missing
  after the aircraft starts to taxi or during post takeoff, section supervisor is responsible for
  notifying MOC. The section supervisor will provide a description of the tool that was lost
  and the suspected location in the aircraft where the tool is believed to be located. MOC will
  notify at a minimum: the command post and the AC who will decide if returning to base is
  necessary.
  2.7. Inventory Procedures/Disposition.
     2.7.1. With the exception of items issued in TAS as Long Term Issue, turnover of
     CTK/items at the job site will be kept to a minimum. When the CTK is transferred
     between individuals at the job site, both individuals will perform a physical inventory and
     the responsibility for the CTK will change to the gaining individual. This exchange will
     be reflected on the AFRC Form 177, Consolidated Tool Kit Inventory and Control Log,
     maintained in the CTK. The gaining individual must take possession of the CTK in the
     TAS.
     2.7.2. When a aircraft CTK is turned over to the aircrew for flight, the flight engineer
     and the crew chief will inventory the toolbox and document an AFRC Form 177. After
     flight, the flight engineer and the crew chief will again inventory the toolbox and
     document the AFRC Form 177.
     2.7.3. Prior to shift change tool issue sections will perform a shift inventory of CTK’s
     and inform individuals and work centers of CTK’s/equipment that have not been
     returned.
  2.8. Lost Tool/Item Procedures.
     2.8.1. In the event of a lost tool after flight, by the aircrew, the aircraft commander or his
     representative will enter a red “X” discrepancy in the aircraft forms for the lost tool and
     initiate lost tool procedures IAW AFI 21-101 Chapter 10.
     2.8.2. If tools or other objects are lost and an aircraft is not involved, the flight chief
     determines if other work centers or staff agencies should be notified and directs efforts to
     find the tool.
     2.8.3. At the conclusion of the search for a lost tool or object, a copy of the AFRC Form
     174, Lost Tool/Object Report, will be forwarded to the Squadron Foreign Object Monitor
4                                                          919SOWI21-110 1 November 2011


       and Quality Assurance. The original report will be filed with the CTK custodian in the
       work center for one year from date of report.

Terms
Composite Tool Kit (CTK)—A controlled area or container used to store tools or equipment
and maintain order, positive control, and ease of inventory. CTKs are assembled as a kit and
designed to provide quick, easy visual inventory and accountability of all tools and equipment.
CTKs may be in the form of a toolbox, a shadow board, shelves, system of drawers (Stanley
Vidmar, Lista, etc.), cabinets, or other similar areas or containers. The CTK contains tools and
equipment necessary to accomplish maintenance tasks, troubleshooting, and repair.
Equipment Identification Designator (EID)—A number assigned to a piece of shop
equipment, used to track status and accountability.
Master Inventory List (MIL)—Primary source document for inventory of CTKs. The MIL
indicates the total number of items in each drawer or section of the tool kit. MIL may be
automated.
Tool Asset Management Software (TCMax)—Air Force approved system to track tools,
equipment, tool kits, HAZMAT items, and Technical Orders (TOs)
