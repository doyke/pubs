products on command aircraft that are not identified in the respective aircraft TO without prior
approval from HQ AETC/A4MSS and/or the applicable system program manager (SPM).
AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014                                                                         11


                                            Chapter 2

                PAINTING AND MARKING OF AEROSPACE VEHICLES

2.1. General. This chapter implements the guidance outlined in AFI 20-114. It provides
guidance for applying and maintaining aircraft topcoats and applying command-approved non-
USAF standard aircraft markings as authorized in TO 1-1-8-WA-1, Application and Removal of
Organic Coatings, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment, applicable to Air Force aircraft,
applicable aircraft-specific TOs and operational and ground trainer aircraft assigned to AETC.
(Note: Not applicable to static display aircraft. The owning unit’s history office manages static
display aircraft.)
2.2. Responsibilities. Wing commanders, group commanders, or equivalents, and aircraft
structural maintenance element chiefs are responsible for complying with the provisions of this
chapter. (Note: For the purpose of this instruction, when only a group is assigned; the group
commander assumes the wing commander role.) Only aircraft markings specifically authorized
by TO 1-1-8-WA-1, applicable aircraft-specific TOs, and this instruction can be applied to
aircraft. The AETC commander is the final approval authority for any paint scheme alteration on
assigned AETC aircraft which includes nose art and all other markings not authorized in the
applicable aircraft technical order and this instruction. HQ AETC/A4M is the final approval
authority for flagship selections and tail flash (tail stripe) designs that meet all specifications
stated within this instruction. HQ AETC/A4MSS is the point of contact for all aircraft painting
and markings as specified in this instruction. HQ ACC/A4MS is the point of contact for all
aircraft unit designators. Note: Process requests to this instruction according to paragraph 2.24.
2.3. Appearance Standards.
   2.3.1. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes must be maintained intact and be
   legible, distinct in color and present a professional appearance. Standardization of paint
   schemes and markings by MDS are of primary concern.
   2.3.2. Units must evaluate and document (score) the condition of aircraft topcoats at least
   twice yearly to determine soundness for corrosion protection and appearance standards
   (see paragraph 2.4 of this instruction for more information).
   2.3.3. Use touchup (sectional) painting to the maximum extent possible to maintain proper
   corrosion protection and appearance standards as opposed to full aircraft overcoats.
   2.3.4. Each unit must establish and manage an aircraft touchup program with the aim of
   maintaining a sound and serviceable topcoat. All command aircraft and helicopter units
   should plan to scuff, sand, and topcoat aircraft at least twice before considering a complete
   strip and repaint. Aircraft with predetermined paint cycles such as programmed depot
   maintenance (PDM), weapon-specific TO directives can base the paint cycle requirements
   according to those directives. Units should rely on touchup painting between scheduled PDM
   paint cycles for large aircraft, such as C-17, C-130, KC-46 and KC-135. Only authorized
   coatings identified in TO 1-1-8-WA-1 and/or weapon system specific directives can be used
   to touch up paint. (Note: Under no circumstances can spray paint in aerosol cans be used to
   topcoat aircraft or support equipment exteriors, unless authorized by specific directives.
 12                                                               AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014


      2.3.4.1. Maintain ground instructional trainer aircraft (GITA) according to this
      instruction (excluding the requirement to strip aircraft and the mandatory use of coating
      systems specified in TO 1-1-8-WA-1 or weapons system specific corrosion directives).
      2.3.4.2. A unit option is to topcoat GITA with a commercial direct-to-metal (DTM)
      paint. DTM paint is an acrylic latex paint that is easy to apply and environmentally
      friendly. DTM paint can be applied using a standard paint roller or brush and the aircraft
      does not require a painting facility. Note: Units that can maintain aircraft with current
      polyurethane paint are encouraged to do so, because DTM paint has a shorter service life
      and will require frequent touchups and/or repaints.
   2.3.5. Use polyurethane protective tapes for AETC aircraft when authorized as an option in
   the applicable aircraft -23 series TOs.
   2.3.6. Do not base the decision to strip an aircraft on timeframe alone. Base the decision to
   media blast on the following criteria.
      2.3.6.1. Aircraft must be top-coated a maximum of three times before being stripped; this
      includes the original paint. (EXCEPTION: T-6 aircraft will not be fully scuff-sanded and
      over coated without being completely stripped. The aircraft will not be stripped any
      sooner than the 8-year point unless approved by the T-6 SPM.)
      2.3.6.2. Strip aircraft as necessary to meet weight and balance requirements.
      2.3.6.3. Aircraft that have undergone or are scheduled for extensive structural
      modification and/or maintenance may be stripped at the discretion of the owning unit.
          2.3.6.3.1. Thoroughly inspect aircraft for structural defects at home station. Make
          every attempt to repair and/or document all structural defects before the aircraft
          departs home station.
          2.3.6.3.2. After stripping, regional facility personnel must accomplish minor
          structural repairs that can be accomplished within contract limitations. Aircraft found
          to have significant structural damage must be repaired at the expense of the unit or
          sent back to home station for repair.
      2.3.6.4. Do not strip aircraft within 3 years of programmed deactivation unless approved
      by HQ AETC/A4MSS.
   2.3.7. The responsibility for determining acceptable paint condition rests with wing
   commanders and fabrication flight chiefs ensuring the guidance set forth in TO 1-1-691, TO
   1-1-8-WA-1, applicable -23 series TOs, and this instruction is not violated.
   2.3.8. Document on AFTO 95, Significant Historical Data, each time a major paint touchup
   (painting of more than 40 percent of an aircraft), complete scuff sand, overcoat, overspray
   and/or complete stripping and repainting of an aircraft is accomplished. Refer to TO 1-1-8-
   WA-1 for additional information.
2.4. Aircraft Paint Scoring Procedures.
   2.4.1. Semiannually score and rank order aircraft using a locally developed paint scoring
   form or automated program. As a minimum, document a complete description of what type
   and where the defect exists, (peeling, flaking, oxidation, discoloration, and staining of the
AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014                                                                          13


   paint), and measure the degree of paint degradation on a scale from 1 to 5; the number 1
   indicates a good paint coat and number 5 indicates the worst.
   2.4.2. The corrosion control work center must document coating defects into a local tracking
   form or program for each aircraft; detail what type of paint deterioration and what areas of
   the aircraft need paint. These products must be kept on file until full strip and repaint is
   accomplished. All aircraft painting will be scheduled with a priority of “worst case” basis
   first. Note: F-35 aircraft do not require paint scoring.
2.5. Marking Application Methods. The following are approved methods for applying aircraft
markings to all AETC aircraft (refer to TO 1-1-8-WA-1 for more information):
   2.5.1. Silk Screen Printing. Do not use this method on aircraft surfaces that are contoured or
   have protruding screws, rivets or bolts that will result in illegible or unprofessional- looking
   markings. When used, procure silk screen printing kits using local purchase procedures with
   organizational and maintenance funds. Local contracting offices can identify vendors.
   2.5.2. Decals. Units are responsible for procuring their own organizational decals.
   2.5.3. Stenciling. Apply markings using stencils. All colors must conform to applicable
   technical data.
   2.5.4. Vinyl. Apply markings using vinyl decals generated on computerized stencil
   machines instead of stenciling with paint. (Note: These vinyl markings tend to peel when
   applied to porous paints such as camouflage or on supersonic aircraft.) Ensure materials are
   properly adhered to and colors conform to those prescribed in applicable weapon system
   technical data.
2.6. Command Insignia. Application of command insignia on USAF aircraft is mandatory. F-
16 and trainer aircraft must apply full color insignias; helicopters, low observable, and cargo
aircraft must apply subdued insignias, unless otherwise authorized. Specific application for each
MDS is located in Attachment 2. Note: Not applicable to special operations aircraft.
2.7. Organizational Insignia. Application of organizational insignias is optional; however, if
used standardize insignias throughout the wing. Apply organizational insignias to both sides of
the aircraft. If squadron insignias are not used, apply wing or group insignias to both sides of the
aircraft. Apply squadron insignias to the left side of the aircraft with the wing or group insignia
on the right side. Units not having organizational insignias may apply the next higher
organizational insignia. Specific application for each MDS is located in Attachment 2. Note: All
new designs will be routed through AETC/A4M for approval before being applied to aircraft.
2.8. Tail Numbers. Aircraft tail numbers are mandatory. The tail numbers must be located
below the unit designator on the vertical stabilizer and or tail-boom pylon. Specific placement
for each MDS is located in Attachment 2.
2.9. Unit Designator. Unit designators are mandatory for all AETC aircraft unless otherwise
authorized by AETC/CC. HQ ACC/A4MS is the office of primary responsibility for the
assignment of unit designators. Submit all requests for approval of unit designators through HQ
AETC/A4MSS to HQ ACC/A4MS. Specific placement for each MDS is located in Attachment
2. Note: Not applicable to special operations aircraft.
2.10. Tail Flashes (Tail Stripe). Tail flashes are used to identify a specific wing, group,
squadron, or flight. Wing commander’s may develop a tail flash design and request AETC/A4M
 14                                                                   AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014


approval for application. The wing commander may choose a single wing tail stripe design or
distinctive tail stripes for each squadron or flight. Submit AETC Form 1236, Request for
Improving/Changing AETC Maintenance Publication, to HQ AETC/A4MSS for AETC/A4M
approval. Apply the tail stripe to the vertical stabilizer and or tail-boom pylon. It must be in the
form of a straight stripe. The height must not exceed 15 inches for trainer, fighter aircraft, and
helicopters, or 24 inches for cargo and refuel aircraft. In addition, the tail stripe must not contain
more than four distinct colors. Variations in length, width, font size, font type, and colors added
to a previously approved tail stripe are not authorized. Specific placement for each MDS is
located in Attachment 2. Note: All other aircraft paint scheme alterations, markings, and nose
art; to include tail flash (not authorized in applicable TO or this instruction) will still require
approval by HQ AETC/CC.
2.11. Aircrew and Crew Chief Names. Unit options are to apply aircrew, crew chief, and
assistant crew chief names to aircraft. Aviator names are permitted for aircrew. Crew chief and
assistant crew chief names must consist of rank and name (first, last) only. Operations group
commanders (OG/CC) must approve or disapprove tasteful aviator names ensuring no discredit
is brought upon AETC, the Air Force, or the Department of Defense. Acceptable examples
include Captain William A. “Smitty” Smith and Major Wayne “Jonesy” Jones. Note: Tactical
call signs are prohibited.
   2.11.1. Lettering styles are unit options, but must not exceed 3 inches in height. All aircraft
   in the wing must be standardized by MDS with the exception of designated commander's
   aircraft, which may have different lettering that does not exceed 3 inches in height.
   2.11.2. A background block for the names may be used to encompass the names. The block
   must be in contrasting colors to the section applied and may be preceded by an eagle head,
   falcon head, tiger head, etc.
2.12. Commander’s Flagships. Commander’s flagships referred to in this instruction are those
aircraft selected to represent the commander’s position. Only MAJCOM, wing, operations group,
and flying squadron commanders are authorized designated flagships. (Note: “Flying squadron
commander” refers to a commander of a squadron with a flying mission.) If a flagship is
selected, only one aircraft is authorized per flying commander. Bases and units with more than
one type MDS assigned must select only one type aircraft for the wing and operations group
flagships. Flying squadron commanders may select one aircraft for designation as a flagship.
After selection, submit an AETC Form 1236 to HQ AETC/A4MSS for review. AETC/A4M is
the final approval for all flagship selections. Apply flagship markings as follows: Note: Any
flagship design not authorized by this instruction will require approval by HQ AETC/CC.
   2.12.1. Major Command (MAJCOM) Flagship. When approved by AETC/A4M, a
   MAJCOM commander's flagship may be authorized at the base where the commander is
   assigned. The aircraft tail number may be replaced by the command designator but must
   remain the same size as the original tail number. Move the tail number to another location on
   the aircraft, in a smaller size, on or as close to the vertical stabilizer as possible.
   2.12.2. Wing (FTW) Flagship. When approved by AETC/A4M, the tail number of the wing
   commander’s flagship number may be replaced by the organization alphanumeric designator
   (such as, 12 FTW), but must remain the same size as the original tail number. Move the tail
   number to another location on the aircraft, in a smaller size, on or as close to the vertical
   stabilizer as possible. Organizations may apply unit insignias to the aircraft. When used,
AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014                                                                             15


   place wing insignias on the right side of the aircraft with the owning squadron's insignia on
   the left side. A collage of assigned flying squadron insignias may be applied to the left side
   of the aircraft in place of a single squadron emblem.
   2.12.3. Operations Group (OG) Flagship. When approved by AETC/A4M, the tail
   number of the OG/CC flagship may be replaced by the group alphanumeric designator (such
   as, 12 OG), but must remain the same size as the original tail number. Move the tail number
   to another location on the aircraft, in a smaller size, on or as close to the vertical stabilizer as
   possible. Organizations may apply unit insignias to the aircraft. When used, place wing
   insignias on the right side of the aircraft with the owning squadron's insignia on the left side.
   A collage of assigned flying squadron insignias may be applied to the left forward area of the
   fuselage instead of a single squadron emblem.
   2.12.4. Flying Training Squadron (FTS) Flagship. When approved by AETC/A4M, the tail
   number of a flying squadron commander’s flagship may be replaced by the squadron
   alphanumeric designator (for example, 560 FTS), but must remain the same size as the
   original tail number. Move the tail number to another location on the aircraft, in a smaller
   size, on or as close to the vertical stabilizer as possible. Organizations may apply unit
   insignias to the aircraft. When used, place wing insignias on the right side of the aircraft with
   the owning squadron's insignia on the left side. A collage of assigned flying squadron
   insignias is not authorized on these aircraft.
   2.12.5. Shadowing. Shadowing of unit designators and tail numbers or organizational
   alphanumeric designators is authorized for all aircraft designated as flagships, at the wing
   commander's discretion. Apply shadowing in a conservative color that complements the
   overall paint scheme of the aircraft (normally black, white, or gray).
   2.12.6. Commander’s Unique Tail Flash (Tail Stripe). Tail flash design must be
   approved by AETC/A4M prior to application. The tail flash must meet the specifications
   outlined in paragraph 2.10 of this instruction.
2.13. Nose Art. Do not apply nose art to AETC assigned aircraft without approval of the
AETC/CC. If approved, the wing commander must select a candidate aircraft for application of
the approved nose art. All nose art must be in good taste, be representative of the local
community and be gender neutral. AETC assigned active aircraft shall not be used for
memorialization purposes. Note: Be aware of potential copyright infringement when selecting
nose art. It is highly recommended that nose art be applied to only one of the flagships
authorized in paragraph 2.12 of this instruction.
2.14. Aircraft Travel Pods. Paint travel pods the same color as the associated aircraft. For ease
of cleaning and appearances, units with aircraft painted in camouflage paint schemes may apply
gloss paint to travel pods, but it must match the color and paint design of the aircraft. Units with
multicolor aircraft must select one primary color for the travel pod. Travel pods designated for
commander flagships may be any color, but must complement the overall paint scheme of the
aircraft and present a professional appearance. These travel pods may contain the name, position,
and appropriate rank insignia of the pilot. Lettering must not exceed 4 inches in height and may
be any color and font style. Submit an AETC Form 1236, plus photographs to HQ
AETC/A4MSS for review and AETC/A4M approval.
 16                                                                AETCI21-106 4 JUNE 2014


2.15. Paint Identification Block. The paint identification block is mandatory for all aircraft
assigned to AETC. Apply as specified in TO 1-1-8-WA-1, including the last strip date. The block
may be of a unique design such as an eagle head, state outline, etc.; however, it must not exceed
6 inches by 6 inches in size and must match the color of other markings on the aircraft.
AETC/CC is the approval authority for all unique designs.
2.16. Aircraft Nose Numbers. Aircraft nose numbers are authorized as a unit option. Numbers
must be in block or Helvetica style letters, not exceed four digits and be applied to the nose of
the aircraft. Specific location for each MDS is located in Attachment 2.
2.17. Bird of Prey Silhouette. Bird of prey silhouettes are authorized on F-16 aircraft as a unit
option, standardized within a wing by MDS. Place the silhouette on both sides of the aircraft aft
canopy on the forward area of the backbone in a contrasting shade of gray to the area being
applied. The silhouette must not exceed 18 inches in height. See Attachment 2 for specific
placement.
2.18. Gun Ports. Gun ports may be painted flat black as a unit option. MDS standardization in
a wing is required. Do not polish gun ports on any aircraft due to corrosion considerations.
2.19. Aerial Victory Markings. AETC aircraft may include a 4-inch star to represent an aerial
victory. Position the star just below and forward of the canopy assembly. The credited pilot’s
name must appear as the pilot of the aircraft. Identify Desert Storm victories with a green star.
Aircraft that have flown combat missions and are credited with bona fide hits or kills may be
identified with a uniquely designed marking. This marking must be conservative in nature and
not exceed 4 inches by 4 inches. If multiple hits or kills are credited, a numerical indicator may
be added to the marking.
2.20. Special Award Markings. Units having local competitions for best flying aircraft, best
looking aircraft, etc., may apply a uniquely designed marking to the aircraft to denote winners.
Criteria for application must be the same as in paragraph 2.19 of this instruction.
2.21. Competition Aircraft. Units participating in competitions such as William Tell,
Gunsmoke, etc., must follow the guidelines established in the competition rules for aircraft
appearance. Note: Excessive painting is detrimental to an effective corrosion program; therefore,
complete overspray of selected competition aircraft is discouraged. Approach competitions with
a “come as you are” management perspective. The wing and operations group commanders are
responsible for ensuring the intent of this instruction is not violated. Note: AETC/CC will not
approve waivers for special paint schemes or markings for these aircraft.
2.22. Helicopter Rotor Markings. All helicopter rotor markings are mandatory.
2.23. Aircraft Transfer. The following markings must be removed prior to formal transfer of
aircraft to other units or MAJCOMs (aircraft retiring to AMARC need not have any markings
removed).
   2.23.1. Organizational insignias.
   2.23.2. Unit identifier.
   2.23.3. Tail stripe.
   2.23.4. Aircrew and crew chief names.
   2.23.5. Unit unique markings.

2.24. Requests. Wing commanders must submit all paint scheme/marking requests according to
policies established in this instruction on AETC Form 1236, through HQ AETC/A4MSS for final
approval. (Note: Requests violating published technical data will not be accepted. Changes to
technical orders must be processed according to TO 00-5-1-WA-1). Requests will be sent to
aetc.a4mss@us.af.mil and must include the following:
   2.24.1. A locally generated ESSS approved by wing commander                or    designated
   representative.
   2.24.2. A clear statement of present procedure and the marking at issue.
   2.24.3. A clear statement of proposed changes.
   2.24.4. Justification.
   2.24.5. Two high quality digital photographs; one of the aircraft with the present marking
   configuration and another of an aircraft with the requested change. Accomplish this by
   temporarily affixing the marking to the aircraft using double-back tape or by some similar
   method that does not require the marking to be applied permanently. Digital photographs can
   be e-mailed to aetc.a4mss@us.af.mil. The request must come from the unit’s wing
   commander or deputy’s e-mail address.
2.25. Aircraft Photo Requirements. Each assigned unit must submit a full-length photograph
of their selected flagship aircraft to HQ AETC/A4MSS. Digital photographs are acceptable and
can be e-mailed to aetc.a4mss@us.af.mil. When design changes to these paint schemes are
submitted and subsequently approved, new photos must be submitted for file within 30 days after
approval.

      COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONICS, AND METEOROLOGICAL (CEM)
                   ACTIVITIES AND EQUIPMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides CEM units with procedural guidance for establishing an
effective corrosion prevention and control program (CPCP) for all CEM equipment.
3.2. Responsibilities.
   3.2.1. Units. Units must establish a local CPCP that stresses prevention and control of
   corrosion through equipment cleanliness and timely detection and maintenance of protective
   finishes. Units may use the base CPCP applicable to the equipment being maintained when
   practical. If the base has a CPCP control board, the unit CPCP functional manager must
   request membership and attend those meetings that have communications and electronic
   equipment related topics.
   3.2.2. Work Center Supervisors. Work center supervisors must ensure prevention or
   treatment actions are taken and documented on all equipment and systems under their
   control. Personnel assigned to the maintenance production work center are responsible for
   inspecting assigned vehicles (such as, trucks, vans, mobilizers, trenchers, tractors, back hoes,
   cable plows, and trailers) for corrosion. Note: The base civil engineer (BCE) must be
   contacted before any maintenance is performed on conduits used with communication and
