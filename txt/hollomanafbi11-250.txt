This instruction complements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 13-204v3, Air Combat Command
(ACC) Supplement, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, Attachment 2, and
establishes policies and procedures for conducting airfield and flying operations at Holloman Air
Force Base (HMN). It provides descriptions of HMN air traffic control services, the local flying
area, and establishes procedures for the orderly control of all aircraft assigned to HMN or
operating in HMN airspace. It prescribes HMN standard flight operations as formulated by 49th
Wing (49 WG) Flight Managers, the Airspace Manager, and affected support agencies. This
instruction is directive in nature with intent to standardize local procedures while not restricting
mission accomplishment. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Contact supporting records managers
as required. Refer recommended changes and questions to the Office of Primary Responsibility

2.25. NOTAM Procedures. Tower is the NOTAM monitor facility for HMN.          AM
disseminates and issues NOTAM IAW AFI 11-208 (IP), Department of Defense Notice to
Airman (NOTAM) System. HQ ACC/A3AO TERPS will issue V series NOTAMs concerning
instrument procedures.
2.26. Flight Information Publication Accounts. AM will order FLIP and aeronautical charts
for HMN units according to established distribution procedures. Noncommissioned Officer in
Charge (NCOIC), AM Operations is responsible for preparing and coordinating FLIP changes to
be submitted according to General Planning. HMN AOF shall coordinate all procedural DoD
FLIP changes with HQ ACC/A3AO TERPS.
2.27. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures.
   2.27.1. ATC will issue variable wind information when there is a change in wind direction
   of 60 degrees or more when the wind speed is six knots. ATC will issue wind gusts to all
   aircraft when the peak exceeds the wind speed lull by 5 knots or more.
   2.27.2. AM is responsible for disseminating hazardous, severe weather and lightning
   information via the secondary crash net.
   2.27.3. Lightning procedures.
       2.27.3.1. Lightning Watch. Informative only and will be issued when lightning is
       forecast to be within 10 NM radius of the airfield in the next 30 minutes.
       2.27.3.2. Lightning Warning. Issued when lightning is observed within 5 NM of HMN
       airfield. When a Lightning Warning is issued, the following will be accomplished:
          2.27.3.2.1. Cease refueling and all airfield activity. Evacuate personnel from the
          airfield to indoor cover or within an airfield vehicle as a minimum.
          2.27.3.2.2. Aircraft WILL NOT be armed or de-armed. In the chocks, clear the crew
          chief off and remain running or shutdown and clear the airfield. The intent is to
          expeditiously get the crew chief off the airfield and to safety. If taxiing, contact SOF
          and expect guidance to either continue taxiing, return to arm/de-arm area (primary),
          or ramp (secondary).
       2.27.3.3. Aircraft WILL NOT takeoff, land or fly approaches at HMN during periods of
       lightning within 5 NM of the airfield area. If airborne, aircraft will hold until
       approaching divert fuel, then divert. If dire circumstances require an aircraft to land
       during lightning periods, the 49 OG/CC is the approval authority. This guidance does not
       preclude the SOF from making time-sensitive safety of flight decisions based on his/her
       situational awareness and Operational Risk Management assessment.
2.28. Transient Alert (TA). TA is available beginning at 0200L on Monday through 1800L
Friday and from 0800L-1500L on Saturday. Services and facilities available to support transient
aircraft are published in the IFR Supplement along with the current airport hours of operation.
2.29. Aircraft Servicing Priorities.
   2.29.1. The following priority list will be adhered to in case of simultaneous fuel support
   requests:
       2.29.1.1. Priority I – MedEvac/Alert aircraft.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                  15


       2.29.1.2. Priority II – President of the United States/Special Air Mission/AA Operations
       Directorate.
       2.29.1.3. Priority III – 96th Test Group (96 TG).
       2.29.1.4. Priority IV – 49 WG assigned aircraft.
       2.29.1.5. Priority V – GAF/Detachment 1, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (Det 1, 82
       ATRS).
       2.29.1.6. Priority VI – Transient aircraft.
   2.29.2. AM will determine and provide priority for special mission fuel requirements to the
   49th Logistics Readiness Squadron Fuels Service Center (49 LRS/LGRF) for appropriate

   2.29.3. The applicable operating plan will determine aircraft servicing priorities during real
   world contingencies.
2.30. Local Aircraft Priorities.
   2.30.1. ATC will provide highest priority to emergencies (declared IFEs and or emergency
   fuel aircraft) then to other missions identified in FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
   Aircraft on final inside 5 NM normally are not broken out for higher priorities. Local
   priority will be as follows unless otherwise directed by the Tower WS:
       2.30.1.1. FAA Flight Check aircraft.
       2.30.1.2. Minimum fuel aircraft.
       2.30.1.3. Actual flight test mission support (approaching critical test time).

       2.30.1.9. Locally assigned aircraft requesting Touch and Go/Low Approach landings.
       2.30.1.10. Transient aircraft conducting practice approaches. During periods of high
       traffic, transient aircraft should expect one approach to a full stop landing.
       2.30.1.11. HMN Aero Club aircraft.
       2.30.1.12. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Official USAF Auxiliary (Civil Air Patrol or
       “CAP”) aircraft may execute touch-and-go’s or low approaches on a non-interference
       basis. Civilian (non-AC and non-CAP) aircraft may execute a low approach only on a
       non-interference basis.
   2.30.2. Priority will be as follows if multiple aircraft are requesting pattern operations:
       2.30.2.1. Aircraft conducting certification or check ride.
       2.30.2.2. Aircraft requiring a certain amount of pattern work for upgrade training.
 16                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


      2.30.2.3. Aircraft needing patterns for currency.
      2.30.2.4. All aircraft requiring multiple patterns or special mission needs will contact the
      SOF 10 min prior to arriving in pattern airspace so the SOF can work with the Tower WS
      to determine aircraft priority. Advance notification and coordination is important to
      resolve/avoid conflicts. Ops Sups can assist SOF in priority coordination by relaying
      timely mission information.
2.31. Noise Abatement and Quiet Hour Procedures.
   2.31.1. The 49 OG/CC or designated representative must approve all takeoffs, landings, and
   low approaches (other than scheduled local flying and exercises to include approved
   Attachment 10 UAO Uncontrolled Airfield Operations) between 2230L-0600L.
   2.31.2. The 49 OG/CC or designated representative is the approving authority for quiet
   hours in recognition of DVs, ceremonies, etc.
   2.31.3. Avoid over flying the White Sands National Monument (WSNM) Visitor’s Center by
   at least 1500ft AGL or 1 NM (Figure 2.2.).

Figure 2.2. WSNM Visitor’s Center (Drawing not to scale).
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                17



                                           Chapter 3

                         AIRSPACE AND RANGE OPERATIONS

3.1. Airspace LOA and Certificates of Authorization.
   3.1.1. Airspace LOAs affecting HMN local flying airspace (Figure A3.1.) are located on the
   49 OSS/OSA SharePoint and WSRF Share drive. The 49 OSS/OSA SharePoint is accessible
   via the Holloman SharePoint website. Alternatively, contact AOF for all airfield and
   airspace related LOAs. IAW 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Letters of Procedures (LOP) are
   reviewed annually by AOF and updated as appropriate.
   3.1.2. HAM maintains and updates airspace Certificates of Authorization (COA) that
   directly impact HMN local flying area. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) units will inform
   Scheduling when planning on operating in National Airspace and adjacent ranges.
   Scheduling will coordinate with the FAA and ranges IAW established agreements. Unit
   schedulers will advise Scheduling no later than (NLT) two weeks prior to execution to allow
   time for proper coordination. Contact the HAM for copies of the COAs.
3.2. Airspace Sharing. If a user (requestor) wants to use airspace already scheduled by another
unit (owning unit), the requestor is required to coordinate approval with the owning unit to
use/share their airspace. If the owning unit approves airspace release to the requestor, both the
owning unit and requestor must contact Scheduling and notify them of the request, approval,
altitudes/airspace affected. Scheduling will pass this information to all applicable agencies.
   3.2.1. Procedures for unscheduled airspace events. When White Sands Missile Range
   (WSMR)/McGregor/Dona Ana airspace are scheduled by HMN flying units, Cherokee may
   authorized unscheduled aircraft access to the range given the following criteria:
       3.2.1.1. Aircrews will advise Cherokee that they are working with/co-sharing airspace
       with aircraft on range.
       3.2.1.2. Aircrews are responsible for de-confliction from other aircraft already on range.
       3.2.1.3. Cherokee WILL NOT provide any de-confliction instructions. However,
       Cherokee will issue current range restrictions if aircraft do not report the current
       restriction code.
       3.2.1.4. The intent of the abovementioned is to allow flexibility of airspace for real time
       mission changes and to prevent the loss of a training mission. The procedures are not
       intended for aircrews to circumvent pre-scheduling airspace with Scheduling. Time
       permitting, aircrews should follow standard airspace coordination procedures.
3.3. Range Operations.
   3.3.1. Local range operations will be IAW AFI 13-212, Holloman AFB (HAFB)
   ADDENDUM- A, Holloman Primary Training Ranges, and when inside WSMR airspace,
   WSMR Flight Safety Operational Plan (FSOP) governing the specific flight mission.
3.4. Local Flying Area. HMN local flying area is defined as a 200 NM radius from the HMN
TACAN, excluding Mexico’s airspace (Figure A3.1.).
   3.4.1. Avoidance Areas: (Figure A3.9.).
18                                                HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


     3.4.1.1. When sled track is in use, comply with restrictions issued by WSRF or
     Cherokee.
     3.4.1.2. WSNM Visitor’s Center (HMN 206/6), N32 45. 24 W106 10.04. Comply with
     restrictions in paragraph 2.31.3.

     3.4.1.4. Remain at least 3000ft AGL over Alamogordo White Sands Regional Airport
     (ALM). Use caution as parachute landings can occur at the White Sands Landing Zone
     seven days a week from sunrise to sunset. Coordinates of the landing zone are
     N32.881849, W105.977919. Maximum altitude of jumps will be 14,000’ MSL.
     Alternate drop zone is located at Griggs Field in Alamogordo.
     3.4.1.5. Remain at least 3000ft AGL over the Cloudcroft and High Rolls areas if possible
     (not applicable to helicopters).
     3.4.1.6. DO NOT fly within 25 NM of ELP VHF Omni-Directional Radio
     Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) (Channel 99) within Class E airspace without
     contacting ELP Approach Control.
     3.4.1.7. Maintain vigilance near Mesa Verde Ranch Strip (airfield Radial 033 at 5.9
     DMN final Runway 22).
     3.4.1.8. Aerial Cable. Crews shall stay above 9000ft MSL within 1 NM of the aerial
     cable. This 2.5 inch thick, 15000ft cable spans between Little Burro Mt (southwest end
     of cable - N33 36.5/W106 25.5 [HMN 340/47.85]) and Jim Peak (northeast end of cable -
     N33 37.5/W106 21.5 [HMN 345/47.9]) and presents a hazard to low flying aircraft. The
     site is located near the border of Lava East and Lava West at the northwest corner of
     Oscura (Figure A3.10., A3.11.).
     3.4.1.9. Chaff and Flare Restrictions. (Figure A3.12.).
        3.4.1.9.1. During all fire danger levels except for “Very High” and “Extreme”, in
        WSMR or R-5103 series, flares may be dropped from a minimum altitude of 2000ft
        AGL. Within designated impact areas of Red Rio, Oscura, and Yonder, aircraft are
        authorized to drop flares from a minimum altitude of 500ft AGL.
        3.4.1.9.2. In other Military Operations Areas (MOA) and Air Traffic Control
        Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) east of HMN (Cowboy, Beaks, Ancho, Pecos, and
        Talon), flares WILL NOT be deployed during periods of “Very high” or “Extreme”
        fire danger.
        3.4.1.9.3. In all designated training MOAs outside WSMR or R-5103 series, during
        periods of “High” fire danger, aircraft WILL NOT flare below 18000ft MSL. If fire
        danger is less than “High” then minimum altitude for flare release is 2000ft AGL.
        3.4.1.9.4. Aircraft are authorized to drop chaff in all WSMR airspace areas subject to
        the limitations of the current chaff permit. DO NOT release chaff within 60NM of
        ELP or ABQ ATC Radar facilities. All chaff use must be scheduled through WSMR.
     3.4.1.10. North/West Helicopter Corridors (Figure A3.13.) When operating in WSMR
     north of the 52 line, comply with Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) Airspace Schedule
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             19


      helicopter mission restrictions whenever the North or West helicopter corridors are
      active.
      3.4.1.11. THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) Minimum Operating Altitudes
      over THAAD. Current restrictions require military aircraft to maintain a minimum
      altitude of approximately 18000 ft AGL (23000 ft MSL) while operating in the vicinity of
      the THAAD radar sites in Yonder South (Figure A3.25.) and 5103B airspace (Figure
      A3.26.) This minimum altitude is based upon aircraft carrying electro-explosive devices.
      Presently, HMN RPAs do not carry any type of live weapons or devices activated by an
      electrical charge.
3.5. ATC Airspace.
   3.5.1. HMN Class D Airspace extends from the surface (SFC) up to and including 6600ft
   MSL (2500ft AGL) within a 4.8 NM radius of HMN and within 1 NM each side of the HMN
   ILS localizer northwest course extending from the 4.8 NM radius to 5.4 NM northwest of the
   airport excluding that airspace within a 2 NM radius of the ALM (Figure A3.2.).
      3.5.1.1. Unusual Maneuvers in Class D Airspace. Unusual maneuvers are not authorized
      in HMN Class D airspace except as specifically authorized by local operating procedures.
      Unusual maneuvers include any intentional maneuver involving an abrupt change in an
      aircraft's attitude, an abnormal altitude, or abnormal acceleration not necessary for
      normal flight. All requests must be coordinated through AOF and approved by 49
      OG/CC or designated representative.
      3.5.1.2. Airfield and Landing Restrictions. While heavy aircraft are holding in position
      for takeoff on Runway 22 approach end, aircraft conducting approaches to Runway 16
      will be limited to restricted low approaches due to the possibility of thrust-induced
      turbulence in the touchdown zone. Restricted low approaches are not authorized over
      aircraft in takeoff position.
   3.5.2. WSRF and Delegated Airspace. WSRF is located at WSMR. WSRF airspace is
   within the lateral limits described in Annex 1 of the Albuquerque (ABQ) LOA from SFC to
   22000ft MSL excluding airspace internally delegated to Arrival Control (Figure A3.3.).
      3.5.2.1. Arrival Control airspace is SFC to 12000ft MSL from the HMN TACAN 310
      radial clockwise to 065 radial within 27 NM, from the 065 radial clockwise to the 135
      radial within 15 NM, and from the 135 radial clockwise to the 310 radial within 20 NM.
      Arrival’s airspace does not include Special Use Airspace (SUA).
      3.5.2.2. VFR Training Areas. VFR training areas in HMN airspace are the AC training
      area southeast of HMN and AA/AC training area to the northeast (Figure A3.4.). Use of
      either VFR training area is coordinated real-time with WSRF and subject to restriction
      based on HMN runway configuration and traffic conditions.
      3.5.2.3. Civilian Flyway. A flyway for light aircraft extends between WSMR and Beak
      MOA/McGregor Airspace. It extends from JUPITER (HMN 357/90) through ALM to El
      Paso (ELP) (EWM, HMN 174/71). When possible, maintain VFR at or above 12500ft
      MSL in the civilian flyway for better ATC identification and de-confliction with civilian
      aircraft.
 20                                                HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


      3.5.2.4. Minimum Vectoring Altitudes (MVA). HMN DASR MVAs are shown in
      Figure A3.5. When the HMN DASR is in-operative and WSRF switches to Mosaic
      Mode (multi-sensor mode), MVAs will change as shown in Figure 3.6.
          3.5.2.4.1. WSRF may vector VFR aircraft at any altitude. Vectors do not imply an
          IFR clearance. The pilot is responsible for terrain and obstruction clearance. When a
          pilot cannot accept an ATC instruction because of terrain, weather, or obstructions,
          they shall advise ATC and obtain an acceptable instruction.
          3.5.2.4.2. VFR Climb/Descent Procedures. Aircraft departing or arriving HMN on
          an IFR clearance must use the terminology “VFR CLIMB/DESCENT” to operate
          below the MVA. Controllers will continue to issue traffic alerts, traffic advisories,
          sequencing, and other services requested by the pilots or as deemed necessary by the
          controller. Pilots on a VFR climb/descent are responsible for maintaining their own
          terrain, obstacle/cloud clearance, and to see and avoid other aircraft. On departure,
          pilots requesting to proceed direct to a fix below 12000ft MSL will automatically
          accept responsibility to maintain terrain clearance by requesting a VFR climb.
3.6. Restricted Airspace/SUA.
   3.6.1. WSMR. 96 TG aircraft and 96 TG sponsored aircraft will abide by applicable WSMR
   airspace directives for test aircraft. Where there is a conflict between those directives and
   this instruction, the WSMR directives take precedence for test aircraft.
      3.6.1.1. Several restricted areas are combined to form WSMR, to include R5103B/C and
      R5107A/K (at or above 13000ft MSL), R5107B, R5107C, R5107D, R5107E, R5107F
      (Jet Route J108/65), R5107G (Jet Route J166), R5107H, R5107J, R5109A, R5109B,
      R5111A, R5111B, R5111C, R5111D (Figure 3.7.).3.7.2.6.1. Cherokee provides airspace
      control to all of WSMR, R-5111, R-5109, R-5103 that has been released from Ft. Bliss,
      and Raptor airspace on an as scheduled basis.
      3.6.1.2. Entry Procedures: Establish radio contact with Cherokee prior to entering
      WSMR airspace. Report current airspace code to Cherokee on initial contact. RAPTOR
      mission aircraft will advise Cherokee of mission lead aircraft call sign. Cherokee will
      issue any updated restrictions to the mission lead aircraft.
      3.6.1.3. Exit Procedures: Advise Cherokee 5 minutes prior to exiting. Request approval
      from Cherokee prior to leaving assigned area. Aircraft shall rejoin and exit WSMR
      airspace prior to the end of area time. Airspace extensions must be coordinated through
      OSS Scheduling and, if airborne, issued by Cherokee. If unable to exit VFR below Class
      A airspace, obtain a clearance from Cherokee or ATC prior to departing the working
      area.
      3.6.1.4. Procedures during Cherokee closure:
          3.6.1.4.1. Aircrews must obtain specific permission from the WSMR Airspace
          Manager or designated representative to operate within R5107 when Cherokee is
          closed. That authority is not delegated to any 49 WG agencies.
          3.6.1.4.2. Flights going to Mesa shall enter at Gallagher; flights to Lava-Mesa shall
          enter at Canyon; and flights to Yonder shall enter at Capes.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                            21


         3.6.1.4.3. Flights entering or leaving Red Rio or Oscura from other than published
         entry points shall check in on Cherokee in the blind stating intentions.
         3.6.1.4.4. Flights will not enter early or extend beyond their scheduled range time.
         Flights WILL NOT enter any range in which other aircraft are present unless
         previously coordinated. If unable to enter, hold VFR or as directed by WSRF or
         ABQ Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) outside the restricted airspace until
         the airspace is clear of the other flight.
  3.6.2. R5107D, which HMN lies within, is broken up into Areas 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and must be
  reserved by Cherokee for R&D missions and Raptor missions (Figure A3.7. & A3.8.). When
  these portions of R5107D are active by Cherokee, it may prohibit instrument and radar
  approaches into HMN.
  3.6.3. ACC Working Areas. There are areas on range designated for use by military aircraft
  training flights also known as ACC Working Areas. These include Lava/Mesa, Casa, Red
  Rio, Oscura and Yonder, Yonder East, Yonder South. Red Rio and Oscura ranges are used
  for “hot” operations (i.e., dropping bombs, lasing, and firing ordinance).
  3.6.4. MOAs/ATCAAs. There are three MOAs northeast of HMN: Beak Alpha, Beak
  Bravo, and Beak Charlie from 12500ft MSL to 18000ft MSL. These are normally in use
  from 0600L through 1800L, Monday through Friday and other times by NOTAM.
  Additionally there are nine ATCAAs in the same vicinity, Beak A/B/C, Cowboy A/B/C and
  Ancho A/B/C 18000ft MSL and combined go up to 60000ft MSL.
  3.6.5. Joint Use Airspace and Working Areas are depicted in Figure A3.15., Pecos Airspace
  is depicted in Figure A3.16., Talon Airspace is depicted in Figure A3.17., and Figure A3.18.

            3.6.5.3.1.3. Ancho: Ancho will be scheduled as part of Raptor airspace (Figure
            A3.20.) or RPA transition to the Beaks/Cowboys ATCAA. Maintain last assigned
            altitude until cleared to enter by Cherokee.
            3.6.5.3.1.4. Talons: Follow stereo route. ABQ ARTCC will clear aircraft to
            enter.
        3.6.5.3.2. Exit Procedures: Contact ABQ ARTCC prior to recovery. DO NOT exit
        without a clearance.
            3.6.5.3.2.1. Beak: Remain level at 17000ft MSL within the Beaks until cleared
            by ATC and then resume the Beak Stereo recovery.
            3.6.5.3.2.2. Cowboy: Remain within Cowboy ATCAA until cleared to KARIE
            from the north, ZIPER from the east or as directed by ATC. DO NOT descend
            below the minimum Cowboy altitude until cleared.
            3.6.5.3.2.3. Ancho: Remain at or above 18000ft MSL and contact Cherokee for
            clearance out of the airspace. Expect to be issued routing to recover to HMN
            either from the north or the east. Do not expect to recover to HMN from directly
            over the field. Cherokee will transfer control to WSRF for sequencing into HMN.
            3.6.5.3.2.4. Talon (ABQ ARTCC): Recoveries from Talon High West and Talon
            High East will be at 19000ft MSL block 20000ft MSL until cleared to resume the
            Talon Stereo. A 20 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) arc off the CHISUM
            VORTAC, parallel to the northern border of Talon High West is set aside as an
            entry and exit corridor to and from Talon High East. Recovery from Talon West
            Low will be VFR or via continuance on filed instrument route (IR).
            3.6.5.3.2.5. Valentine MOA. If all flight members are in visual contact with the
            lead aircraft, lead will squawk the assigned Mode 3 code with Mode C on. If
            flight members separate in the area outside visual contact with lead,
            aircraft/elements will squawk assigned Mode 3 with Mode C on until rejoined
            with the lead aircraft. Valentine MOA is activated by NOTAM only.
  3.6.6. Centennial Bombing Range/R5103A/B/C (Figure A3.19.).
     3.6.6.1. Cherokee provides airspace control in Centennial/R5103C to aircraft not
     associated with Army Air Defense operations.
     3.6.6.2. Centennial Fly Area (CFA) is designated a protected operating airspace
     dedicated primarily to high speed strike aircraft when so scheduled with Fort Bliss Range
     Scheduling. The CFA altitudes are SFC to 30000ft MSL. Centennial Fly Area will be
     scheduled and transit through this airspace during scheduled operations windows shall
     not be allowed with the exception declared emergency and then only after notification of
     aircraft operating in the CFA. When scheduling Centennial range, fast moving aircraft
     will also request the Centennial Fly area. Aircraft will be scheduled to fly outside the
     Centennial Fly area but must observe all Ft Bliss restrictions as depicted in scheduling
     software currently in use and the “Restriction Page”. Top 3’s and aircrews will be
     notified that the CFA is active via comments in the “Operating Airspace” section of the
     daily Airspace Schedule available via scheduling software currently in use. Add new
     map in Figure 3.18.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                               23


     3.6.6.3. Entry Procedures: Enter only within scheduled range time and after receiving
     clearance.
     3.6.6.4. Radio Contact: Establish two-way radio communications with Cherokee prior to
     entering and departing R5103. Upon clearance to enter R5103, aircrews may push over
     to Range Operations Center (ROC) for real-time scoring of air-ground munitions (must
     be pre-coordinated through ROC). If the ROC frequency is not being used for JAWSS
     scoring, aircrews may use that frequency as a discrete frequency for air-to-air inter-flight
     communications.
     3.6.6.5. Exit Procedures: Notify Cherokee with your intentions prior to exiting the area.
     If unable to maintain Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), coordinate with
     Cherokee for an IFR pickup and recovery. DO NOT depart the range without clearance
     from the controlling agency.
  3.6.7. Raptor Airspace.
     3.6.7.1. RAPTOR airspace is defined as R5107C, R5107B, R5107E, R5107D, R5107J,
     R5107H, R5107F, R5107G, R5111A/B, R5107A, R5107K, R5103B, R5103C,
     VALMONT, COWBOY A/B/C, ANCHO A/B/C, and BEAKA/B/C MOA/ATCAA(s)
     (Figure 3.19.). For altitude information reference applicable LOPs.
     3.6.7.2. Raptor airspace is exclusively for the use of HMN assigned and HMN tenant
     units.
     3.6.7.3. Raptor Airspace Procedures.
         3.6.7.3.1. WSRF shall return RAPTOR airspace (excluding R5103 B/C and
         R5107A/K) to ABQ as soon as RAPTOR missions are completed.
         3.6.7.3.2. WSRF shall be open when RAPTOR airspace is released for RAPTOR
         missions.
         3.6.7.3.3. R5107D (defined as WSMR grid Papa to Tango, 28 to 50 and Quebec to
         Tango 24 to 28) airspace 10000ft MSL to 60000ft MSL, is available to be scheduled
         in conjunction with RAPTOR airspace.
         3.6.7.3.4. Whenever RAPTOR airspace is requested, Scheduling shall schedule
         R5107D with a floor of 10000ft MSL and place the request on the CSE Airspace
         Schedule. However, in order to use a lower altitude than the standard 18000ft MSL,
         the requesting Top 3 must gain final approval from the WSRF WS (DSN 258-8000)
         at least 1-hour prior to the mission start time. If unable to approve the request, then
         WSRF will issue an alternate altitude or a time restriction, if available.
         3.6.7.3.5. Real-time (unscheduled) requests for Areas 2 and 3 (Papa to Romeo, 28-
         50) at 10000ft MSL and above may be made by aircrew directly with WSRF. If
         traffic and weather permits, WSRF may authorize the use of the airspace.
         3.6.7.3.6. WSRF WS is the final authority on operations within R5107D and can
         deny or recall the airspace at any time if conditions require (i.e. weather or IFR
         operation). Cherokee will contact the lead aircraft on the appropriate working
         frequency passed by the aircraft (normally 342.4), via the Airborne Warning and
         Control System controller, or on 243.0.
 24                                                  HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


          3.6.7.3.7. For missions of more than three hours, scheduling shall coordinate with
          ABQ Airspace and Procedures Office (505-856-4533 or DSN 245-1453) at least
          SEVENTY TWO (72) hours before scheduled use of RAPTOR airspace.
   3.6.8. Supersonic Airspace.
      3.6.8.1. Supersonic operations are authorized in WSMR from 10000ft MSL to 60000ft
      MSL, Cowboy from 23000ft MSL to 60000ft MSL, R5103 B/C from 10000ft MSL to
      60000ft MSL, and Valmont from 18000ft MSL to 60000ft MSL (Figure A3.20.).
      3.6.8.2. Minimizing Sonic Boom Impact. The following three areas apply to all aircraft
      operating within the confines of Ancho, Cowboy and Beak airspaces.
          3.6.8.2.1. Area 1:

Table 3.1. Area 1.
                     SW corner           N33 15 W105 45
                     SE corner           N33 15 W105 32
                     NE corner           N33 38 W105 28
                     NW corner           N33 38 W105 48
          3.6.8.2.2. Area 2: 5NM radius circle with the center point at Carrizozo, N33 39.5 W
          105 53.
          3.6.8.2.3. Area 3:

Table 3.2. Area 3.
                     N33 11 W105 52
                     N33 01 W106 05
                     N32 50 W105 59
                     N32 51 W105 40
                     N33 05 W105 38
          3.6.8.2.4. Area 1 is subsonic ONLY.        Areas 2/3 is supersonic, NON-
          MANEUVERING flight above 23000ft MSL. NON-MANEUVERING is defined as
          no transition from subsonic to supersonic and no turning under G (level or
          descending) while supersonic.
          3.6.8.2.5. Approaching the confines of Area 1-3, pilots should not maneuver
          aggressively to avoid but instead decelerate and climb slightly to avoid “throwing”
          focused booms.
          3.6.8.2.6. Mission planners and all pilots are responsible to mitigate sonic boom
          exposure in these areas.
      3.6.8.3. Pilots will reference local instructions for details/additional restrictions prior to
      flying supersonic in the local airspace.
3.7. Fort Bliss - High Altitude Mountain Environmental Strategy (HAMETS).
   3.7.1. The HAMETS area is a helicopter training area located in the northern section of
   5103C. The area is designated a free fly area and is continuously active. Davis Dome/Bliss
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              25


   Radio provides advisory service to HAMETS aircraft. Cherokee must coordinate with Davis
   Dome/Bliss Radio prior to allowing an aircraft to transit the area. Helicopters will maintain
   at or below 1500ft AGL or 7500ft MSL. When HAMETS is active aircraft shall transit the
   HAMETS area at or above 8500ft MSL. Units can schedule the HAMETS area through 49
   OSS/OSOS if their mission requires access to the airspace. For real time crossing through
   the area, contact Cherokee who will in turn coordinate with Bliss Radio for availability.
   3.7.2. HAMETS area has two ingress and egress routes from Ft. Bliss proper, the White
   Corridor on the eastern boundary of 5103C and the Red Corridor on the western boundary of
   5103C. These corridors are active from the SFC to 800ft AGL and must be avoided by non-
   HAMETS aircraft except during the times and for the missions that the Centennial low-level
   entry has been scheduled.
3.8. Low Level Routes.
   3.8.1. Procedures: Visual Route (VR)-176, Instrument Route (IR)-133, IR-134, IR-142, IR-
   192, IR-194, or IR-195 can be filed by local stereos or Department of Defense (DD) Form
   175, Military Flight Plan for other entries and exits. All routes must be scheduled through
   49 OSS/OSOS.
   3.8.2. Aircrews using low-level routes are responsible for all military training route
   procedures in FLIP Area Planning 1B. MARSA applies at the entry point, alternate entry
   point, along the route, and at the exit and alternate exit points. Avoid all noise sensitive
   areas.
   3.8.3. Expect clearance from ABQ ARTCC for VR176. Expect en route entry clearance
   from WSRF for IR-133, IR-134, IR-192, IR-194 and IR-195. If unsure of clearance into
   route, contact ATC.
   3.8.4. Clearance for VR-176 and IR-133 stereo does not mean that Cherokee has approved
   entry into R5107B or R5107H. DO NOT enter WSMR airspace without Cherokee approval.
   For IR-134P, maintain 12000ft MSL until point Alpha.
   3.8.5. Clearance to fly IR-134, IR-192, IR-194, or IR-195 does not authorize entry into
   R5103 B/C. DO NOT enter R5103 without approval from the controlling agency.
   3.8.6. Information on bird hazards and periods of peak activity is available for low-level
   routes on the following U.S. BASH website: http://www.usahas.com.
   3.8.7. R5113, on VR-176 will be avoided. Within that restricted area are several aerial
   cables and antennas that are not adequately described in AP/1B Chart (Western US) or the
   IFR Enroute Low Altitude Chart L-4. Aircrews will take extra caution when operating in the
   vicinity of R5113.

                                   GROUND OPERATIONS

5.1. Engine Test and Run-up Procedures.
   5.1.1. Engine Run-up Areas: Engine run-up areas are located on Runway 25 approach end,
   Runway 34 approach end, on run-up pad west of Taxiway Hotel near building 801, and Pad
   19.
   5.1.2. Reciprocating or Turboprop Run-up: Designated location is 200ft short of the VFR
   hold lines for Runway 16/34 at Taxiways Alpha and Delta. Run-up for Runway 07/25 is at
   Taxiway Bravo favoring the infield edge of the taxiway. For all other runways, run-up on
   appropriate taxiway or approach end of runway as approved by AM.
   5.1.3. Military Power Engine Runs: Suppressed engine runs required for maintenance may
   be accomplished during quiet hours. Non-suppressed engine runs will only be accomplished
   on the first 1000ft of the approach end of any runway to avoid surface damage. Non-
   suppressed engine runs must be approved by 49 OG/CC or designated representative if
   conducted outside of wing flying hours or during quiet hours. Coordinate all requests for
   military power engine runs by transient aircraft through AM (DSN 572-5411). AM will
   determine the location for transient engine runs and AM will advise Tower of time, location,
   and call sign.
5.2. Aircraft Special Operations Areas and Ramps.
   5.2.1. Drag Chute Jettison Areas: All aircraft will maintain chutes until parking. If chute
   must be jettisoned prior to parking, coordinate with AM or Tower for area to jettison chute.
   5.2.2. Hot Pit Refueling Areas: Alpha Arm/De-Arm, Hotel Arm/De-Arm and Main Ramp
   Alpha row.
   5.2.3. Live Load Areas: GAF Live Load, ECHO LOLA.
5.3. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements and Routes.
   5.3.1. Taxi speed is restricted to a maximum of 30 knots on all taxiways. DO NOT exceed
   10 knots ground speed in parking areas, ramps, and in the West Ramp.
   5.3.2. Only base assigned aircraft that are approved to park in the West Ramp may taxi
   through the West Ramp (refer to paragraph 2.10.).
   5.3.3. Taxiway Golf Hot Spot. Tower will issue specific runway exiting and taxi
   instructions before aircraft exit Runway 22 or before aircraft enter Taxiways Golf and
   Romeo.
   5.3.4. Taxi routes will be per Tower instructions.
   5.3.5. Pilots will ensure taxi de-confliction from heavy aircraft jet thrust.
   5.3.6. Wing Tip, Jet Blast, and Parking Restrictions. HMN Master Aircraft Parking Plan is
   maintained IAW AFI 13-204v3, ACC Supplement using UFC 3-260-01. This plan ensures
   wingtip clearances, jet blast safe distance requirements, and parking restrictions are
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                29


   maintained to protect personnel, aircraft, facilities, and equipment. HMN Master Aircraft
   Parking Plan is maintained by AM.
   5.3.7. Precision Approach Critical Areas. When weather conditions are reported to be less
   than an 800ft ceiling and/or visibility is less than 2 SM, Tower will protect the ILS Critical
   Areas IAW AFI 13-204v3 ACC Supplement I. An Instrument Hold Line is located on
   Taxiway Delta to protect Runways 16 and 22 Glideslope signals and both Precision Obstacle
   Free Zones (POFZ). See Figure 2.1. for location. When weather dictates, Tower will
   broadcast “INSTRUMENT HOLD LINE IN EFFECT” on Tower frequencies.
5.4. Startup/Taxi Procedures.
   5.4.1. Monitor ATIS prior to calling for IFR/VFR clearance or taxi instructions.
   5.4.2. Contact Clearance Delivery no earlier than 30 minutes prior to proposed departure
   time. If your departure time has changed from your original proposed time, notify Clearance
   Delivery on initial call-up.
      5.4.2.1. Request VFR/IFR departures with Clearance Delivery.             Include proposed
      departure time, type, number in flight, and intentions.
   5.4.3. Call Ground Control for taxi instructions prior to taxiing.
      5.4.3.1. Inform Ground Control of any special requirements such as non-standard
      departures.
      5.4.3.2. Include call signs of other flight members if not filed as a single flight.
      Example: “GROUND, CHAP11 WITH JUDGE01, TAXI WITH ALPHA FROM SPOTS 2
      AND 5…”
      5.4.3.3. Use the arm/de-arm nearest the departure runway unless mission needs dictate
      otherwise.
5.5. General Departure Procedures.
   5.5.1. Contact Tower when ready for departure. When cleared for takeoff, the pilot will
   acknowledge clearance and departure runway. If instructed to hold short of the runway or
   line up and wait, the pilot will acknowledge the instructions verbatim. When Tower instructs
   the pilot to change or contact departure, the pilot will change to the assigned frequency given
   them by Clearance Delivery.
5.6. Line Up Procedures.
   5.6.1. Line up IAW applicable aircraft flight manual directives except during dual runway
   operations with Runway 22 departure and Runway 16 arrival or Runway 16 departure and
   Runway 22 arrival, aircraft will line up at the intersection of Runway 22 and Taxiway Echo
   or 2000ft down Runway 16 as applicable. Any aircraft requesting full length on Runway 16
   or Runway 22 will advise Tower as soon as possible after completion of EOR checks.
   5.6.2. When QF-4 drone aircraft are on final to Runway 04, all aircraft departing Runway 16
   will line up with the last flight element no further north than the BAK-12 located 1500ft from
   Runway 16 threshold.
   5.6.3. Takeoff restrictions:
 30                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


       5.6.3.1. For BAK-15 barrier equipped runways, Tower will ensure the BAK-15 barrier is
       raised prior to T-38 departures. For Tornado initial departures, the BAK-15 will be in the
       lowered position. If the controller is unable to lower the BAK-15 due to equipment
       malfunction or other operational priorities, controllers will issue an advisory that the
       BAK-15 is in the raised position.
       5.6.3.2. Tower and WSRF approval is required for maximum performance climbs.
   5.6.4. Aborting Takeoffs:
       5.6.4.1. Aborted takeoffs automatically cancel takeoff clearance for all remaining
       stationary elements in the flight. If any element of the flight has begun takeoff roll, the
       decision to continue takeoff or abort rests with the pilot in command. Takeoff clearance
       for any remaining elements must be re-issued prior to re-attempting takeoff.
       5.6.4.2. If conditions permit, pilots will call “BARRIER, BARRIER, BARRIER,” or
       “CABLE, CABLE, CABLE, RUNWAY (name)” on Tower frequency if a barrier or cable
       engagement is anticipated.
   5.6.5. Intersection Departures. The distance remaining from intersection to end of runway
   are not issued to locally-assigned aircraft to include AC unless requested by the pilot.
   Departure from the following intersections:
       5.6.5.1. Runway 16 from Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot – 8150ft remaining.
       5.6.5.2. Runway 16 from intersection of Runway 07/25 – 5750ft remaining.
       5.6.5.3. Runway 34 from Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot – 3950ft remaining.

                                     VFR PROCEDURES

6.1. VFR Stereo Departures. (See 49 WG IFG).
   6.1.1. Aircraft wishing to fly directly into WSMR Restricted Airspace will file a Romeo or
   Yonder Departure through squadron operations. Squadron operations should include number
   of aircraft in flight, proposed departure time, and destination within WSMR airspace.
   Requests for Romeo and Yonder departures may also be made directly with Clearance
   Delivery, but aircraft should expect a delay prior to clearance being issued due to required
   coordination with AM.
       6.1.1.1. On departure, contact Cherokee for clearance into the work area. Departure
       approval is void if not airborne within 5 minutes prior to or 15 minutes after proposed
       departure time. Romeo and Yonder Departures are not authorized for range crossings
       and may only be used from Runway 04 and Runway 07 with Tower approval. If range
       crossing is desired, specifically request VFR range crossing.
       6.1.1.2. Romeo Departure aircraft will depart VFR on the Romeo line (3 NM west of
       Sled Track) to Salinas Corridor, then to assigned work area at or below 8500ft MSL.
       Romeo Departures are not authorized when a lost link RPA is orbiting at the Last Six (see
       A9.9.1.).
       6.1.1.3. Yonder aircraft will depart VFR and proceed westbound (into Yonder airspace)
       at or below 8500ft MSL.
6.2. VFR Departures to ELP.
   6.2.1. Fly the appropriate VFR altitudes en route from HMN to ELP in the VFR corridor.
   Remain clear of ALM. Follow the railroad tracks south to ELP remaining within 2 NM west
   of the railroad tracks. The VFR corridor is bounded by R5107A to the west and R5103B/C
   to the east. DO NOT fly east of the railroad tracks until reaching EWM. This is a civilian
   flyway with potential live missile firings conducted on either side. If possible, maintain at or
   above 12500ft MSL for better radar identification and de-confliction with light aircraft.
   Contact ELP Approach Control abeam Oro Grande if radar services are not being provided
   by WSRF. For return to HMN, follow the VFR corridor northbound and call WSRF abeam
   Oro Grande if ELP Approach is not providing radar services. Helicopters are exempt from
   altitude restrictions.
6.3. Position Reporting.
   6.3.1. Position Calls: When possible, use DME for all position calls. Runway 34 visual
   straight-in final will always be DME due to the position of the TACAN on the airfield.
   Aircraft reporting 90-to-initial are not acknowledged by Tower.
   6.3.2. Initial Aircraft Contact: Initial contact with applicable information, to include call
   sign, number of aircraft in flight, position, pattern/approach request, and type landing.
6.4. VFR Recoveries.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                33


   6.4.1. Pilots returning to HMN VFR will contact WSRF NLT than 20 NM from HMN with
   intentions. Pilots leaving SUA will obtain current ATIS and contact WSRF or ABQ ARTCC
   prior to leaving the SUA. When possible, maintain 300 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS)
   when proceeding to initial or slow to 250 KIAS for straight-in.
6.5. Radar Vector to Initial/VFR Straight-In.
   6.5.1. Aircraft may request vectors to initial or VFR straight-in for any runway, except
   restrictions IAW paragraph 6.7.3. IFR aircraft recovering to the VFR traffic pattern,
   requesting initial or VFR straight-in will advise WSRF of cancellation of IFR or will report
   the airport/VFR reporting point in sight no later than 15 DME. A pilot report of the
   airport/VFR reporting point in sight will constitute automatic cancellation of IFR flight plan.
   Upon receiving a pilot report of the airport/VFR reporting point in sight and leaving Class A
   airspace, WSRF will no longer provide standard IFR separation, but will provide basic radar
   service, sequencing, and advisories until frequency change to Tower. Exception to automatic
   IFR cancellation procedures are GAF aircraft flying nighttime overheads will remain IFR
   until reporting initial/3 NM final.
6.6. TULA Recovery to Runway 16 (Figure 6. 1.). Tula Peak or direct to outside downwind
only.

Figure 6.1. Runway 16 TULA Recovery (Drawing not to scale).




   6.6.1. To enter the Runway 16 VFR pattern from the north, aircraft will be at 6100ft MSL at
   Tula Peak and report initial. For a visual straight in, aircraft will be at 5600ft MSL at Tula
   Peak and report 5 NM final.
   6.6.2. To enter Runway 16 VFR pattern from the south or east, request direct to outside
   downwind from WSRF. Tower will sequence aircraft into outside downwind as conditions
 34                                                  HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   permit. When cleared, enter outside downwind at 6100ft MSL while visually clearing for
   traffic. Follow the pattern to initial or straight in transition. If unable to be sequenced in to
   the outside downwind, proceed VFR to Tula Peak.
6.7. GAP Recovery to Runway 22 or Runway 25 (Figure 6. 2.).

Figure 6.2. Runway 22 and 25 GAP and GORDO Recoveries (Drawing not to scale).




   6.7.1. Aircraft recovering to the VFR pattern from the north for Runway 22 or Runway 25
   will report GAP.
   6.7.2. Initial Transition: Aircraft should be at 6100ft MSL at Gap. From Gap, turn direct
   downtown Alamogordo (approximate heading 135). For Runway 25, proceed south,
   paralleling Highway 54/70, 1 NM to the west. Turn right to intercept 4-5 NM initial Runway
   25                                                                                      or
   Runway 22 then report initial.
   6.7.3. Straight-In Transition: Same as initial except cross Gap at 5600ft MSL. Straight-In
   Transition is not authorized to Runway 25 except for emergencies, hung ordnance, check
   rides, or when approved by the SOF.
6.8. GORDO Recovery to Runway 25 (Figure 6. 2.).
   6.8.1. VFR traffic from south or east of the airfield can request Gordo if the active runway is
   Runway 25 and traffic allows. If cleared to Gordo, arrive over Gordo at 6100ft MSL.
   6.8.2. Initial Transition: Turn direct to the airfield and intercept initial Runway 25. Report 3
   NM initial.
   6.8.3. Straight-In Transition is not allowed to Runway 25 except for emergencies, hung
   ordnance, check rides, or when approved by the SOF.

6.12. VFR Pattern Weather Minimums.
   6.12.1. VFR weather minimums - 1500ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility unless otherwise stated
   below:
       6.12.1.1. Overhead Pattern – 3000ft AGL (7100ft MSL) ceiling and 5 SM.
       6.12.1.2. Rectangular Pattern – 3000ft AGL (7100ft MSL) ceiling and 5 SM.
       6.12.1.3. Straight In (Outside downwind) Pattern – 3000ft AGL (7100ft MSL) ceiling
       and 8 SM.
          6.12.1.3.1. When weather minimums are at least 2000ft AGL (6100ft MSL) ceiling
          and 8 SM visibility, an amended straight-in pattern may be flown at 5600ft MSL.
          The same outside downwind and rectangular pattern ground track will be used. There
          is no break out available and no more than four aircraft may be in this pattern at any
          given time.
       6.12.1.4. Periods of Civil Twilight are considered daytime.
6.13. VFR Traffic Patterns. The following general pattern information applies to all runways.
See paragraph 6.13.6. for specific pattern information. See Attachment 9 for RPA specific
pattern information.
   6.13.1. Overhead Pattern. Pattern altitude (initial) is 6100ft MSL and airspeed is 300 KIAS.
       6.13.1.1. Initial point for all runways is 3 NM from the approach end. At initial, pilots
       will report: “(call sign), INITIAL, (full stop/touch and go/low approach/option)”.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                               37


     Standard break is away from the West Ramp (Runway 16/34 east, Runway 22/04 25/07
     north). Tower may change direction of breaks when necessary.
     6.13.1.2. Tower will respond with “(call sign) REPORT BASE” may be followed with
     “BREAK MIDFIELD/DEPARTURE END” or with sequencing instructions “BREAK TO
     FOLLOW” or “CARRY INITIAL STRAIGHT THROUGH”. If Tower does not respond
     with any of the above, carry initial straight through, DO NOT break. To carry initial
     straight through, remain at 6100ft MSL, continue to departure end then turn to enter the
     outside downwind. When turning base, fly the final turn to roll out on a 1 NM final at
     300ft AGL. Request to return to radar should be made no later than base turn.
     6.13.1.3. Tactical Initial. Request tactical initial upon initial contact with WSRF.
     Maximum flight size will be four aircraft and maximum speed is 350 KIAS. Formation
     will be within 6000ft unless otherwise coordinated. For formations instructed to carry
     initial straight-through, tactical initial is automatically terminated and the flight should
     rejoin as elements as soon as practical.
     6.13.1.4. Nighttime Overhead. MQ-1, MQ-9, GAF Tornado aircraft and the 586th Flight
     Test Squadron (586 FLTS) may conduct night overhead and closed patterns provided
     they are conducted for training or syllabus requirements. All other aircraft must have
     OG/CC approval to conduct overhead patterns at night. After 2200L, night overheads
     shall be conducted to Runway 22. Overheads WILL NOT be conducted after 2230L.
     See Attachment 9 for RPA nighttime overhead procedures. Tower has the authority to
     decline night overhead patterns.
         6.13.1.4.1. Night overheads will only be flown to Runway 16/34 or 22. The
         minimum operational airport lighting requirements are HIRL, PAPI, and Runway
         Threshold Lights.
         6.13.1.4.2. Maximum of four aircraft in the night overhead/rectangular pattern.
         6.13.1.4.3. GAF aircraft flying overhead patterns at nighttime will be IFR until
         reporting initial point.
         6.13.1.4.4. Outside downwind not available for reentry at night.
         6.13.1.4.5. All night break outs will return to arrival for re-sequencing. When Tower
         advises an aircraft to “BREAK OUT”, the following procedures apply:
            6.13.1.4.5.1. Prior to the break point aircraft will climb to 6600ft MSL, continue
            to 5 DME, and contact arrival.
            6.13.1.4.5.2. Runway 16/34 Break-Out: Climb to 6600ft MSL runway heading.
            Execute Local Climb-out (paragraph 7.7.) and contact WSRF for re-sequencing.
            6.13.1.4.5.3. Runway 22 Break-Out: Climb to 6600ft MSL runway heading.
            Execute Local Climb-out (paragraph 7.7.) and contact WSRF for re-sequencing.
  6.13.2. Rectangular (Closed Traffic) Pattern. The standard direction of turns is away from
  the West Ramp (Runways 16/34 east, Runways 22/04 and 25/07 north). Tower may change
  direction of the turns when necessary. The inside downwind ground track is displaced 1 NM
  from the runway. Pilots WILL NOT enter the rectangular pattern without Tower approval.
     6.13.2.1. Rectangular Pattern altitudes are:

             Helicopters 4600ft MSL.
      6.13.2.2. When turning base, pilots should fly their final turn to roll out on a 1 NM final
      at 300ft AGL. Request to return to radar should be made no later than base turn. Initiate
      closed pattern only after instructed by Tower, normally at departure end of runway or the
      extreme west end Taxiway Golf for Runway 25.
   6.13.3. Protection of the 360 Degree Overhead Pattern. After completing approach,
   maintain at or below 5600ft MSL until departure end unless otherwise directed by Tower.
   Advise Tower of intentions (i.e., request closed traffic, re-enter, re-enter straight-in). For
   Runway 25, maintain at or below 5600ft MSL until west end of Taxiway Golf.
   6.13.4. Go Around and Break Out.
      6.13.4.1. Standard Go-Around: For Tower issued or pilot initiated go around, the pilot
      will maintain at least 500ft vertical separation from aircraft on the runway (DO NOT
      overfly the aircraft on the runway). Remain below 5600ft MSL until departure end or the
      west end of Taxiway Golf if using Runway 25. If an aircraft is cleared for a restricted
      low approach, ATC will issue the appropriate altitude to maintain.
      6.13.4.2. Standard Breakout: Pattern breakouts will climb to 6600ft MSL in the
      direction of the pattern until clear of the outside downwind. Aircraft shall be wings level
      prior to 90-to-initial and orbit at 6600ft MSL until approved by Tower to re-enter.
      6.13.4.3. Tower shall include the reason for the go-around or breakout when able.
   6.13.5. Gear reports: Pilots will report position, gear down, intentions and runway.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     IFR PROCEDURES

7.1. Local IFR Departure Procedures.
   7.1.1. Runways 04 and 07 have no published IFR procedures.
   7.1.2. Runways 16, 22, and 25 use CLOUD FOUR ALPHA or CLOUD FOUR BRAVO
   departure IAW FLIP. The CLOUD FOUR CHARLIE is also available for Runway 25 only
   IAW FLIP.
   7.1.3. Runway 34 use HIGGY TWO departure IAW FLIP.
   7.1.4. Restrictions: When restricted area R5107D Area 2 and/or Area 3 are active, IFR
   departures may or may not be authorized from Runway 22 and Runway 25 due to separation
   requirements associated with SUA. If Cherokee cannot approve an IFR departure, Clearance
   Delivery will advise, “DUE TO RESTRICTED AIRSPACE 5 NM WEST OF THE FIELD,
   VFR DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED OFF RUNWAY 22/RUNWAY 25”. If instructed to depart
   VFR due to Areas 2 & 3 airspace separation, turn left to avoid the eastern boundary of these
   areas (approximately 5 DME west of HMN), DO NOT cross the extended centerline of
   Runways 16/34 until above 6600ft MSL and proceed VFR. If an IFR pick-up is required,
   proceed on a northeasterly heading to Cloud. Expect IFR pickup when clear of the restricted
   areas and above the applicable MVAs. If weather dictates Instrument Meteorological
   Conditions (IMC) flight, expect a departure from Runway 16 or Runway 34.
   7.1.5. Night/IFR. The following night/IFR plan is designed for F-22A operations but may
   be used by any aircraft that requests it. This will be all encompassing for IFR departures (not
   only night). The following night/IFR procedures are based on airspace and runway in use.
      7.1.5.1. RAPTOR EAST: file and fly a BeakCC stereo as described in the 49 Wing
      Inflight Guide (49 WG IFG).
      7.1.5.2. 5103C/B: file and fly a BeakCC stereo as described in the 49 WG IFG. At or
      prior to CLOUD, coordinate with Departure Control to turn direct to 5103C/B.
      7.1.5.3. YONDER: file any IFR stereo departure (BeakCC, Gallager 1, etc) that will
      allow aircrew to takeoff and enter IFR if radar vectors cannot be issued. This will be
      utilized for Runway 22 or 25 departures. On initial contact with Clearance Delivery,
      aircrew/flights will state: “CLEARANCE DELIVERY, (call sign) REQUEST RADAR
      VECTORS INTO YONDER”. Clearance Delivery will respond “(call sign) ON
      DEPARTURE FLY HEADING XXX, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN XXXXX, DEPARTURE
      FREQUENCY CHANNEL 4 SQUAWK XXXX”. Aircraft must takeoff on departure
      frequency when IFR.
      7.1.5.4. LAVA/MESA: file and fly a Gallagher 1 as described in the 49 WG IFG. If
      yonder is available, aircrew members have the option to file the same as 7.1.5.3.
   7.1.6. Local Climb-out (see paragraph 7.7.) may be requested on initial departure for IFR
   pattern delays, expedited routing, active airspace avoidance, etc.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                               47


7.2. Non-Standard Formation Departures. Advise Departure Control of nonstandard
formation. For nonstandard formation departures, lead aircraft will squawk the Identification
Friend or Foe (IFF) mode 3C code assigned. Last trailing flight element will squawk 4000.
Flight leads will advise ATC once standard formation is achieved.
7.3. Local IFR Arrival Procedures.
   7.3.1. The preferred IFR recovery procedure is the North Recovery (Figure 7.1.) Unless
   otherwise specified, ATC clearance for the North Recovery is an IFR clearance authorizing
   the aircraft to proceed direct to SPNGS (HMN 357/40) at 12000ft MSL. At SPNGS, proceed
   direct HIGGY (HMN 357/22). Cross HMN 357/34 at or above 10400ft MSL and then
   descend to cross HIGGY at or above 9400ft MSL. If IMC at HIGGY, proceed with the
   instrument approach as cleared.
       7.3.1.1. Departing the working area, pilots will check in with “(call sign), (current ATIS
       information) REQUESTING NORTH RECOVERY, (preferred instrument approach),
       (type landing).” When able, WSRF shall give the clearance for both the North Recovery
       and the instrument approach at the same time.
       7.3.1.2. Arrival Clearances will depend on the landing runway:
          7.3.1.2.1. Runway 16: “(call sign), CLEARED TO HOLLOMAN VIA THE NORTH
          RECOVERY, CLEARED (requested approach).” After HIGGY, aircraft will maintain
          9000ft MSL until JEMTO/FODSU then descend IAW the instrument approach
          procedure.
          7.3.1.2.2. Runway 22 and Runway 34: “(call sign), CLEARED TO HOLLOMAN
          VIA THE NORTH RECOVERY, CROSS HIGGY AT 13,000 CLEARED (requested
          approach).” Aircraft will follow routing listed in paragraph 7.3.1. (SPNGS to
          HIGGY) at 13000ft MSL until HIGGY and then descend IAW instrument approach
          procedure.
          7.3.1.2.3. Runway 25: WSRF will give clearance listed above and issue circling
          instructions at the same time. i.e. “(call sign), CLEARED TO HOLLOMAN VIA THE
          NORTH RECOVERY, CROSS HIGGY AT 13,000 CLEARED (requested approach),
          CIRCLE EAST OF THE RWY FOR A RIGHT BASE RWY 25”. Aircraft will follow
          the procedure outlined above and circle as directed.

7.5. Practice Circling Approach.
   7.5.1. Practice circling approaches in VFR conditions may be flown to any runway with
   published circling minimums.
   7.5.2. Once approved, begin circling between 5 and 2 NM final and maintain at or below
   5600ft MSL during the circling approach maneuver.
   7.5.3. Circling approaches are not authorized west of Runway 16/34.
   7.5.4. Transient aircraft may conduct practice circling approaches on a non-interference
   basis.
   7.5.5. Tower is the final approval authority for practice circling approaches.
7.6. Availability/Restrictions for Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approaches and
Precision Approach Radar (PAR) Approaches/Monitoring. ASR and PAR approaches are
not available at HMN.
7.7. Local Climb-out Instructions.
   7.7.1. HMN assigned units and locally hosted TDY units will use the following climb-out
   procedures when ATC directs “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMB-OUT”: for Runway 16 the
   direction of downwind will be directed by the controller “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMB-OUT
   WEST OR EAST DOWNWIND”.

   7.7.2. There are no published “local climb-out” procedures for other Runways; climb-out
   will be directed by WSRF.
7.8. HMN Non-Radar Procedures.
   7.8.1. The following procedures are in effect in the event that WSRF experiences a total
   radar failure:
   7.8.2. If able, all aircraft will depart and arrive HMN VFR.
   7.8.3. Cancel IFR if on an IFR flight plan and able to proceed VFR.
   7.8.4. VFR aircraft shall adhere to the following procedures:
52                                                HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


     7.8.4.1. Contact WSRF (Channel 8) NLT 20 DME from HMN TACAN with current
     ATIS. On initial contact pilots shall state position and altitude. Recoveries will be to a
     full stop or to the VFR traffic pattern.
     7.8.4.2. Exit Beak airspace at or below 14500ft MSL to de-conflict with 16500ft MSL
     departures. McGregor Range recoveries should exit VFR and contact Tower. Salinas
     Corridor recoveries will report Capes.
     7.8.4.3. Final approach instrument training may be accomplished by requesting a VFR
     straight-in, advising Tower of the type of final approach to be flown, and using normal
     straight-in ground track until established on final. This is a VFR maneuver.
     7.8.4.4. All flight briefings will include adherence to flying VFR altitudes, potential
     traffic conflict areas, and see-and-avoid operations.
     7.8.4.5. Aircraft departing VFR will advise Clearance Delivery of intentions. Clearance
     Delivery will amend flight plans in the Flight Data System as applicable. VFR
     departures will follow normal ground tracks. All aircraft will report Cloud and, if going
     northbound, report Bentt and Karie. Fly the appropriate VFR hemispheric altitude
     (16500ft MSL or 17500ft MSL) until switched to ABQ ARTCC. Departure control will
     coordinate with ABQ ARTCC for an IFR pick-up if time permits.
  7.8.5. Aircraft requesting IFR separation and services can expect up to a 30-minute delay
  based on air traffic, runway in use, weather, and airspace configuration. In the event that
  aircraft are unable to depart/arrive VFR, the following procedures are in effect:
     7.8.5.1. WSRF will advise ABQ ARTCC of the altitudes assigned. Aircraft held below
     their final altitude can expect higher with ABQ ARTCC or as higher altitudes become
     available.
     7.8.5.2. Departure Control will request aircraft to provide the estimated time to reach the
     appropriate transfer of control points, ORYXX (HMN 006/53), SKEEN (HMN 078/40),
     CAPES (HMN 354/26), or DUSTE (HMN 182/20) SHYLY (HMN 291/51). WSRF will
     coordinate this time with ABQ ARTCC and transfer communications no later than the
     transfer control point.
     7.8.5.3. Arrival aircraft will normally be routed to MONGO (HMN 034/20) for holding,
     unless an ATC operational advantage can be obtained. Aircraft that are directed to hold
     will be given an Expect Further Clearance (EFC) time. Recoveries will be via a
     published instrument approach to a full stop or to the VFR traffic pattern.
         7.8.5.3.1. Aircraft in the arrival pattern unable to maintain VMC can expect a non-
         radar routing.
         7.8.5.3.2. All aircraft will report commencing the approach at 15 NM and 10 NM
         final.

                                            Chapter 8

                 EMERGENCY AND PRECAUTIONARY PROCEDURES

8.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   8.1.1. In the event of an aircraft mishap or emergency, Tower will activate the PCAS IAW
   FAAO JO 7110.65.
   8.1.2. Agencies with two-way voice communication on the PCAS are Tower, FD, AM, and
   the Ambulance Response Element. Tower will activate the PCAS for the following reasons
   (list is not all inclusive):
       8.1.2.1. In-flight (IFE) and ground emergencies (GE).
       8.1.2.2. Aircraft mishaps.
       8.1.2.3. Notification of external stores jettison.
       8.1.2.4. Planned or unplanned arresting gear/cable engagements excluding barrier
       certifications.
       8.1.2.5. Suspected or confirmed hot brakes.
       8.1.2.6. Gun malfunctions and hung forward firing ordnance.
       8.1.2.7. Stop Alerts.
       8.1.2.8. Hydrazine mishaps.
       8.1.2.9. Fluid spills or other emergencies when notified by any first responder base
       agency.
       8.1.2.10. Single ship aircraft experiencing complete radio failure (NORDO).
   8.1.3. AM will forward all initial and updated information verbatim via the SCN as it
   becomes available. AM records the SCN.
8.2. Command and Control of IFEs. The primary discrete emergency channel for HMN is the
Single Frequency Approach (SFA - Local Channel 13, Attachment 2). This channel is intended
to provide a SFA to emergency aircraft and facilitate communication between the control
agency, the SOF, and the aircrew. WSRF will assign the SFA or a UHF/VHF discrete frequency
as soon as practical unless otherwise requested by aircrew. Tower will relinquish control of the
SFA or UHF/VHF discrete frequency to senior FD officer once the aircraft comes to a complete
stop. When an aircraft declares a GE or emergency abort on takeoff and the senior FD officer or
designated representative requests use of the SFA or UHF/VHF discrete frequency, Tower will
coordinate with WSRF then relinquish the SFA as soon as possible.
8.3. Suspension of Runway Operations due to Aircraft Emergencies. Runway operations
will be suspended for all known or suspected FOD conditions and emergencies. SOF may waive
requirement to suspend operations for runway inspection following an emergency if in his/her
judgment a FOD check is unnecessary. If operations are suspended, AM must conduct a runway
check before operations can be resumed.
8.4. Emergency Response Procedures.
 54                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   8.4.1. IFEs:
      8.4.1.1. Notify controlling agency of squawk if other than 7700.            RPA will set
      emergency mission squawk 0277.
      8.4.1.2. IFEs will be given full runway separation.
      8.4.1.3. The primary runway for cable engagements is Runway 04/22.
      8.4.1.4. The SOF shall receive ATC approval prior to transmitting on the SFA
      frequency.
      8.4.1.5. Emergency aircraft will normally remain on the emergency frequency until the
      emergency is terminated.
      8.4.1.6. Runway Operations will be suspended upon aircraft landing and require AM to
      conduct a FOD check of the entire runway surface. The SOF may waive the requirement
      to conduct a FOD check at his/her discretion.
   8.4.2. GEs may be worked from the Ground Control frequency.
   8.4.3. Tower will direct taxiing aircraft to hold position while emergency response vehicles
   are responding to the emergency. Emergency vehicles responding to an aircraft emergency
   will be given priority to cross all active runways over non-emergency airborne aircraft and
   departures. Ground Control may approve specific aircraft movement if there is no conflict
   with emergency response vehicles.
   8.4.4. Discontinue any operation that would interfere with availability of landing runway and
   broadcast on the fire/crash Frequency Modulation (FM) net when the emergency aircraft is
   next to land.
   8.4.5. AM will respond to all GE’s to conduct a FOD check.
   8.4.6. For any IFE or GE (on or off base), the senior FD representative is the incident
   commander until the emergency is terminated. FD is the only agency with the authority to
   terminate an emergency. If there is an associated mishap, the incident commander will be
   designated and assume the responsibilities as directed in HAFB Plan 91-204, Mishap
   Response Plan.
   8.4.7. Simulated Emergencies: ATC will exercise the same procedures as in an actual
   emergency. Unless previously coordinated, simulated emergency aircraft WILL NOT
   receive priority over other aircraft.
8.5. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures.
   8.5.1. When possible, jettison external and internal stores on Oscura, Red Rio or Centennial
   ranges in one of the approved impact areas. Drops in any other areas will be for emergency
   situations only. Obtain permission from WSRF to drop stores on the range impact areas.
   Expect minimum delays if the impact areas are in use or designated hot.
   8.5.2. If the areas are not in use or designated cold, WSRF must coordinate with Ft. Bliss.
   8.5.3. On the airfield and with Tower approval, jettison external and internal stores parallel
   to and 1500ft left of Runway 04 heading 035 degrees. Release abeam the threshold of
   Runway 04 between 4300ft to 4400ft MSL (Figure 8.1.).
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                55


Figure 8.1. Jettison on HMN (Drawing not to scale).




      8.5.3.1. Hold for jettison on the HMN 222 radial between 6 and 10 DME at or above
      8500ft MSL. The aircraft commander is responsible for visually clearing the jettison
      area. VFR Jettison Area is for fuel tanks, inert ordnance, and non-hazardous stores only.
      8.5.3.2. IFR jettison will be at 6000ft MSL outbound on the HMN 321 degree radial
      between
      10 and 14 DME.
      8.5.3.3. Contact WSRF on the Approach frequency (Attachment 2).
      8.5.3.4. ATC will provide a vector to intercept the 321 degree radial and advise the pilot
      when at 10 DME and again at 14 DME. If WSRF radar is out, WSRF will issue
      clearance outbound on the 321 degree radial prior to 10 DME at 6000ft MSL.
      8.5.3.5. Tower will activate the PCAS when alerted that an aircraft will use the IFR/VFR
      jettison area (PCAS WILL NOT be activated for areas over the range) and again upon
      termination of jettison. AM will alert agencies involved in cleanup/recovery operations.
8.6. Fuel Dumping. There is no defined fuel dumping area. Location of fuel dumping will
occur as directed by ATC. Aircrew should attempt to dump above 5000ft AGL and avoid
populated areas, safety constraints permitting.
8.7. Abandonment of Aircraft.
   8.7.1. The designated bailout area is northwest of HMN between HMN 270 and 300 radial
   and between 3 and 5 DME. Bailout at or above 10000ft MSL on a northwesterly heading.
   8.7.2. In the event that an aircrew abandons an aircraft, the pilot should make every effort to
   advise ATC of the aircraft position prior to abandonment. When alerted that an aircrew
   abandons an aircraft, Tower will plot the position on base crash grid maps or on a sectional
   chart for crash recovery efforts and activate the PCAS to pass along all applicable
   information.
8.8. Hung Ordinance Procedures.
   8.8.1. Primary runway for hung ordnance is Runway 22 and alternate is Runway 25.
   Recover via straight-in with chase ship (if possible) and avoid flying over populated areas to
   the max extent. After landing, aircraft will taxi to Hung Ordnance area (Golf Arm/De-Arm)
   conditions permitting. Explosive Ordnance Disposal will evaluate and safe the munitions
   with weapons load personnel assistance as needed. If ordnance can be safely pinned and
 56                                                  HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   secured, taxi to park. If not, shut down and have the aircraft towed back to authorized Live
   Ordnance Load/Unload area.
   8.8.2. 96 TG and Det 1, 82 ATRS projects involving ordnance requiring action different
   from above should coordinate with 49 OG/CC or designated representative, the SOF, AM,
   and     49th Wing Weapons Safety (49 WG/SEW) prior to launch.
   8.8.3. Hung ordnance does not apply to Tornado’s carrying CBLS 200 (BDU-33, MK106,
   DM18/28).
8.9. Gun Malfunctions/Hung Forward Firing Ordnance. Safe switches and declare an IFE.
Avoid pointing aircraft at populated areas. Recover with chase ship straight in Runway 22
(primary) or Runway 25 (alternate).
   8.9.1. After landing, stop and point the aircraft's nose to heading 270 through 290 degrees on
   runway and de-arm on end of runway. When gun or ordnance is declared safe, aircraft may
   taxi to authorized Live Ordnance Load/Unload area. Expect Tornado aircraft to shut down
   on the runway with a gun malfunction. Upon notification via the SCN, 49th Security Forces
   Squadron (49 SFS) will secure the appropriate area(s) IAW 49 SFS Quick Reaction Checklist
   3, In-Flight Emergency.
   8.9.2. De-arming of simultaneous gun malfunctions/hung forward firing ordnance
   emergencies will be directed by the incident commander on a case-by-case basis.
8.10. Lost Communications Instructions (NORDO).
   8.10.1. Squawk 76XX (16, 25, 34, etc.) for intended landing runway. If a greater emergency
   exists, squawk 7700. See Attachments 4, 6, 8, and 9 for additional NORDO procedures.
   8.10.2. If able to return VFR, follow the steps below:
      8.10.2.1. Have a wingman lead the NORDO aircraft to a straight in if possible.
      8.10.2.2. Maintain appropriate VFR altitudes.
      8.10.2.3. Proceed to initial, rock wings at initial, and break at departure end.
      8.10.2.4. Look for a steady green light gun signal from Tower for clearance to land.
   8.10.3. If weather conditions requires an IFR return to base, follow the guidance below:
      8.10.3.1. If recovering from the north or west, intercept the HMN 357 radial inbound at
      16000ft MSL. Cross SMATI (HMN 357/12) at or above 13000ft MSL. If able, execute
      one complete turn in holding followed by the published approach.
      8.10.3.2. If recovering from the south or east, intercept the HMN 093 radial inbound at
      16000ft MSL. Cross FITZZ at or above 13000ft MSL and execute the published
      procedure.
8.11. Air Evacuation Notification and Response Procedures.
   8.11.1. Tower will notify AM of arriving AirEvac or MedEvac aircraft by 15 flying miles.
   8.11.2. AM will relay AirEvac or MedEvac information via the SCN. If not already
   informed, AM will also notify Tower, FD, Ambulance Response Element and Gerald
   Champion Regional Medical Center Emergency Room and provide all data possible
   (Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), number of patients off-loading, litter/ambulatory, special
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              57


   equipment, physician required, etc.). 49th Aerospace Medicine Squadron Flight Medicine
   (49 AMDS/SGPF) should be notified 30 minutes or more prior to landing so appropriate
   receiving medical units can be postured for receipt of casualties. AM will coordinate with
   TA for servicing equipment and parking and provide other priority service as required in the
   area of transportation and flight planning, etc.
8.12. Emergency Aircraft Arresting System Procedures.
   8.12.1. HMN aircraft arresting system locations are displayed in Table 2.1. Landing zone
   for a BAK-15 barrier is displaced. Aircraft may only land over a raised BAK-15 arresting
   barrier in an emergency. Tower will issue the distance of the barrier from the approach end
   of the runway.
   8.12.2. All BAK-15s are remotely controlled by Tower. When the approach end of the
   primary landing runway is equipped with a BAK-15 barrier, the barrier will be rendered safe
   (taking remote capability away from the Tower) and placed in the “down” position. The
   BAK-12 cable will be disconnected from the BAK-15. If weather conditions demand an
   immediate runway change, it is permissible to land over an armed BAK-15 in the “down”
   position. However, Tower will immediately notify 49th Civil Engineer Squadron Barrier
   Maintenance
   (49 CES/CEOFP) or 49 CES/CEF to render the barrier safe if continued landings are
   expected. 49 CES/CEOFP or 49 CES/CEF personnel will advise Tower of barrier
   configuration and whether the BAK-15 barrier is armed or safe.
   8.12.3. When Runway 22 approach end BAK-12 engagement is anticipated and aircraft are
   holding in Echo Arm/De-Arm or on Taxiway Echo, Tower will either clear the aircraft for
   takeoff (emergency outside 10 NM) or direct holding aircraft to taxi well clear of Runway
   22.
   8.12.4. Crash Recovery, FD, 49 CES/CEOFP, and AM will respond immediately to all
   barrier engagements. All unmanned drones will recover using a barrier engagement. 49
   CES/CEOFP will be notified in advance by Det 1, 82 ATRS of all unmanned missions.
   Barrier certifications are pre-coordinated with all required responding agencies.
8.13. Hot Brake Area and Procedures.
   8.13.1. 49 WG/CP will advise maintenance. If able, crews will taxi to the nearest hot brake
   area (nearest arm/de-arm). Crash Recovery personnel will determine if hot brakes exist and
   if the aircraft is cleared to continue taxiing.
   8.13.2. Incident commander will ensure a 300ft safety zone around the aircraft. Aircraft
   WILL NOT be allowed to taxi within the 300ft safety zone.
8.14. Hydrazine Procedures. If a hydrazine problem exists while the aircraft is airborne and
conditions permit, the aircraft will land Runway 22 and proceed to Golf Arm/De-Arm. Once the
aircraft is on the ground, evacuate an area at least 100ft upwind and 600ft downwind of all non-
essential personnel.
8.15. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response Procedures.
   8.15.1. Scheduled operational testing of beacon/ ELT will be conducted IAW FAAO JO
   7110.65 during the first five minutes of the hour for no more than three audible sweeps.
 58                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   8.15.2. 49 WG/CP is designated as the single point of contact for ATC notification. The
   PCAS IS NOT activated in response to unscheduled personnel, crash locator beacon/ELT.
   49 WG/CP will attempt to determine the source of the signal or personnel and will direct
   Tower to activate the PCAS as necessary.
8.16. Weather Recall/Divert Procedures.
   8.16.1. 49th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (49 OSS/OSW) will immediately
   notify the SOF and Tower with pertinent adverse conditions and location. Any pilot or
   controller observing such conditions should immediately pass that information to their Ops
   Sup, SOF, Tower WS or WSRF WS, and 49 OSS/OSW.
   8.16.2. The SOF will determine whether to recall, divert, discontinue departures, or direct all
   aircraft to a full-stop.
   8.16.3. WSRF will pass weather and route recall notification to ABQ ARTCC and will
   coordinate range and restricted area crossings for aircraft with regard to weather avoidance
   areas. Route recalls must include the specific call signs of the aircraft affected.
   8.16.4. Pilots will acknowledge weather and route recall on their current controlling
   frequency and arrange to return to base (RTB). Range crossings cannot be guaranteed.
   Pilots will contact the SOF and determine their available hold time prior to contacting WSRF
   or Cherokee.
   8.16.5. IFR Divert to ELP. Contact WSRF for emergency service. Expect hand off to ELP
   Approach for sequencing into ELP.
8.17. Alternate Airfields.
   8.17.1. HMN has two primary alternate airfields for practice patterns and approaches: Biggs
   Army Air Field (KBIF), located 77 NM to the SSE, and Roswell Industrial Air Center
   (KROW), located 91 NM to the NE. In addition, El Paso International Airport (KELP) is
   available for practice instrument approaches.

9.1. Opposite Direction Departures and Landings.
   9.1.1. Tower will have final approval authority on opposite direction arrivals. WSRF will
   have final approval authority on opposite direction IFR departures. Cutoffs prescribed below
   also apply to helicopter operations except when helicopters are established on
   arrival/departure routes described in paragraph A6.3.
   9.1.2. Arrival versus Arrival (applies to IFR and VFR aircraft):
      9.1.2.1. Opposite direction arrivals will be restricted to straight-in full stops.
      9.1.2.2. An opposite direction arrival will proceed no closer than 10 flying miles from
      the runway until the preceding arrival to the active or opposing runway has landed or has
      completed a practice approach and has turned at least 45 degrees from the reciprocal
      course of the opposite direction arrival.
      9.1.2.3. Aircraft in or entering the VFR traffic pattern will be restricted from base and
      final until after the opposite direction arrival lands.
   9.1.3. Arrival versus Departure (applies to IFR and VFR aircraft):
      9.1.3.1. When opposite direction arrivals reach a point 10 flying miles from the runway,
      IFR departures will be suspended.
      9.1.3.2. Aircraft departing VFR, remaining in the VFR pattern, must have departed or
      turned to avoid the arrival before the arrival reaches a point 10 miles from the runway.
      9.1.3.3. Arrivals to either Runway 04 or Runway 07 will be considered opposite
      direction to both Runway 22 and Runway 25 departures.
   9.1.4. Departure versus Arrival:
      9.1.4.1. IFR opposite direction departures will be established on a course diverging by at
      least 45 degrees from the reciprocal of the final approach course to avoid any conflict
      prior to an arrival reaching a point 10 flying miles (12-mile base for drones) from the
      active/opposing runway.
      9.1.4.2. VFR opposite direction traffic will be airborne and turning to avoid any conflict
      before an arrival reaches a point 10 flying miles from the runway.

                               GAF TORNADO OPERATIONS

A4.1. Tornado Engine Governor Check. A Tornado requiring a governor (GVNR) test will
include this information upon initial contact with Ground Control. On initial contact with Tower
the pilot will state “(call sign), NUMBER ONE, REQUEST LINEUP GOVERNOR”. Tower,
when able, will instruct the aircraft to line up and wait. If cleared onto the runway, the pilot will
conduct GVNR test and after completion of GVNR test will call “(call sign), READY FOR
DEPARTURE”. At this time, traffic permitting, Tower will clear the aircraft for departure. If
cleared for takeoff, the aircraft/flight will line up, execute the GVNR check and depart thereafter.
Other aircraft on Tower frequency should consider that the GVNR test will take up to two
minutes on the runway.
A4.2. VFR Extended Straight-In. Extended straight-in is only authorized to Runway 16/34.
Request for extended straight-in will be made with ATC. If currently under WSRF control,
expect vectors to a 10 NM straight-in. If requested on the go, expect to be transferred to WSRF
after Tower coordination. The VFR Extended Straight-In follows the normal straight-in ground
track. At 90-to-initial point, descend to 5600ft MSL. Base turn will be initiated at 10 NM from
touchdown point. Expect handover to Tower when initiating base turn. Extended straight-in is
used for Simulated Single Engine and Swept Wing (EP) pattern or for multiple formation
approaches requiring a longer than normal straight-in final.
A4.3. Tornado EP Procedures.
   A4.3.1. Swept wing or simulated single engine indicates a pilot request for an EP pattern.
   Simulated EP Pattern approaches may be flown to Runway 16/34 or to Runway 22. For
   multiple approaches to Runway 16/ 34, pilots will request, as soon as possible to either
   Tower or WSRF, extended straight in using standard terminology and will add
   “SIMULATED SINGLE ENGINE” or “SWEPT WING” “(call sign) ON THE GO, REQUEST
   EXTENDED STRAIGHT-IN SWEPT WING”. For multiple approaches to Runway 22, pilots
   will request “RUNWAY 22 LOCAL CLIMB-OUT” for radar vectors to TACAN final.
   A4.3.2. IMC/Nighttime: Simulated single engine approaches can be flown in IMC or at
   nighttime under IFR. Swept wing approaches can be flown in IMC during the daytime under
   IFR. Expect a published instrument approach or radar vectors to a TACAN Runway 16/34 or
   Runway 22. Additional approaches can expect local climb-out or alternate instructions.
   A4.3.3. Daytime VFR conditions: Simulated EP will only be flown in VMC to Runway
   16/34 from a visual extended straight-in or from any recovery leading to a straight-in
   transition. Aircrews are responsible for their own terrain avoidance. Aircrews flying the
   VFR pattern will request extended straight-in on the go and follow the standard HMN
   straight-in ground track at 6100' MSL. On outside downwind at 5 DME (7 DME Runway
   34), aircrews will transmit “(call sign) OUTSIDE DOWNWIND REQUEST EXTENDED
   STRAIGHT-IN SWEPT WING/SIMULATED SINGLE ENGINE”. If approved, Tower will
   direct the aircrew to contact Arrival channel 9. Aircrews should squawk last assigned code
   or 1200 as appropriate and begin a descent to 5600ft MSL. Aircrews will inform Arrival
   “HOLLOMAN ARRIVAL, (call sign) SELF NAVIGATION 10 MILE STRAIGHT-IN, SWEPT
   WING/SIMULATED SINGLE ENGINE”. Arrival will approve or disapprove self-navigation
   while providing traffic advisories and sequencing as required. If self-navigation is approved,
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             95


   aircrews will plan to turn base abeam Tula Peak for Runway16 or Lone Butte for Runway
   34. DO NOT over extend the pattern. Aircrews should inform arrival of their base turn.
   Expect a hand off to Tower shortly thereafter. The aircraft will be configured when
   intercepting glide path (approximately 5 miles on a visual straight-in).
   A4.3.4. If Tower does not approve extended straight-in, aircrews are expected to continue
   for a normal straight-in via the standard straight-in procedures/ground track or request to
   report initial at 6100ft MSL.
   A4.3.5. On Simulated Single Engine patterns, crews should fly a normal glide path,
   maintaining between 180 and 200 KIAS on final. If no Touch and Go tower can expect the
   go-around to be accomplished on short final.
   A4.3.6. Swept wing patterns will slow from 300 KIAS to approximately 230 KIAS for a
   67-degree swept wing (190 KIAS for a 45-degree swept wing pattern) at glide path intercept
   (approximately 5 NM). Aircrews will initiate a go-around between 1 to 2 miles on final.
   Swept wing pattern WILL NOT be conducted at nighttime.
A4.4. Tornado Internal Aids Approach (IAA).
   A4.4.1. Tornado aircraft may conduct VFR Internal Aids Approaches using published
   procedures. Approaches will be flown in VMC only. Aircrews will use all available
   navigational aids to ensure course alignment.
   A4.4.2. Pilots can request vectors for TACAN approach for the IAA on recovery into HMN
   or from the radar pattern. Aircrews will use the following phraseology when initially
   contacting approach: “(call sign), REQUEST TACAN FOR INTERNAL AIDS, RUNWAY XX,
   (landing intentions)”.
   A4.4.3. Approach will issue the following clearance: “(Call sign), CLEARED TACAN
   RUNWAY XX, EXPECT INTERNAL AIDS PROCEDURES”.
   A4.4.4. Aircrews will coordinate combined swept wing and IAA approaches as soon as
   possible after WSRF approves the IAA procedure. It is imperative that the swept wing
   request is made to ensure Approach can provide proper separation.
   A4.4.5. Aircrews will use the following phraseology when switched to Tower: “(Call sign),
   (position), INTERNAL AIDS APPROACH” or “(Call sign), (position), INTERNAL AIDS
   APPROACH, SWEPT WING”. Tower will acknowledge the call and direct the aircrew to
   report 5 mile final.
      A4.4.5.1. At 5 mile final from the runway, IFR clearance is automatically cancelled and
      aircrew will proceed VFR on the IAA.
      A4.4.5.2. If unable to maintain VFR prior to 5 mile final, the aircrew will notify Tower
      or WSRF that they are canceling the IAA and continuing the TACAN approach.
      A4.4.5.3. Aircrews desiring a self-positioning IAA will request an extended VFR
      straight-in IAA: “(call sign), REQUEST EXTENDED STRAIGHT-IN, INTERNAL
      AIDS.” Aircrews will fly the ground track of the VFR straight-in pattern with a base turn
      NLT 10 DME and make all standard VFR pattern calls. Aircraft will be sent back to
      WSRF.
      A4.4.5.4. IAA procedures WILL NOT be conducted at night.

A4.5. Tornado Trail Procedures.
   A4.5.1. Tornado Trail departures.
      A4.5.1.1. The Tornado Trail Departure is a non-radar trail departure, flown under IFR in
      VMC and IMC in non-standard formation, if weather, crosswind or the number of aircraft
      preclude the execution of a formation takeoff or a rejoin of the formation below clouds.
      The aim of the Tornado Trail Departure is to reach VMC for a rejoin of the formation
      above a cloud layer. The Tornado Trail Departure can be flown in two ships (two by
      two), single ships (one by one) or a two ship following a single ship(s), the two-ship
      being allowed as last element only to cope for a lost wingman situation. In the following,
      each single unit will therefore be referred to as an entity.
      A4.5.1.2. WSRF will inform ABQ ARTCC if a flight will be non-standard formation in
      their airspace.
      A4.5.1.3. Procedure:
          A4.5.1.3.1. Procedure to be used under IFR on the CLOUD-FOUR-ALPHA and the
          HIGGY-TWO.
          A4.5.1.3.2. VMC for formation join up must be attainable within HMN assigned
          airspace
          (See Figure A4.1.).

Figure A4.1. HMN assigned airspace (Drawing not to scale).




          A4.5.1.3.3. The formation files separate flight plans.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             97


          A4.5.1.3.3.1. An altitude block of 1000ft (2 entities)/2000ft (3-4 entities) will be
          filed.
       A4.5.1.3.4. Flight plans will include the remarks: Tornado Trail Departure MARSA
       with call-sign.
       A4.5.1.3.5. Formation lead will request Trail Departure with Clearance Delivery and
       inform Tower upon check in.
       A4.5.1.3.6. Each entity will be assigned a separate squawk.
          A4.5.1.3.6.1. The first and the last entity will squawk as assigned, all others will
          squawk standby and will be tracked by ATC as primary targets.
       A4.5.1.3.7. Take off spacing between entities is 20 seconds, which equals a
       longitudinal spacing of approximately 2 NM during flight.
       A4.5.1.3.8. The maximum distance between lead and last aircraft of the formation
       will be 10 NM.
       A4.5.1.3.9. The first and last entity will report airborne and level off on assigned
       altitude to ATC.
       A4.5.1.3.10. Each entity will:
          A4.5.1.3.10.1. Cancel Reheat (afterburner) at 330 calibrated airspeed in knots
          (KCAS).
          A4.5.1.3.10.2. Establish a 5 degree climb angle in the Head Up Display (HUD)
          up to 10000ft MSL and then reduce to a 3 degree climb until level off.
          A4.5.1.3.10.3. Adjust power as required to maintain 330 KCAS (use reheat if
          necessary).
          A4.5.1.3.10.4. Use a 30 degree angle of bank during turns.
       A4.5.1.3.11. All entities are strictly to adhere to the headings, turn points, airspeed,
       climb angles and altitudes in order to fly the same ground track as the entity in front,
       to maintain the spacing and to ensure terrain clearance to the east of HMN.
       A4.5.1.3.12. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft will apply to the entire
       formation, while maintaining the relative position to each other.
       A4.5.1.3.13. Entities will maintain the 20 seconds trail position until join up in close
       formation is guaranteed in VMC.
       A4.5.1.3.14. Unless every entity in the formation has indicated a radar contact or
       lock-on (tied-on), lead will call all changes in airspeed, altitude, and heading. During
       climbs and descents, lead will call passing each 2000ft altitude increment with
       altitude and heading (or heading passing) until joined, leveled off, or the following
       entity called tied-on.
       A4.5.1.3.15. Should a level off on an intermediate altitude become necessary, or if
       unable to reach VMC at the assigned altitude, each trailing entity will level off 500ft
       below the preceding entity and inform ATC.
98                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


        A4.5.1.3.16. Formation lead will report to ATC, when standard formation has been
        established.
        A4.5.1.3.17. Joining aircraft will strangle squawk/squawk stand-by upon join up on
        the preceding aircraft.
        A4.5.1.3.18. The IFR portion of the flight plan can be cancelled by formation lead at
        the earliest when all formation members reached and reported VMC.
     A4.5.1.4. In case of radio failure:
        A4.5.1.4.1. Try to establish contact on UHF/VHF Guard.
        A4.5.1.4.2. If unsuccessful, squawk Mode A/7600.
        A4.5.1.4.3. Continue departure on defined parameters to assigned altitude.
        A4.5.1.4.4. Lead aircraft: If unable to reach VMC on assigned altitude, set squawk
        Mode A/7700 for 30 seconds, thereafter continue according to NORDO procedures.
        A4.5.1.4.5. Wingmen: If unable to reach VMC for formation join up, set squawk
        Mode A/7700 for 30 seconds, thereafter continue according to NORDO procedures.
        A4.5.1.4.6. ATC will inform remaining formation members of the NORDO situation.
     A4.5.1.5. In case of lost wingman:
        A4.5.1.5.1. Execute lost wingman procedure.
        A4.5.1.5.2. Observe published terrain clearance limits.
        A4.5.1.5.3. Squawk assigned code.
        A4.5.1.5.4. Obtain separate clearance from ATC.

A5.1. Drone Operations.
   A5.1.1. Detachment 1, 82 ATRS Responsibilities.
      A5.1.1.1. Brief Tower WS at least one hour prior to takeoff for all drone missions.
      Information will include but is not be limited to:
          A5.1.1.1.1. Estimated time of departure (ETD)and ETA.
          A5.1.1.1.2. Mission frequency.
          A5.1.1.1.3. Manned or unmanned.
          A5.1.1.1.4. Mission summary (i.e., type of departure, length of time on range,
          number of approaches, etc.).
      A5.1.1.2. Release Runway 22 at Taxiway Echo to Tower for departures until five
      minutes prior to drone takeoff time (manned drone only).
      A5.1.1.3. Advise Tower when manned drone is 18 flying miles (normally 12-mile base
      leg) and at 5 miles from touchdown. Obtain Tower approval prior to turning other than
      an 18 or 12-mile base leg.
      A5.1.1.4. Provide two-way radio equipped vehicle to assist in approach/departure area
      evacuation (unmanned drone operations only).
      A5.1.1.5. Advise Tower when all personnel are clear of the runway and that normal

   A5.2.1. Manned QF-4 Drone Procedures:
       A5.2.1.1. Issue taxi instructions to aircraft.
       A5.2.1.2. Limit Runway 22 to drone operations only. Tower will verbally coordinate
       with Atilla Mobile to confirm authorization of exceptions.
       A5.2.1.3. Advise WSRF of drone operations as soon as possible.
   A5.2.2. Chase Aircraft:
       A5.2.2.1. Once takeoff clearance has been issued, if pickup is immediate, the chase
       aircraft is automatically cleared to takeoff from any runway.
       A5.2.2.2. If pickup is not immediate i.e. chase aircraft is already airborne, obtain
       clearance from Tower before conducting drone takeoff and pickup operations.
       A5.2.2.3. Suspend all departures from Runway 25 when the drone is 15 flying miles
       (normally 12-mile base leg) to Runway 04. Limit straight-in approaches to Runway
       16/34 as necessary to allow full runway or missed approach separation for the drone.
       Arriving aircraft can expect to be delayed when drone operations are in progress.
   A5.2.3. Unmanned Drone Procedures:
       A5.2.3.1. Clear 49 CES/CEOFP or FD personnel onto the runway for arresting gear
       configuration.
       A5.2.3.2. Unmanned drone ops WILL NOT occur when the temporary weapons storage
       (south of Runway 04/22 and east of Taxiway Echo) facility is being used. The drones
       must ensure de-confliction during mission planning.
       A5.2.3.3. Unmanned Drone Departures. Tower will evacuate all non-participating
       vehicles and aircraft within a 2000ft radius of the unmanned drone before authorizing the
       drone destruct system to be armed. Immediately prior to issuing take off clearance,
       Tower will ensure a 1000ft cordon from Runway 04/22 centerline is in place for all non-
       participating vehicles and aircraft until the drone departs. This cordon includes portions
       of Taxiways Delta, Echo, Romeo, and Golf as well as their corresponding arm/de-arm
       areas.
       A5.2.3.4. Unmanned Drone Arrivals. Prior to issuing landing clearance, Tower will
       ensure a 1000ft cordon from Runway 04/22 centerline is in place for all non-participating
       vehicles and aircraft. The cordon will remain in effect until the drone is stopped on the
       runway, at which time the cordon will be adjusted to a 2000ft radius around the aircraft
       and will be canceled once the drone’s destruction system is de-armed.
A5.3. Pick Up Pattern for Chase Aircraft.
   A5.3.1. Normally QF-4 chase aircraft will fly a pattern altitude of 5100ft MSL north of
   runway 04/22.
   A5.3.2. During manned QF-4 operations, the chase aircraft will normally depart from the
   same runway. During unmanned operations, the chase aircraft will normally depart from
   runway 25 or 16.

                               HELICOPTER OPERATIONS

A6.1. HMN Class D Helicopter Operations.
   A6.1.1. Within 5 NM of HMN, VFR arrivals and departures will be at or below 4600ft MSL.
   A6.1.2. Remain clear of all runways until approval to cross is obtained from Tower or IAW
   a specific arrival or departure route, which includes clearance to cross. Remain clear of the
   extended runway centerlines by at least 1500ft (lateral) within the airfield boundary. DO
   NOT over-fly aircraft in run-up areas, taxiing, holding in takeoff position or in parking ramps
   (Transient Parking Area, North Ramp, Drone Parking, or West Ramp).
   A6.1.3. Takeoff or landing in uncontrolled areas (i.e., ramps and parking areas) is at pilot's
   own risk. Helicopter operations conducted to and from areas not approved for helicopter use
   (i.e., the North Side ramp, Main ramp, Transient Ramp, track, auxiliary field) will request
   specific arrival or departure stereo routings by name.
   A6.1.4. Normal airfield traffic departs Runway 22 or Runway 25 and recovers Runway 16.
   Any change of the recovery runway will be relayed by Tower to approaching aircraft. The
   only approved helicopter departure and arrival operations are to the runways.
   A6.1.5. Arriving helicopters will be informed, “(name of specific arrival) ARRIVAL
   APPROVED”. When reporting for landing, Tower will state “LANDING AT NORTH RAMP
   WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK” and if necessary “USE CAUTION (reason)”. Departing
   helicopters will be informed “DEPARTURE FROM NORTH RAMP WILL BE AT YOUR
   OWN RISK” and if necessary “USE CAUTION (reason)”.
A6.2. Helicopter Operations Outside HMN Class D. After departure from HMN Class D,
helicopter operations will be IAW AA Operations standard operating procedures.
A6.3. Standard VFR Arrival and Departure Routes (Figure A6 1.). Request specific
departure/arrival stereo routings by name. Tower will specify an alternate routing if requested
route cannot be provided.
   A6.3.1. MONUMENT: (Water tower HMN 195R at 5.6 DME). When departing the North
   Side, proceed directly across Runway 16 and Runway 25 intersection and remain west of the
   West Ramp en route to the water tower abeam WSNM Headquarters (departure routing
   approval from Tower constitutes clearance to cross the Runway 16 and Runway 25
   intersection). Aircraft departing from the Transient Ramp will proceed directly across
   Runway 16. On arrival call “MONUMENT” then report southwest of the West Ramp.
   Tower will sequence the helicopter to cross Runways 16 and Runway 25. Specific clearance
   from Tower is required. Tower may hold aircraft over the West Ramp or issue instructions
   to adjust route for traffic separation.
   A6.3.2. TRACK: (Track HQ HMN 295R at 2.4 DME; King 1 HMN 316R at 0.9 DME).
   Departing North Side, cross the approach ends of Runway 16 and Runway 22 en route to
   King 1 then to Track. Departure routing approval from Tower constitutes clearance to cross
   the Runway 16 and Runway 22 intersection. Departures from the Transient Ramp will
   proceed directly to Runway 16 and Runway 22 intersection en route to King 1, then to Track.
   Departure routing approval from Tower constitutes clearance to cross Runway 07/25. On

   arrival, call Track then report over King 1. Tower will hold aircraft at King 1 or issue
   instructions to adjust route for traffic separation.
   A6.3.3. ALAMOGORDO: Depart North Side to the northeast of Runway 07/25 and east of
   Runway 04/22. Departure routing approval for aircraft departing the Transient Ramp
   constitutes clearance to cross Runway 07/25 directly to the North Side. On return call
   Alamogordo, then report a quarter mile from the North Side. When Runway 07/25 is the
   primary landing runway, exercise caution and make approach from the north-northeast
   quadrant. DO NOT over-fly the HMN small arms range.

Figure A6.1. Helicopter Arrival and Departure Routes (Drawing not to scale).




   A6.3.4. BERN: (HMN 005R at 3.0 DME). Depart the North Side to the north, parallel to
   Runway 16 extended centerline and fly over perimeter road that leads to La Luz Gate.
   Departure routing approval for aircraft departing the Transient Ramp constitutes clearance to
   cross Runway 07/25 directly to the North Side. DO NOT over-fly the monkey farm or small
   arms range en-route to Malone Draw (BERN), and then proceed to Tula Peak. If
   transitioning to the Track or Aux Field, advise Tower. Turn left at Malone Draw (3 DME),
   descend to 50ft AGL and cross the extended centerline of Runway 16 to the track. On return,
   state your location and call for the Bern; report 2 miles north of the North Side. From test
   track, cross 3 DME north of Runway 16 extended centerline at 50ft AGL.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                103


   A6.3.5. BOLS ACRES: (South of ALM to Twin Butte). Depart the North Side to the east
   to remain east of the tank farm, then south along power lines staying east of the lines and
   housing area. Aircraft departing the Transient Ramp will proceed directly to the tank farm
   without over-flying the Main Ramp and remain south of Runway 07/25. Aircraft departing
   the North Side will remain north of Runway 07/25. At power line intersection proceed to
   Boles Acres or toward WSMR. If going west toward WSMR from power line intersection,
   descend to 50ft AGL to be low when crossing the extended centerline of Runway 34. On
   arrival (opposite departure routing), call “Boles Acres” then report the tank farm. When
   Runway 07/25 is the primary landing Runway, exercise extreme caution. Report the tank
   farm inbound and DO NOT proceed until clearance is obtained from Tower.
   A6.3.6. If instructed to orbit to hold for runway crossing, ensure that orbit pattern does not
   over-fly any ramp areas. In West Ramp Orbit, remain west/southwest of the West Ramp
   hangars and ramp. In North Side Orbit, remain east of Runway 16/34 and north of Runway
   07/25, remain north/northeast of the North Side parking area. In King Orbit, remain
   northwest of Runway 22. In Transient Orbit remain northwest of Taxiway Alpha and east of
   Runway 16/34 and south of Runway 07/25.
   A6.3.7. AUX FIELD TRANSITION. Helicopters may modify any of the above departures
   by requesting an “AUX FIELD TRANSITION” in addition to the specific type of departure.
   All clearances/restrictions of the applicable departure still apply. Aux Field transition simply
   clarifies the destination of the helicopter. See Bern departure above for applicable
   restrictions on Aux Field Transitions.
A6.4. Nonstandard VFR Departures and Arrivals. Traffic permitting, non-standard routes
may be approved by Tower. In non-emergency situations, helicopters will cross the fewest
possible active Runways at designated points. Helicopters may obtain special VFR clearances
from Tower or WSRF to operate within the Class D. Helicopters with radio failure will plan
their approach to avoid crossing any extended runway centerline within 5 SM of the airfield.
A6.5. Helicopter NORDO Procedures. In the event of radio failure in the HMN area the
following procedures apply:
   A6.5.1. If IFR, follow two-way radio failure procedures IAW the flight information
   handbook.
   A6.5.2. If VFR, squawk 76 and the last two number of your call-sign.
       A6.5.2.1. If communication is lost after initial contact with Tower, continue to the
       established reporting point for that approach and look for a light gun signal from Tower.
       A6.5.2.2. If not established on an approach and have not talked to Tower,
       circumnavigate the Class D and proceed inbound on the Alamogordo Arrival. Proceed
       inbound to a quarter mile from the north side and look for a light gun signal from the
       Tower.
A6.6. Autorotation/Running Landing Areas. The only approved autorotation/running landing
area is Runway 22 between the approach end and departure end BAK-12 cables. This location
may be used for running landings and emergency training with Tower approval.

A8.4. AC Practice Areas. Procedures for the AC VFR Training Areas are listed in paragraph
3.5.2.2. The boundaries are depicted in Figure A3.6. and include the altitudes from 500ft AGL
up to but not including 18000ft MSL. AC aircraft will monitor WSRF Approach frequency
when using the practice area during the local flying window. The boundaries of the areas are as
follows:
   A8.4.1. North Practice Area: North: Tularosa; South: La Luz; East: Mountains; West:
   Highway 70/54.
   A8.4.2. South Practice Area: North: Boles Acres; South: Two miles north of Dog Canyon
   Rd.; East: Mountains; West: Highway. Use caution for helicopter periodic operations
   between KALM and 5103C.
A8.5. AC NORDO Procedures. Student pilots without a Certified Flight Instructor on board
flying a NORDO aircraft in the VFR pattern when air traffic control is busy, without an operable
transponder will land at ALM. Upon landing at ALM, pilots shall call AM at (575) 572-5411 to
coordinate an appropriate return time to HMN. All aircraft departing ALM enroute to HMN will
call AM prior to departing and coordinate a time to depart, regardless of status of their
transponders. Runway 25 is the only runway available at HMN for NORDO AC aircraft. If the
wind is out of limits for Runway 25, exit Class D to the east and land at ALM. NORDO aircraft
with operable transponders will squawk 7600 and enter the Class D from the east/southeast via
Highway 70 to American Legion building. After American Legion, track towards the approach
end of Runway 34 via the perimeter road until abeam the approach end of Runway 25, then
accomplish a teardrop entry into the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area (Figure A8.1.).

Figure A8.1. Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area (Drawing not to scale).




   A8.5.1. Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area (Figure A8.1.): Once abeam the approach end of
   Runway 25, parallel Runway 25 remaining 1000ft south of Runway 25 at all times. Aircraft
   will turn left prior to Runway 16/34, remaining at least 1000ft east of Runway 16 at all times
   and proceed eastbound. In the left turn, DO NOT proceed any further south than the
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                 107


  departure end of Runway 16. Turn left at the approach end of Runway 25 at 5100ft MSL and
  repeat the above procedure, until a light gun signal is received from Tower. Pilots will
  receive one of the following light gun signals from Tower and shall comply with the
  corresponding actions:
     A8.5.1.1. Steady Red Light (or in the absence of a light gun signal). Continue orbiting in
     the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area.
     A8.5.1.2. Flashing Red Light. Exit Class D to the east and land at ALM.
     A8.5.1.3. Flashing Green Light Gun Signal. Pilot is cleared left base to Runway 25. A
     steady green light on short final is clearance to land. After landing, continue through
     Runway 16 and Runway 25 intersection. If able, turn left on Taxiway Foxtrot, enter
     Foxtrot Arm/De-arm and wait for an escort to taxi back to parking. If unable to turn on
     Taxiway Foxtrot continue to Golf Arm/De-arm and wait for an escort to taxi back to
     parking.
  A8.5.2. AC NORDO/Go Around/Breakout. If initial radio contact with Tower is established
  and subsequently lost, aircraft will comply with Tower's last control instruction and look for
  a light gun signal from Tower.
     A8.5.2.1. Runway 25. If not cleared to land (by light gun signal) on base leg, aircraft
     will maneuver 1000ft to the left of Runway 25 and climb to 5100ft MSL. If able, turn
     left prior to Runway 16 and enter the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area.
     A8.5.2.2. Runways 16, 22, and 34. If instructed by Tower to report base to Runway 16,
     Runway 22, or Runway 34 prior to loss of radios, proceed as instructed and look for a
     light gun signal. After landing Runway 34, continue through Runway 16 and Runway 25
     intersection, turn right on Taxiway Charlie and hold for an escort to taxi back to parking.
     After landing Runway 16, continue through Runway 16 and Runway 25 intersection, turn
     left on Taxiway Alpha and hold in Alpha Arm/De-arm for an escort to taxi back to
     parking. After landing Runway 22, turn left at the end on Taxiway Romeo and hold,
     remaining clear of Runway 22 and Taxiway Golf and wait for an escort to taxi back to
     parking. If not cleared to land for Runway 22 (by light gun signal), execute a restricted
     low approach at or above 4600ft MSL and exit to the south remaining west of Runway 34
     extended centerline at 5100ft MSL until clear of HMN Class D. Re-enter HMN Class D
     from the east/southeast to the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area as described above. If not
     cleared to land on Runway 34 (by light gun signal), aircraft will climb to 5100ft MSL
     and, if able, turn right prior to Runway 25 and enter the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area.
     If not cleared to land for Runway 16, proceed across Runway 25, turn left, climbing to
     5100ft MSL and enter the Runway 25 NORDO Orbit Area.
  A8.5.3. Establishing Radio Contact (Receiver-only Aircraft). Tower controllers will use all
  available means to re-establish communications with the aircraft. This may include issuing
  clearances over emergency frequencies and having the aircraft make turns or use its
  transponder to acknowledge clearances and questions. Tower controllers may also instruct
  the pilot in flight to rock his wings (day time) or flash navigation or landing light (night time)
  for acknowledgment of control instructions from aircraft that are receiver only. If on the
  ground, Tower will instruct the pilot to move rudders or ailerons (day time) or flash

                                MQ-1 / MQ-9 OPERATIONS

A9.1. Introduction.
   A9.1.1. This attachment complements AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and
   Programs. It also outlines specific procedures for local Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
   operations IAW AFI 11-2MDS V3, MQ-1 & MQ-9 Operations Procedures.
   A9.1.2. RPA refers to MQ-1 and/or MQ-9.
A9.2. General Policy.
   A9.2.1. Primary point of contact for command and control of RPA missions is the Squadron
   Ops Sup. All communication with the crew not directly associated with the mission will be
   routed through the Ops Sup.
   A9.2.2. GCS refers to Mobile Ground Control Station (MGCS), Fixed Facility Ground
   Control System (FGCS) and Containerized Data Control System (CDCS). The GCS is to be
   considered a cockpit environment. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is the final authority for
   entry/exit and number of personnel in the cockpit. Entry/exit of the Control Station and
   personnel within the cockpit occupancy should be limited to aircrew and mission essential
   ground crew. During in-flight troubleshooting and emergencies, additional personnel will be
   limited to the minimum maintenance personnel required. Tours of the GCS will be approved
   by the Squadron Commander or Director of Operations and coordinated with the PIC.
   A9.2.3. Crew changeovers and seat swaps will only occur at or above 2000ft AGL. Launch
   and Recovery (LR) sorties may accomplish seat swaps above 500ft AGL.
   A9.2.4. RPA Separation. RPA are unable to accept see and avoid clearances, therefore ATC
   must be more vigilant of separation when potential conflicts arise and shall notify all aircraft
   involved immediately. ATC shall not ask aircrews to maintain visual separation. However,
   aircrews are able to report the runway in sight for continuation of VFR maneuvers. Other
   than the aforementioned, ATC shall handle RPA as manned aircraft.
      A9.2.4.1. ATC may apply FAA Same Runway Separation Category III and use FAA
      Wake Turbulence Category “small” for all RPA separation. ACC RSRS IS NOT applied
      to any situation involving an RPA. Issue cautionary wake turbulence advisories, and the
      position, altitude, and direction of flight to landing RPA pilot/operator, if in your opinion,
      wake turbulence may have an adverse effect on it. Wake turbulence rules cannot be
      waived by the RPA pilot/operator.
   A9.2.5. Due to lack of instrument navigation equipment, aircraft are unable to hold IAW
   AFMAN 11-217v1, Instrument Flight Procedures. RPA will “orbit” or “delay” as directed
   by ATC for aircraft de-confliction.
   A9.2.6. RPA can only operate in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and are not
   authorized to operate under Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR). RPA must avoid IMC to
   the maximum extent possible due to airframe limitations. Due to a lack of onboard
   instrumentation, colored routes (A9.3.5.) listed in this addendum will be used to the
   maximum extent.
 110                                                HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   A9.2.7. Due to line-of-sight (LOS) restrictions, RPA are only able to land on HMN airfield
   or other locations with C-Band capabilities.
   A9.2.8. ATIS Procedures. During RPA flight operations, Tower will include in the ATIS
   broadcast an advisory that “UNMANNED AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS ARE BEING
   CONDUCTED IN THE LOCAL AREA”.
   A9.2.9. Filing of Stereo Routings. To comply with Flight Plan Procedures of this
   instruction, the launching PIC will annotate, and sign for, a stereo routing in the remarks
   section of the AF IMT 4327z (Crew Flight Authorization) which has a RDS of one year. In
   order to activate the stereo the launching PIC or Squadron Top 3 must call Airfield
   Management/Base Operations with the proposed call sign, departure times, arrival times, and
   working airspace. Airfield Management/Base Operations will then file the appropriate
   stereo. LR crews shall contact clearance delivery to prior to departure.
   A9.2.10. All RPA aircrews will monitor the RPA Common frequency while in HMN Class
   D airspace and should monitor RPA Common while outside the Class D airspace for RPA
   traffic and frequency de-confliction.
   A9.2.11. Noise Abatement and Quiet Hour Procedures. RPA are exempt from the noise
   abatement procedures listed in paragraph 2.31. The 49 OG/CC or designated representative
   will specify RPA restrictions during quiet hours for ceremonies, etc.
   A9.2.12. Position Reporting. All RPA assigned to HMN are not TACAN equipped and will
   use distance from their respective Ground Data Terminal (GDT) for position reporting. ATC
   must consider that this distance will be different for each RPA as each uses a different GDT.
   Fixed GDTs are located on the infield approximately 200ft east of Taxiway Delta midway
   between Runway 25 and Taxiway Charlie. Mobile GDTs are located north of taxiway Alpha
   on the pad for the former ASR site.
   A9.2.13. Vehicles/Equipment/Personnel Near Runways. For safety concerns, Tower will
   ensure all vehicles, equipment, or personnel are outside the CMA of the runway in use before
   RPA takeoff or landing.
A9.3. Mission Planning/Local Airspace Procedures.
   A9.3.1. FAA COA. HAM maintains airspace COA that directly impact HMN local flying
   area. RPA units will inform Scheduling when planning on operating in National Airspace
   and adjacent ranges. Scheduling will do appropriate coordination with FAA and ranges IAW
   established agreements. Unit schedulers will advise Scheduling NLT two weeks prior to
   execution to allow time for proper coordination. The COAs are located on the 49 OSS
   SharePoint and are updated annually or as listed within the COA.
   A9.3.2. Frequencies and Global Positioning System (GPS) Jamming de-confliction. C-
   Band/Ku-Band frequency management and scheduling will be coordinated through
   Scheduling. RPA units will forward frequency requirements to Scheduling by Friday, NLT
   two weeks prior to execution. Scheduling will publish frequency schedules with the daily
   RPA flying schedule.
   A9.3.3. Frequency De-confliction. RPA Ops Sups are responsible for real-time frequency
   de-confliction of their aircraft. Ops Sup will assign frequencies to their aircrew at crew step
   IAW the published schedule to the maximum extent possible. In the event that additional
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             111


  frequencies are needed, respective squadron Ops Sup will coordinate with each other for real-
  time de-confliction. C-Band sharing between RPA squadrons will be prioritized as follows:
  Emergencies, Check-rides, Normal Program Flying Training, Launch & Recovery, and
  Continuation Training.
  A9.3.4. RPA Airspace De-confliction.
     A9.3.4.1. The primary means of airspace de-confliction shall be through the scheduling
     process with a backup of real time de-confliction utilizing Cherokee. R-5111C/D will be
     reserved for concurrent RPA operations, unless otherwise scheduled. To facilitate
     departures and recoveries, WSRF may direct RPAs to maintain an altitude and descend
     over the field, within the confines of HMN Class D airspace. To the max extent possible,
     WSRF WILL NOT direct MQ-1 aircraft to climb over the field before proceeding to their
     airspace during a departure.
     A9.3.4.2. Yonder East. The use and scheduling of the airspace underlying the confines
     of Yonder East Areas (P – T 28 – 50) are as follows:
         A9.3.4.2.1. The “Yellow Container” (WSMR grid Romeo to Tango, 24 to 28, 10K to
         assigned altitude) will be scheduled 15 minutes prior to the first scheduled RPA
         launch until 45 minutes after the last scheduled RPA launch. The confines of the
         Yellow Container may be extended as agreed upon at the weekly airspace scheduling
         meeting. When scheduled, WSRF may still use this airspace for departures or
         recoveries of other aircraft.
         A9.3.4.2.2. When scheduled, the Yellow Container will be added to the HMN
         Airspace Restrictions page by Scheduling. RPA Squadrons that desire to use this
         airspace in conjunction with RAPTOR Airspace must coordinate with Raptor Ops
         Sups. If launches are delayed, RPA Ops Sups must notify RAPTOR Airspace
         owning Ops Sups and Scheduling of the extended launch window.
         A9.3.4.2.3. Yonder East Areas 1 and 4, 10K to FL220, may be scheduled in
         conjunction with RAPTOR Airspace. When requested, Scheduling will place this
         request on the CSE Airspace Schedule. In addition, requesting Ops Sup must gain
         final          approval          from           the         WSRF            WS
         (DSN 258-8076) for use of the altitudes 10K to FL180 NLT 1-hour prior to mission
         start time.
         A9.3.4.2.4. Yonder East Areas 2 and 3 (Papa to Romeo, 28-50) at 10K and above
         may be scheduled real-time by requesting Ops Sup through the WSRF WS.
         A9.3.4.2.5. WSRF WS is the final authority on operations within Yonder East and
         can deny or recall the airspace at any time if conditions require. Cherokee shall
         contact aircraft on the appropriate working frequency passed by the aircraft, via an
         Airborne Warning and Control System controller, or on 243.0.
  A9.3.5. RPA Colored Routes. RPA aircrew shall fly the colored routes (Figure A9.1. ,
  Figure A9.2. , and Table A9.1.) to transition restricted airspace unless otherwise directed by
  Cherokee. RPA Colored Routes are scheduled and used as follows:
     A9.3.5.1. Green Route (South) SFC to Assigned Altitude (Green Route points S1
     through S9) may be used by RPA aircraft to facilitate departures and recoveries between
112                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


      working airspace and HMN at any time, regardless of airspace ownership by 49th Wing
      units. The Green Route corridor is ½ NM inside WSMR Restricted Airspace perimeter.
      A9.3.5.2. Departures and recoveries along any other Colored Route require RPA Ops
      Sup to coordinate with affected airspace owners. RPA Ops Sups will notify WSRF WS
      of the coordinated route and altitudes.
      A9.3.5.3. WSRF will advise airspace users if a colored route is active, i.e. “Green Route
      (South) is active at Fight Level 180.” WSRF will include amplifying information if RPA
      aircraft are climbing or descending, by providing the associated block altitude
      information. Aircraft transiting RPA colored routes will fly altitudes as assigned by
      Cherokee.

A9.4. Ground Operations.
   A9.4.1. RPA Designated Start Areas: Main Ramp, North Ramp and all arm/de-arms.
   A9.4.2. RPA Towing Procedures. Towing procedures are IAW HAFBSUP 13-213.
   A9.4.3. RPA Taxi Restrictions.
        A9.4.3.1. Due to line of sight communication issues, RPA shall not be taxied to or
        through the West Ramp or on Taxilane Alpha abeam the T-38/GAF engine run hush
        houses at any time.
        A9.4.3.2. Unless modified by the OG/CC, the following restrictions apply to RPA’s use
        of Taxiway Delta.
           A9.4.3.2.1. RPA crews will not use Taxiway Delta North of Runway 25.
 116                                                HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


          A9.4.3.2.2. RPA crews will not takeoff or descend any lower than pattern altitude
          while any other RPA is under Line of Sight (LOS) control on Taxiway Delta.
          A9.4.3.2.3. RPA crews will make an advisory call on RPA common prior to taxiing
          onto Taxiway Delta and after clearing Taxiway Delta. Additionally, RPA crews can
          contact the SOF for assistance with deconfliction.
       A9.4.3.3. Taxiing RPAs are extremely susceptible to heat extremes above 95°F. During
       these times, aircraft should be given the most direct taxi routing and expedited take-off
       clearance so as to reduce exposure on the ground.
          A9.4.3.3.1. All RPA LOS flight and ground movement operations at Holloman will
          be conducted with both AV TX 1 and 2 set to “On” with AV TX Power Control set to
          “High”. This does not prohibit crews from using AV TX Power Control “Low” to
          manage transmitter temperatures while at a complete stop.
       A9.4.3.4. Sunshades. Aircrews will taxi out of the sunshades from south to north. A
       marshaller will be used until clear of the sunshade. When recovering to the sunshades,
       aircrew will use a marshaller to taxi into the parking area then shut down. Crews will
       avoid taxiing into the sunshades.
   A9.4.4. RPA Aircraft Arresting System Configurations.
       A9.4.4.1. RPA are unable to taxi over arresting cables therefore Scheduling will provide
       Barrier Maintenance (49 CES/CEOFP) the flight schedule NLT the day prior for AM
       coordination.
       A9.4.4.2. Fifteen minutes prior to take-off and landing, Tower shall ensure all applicable
       cables are de-strung.
       A9.4.4.3. Runway 16/34 is the primary RPA departure and arrival runway. Coordination
       is required one hour prior to departure time for other than primary runway.
   A9.4.5. GDT Power. Prior to applying power to the GDT, aircrew will establish reasonable
   certainty that no RPAs are established inside the perch through 500ft climb out, (using Zeus)
   and will make an advisory radio call on RPA Common Frequency (Example: “GCS 5034,
   Going Active Pool 3”). NOTE: Crews shall monitor RPA Common Frequency for 5 seconds
   prior to powering on the GDT and continue to monitor the RPA Common Frequency, ready
   to turn the GDT back off, for 6-9 seconds afterwards.
       A9.4.5.1. The current airfield locations of the GDT towers have been sited IAW UFC
       03-260-01 and USAF Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) criteria. Changes to the
       tower locations or use of additional mobile GDT towers will be coordinated with AM.
A9.5. Departure Procedures.
   A9.5.1. RPA shall depart via routings as outlined in Figure A9.1. PIC shall contact
   Clearance Delivery and request a specific colored routing. Clearance Delivery shall issue the
   clearance with colored routing, departure frequency and transponder code.
   A9.5.2. RPA shall have an operational transponder and squawk as determined by ATC.
   A9.5.3. If active restricted airspace dictates, Clearance Delivery shall issue crossing
   restrictions along the route such as “CROSS THE 44 LINE AT OR ABOVE 13,000”. Outside
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              117


   HMN Class D airspace, RPA shall resume the preprogrammed departure route requested via
   the aircraft’s flight plan.
   A9.5.4. Example Flight Plan Clearances:
      A9.5.4.1. “BONES25, GREEN NORTH DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED, DEPARTURE
      FREQENCY CHANNEL 5, SQUAWK 0271”.
      A9.5.4.2. “CLAW20, ORANGE NORTH TO RED WEST DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED,
      DEPARTURE FREQENCY CHANNEL 5, SQUAWK 0271”.
      A9.5.4.3. “BONES09, ORANGE NORTH DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED, CROSS THE 44
      LINE AT OR ABOVE 13,000, DEPARTURE FREQUENCY CHANNEL 5, SQUAWK
      0271”.
A9.6. Range Operations/Weapons Employment.
   A9.6.1. Local range operations will be IAW AFI 13-212 HAFB ADDENDA-A, and when
   inside WSMR airspace, WSMR FSOP governing the specific flight mission.
   A9.6.2. Laser bore-sight runs on Oscura range shall be south to north only and IAW WSMR
   FSOP governing the specific flight mission.
   A9.6.3. In the event of unexploded ordnance, the PIC will pass aircraft release parameters
   and intended target to RCO. If impact point is observed, pass coordinates as well.
   A9.6.4. Unless accomplished by an LR crew in conjunction with A10.4.5. (Advisory call on
   RPA Common Frequency prior to applying power to the GDT), RPAs WILL NOT turn on an
   AV transmitter with a directional antenna pointed towards the airfield unless:
      A9.6.4.1. A reasonable certainty exists that no RPAs are established inside the perch
      through 500ft on climb out (using Zeus).
      A9.6.4.2. The crew makes an advisory call on RPA Common Frequency (Example:
      “BONES34, GOING ACTIVE, POOL X”). NOTE: Crews shall monitor RPA Common
      Frequency for 5 seconds prior to powering on the AV transmitter and continue to monitor
      the RPA Common Frequency, ready to turn the AV transmitter back off, for 6-9 seconds
      afterwards.
   A9.6.5. HMN RPAs are authorized to operate no lower than 13000 ft MSL in the vicinity of
   the THAAD radar site. In the event that live weapons are loaded on the RPA, the 23000 ft
   MSL restriction will apply.
   A9.6.6. Under current agreements Cherokee controls all aircraft above the coordination
   altitude in R5103, to include aircraft dropping ordnance from above the coordination altitude,
   along with all fast movers below the coordination altitude. Bliss Radio controls all aircraft
   below the coordination altitude with the exception of fast movers. For aircraft that are
   scheduled to use the Centennial Fly Area/Centennial Range immediately after entry into
   R5103, Cherokee will accomplish the required coordination prior to providing clearance into
   the airspace.
      A9.6.6.1. Aircraft that will operate in R5103 but are scheduled to use the Centennial Fly
      Area/Centennial Range at a later time will contact Cherokee five minutes prior to using
      the Centennial Fly Area/Centennial Range (for example, RPAs dropping GBU-12s on
 118                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


       Centennial). Once Cherokee has coordinated with Bliss Radio they will clear the aircraft
       to use the CFA/CR. Aircrew will not utilize the Centennial Fly Area/Centennial Range
       until this clearance has been granted. This does not prevent aircraft from overflying the
       Centennial Fly Area/Centennial Range, above the coordination altitude, as scheduled.
       However, it will improve safety by ensuring that Cherokee provides Bliss Radio
       notification prior to aircraft either flying below the coordination altitude or releasing
       ordnance that will pass below the coordination altitude.
       A9.6.6.2. Top 3’s and Aircrew will be notified that the CFA is active via comments in
       the “Operating Airspace” section of the daily Airspace Schedule available via current
       scheduling software.
A9.7. Arrival Procedures.
   A9.7.1. All RPAs shall recover from restricted airspace IAW A10.3.5. or as directed by
   ATC. If required, appropriate altitude restrictions along recovery route shall be issued by
   Cherokee. Fighter aircraft will have traffic priority during their recovery and RPA may be
   requested to “ORBIT PRESENT POSITION”, “PROCEED TO LAST SIX”, or orbit as
   directed by ATC.
   A9.7.2. RPAs shall enter HMN Class D airspace via the orange or green routes outlined in
   paragraph A9.3.5. or as directed by ATC. Cardinal heading is the direction to fly on the
   route.
   A9.7.3. Example Recovery Clearances:
       A9.7.3.1. ATC: “CLAW24, RECOVER VIA GREEN, NORTH”.
       A9.7.3.2. ATC: “BONES38, RECOVER VIA RED, EAST, ORANGE, SOUTH”.
       A9.7.3.3. ATC: “CLAW30, RECOVER VIA ORANGE, SOUTH, CROSS THE 44 LINE
       AT OR ABOVE 13,000”.
A9.8. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   A9.8.1. Tower WS and the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) have the authority to limit RPA
   multiple approaches for safety reasons.
   A9.8.2. RPA VFR Pattern Weather Minimums. Overhead/Rectangular: Ceiling must be
   500ft above the requested Overhead/Rectangular pattern altitude or orbit area and 3 SM
   visibility. SFO: Ceiling must be 1000ft above pattern altitude and visibility 5 SM.
   A9.8.3. Overhead Pattern. Pattern altitude (initial point) is 5100ft or 5600ft MSL or as
   directed by ATC. RPA overhead patterns at night are permitted with operational infrared
   (IR) camera or sensor. RPA overhead break shall normally be away from the main base (RY
   16/34 west break; RY 22/04/25/07 north break).
   A9.8.4. Rectangular Pattern. Pattern altitudes for RPA are 5100ft MSL for MQ-1 and
   5600ft MSL for MQ-9.
       A9.8.4.1. Runway 16 shall normally be west patterns. Expect orbits 3 NM southwest of
       airfield and minimum 3000ft west of runway centerline, midfield downwind, or as
       directed by Tower for de-confliction from departing and arriving traffic.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             119


     A9.8.4.2. Runway 34 shall normally be west patterns. Expect orbits at midfield
     downwind, Last Six, or as directed by ATC for de-confliction from departing and
     arriving traffic.
     A9.8.4.3. Runway 07/25 shall normally be north patterns. Expect orbits at midfield
     downwind, “LAST SIX”, or as directed by Tower for de-confliction from departing and
     arriving traffic. Avoid left traffic to runway 25 to the max extent possible.
     A9.8.4.4. Runway 04/22 shall normally be north patterns. Expect orbits at midfield
     downwind, Last Six, or as directed by Tower for de-confliction from departing and
     arriving traffic.
     A9.8.4.5. Tower may direct other non-standard de-confliction orbits or pattern altitudes
     when required.
  A9.8.5. Protection of the 360 Degree Overhead Pattern. After completing approach,
  maintain at or below 5600ft MSL until departure end unless otherwise directed by Tower.
  For Runway 25, maintain at or below 5600ft MSL until west end of Taxiway Golf. Fighter
  overhead pattern breakouts may climb to 6600ft MSL in the direction of the pattern until
  clear of the outside downwind. When an orbit area conflicts with overhead pattern breakout,
  Tower will direct RPA orbits at or above 7100ft MSL.
  A9.8.6. RPA Straight-in. RPA will be at or below 5600ft MSL prior to departing 3 NM
  final.
  A9.8.7. RPA SFO Restrictions/Cut-offs.
     A9.8.7.1. Only locally assigned RPA may conduct SFO approaches at HMN.
     A9.8.7.2. Prior coordination with Tower WS is required to conduct an SFO. Prior
     coordination does not constitute blanket approval. Approval or disapproval shall take
     place real time after considering traffic volume and safety concerns. Straight-in or
     Alternate-Entry SFOs are not authorized.
     A9.8.7.3. No more than two RPA will be allowed to execute SFO procedures
     simultaneously. Maximum number of aircraft operations while an SFO approach is being
     conducted are: Fighters: two; Heavy aircraft: one; Turboprop: two; RPA: three.
     Aircraft operations include aircraft requesting departure, inbound aircraft within 15 miles
     (regardless of frequency) and over flights within the Class D airspace (regardless of
     frequency). Tower WS will determine the number of aircraft that can safely operate in
     the VFR pattern. Tower must consider other aircraft characteristics, climb-out, missed
     approach, availability of the Tower Radar Display, active restricted airspace, and FAA
     mandated intersecting/same runway separation before authorizing other operations during
     SFO patterns.
     A9.8.7.4. RPA SFO vs. Other IFR/VFR Straight-in Arrivals. Other aircraft inbound to
     the same or intersecting runway must be more than 15 flying miles away for fighters and
     10 flying miles away for all other aircraft. Aircraft inside the 15/10 mile cutoff may be
     sequenced behind the RPA or held outside the Class D.
     A9.8.7.5. RPA SFO vs. Other IFR/VFR Departures. Departures from the same or
     intersecting runway must be rolling before an SFO reports low key.
 120                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


A9. 8.7.6. SFOs are only authorized to terminate in a low approach.
       A9.8.7.7. SFOs at night are permitted IAW Memorandum for ACC Waiver to AFI 11-
       202V3, Night Simulated Flameout (SFO) Operations Waiver.
   A9.8.8. SFO Pattern Specifications:
       A9.8.8.1. Once Tower approves the SFO recovery, climb or descend to 6100ft MSL
       (MQ-1) or 6600ft MSL (MQ-9) along the inside or outside downwind ground track.
       Report High Key and perform engine-out procedures while remaining within the inside
       downwind ground track.
       A9.8.8.2. All SFO patterns begin with the RPA aligned with the runway centerline, at the
       approach end of the landing runway, defined as the first one-third of the runway in use.
       SFO patterns will be flown toward the inside downwind as appropriate for both MQ-1
       and MQ-9 (Figures A9.3. through Figure A9.8.). Patterns to Runway 16/34 will remain
       to the west of the runway and patterns to Runway 04/22 and 07/25 will remain to the
       north of the runway.
       A9.8.8.3. All SFO patterns will remain clear of HMN housing when able.
       A9.8.8.4. SFO High Key:
       MQ-9: Over the runway approach end at 6600ft MSL and airspeed approximately 100
       knots.
       MQ-1: Over the runway approach end at 6100ft MSL and airspeed approximately 76
       knots.
       A9.8.8.5. SFO Low Key:
       MQ-9: A point abeam the intended touchdown zone, between 5200ft and 5500ft MSL.
       MQ-1: A point abeam the intended touchdown zone, between 5100ft and 5300ft MSL.
       A9.8.8.6. SFO Base Key:
           A9.8.8.6.1. MQ-9: A point halfway through the final turn between 4900ft and 5100ft
           MSL.
           A9.8.8.6.2. MQ-1: A point halfway through the final turn between 4700ft and 4900ft
           MSL.
       A9.8.8.7. SFO Breakouts:

Table A9.2. SFO Breakouts.
Runways 16/34: Westerly climbing turn back to high key altitude.
Runways 04/22/07/25: Northerly climbing turn back to high key altitude.
Different breakout procedures may be directed by Tower for de-confliction purposes or approved
upon pilot request. “Breakout” will normally not be used once an RPA has departed Low Key,
instead Tower will use “Go Around (additional instructions as necessary)”.
   A9.8.9. SFO Phraseology:
       A9.8.9.1. Request SFO approach with Tower by stating “(Call Sign), REQUEST HIGH
       KEY AT at (Altitude)”.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              121


     A9.8.9.2. Traffic permitting, Tower will approve the SFO by stating “(Call Sign),
     REPORT HIGH KEY AT (Altitude)”.
     A9.8.9.3. Report High Key, “(Call Sign), HIGH KEY”.
     A9.8.9.4. Tower will request the RPA to report Low Key “(Call Sign), REPORT LOW
     KEY”.
     A9.8.9.5. Report Low Key, “(Call Sign), LOW KEY, GEAR DOWN, LOW APPROACH”.
     A9.8.9.6. At Low Key, Tower will issue low approach clearance or alternate
     instructions.
     A9.8.9.7. Report Base Key (Optional). “(Call Sign), BASE KEY”.
     A9.8.9.8. At Base Key, Tower will issue low approach clearance or alternate
     instructions.
  A9.8.10. West Outside Downwind/Re-Entry (Runway 16/34 only) may be used for training
  or de-confliction from departing and arriving traffic. West Outside Downwind ground track
  is displaced 3 NM west of Runway 16 or 34. See Figures A9.3. and A9.4.
     A9.8.10.1. At departure end initiate a right turn (Runway 16) or a left turn (Runway 34),
     maintain at or below 5600ft MSL. Higher than standard pattern altitudes may be
     requested or directed. Coordinate intentions (overhead, straight-in, or SFO) with Tower
     when established on the West Outside Downwind. Turn 90-to-initial or base to intercept
     3 NM. At 90-to-initial, pilots will report: “(Call-Sign) 90-to-initial, or (Call-Sign)
     descending straight-in”. Tower will acknowledge the position report and may issue
     additional reporting instructions or non-standard de-confliction orbits when required.
  A9.8.11. Launch and Recovery Safety Pilot Program.
     A9.8.11.1. Unless modified by the OG/CC, all takeoffs, SFOs, and landings will have a
     safety pilot in the GCS. The safety pilot will attend the brief, step with the crew, and be
     in the GCS for all operations below pattern altitude.
         A9.8.11.1.1. The safety pilot will pay particular attention to the landing phase of
         operations and backup the crew with speed, altitude, ground track, and flare picture.
         Anytime the aircraft is transitioning to land and is outside of published criterion or
         limits, a Go-Around will be called by any member of the crew.
         A9.8.11.1.2. During LR Instructor Pilot (LRIP) upgrade sorties the upgrading LRIP
         is authorized to serve as the safety pilot for takeoff and any type of approach flown by
         the LRIP.
         A9.8.11.1.3. LR initial qualification sorties require a safety pilot any time the LRIP
         takes the seat to demonstrate an approach. Once the upgrading LR pilot has
         successfully completed their LR simulator sorties they may serve as the safety pilot
         for any approach other than an SFO. Once all LR simulator sorties and two pattern
         sorties have been successfully completed the upgrading LR pilot may serve as the
         safety pilot for SFO’s.
     A9.8.11.2. Unless modified by the OG/CC, all other SFO’s will be accomplished under
     LRIP supervision. MQ-9 SFO’s will be limited to less than 8500 lbs gross weight.

A9.9. Abnormal/Emergency Procedures.
   A9.9.1. Loss of Thrust or Engine Failure East of the Valmont. An emergency such as a loss
   of thrust or engine failure that prevents the aircraft from crossing the Valmont corridor at or
   above FL180 does not preclude the crew from attempting to glide back to Holloman. The
   crew will declare the emergency with the appropriate ATC agency as soon as possible in
   order to receive priority as well as assistance with coordination and deconfliction.
   A9.9.2. RPA Hung Forward Firing Ordnance:
      A9.9.2.1. Safe switches and declare an IFE. Avoid pointing aircraft at populated areas.
      Recover straight in Runway 22 or backup Runway 25.
      A9.9.2.2. After landing stop and de-arm at the end of Runway 22 (primary) or Runway
      25 (secondary). Point the aircraft's nose to heading 270-290 degrees on runway. Once
      ordnance is declared safe, aircraft may taxi to park.
      A9.9.2.3. If landing Runway 22, DO NOT enter Taxiway Golf without clearance.
   A9.9.3. (MQ-9 only) Hung Free-Fall Ordnance. MQ-9s with hung free-fall ordnance will
   comply with the Hung Ordinance Procedures section of this instruction.
   A9.9.4. RPA Emergency Divert Base Designation. HMN assigned RPAs do not currently
   have an emergency divert base other than HMN.
   A9.9.5. Lightning:
126                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


      A9.9.5.1. RPA MD-1 Ground Control Stations (GCS) do not have integral lightning
      protection. Until a lightning protection system is installed, the following steps will be
      followed to mitigate the hazard and risk to aircrew.
      A9.9.5.2. The “GCS farm” located on the ramp behind building 302 is surrounded by
      taller buildings with lightning protection installed; per T.O. 1Q-1(M)A-1 7.2.2.3, the
      GCS “may be protected by area lightning protection systems at the operating location.”
      Mission Control Element operations may continue in the event a lightning within 5 NM
      warning has been issued; however, personnel will not transit to or from the GCS until the
      lighting within 5 NM warning has been rescinded.
      A9.9.5.3. Launch and Recovery (LR) operations for proficiency or training should cease
      once a lightning within 5 NM watch has been issued.
  A9.9.6. RPA Weather Recall Procedures.
      A9.9.6.1. 49 OSS Weather Flight (49 OSS/OSW) will immediately notify the SOF and
      Tower with pertinent adverse conditions and location. Any pilot or controller observing
      such conditions should immediately pass that information to their Ops Sup, SOF, Tower
      WS or WSRF WS, and 49 OSS/OSW.
      A9.9.6.2. The SOF will coordinate with RPA Ops Sup when determining whether to
      recall, discontinue departures, or direct full-stops. RPA’s will recover IAW AFI 11-
      2MDS V3 specific guidance.
  A9.9.7. RPA Forced Landing Procedures.
      A9.9.7.1. If unable to glide back to HMN using LOS link, avoid populated areas and
      glide to the nearest uninhabited, undeveloped site. Avoid the following areas:
         A9.9.7.1.1. Red Butte (N33.8262 W106.6645).

        A9.9.7.1.21. RPA’s with live ordnance will make every effort to remain within the
        impact area of assigned range.
  A9.9.8. RPA Lost Link Procedures.
     A9.9.8.1. As soon as conditions permit, the PIC shall notify controlling agency the
     following: time of lost link, last known position, altitude, direction of flight, and confirm
     execution of lost link procedures.
     A9.9.8.2. In the event a RPA goes lost link, it will fly it’s pre-programmed emergency
     mission which will terminate in the Last Six waypoints (Figure A9.9.). The PIC shall
     immediately notify the controlling agency (Tower, WSRF, or ABQ ARTCC) of the lost
     link condition. The PIC will advise the controlling agency of the RTB timetable and
     routing. ATC will advise any aircraft or agencies that might be affected by the lost link
     aircraft. A lost link aircraft that reaches the Last Six area and is within one hour of fuel
     exhaustion will be considered an emergency aircraft and the PIC shall declare an IFE
     with the controlling agency.
     A9.9.8.3. RPA aircrew will de-conflict their emergency missions over Last Six in 1000ft
     increments. In the event weather and/or airspace preclude use of scheduled orbits, the
     Ops Sup(s) will coordinate 500ft altitude stacks or direct the RPA to RTB as required.
     Top 3s will develop and brief LL de-confliction plan for ALL RPAs and Airspaces. RPA
     aircrew will keep current mission information updated in Skynet. The following
     emergency mission altitude blocks will be utilized as the standard unless coordinated by
     Squadron Top3/Ops Sups: 9 ATKS –10100’/10600’; 29 ATKS –9100’/9600’; 6 RS –
     8100’/8600' and 7100’/7600’.
     A9.9.8.4. Unless specifically mission planned, briefed, and executed in compliance with
     all applicable guidance/instructions, all RPA aircrew will set a range Minimum Altitude
     MSL that will provide a mountainous terrain clearance of 2,000 feet above the highest
     obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within 5 NM of the
     operating area. During LR all RPA aircrews will set ILLH to planned runway heading
     and ILLA to 4600ft MSL; MQ-1 aircrew will set a Minimum Altitude MSL to 5100ft
     MSL, and MQ-9 aircrew will set 5600ft MSL. Except for airspace delays, RPAs shall be
     pre-programmed to squawk 0277 when they are lost link.
128                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


      A9.9.8.5. On departure, the preprogrammed emergency mission will be set to follow the
      cleared departure routing and delay in the assigned airspace for no less than 30 minutes
      before recovering.
      A9.9.8.6. While in assigned airspace, the preprogrammed emergency mission will be set
      to begin with no less than a 30 minute delay at the assigned altitude (squawk normal),
      then recover as described above (squawk 0277). If altitude change is required for de-
      confliction, aircraft will climb/descend upon departing loiter enroute to WP 2 and remain
      at new altitude for RTB.
         A9.9.8.6.1. Ensure emergency mission crosses Valmont at/above FL180. Waypoint
         1; 30 min loiter at assigned altitude. If Ku link cannot be re-established Top 3s will
         attempt to coordinate for crews to acquire link via LOS during this loiter prior to a/c
         departing 5103.
         A9.9.8.6.2. If below FL180, Waypoint 2; 30 min loiter climbing to Skynet de-
         conflicted odd altitude (18500, 19500, 20500, etc). Remain at new altitude for RTB.
         Waypoint 2 will be Top 3 assigned/de-conflicted (Points A or B from current IFG
         RPA annex).
      A9.9.8.7. During recovery, the preprogrammed emergency mission will be set fly a
      predictable ground track along the cleared recovery routing. If approaching the field
      from the southwest to northwest quadrant, the RPA shall fly to O2 of the Orange Route
      and then proceed direct to the Last Six. If approaching the field from any other quadrant,
      the RPA will fly to a point overhead the field and then proceed direct to the Last Six.
      Lost Link planning will not descend the RPA below 7100ft MSL until after the LR crew
      has established two-way communication with the tower.
      A9.9.8.8. In the event lost link occurs in the Class D airspace:
         A9.9.8.8.1. (MQ-9) The preprogrammed emergency mission will be set to fly the
         RPA direct to a point 1 NM past the departure end of the active runway. The RPA
         will then turn to its second waypoint, 0.3 NM south of the Last Six. The RPA will
         climb no higher than 1500ft AGL. After reaching the second waypoint, the lost link
         aircraft will then climb to its assigned altitude as it flies the Last Six waypoints.
         A9.9.8.8.2. (MQ-1) The first way point in the preprogrammed emergency mission
         will be set to fly the RPA to “Pattern Lost Link Entry Point #2” as depicted in Table
         A9.3. at 1000ft AGL for all runways. The lost link aircraft will then climb to its
         assigned altitude as it flies the Last Six waypoints.
      A9.9.8.9. If the RPA departs its lost link route and the PIC has aircraft positional
      awareness, he/she shall notify the controlling agency immediately.
      A9.9.8.10. If control of the RPA cannot be regained, it will orbit at the Last Six until fuel
      exhaustion.
      A9.9.8.11. If the data link cannot be re-established within one hour of fuel exhaustion,
      the SOF (or Ops Sup, if no SOF on duty) shall coordinate with the OG/CC for the
      probable activation of the HAFB Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2,
      On/Off Base Aircraft Accident Checklist(s).
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                           129


      A9.9.8.12. The Last Six orbit area (Figure A9.9. and Table A9.3.) is the primary C-band
      recovery orbit for aircraft that have lost Ku band command and control links, but may
      also be used as a delay orbit during periods of traffic pattern saturation.
      A9.9.8.13. ROMEO departures are not authorized when a Lost Link RPA is orbiting at
      the Last Six.
      A9.9.8.14. Lost Link while on ground/taxiing. If an RPA loses link while on the ground
      (less than approximately 50 KIAS—software and MQ-1/9 specific), the throttle will be
      set to ground idle, brakes will be set, and the engine will be killed all within seven
      seconds. Approximately 25 seconds later the brakes will be released and the aircraft may
      roll. RPA Maintenance will have to respond and tow the aircraft off of the runway or
      taxiway.

       greater emergency exists, squawk 7700.
       A9.9.9.2. Direct telephone communications between ATC and a NORDO RPA are the
       primary means of back-up communication. NORDO RPA WILL NOT conduct multiple
       VFR practice patterns. NORDO RPA will use the telephone to coordinate recovery and
       landing clearance. ATC will advise all effected aircraft of a NORDO RPA’s intentions.
       A9.9.9.3. RPAs shall configure their Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) or targeting
       pod (video cameras) to position mode while operating below 500ft AGL. Consequently,
       the use of standard light gun signals by Tower during RPA NORDO situations on final
       would normally be ineffective and is not recommended.
A9.10. GPS Jamming and RPA Operations.
   A9.10.1. This section identifies RPA procedures for scheduling and flying during Global
   Positioning System (GPS) jamming activities. The Office of Primary Responsibility for
   guidance in this section is 49th Operations Support Squadron Wing Weapons (49 OSS/OSK).
   A9.10.2. Wing Scheduling (49 OSS/OSOS) is responsible for coordinating and tracking
   GPS jamming in Holloman’s Local Airspace. The following timeline is stated in WSMR OI
   70-3 for scheduling GPS jamming. However in execution, the timeline may happen
   significantly closer to the execution date.
       A9.10.2.1. T-60 - WSMR Range Scheduling enters event into schedule.
       A9.10.2.2. T-28 – Wing Scheduling is provided information package at weekly
       scheduling meeting. This includes program description, jammer locations, GIANT L1
       and L2 Jam to Signal (J/S) ratio plots, schedule, etc. GIANT plots will include the
       scheduled flying window, ±1 hour, for:
          A9.10.2.2.1. Holloman Ramp at 15ft AGL, for initial L1 acquisition.
          A9.10.2.2.2. Holloman Airspace at 10K, 15K, 20K, and 25K ft MSL.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                          131


     A9.10.2.3. T-14 - GPS Jamming Msn submitted for Conduct Approval.
     A9.10.2.4. T-7 - WSMR mission is coded and committed to schedule, schedule locked.
     A9.10.2.5. T-0 - Test Execution Day.
  A9.10.3. Wing Scheduling will forward applicable information to the effected squadrons
  ASAP to enhance squadron awareness. Wing Scheduling will deconflict GPS jamming with
  RPA operations using definitive MGRS lines of deconfliction to separate RPA ops from GPS
  jamming greater than a 50 db J/S ratio for MQ-1s and a 60 db J/S ratio for MQ-9s, as
  depicted by GIANT plots. These maximum J/S ratios will be adhered to regardless of GPS
  jamming type (L1 or L2 as described below). Finally, to aid in real-time execution by RPA
  Top3s, Next Day (ND) and Current Day (CD) GIANT plots, and/or lines of deconfliction, for
  each specific CSE Airspace Restriction Msn ID/Name will be posted or linked in/from the
  CSE home page under Scheduling Documents.
  A9.10.4. Aircrew will also add GPS jamming events into their ORM, by defining GPS
  jamming as “Mission Issues – Airspace: Real-time Coord”. While not driving overall
  Mission ORM to any specific level, this should be considered in weighing overall mission
  risk and mitigation strategies.
  A9.10.5. The GPS signal is broadcast on two frequencies, L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2
  (1227.60 MHz). L1 contains civilian coarse-acquisition (C/A) code and the military
  encrypted (P) code, while L2 only contains the P code. GPS jamming can occur on either of
  these two frequencies.
     A9.10.5.1. (MQ-9 Only) .
         A9.10.5.1.1. The MQ-9 utilizes three H-764 Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) units that
         work off of the L1 signal. MQ-9 aircrew are not able to directly see (Jam-to-Signal)
         J/S levels, however:
            A9.10.5.1.1.1. MQ-9 Carrier-to-Noise (C/No) information is available on VIT 32
            which shows how well GPS satellites are being tracked by the NAV systems. A
            C/No less than 20dbHz is an indication of degradation.
            A9.10.5.1.1.2. The MQ-9 GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) on VIT 23 will display the
            GPS quality in the form of a code. A normal MQ-9 GPS FOM is ‘01’ meaning
            accuracy is ≤ 25m as listed in the TO 1Q-9(M)A-1 Figure 1-101.
            A9.10.5.1.1.3. The status of the MQ-9 FCAs and Nav Quality can also be found
            on VIT 63. A normal Nav Quality is ‘B’ meaning the quality is 1m as listed in
            the TO 1Q-9(M)A-1 Figure 1-98. Additional detail on each FCA is found on
            VITs 40-42.
         A9.10.5.1.2. Launching MQ-9 aircrew will verify a valid “P” code is loaded by
         verifying “GPS Key 8880” on VIT 23.
         A9.10.5.1.3. MQ-9 aircrew may see the following HDD warning messages and
         should apply the following corrective actions, IAW TO 1Q-9(M)A-1, Fig 3-14

       than 0.8 nm per hour.
       A9.10.5.3. (MQ-1 Only) .
          A9.10.5.3.1. The MQ-1 Nav 2 Sensor (NOVATEL) utilizes L2 to enhance the
          navigation solution accuracy, but cannot calculate the navigation solution without L1,
          since it is a civilian receiver. The MQ-1 Nav 1 System (LN-100G) is able to
          calculate a navigation solution on either L1 or L2. MQ-1 aircrew are not able to
          directly see (Jam-to-Signal) J/S levels.        However, C/No (Carrier-to-Noise)
          information is available, which shows how well GPS satellites are being tracked by
          the NAV systems. For flight operations, a lower J/S and a higher C/No are
          preferable.
          A9.10.5.3.2. Launching MQ-1 aircrew will verify a valid “P” code is loaded by
          verifying “GPS Key 8880” loaded on VITs 0, 7 or 67.
          A9.10.5.3.3. MQ-1 aircrews may see varying “states” of NOVATEL readiness and

              A9.10.5.3.3.3. MQ-1 “Nav sensor 2 – is permanently degraded”.

Table A10.6. MQ-1 “Nav sensor 2 – is permanently degraded”.
               -Ensure Nav sensor 1 is in use
               -Nav 2 is still manually selectable
               -Land as soon as practical

          A9.10.5.3.4. While TO 1Q-1(M)B-1, Fig 3-17 “Warning Messages” also directs
          “land as soon as practical” for NAV1 failures, MA-1 crews will initiate RTB with a
          failed NAV1 system.
   A9.10.6. With a complete loss of GPS both MQ-9 and MQ-1 crews will accomplish the
   Ku POWER DOWN checklist as part of their normal recovery. Aircrew will use GDT
   Tracking selected to AZIMUTH and the GDT slew switch to align the GDT with the last
   known location of the a/c. Once LOS link has been established, select the GDT Tracking to
   IN-FLT TRACK. If crews are not confident in their ability to accurately discern their
   position in relation to Holloman, crews may ask Holloman Approach for a BULLSEYE cut
   and vectors to a VFR straight-in. Holloman Approach is also capable of providing no-gyro
   vectors to a VFR straight-in, as necessary, though primary heading information is not GPS
   based.
   A9.10.7. If, due to GPS jamming, MQ-9 and MQ-1 aircrew are unable to maintain a C-
   Band link they will call “CEASE BUZZER” to Cherokee, requesting a temporary cessation
   of GPS jamming. Cherokee will then call the specific test POC to relay the “CEASE
   BUZZER” message. Once GPS jamming has ceased, a navigation solution should occur
   immediately, allowing an immediate RTB. Top3 will contact the test POC once RTB is
   complete.
   A9.10.8. If any navigation degradation occurs, RPA aircrew will save all mission data
   loggers and DVR information, and will note the time, location (lat/long/altitude, if able), and
   results of the degradation. Affected aircrew will coordinate with squadron leadership, Wing
   Weapons, Wing Scheduling, and the test POC within one business today to relay this
   information for troubleshooting and lessons learned.

                   UNCONTROLLED AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (UAO)

A10.1. Introduction.  This attachment implements AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations
Procedures and Programs, Uncontrolled Airfield policy.
   A10.1.1. It outlines flying procedures for HMN Aero Club Flight Training Center (AC), 96
   TG, Army Air Office (AA), and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) to operate during periods when HMN
   ATC Tower and AM are closed.
   A10.1.2. This attachment also outlines airfield operating procedures for the units that are
   authorized access to the runways, Taxiway Golf, and North Ramp when the airfield is closed.
   In addition to the units above, airfield drivers include: FD, 49th Security Force Squadron (49
   SFS), Ambulance Response, Crash Recovery, Operations Duty Officers (ODO), Barrier and
   Airfield Maintenance, Exterior Electric, ATCALS maintenance, 49th Logistics Readiness
   Squadron
   (49 LRS) Fuels, Detachment-1 82nd Aerial Target Squadron (Det-1 82ATRS), and its
   contractors.
   A10.1.3. Additionally, the AOF and 49 WG/CP have duties in this publication. All of the
   above units are responsible for understanding the UAO process and their responsibilities
   within this publication. The intent is to ensure the safe arrival/departure of aircraft during
   UAO.
A10.2. UAO Limitations. Operations conducted under the scope of this attachment have
specific limitations. Note: AC refers to all locally assigned aero club aircraft. 96 TG refers
solely to aircraft operating under the 586th Flight Test Squadron. AA refers to all Army Air
rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft assigned to HMN. CAP refers to all aircraft which have been
approved through the Alamogordo CAP squadron. All CAP aircraft not assigned to Alamogordo
will coordinate a PPR through the Alamogordo CAP squadron. At no time shall any
organization operate a jet aircraft. Unit will be cognizant of weight restrictions for taxiways and
parking areas.
   A10.2.1. HMN airfield hours of operation are as published in paragraph 2.20.1. UAO will
   take place during periods when the airfield is closed. If a unit would like to operate during
   hours of darkness, the ODO will be trained on airfield lighting system operation.
   A10.2.2. Aircraft shall not depart if weather is forecasted to go below VFR minimums
   within one hour plus or minus the scheduled departure/arrival time.
       A10.2.2.1. Minimum ceiling is 1500 AGL with minimum visibility of 3 SM. Exception:
       Rotary wing aircraft may adhere to service minimums.
   A10.2.3. UAO shall be limited to a single departure/arrival for each aircraft. Pattern work is
   prohibited. Pilots must depart the aerodrome following initial takeoff unless experiencing a
   situation that requires an immediate landing. Pilots returning HMN to land shall make one
   pattern to a full stop landing.
   A10.2.4. AC, 96 TG, CAP, and AA shall ensure operations at the airfield do not conflict
   with scheduled PMI of ATCALS or airfield equipment. PMI schedules are published in the
   FLIP. If a situation arises where UAO will impact airfield/ATCALS/barrier/lighting
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              135


   maintenance, the ODO and maintenance unit will coordinate and attempt to resolve. If both
   the ODO and maintenance unit deem safe, UAO and maintenance may occur simultaneously.
   If no resolution is possible, the maintenance operation will have priority.
      A10.2.4.1. The unit manager for each participating unit will provide AM with up to date
      ODO contact lists, to include assigned ODOs and ODO’s cell phone number. AM will
      provide unit ODOs, 49 WG/CP, 49th Civil Engineering Squadron (49 CES), 49th
      Communications Squadron (49 CS), SFS, Tower, WSRF, FD, and Ambulance Response
      with the updated ODO contact list.
A10.3. UAO - Procedures.
   A10.3.1. AM will ensure critical information/procedures for HMN UAO are published in the
   FLIP.
   A10.3.2. The ODO is the focal point for operations conducted under the scope of this
   instruction. In supervising UAO, the ODO operates in lieu of the ATC Tower and AM Ops
   to ensure operations are conducted safely, airfield security is not compromised, and that
   emergency response is available as required. If multiple ODOs are present, paragraph
   A10.3.14.2. identifies who will have the lead until termination of their unit’s ops. The ODO
   will coordinate with other ODOs prior to terminating to hand off the lead to another ODO.
   49 WG/CP will be advised by the incoming lead ODO of the “ODO lead” transfer.
      A10.3.2.1. The ODO SHALL NOT perform ATC functions and may not issue ATC
      instructions. Each unit conducting operations in the local area during UAO will have an
      ODO on duty. The ODO will be on duty until their last aircraft shuts down. For aircraft
      arriving from outside of the local flying area (i.e. cross-country arrivals), the unit will
      have                   an                 ODO                    on                   duty
      1 hour prior to scheduled arrival and will remain until the aircraft is parked and the
      engines are shut down. For aircraft departing the local area, the ODO will be on duty
      from 1 hour prior to departure to 30 min after takeoff. The ODO shall provide updated
      arrival/departure times to the 49 WG/CP. 49 WG/CP will pass the arrival/departure times
      to AM on the next duty day via the schedule which will have columns for departure and
      land times.
   A10.3.3. ODO Schedule. The unit manager shall manage the ODO schedule.                  Pilots
   planning to fly when HMN is closed shall ensure an ODO has been scheduled.
   A10.3.4. Preparation. The ODO accomplishes the following steps prior to commencing
   operations.
      A10.3.4.1. Scheduling UAO. The ODO for the requesting unit shall complete the
      Figure A10.1 UAO Setup Checklist, the duty day prior to requested operations. If UAO
      will occur on multiple days, coordination must be accomplished for each day. For
      example, if the requested ops are on Saturday or Sunday, the checklist must be
      accomplished on Friday by close of business (assuming it is not a Holiday or “Down”
      day). If the requested ops are, for example, Wednesday night after the airfield closes or
      Thursday morning before the airfield opens, the checklist must be completed on
      Wednesday by 1600L.
136                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


         A10.3.4.1.1. The ODO shall obtain an in-person briefing from the Airfield Manager
         (AFM) or their designated representative prior to commencing operations. This
         briefing shall be the last checklist item completed. The briefing must address airfield
         facilities status, construction avoidance areas, and planned airfield maintenance
         activities during the period of UAO. Once the checklist is complete, a copy will be
         given to AM for final approval. When ODO calls CE and CS, the ODO will ensure
         that there are no maintenance or PMIs scheduled outside of what is published in the
         FLIP. If an irreconcilable conflict exists, maintenance operations will have priority
         IAW paragraph A10.2.4. NOTE: If the full setup checklist, including AM briefing is
         not accomplished, the respective unit shall not participate in UAO.
         A10.3.4.1.2. AM will retain See Figure A10.1. UAO Setup Checklist for record
         keeping. AM Ops will notify 49WG/CP and fax CP a copy of the upcoming UAO
         schedule when the checklist is turned in.
         A10.3.4.1.3. WSRF/CE/CS/AOF reserve the right to cancel/modify scheduled UAO
         at any time due to unforeseen conflicts. These agencies will call 49 WG/CP to verify
         whether UAO will be occurring. If so, CP will refer the agency to the lead ODO.
         The agency will contact the lead ODO and attempt to coordinate de-confliction. If
         de-confliction is not possible, then the agency shall inform the ODO that ops will
         terminate due to mission essential activities. The agency will inform CP of the
         termination. The ODOs will then notify the CP once ops have terminated.
      A10.3.4.2. The ODO shall obtain a weather briefing for HMN and the surrounding area.
      Any official weather source is acceptable including a self-brief from Direct User Access
      Terminal Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration internet
      aviation weather services.
      A10.3.4.3. The ODO shall contact CP to coordinate commencement of UAO prior to
      their unit’s first aircraft engine start. CP shall in turn notify the 49th Medical Group (49
      MDG) Ambulance response Element, FD, and 49 SFS.
      A10.3.4.4. Prior to aircraft movement, the ODO shall perform an airfield check on all
      taxi routes and runway(s) to be utilized by their aircraft to ensure movement areas are
      clear of FOD, wildlife, obstructions, etc. AM shall provide initial and recurring training
      to all unit ODOs to ensure quality education on appropriate airfield checks. (See Figure
      A10.2. ODO Training Checklist).
  A10.3.5. Flight Plans. IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs,
  all aircraft departing USAF installations must have a flight plan on file with AM (or locally
  assigned unit with approved flight plan processing procedures in place) prior to takeoff. Use
  DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or other authorized forms IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3,
  General Flight Rules. In the remarks section of the flight plan (s) the pilot will annotate
  “UAO”. Flight plans will be retained by originating unit, pilot shall file, activate, and close
  flight plans with ABQ Flight Service Station (FSS) or other applicable facility.
      A10.3.5.1. Units will maintain the original flight plan according to AFRIMS RDS
      available from the Air Force Portal link. Suspension of UAO privileges may occur if unit
      records are not maintained properly.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                                137


  A10.3.6. Step briefing. The ODO shall accomplish an in-person briefing with each aircrew
  prior to launch. The ODO shall ensure knowledge of each aircrew’s intentions.
  Additionally, the ODO shall brief aircrews on any airfield taxi, departure, and landing
  restrictions.
  A10.3.7. Taxi Routes. Pilots shall taxi in the most direct route to and from the runway
  consistent with safety and taxi restrictions. Pilots shall not taxi into restricted areas (to
  include the west ramp) and all taxi operations shall be overt. Pilots shall give right of way to
  all emergency vehicles.
  A10.3.8. Runways. Operations are unrestricted on Runway 04/22 and Runway 16/34.
  Runway 07 at or east of Taxiway F may be used for departures only. Runway 07 WILL
  NOT be used for landings under any circumstances. Runway 25 WILL NOT be used for
  landings and takeoffs under any circumstances. The ODO shall determine runway in use
  based on existing and forecasted wind direction. ODOs must coordinate this information
  with other participating unit ODOs to alleviate conflicts.
     A10.3.8.1. AA Helicopters may depart and land at the North Ramp, in lieu of using the
     runways.
  A10.3.9. Patterns. Pilots will adhere to recommended pattern procedures for UAO as
  described in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and other related FAA regulations.
  Observe traffic pattern and VFR procedures identified Chapter 6, Attachment 6, and
  Attachment 8.
     A10.3.9.1. In order to ensure de-confliction with ALM, which is within 6 NM of HMN,
     the south east sector of HMN Class Delta airspace shall not be used. The southeast sector
     consists of an imaginary line extending off of the departure ends of Runways 16 and 07
     to extend to 5 NM. Exception: Standard downwind to Runway 16/34 is allowed.
  A10.3.10. Altimeter Setting. Pilots shall obtain an altimeter setting from the ALM
  Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) @ 127.825 or the HMN weather observer,
  if on duty.
  A10.3.11. Airfield Lighting Training. All unit ODOs planning flight operations during
  hours of darkness will schedule training with CE Exterior Electric for lighting procedures at
  the Airfield Lighting Vault (ALV) (building 863) prior to scheduling night ops.
  A10.3.12. If aircraft are departing/arriving at night, the ODO shall turn on airfield lighting at
  the ALV no more than 30 minutes prior to taxi and no less than 30 minutes prior to landing.
  Airfield lighting shall be turned off by the ODO no earlier than 30 minutes after departure
  and prior to terminating operations. NOTE: If airfield lighting is not turned on prior to
  landing, aircraft shall divert to ALM or other airports as required until lighting is turned on.
  A10.3.13. Commencement/Termination of Operations.              The ODO shall report
  commencement/ termination of operations to 49 WG/CP. 49 WG/CP will ensure that a new
  lead ODO has been coordinated if applicable or will notify the MDG Ambulance Response
  Element, FD and SFS that UAO has been terminated.
  A10.3.14. Communication procedures.
     A10.3.14.1. Radio Communications. Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) is
     HMN Tower frequency, 119.3. (119.3 is continuously recorded as an ATC frequency)
 138                                               HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


       Note: Use of UHF for the purpose of HMN CTAF is not authorized. Pilots shall adhere
       to the recommended radio procedures for UAO as described in the AIM. Departing
       pilots shall establish contact with the ODO before taxiing to the runway for departure.
       Arriving pilots shall establish contact with the ODO at least 10 NM prior to landing. The
       ODO shall provide airfield advisories as appropriate. All communication between the
       ODO and the aircraft will be via the CTAF on a VHF radio.
       A10.3.14.2. The ODO shall use unit specific call-signs:

Table A10.1. Unit Specific Call-Signs.
               AC -      “ODO one”
               TG -      “ODO two”
               AA -      “ODO three”
               CAP - “ODO four”
The above order of ODOs designates a priority to who will be the lead ODO. Example: AA is
the first and only ODO on the scene. If AC arrived to commence ops, the lead ODO would be
transferred to AC.
A10.3.14.3. The primary method for the ODOs to communicate with vehicular traffic will be via
Land Mobile Radio (LMR) (Tower FM Net). Each participating unit will ensure the ODO has
an operable LMR (Tower Net). All vehicle operators that will be accessing the runways,
Taxiway Golf, or North Ramp will have an operable LMR (Tower FM Net) to ensure two way
communication between the ODO and the vehicle operators. ODO should communicate via cell
phone as a last resort. The ODO shall monitor all ops on VHF and LMR radios.
       A10.3.14.4. At a minimum the ODO will transmit a blanket broadcast on the LMR
       Tower FM Net at the following times. Each unit ODO is responsible for broadcasting the
       arrival and departure advisories of their unit’s aircraft.
          A10.3.14.4.1. Commencing operations (after calling 49 WG/CP)--”Attention on the
          Tower Net, Uncontrolled Airfield Operations is commencing”.
          A10.3.14.4.2. When aircraft calls to taxi for departure--“Attention on the Tower Net,
          aircraft departing Runway XX or North Ramp”.
          A10.3.14.4.3. When aircraft call inbound--“Attention on the Tower Net, aircraft XX
          minutes from Holloman, will be landing Runway XX or North Ramp”.
          A10.3.14.4.4. Terminating operations (prior to calling 49 WG/CP)--“Attention on the
          Tower Net, Uncontrolled Airfield Operations is terminated”. Note: Ensure that no
          other ODOs are operating prior to making this broadcast.
       A10.3.14.5. AM will have a limited number of LMRs, with Tower FM Net capability,
       that will be available for use, if needed, by the ODOs. LMRs will be hand receipted out
       on a first come, first served basis, when the ODO comes to AM to complete the See
       Figure A10.1. UAO setup checklist. On the next duty day, the ODO will return the LMR
       to AM. Failure to return the LMR could result in the loss of the unit’s UAO privilege.
       A10.3.14.6. The 49WG/CP will provide vehicle operators the cell phone number of the
       lead ODO if the vehicle operator cannot establish communication with the ODO via
       LMR (Tower FM Net).
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             139


A10.4. UAO - Aircraft Mishap/Emergency.
   A10.4.1. The PIC and the ODO have the authority to declare an emergency at any time. In
   the event of an aircraft mishap or declared emergency, the ODO shall immediately notify FD
   with pertinent information (i.e. type aircraft and location) to assist rescue efforts to the
   maximum extent possible. The ODO shall then notify 49 WG/CP, who then shall, at a
   minimum, again notify FD, Ambulance Response Element, and SFS for immediate
   mishap/emergency response. 49 WG/CP will also notify AOF/CC or AOF Director of
   Operations (AOF/DO) immediately, to ensure they are aware of potential impact to airfield
   operations. If neither AOF/CC nor DO can be contacted, 49 WG/CP will call 49 OSS/DO or
   49 OSS/CC. If unavailable, 49 WG/CP will call the 49 OG/CC.
   A10.4.2. ODO shall restrict vehicle access to emergency response vehicles only until the
   emergency has been terminated by the FD. After an emergency, the ODOs are responsible
   for ensuring that the runway or North Ramp is clear of all debris, damage, and fluid spills.
   Following an aircraft mishap, aircraft debris WILL NOT be moved without Emergency
   Operations Control Commander approval. ODO will notify AM Ops on the next duty day of
   any declared emergencies or any pertinent info, to include damage to airfield or fluid spills
   that occurred.
A10.5. UAO - Vehicle Operations.
   A10.5.1. In order to minimize the potential for incidents, only a select few agencies shall
   come within 100ft of any runway, Taxiway Golf, and or North Ramp when the airfield is
   closed. These agencies are FD, SFS, Ambulance Response, Crash Recovery, ODOs, Tower,
   AM Ops, Barrier and Airfield Maintenance, Exterior Electric, ATCALS Maintenance, LRS
   Fuels, Det 1 82ATRS, Lockheed (drones), and 586 FLTS. Note: The OG/CC may authorize
   additional base agencies to come within 100ft of any runway, Taxiway Golf, and or the
   North Ramp when the airfield is closed as the mission dictates.
      A10.5.1.1. If any other unit needs access to a runway, Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp
      for mission essential reasons when the airfield is closed, prior coordination and training
      must be accomplished with the AFM. The AFM will be the approval authority. Under
      no circumstances will any non-approved units drive on any portion of a runway, Taxiway
      Golf, and/or North Ramp when the airfield is closed.
      A10.5.1.2. If live load operations and UAO have a conflict, live loads will take priority.
      AOF shall monitor and approve UAO when live loads (that require runway crossings) are
      scheduled to be in effect. The ODO will be advised of non-availability of UAO when he
      comes to AM Ops to complete the setup checklist. Supplemental training is not required
      for vehicle operators who are involved in live load operations because AM will de-
      conflict and disapprove UAO during that time period if live load vehicle operators
      require runway access.
   A10.5.2. Airfield Driving Training. Current Airfield drivers from the units referenced in
   paragraph A10.5.1. will receive supplemental training regarding UAO procedures. This
   supplemental training will be tracked by the DAFM and unit Airfield driving program
   managers (ADPM) to ensure compliance. CAP ODOs that require Airfield driving will be
   trained and tracked by the OSS ADPM. Units not listed in paragraph A10.5.1. ARE NOT
   allowed access to the runway, Taxiway Golf, and or North Ramp when the airfield is closed.
 140                                                 HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014


   A10.5.3. Vehicles operating on the airfield when the airfield is closed shall exercise extreme
   caution when operating in the proximity of taxiways/runways and/or North Ramp.
   A10.5.4. Vehicle operations on the runways, Taxiway Golf, and North Ramp when the
   airfield is closed will be kept to the absolute minimum. Vehicles WILL NOT be left
   unattended on the runway at any time. In the event a vehicle requires access to a runway,
   Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp when the airfield is closed, they shall call 49 WG/CP
   prior to entering the runway (defined as the runway and the area within 100ft of any runway
   surface, Taxiway Golf, and North Ramp). If CP verifies that UAO are not being conducted,
   the vehicle may proceed to enter the runway environment.
       A10.5.4.1. If UAO are or will be in effect, the 49 WG/CP will provide a schedule of
       UAO and ODO contact information and instruct them to contact the ODO for access. If
       UAO is scheduled during the time the vehicle requires access to a runway, Taxiway Golf,
       and/or North Ramp, the vehicle operator shall contact the lead ODO for permission via
       LMR (Tower FM Net) to cross or enter any runway, Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp.
       The driver will advise the ODO of number of vehicles entering the runway, Taxiway
       Golf, and/or North Ramp and notify the ODO once crossing/access is complete. Vehicle
       operators shall visually clear the runway, Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp and
       adjoining airspace in both directions prior to proceeding across or onto a runway,
       Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp. If the 49 WG/CP or vehicle attempting to access the
       runway, Taxiway Golf, and/or North Ramp cannot contact the scheduled ODO via LMR
       (Tower FM Net) or cell phone, the vehicle shall not enter or cross the runway, Taxiway
       Golf, and/or North Ramp. NOTE: Scheduled ODOs must be accessible via LMR and
       the provided contact numbers or risk suspension from UAO at the discretion of the 49
       OG/CC.
       A10.5.4.2. The unit ODO shall transmit a blanket broadcast, via LMR (Tower FM Net),
       prior to commencing UAO, upon receiving notification of a landing or departing unit

                             COMBAT BANNER OPERATIONS

A11.1. Ground Procedures.
   A11.1.1. The banner tow pilot (or Det 1, 82 ATRS Top 3) will notify AM of expected
   banner operations and will confirm with 49 WG Scheduling 24 hours prior to the expected
   launch window. Specific procedures for installation and operation of the TDU-32A/B target
   are found in TO 1F-4E-2-01LJG-00-1.
       A11.1.1.1. The primary runway will be 25, unless TOLD factors dictate otherwise.
       Runway 22 will be the secondary runway, but any other runway may be used (15kt x-
       wind limit, no tailwind component is allowable).
       A11.1.1.2. The Banner Team lead will coordinate with Barrier Maintenance to remove
       the approach end barrier of the planned takeoff runway. This can be done any time prior
       to the QF-4 taking the runway for the banner installation, normally 20 minutes before
       takeoff. A departure end barrier must be in place for all QF-4 takeoffs.
       A11.1.1.3. Banner tow pilot will coordinate with AM to publish a NOTAM at least 24
       hours prior to launch.
   A11.1.2. The Banner Team will enter the runway for equipment setup before the tow aircraft
   arrives. They will contact Holloman ground to obtain permission prior to entering the
   runway.
       A11.1.2.1. They will maintain constant radio contact with HMN ground at all times
       while on the runway.
   A11.1.3. Tow pilot will call for taxi clearance and verify barrier status if required.
       A11.1.3.1. Tower will add runway/cable status to Automatic Terminal Information
       Center (ATIS).
       A11.1.3.2. Tower will make a blanket call on guard that Holloman AFB is single runway
       operations if applicable.
       A11.1.3.3. Tow pilot will obtain clearance for himself and the Launch Crew (white van)
       prior to entering the runway.
   A11.1.4. Once on the runway, the Banner Team will set up the banner IAW TO 1F-4E-2-
   01LJG-00-1:
       A11.1.4.1. If applicable, the banner will be positioned so as not to interfere with
       intersecting runway operations (RWY 16/22).
       A11.1.4.2. Tow aircraft will be marshaled into position by the Launch Crew and hold
       approximately 2000’ down the runway, angling into the wind about 30°. There are paint
       markings at the appropriate distance.
       A11.1.4.3. Banner Team will install the banner. Once installed, the launch crew will
       conduct final aircraft inspection and direct pilot to perform hook check. If required, they
       will direct the Tow aircraft forward to eliminate slack in cable. The observer (rear
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                              151


      cockpit) pilot can also determine if there is any slack and direct the tow pilot forward
      once the Banner Team and Launch Crew are clear of the runway.
      A11.1.4.4. When installation procedures are complete, the Banner Team and Launch
      Crew will drive to the end of the banner location and monitor the takeoff. When the
      Launch Crew calls clear the tow pilot will inform the shooters he is ready.
A11.2. Launch Procedures.
   A11.2.1. Tow pilot will request takeoff clearance from Holloman tower normally after the
   shooters takeoff. Banner Team and Launch Crew will depart the runway .
   A11.2.2. If the SOF deems necessary, the Barrier crew will re-rig the barriers as required. It
   is recommended that the barrier remain de-strung in case the tow aircraft must return to that
   runway with a “hung” banner/cable.
      A11.2.2.1. Tower clears barrier maintenance to re-rig barrier.
      A11.2.2.2. Tower coordinates with Airfield Management Operations to perform FOD
      inspection on FM Net.
      A11.2.2.3. Tower makes a blanket call on guard that Holloman AFB has resumed normal
      operations, if required.
   A11.2.3. Departure Routing.
      A11.2.3.1. All Runways (except 16). Tow Aircraft will remain visual flight rules (VFR)
      and fly normal departure routing in accordance with Holloman AFB In-Flight Guide,
      normally direct to the shoot container. If possible, he will avoid over-flight of populated
      ground sites.
      A11.2.3.2. Runway 16. Tow Aircraft will remain VFR, fly runway heading until clear of
      HWY 70 (three DME), and then on course.
A11.3. Recovery Procedures.
   A11.3.1. Tow pilot will contact Cherokee when ready for recovery and request a VFR
   straight-in to runway 04. Once handed off to Holloman tower, the tow pilot will request
   permission to proceed to the banner drop area (below). Once cleared, he may proceed to a 3-
   5 mile final to 04, off-setting to the north.
   A11.3.2. Banner Team will ensure the banner drop area is clear of personnel. If any
   personnel are observed in the area, the banner team will contact Holloman tower to direct the
   tow pilot back on range. If the area cannot be cleared before bingo fuel, the tow pilot will
   drop the banner at the alternate drop area 500’ north of runway 22 or in a safe area away
   from populated areas.
   A11.3.3. Tow Aircraft will avoid populated areas during recovery, and will remain on range
   until able to proceed directly to the Banner Drop Area northwest of RWY 04/22. The tow
   aircraft will remain clear of the confines of Holloman Air Force base proper until the banner
   is released. Normally, plan to release the banner heading NW (approx 040°).

A12.1. Purpose. This attachment complements AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures
and Programs. It also outlines specific procedures for pilots who fly 49 WG F-22 aircraft. In
addition to this document, pilots must be familiar with the procedures in the HMN Basic In-
Flight Guide (49 WG IFG), and the HMN Raptor IFG Supplement (F-22 Annex).
A12.2. General        Policy. This      supplement       complements    higher     headquarters
regulations/directives. It is not intended as a single-source document. When deployed, comply
with local procedures for the TDY location or these procedures, whichever are more restrictive.
A12.3. F-22 Ground Operations.
   A12.3.1. F-22 Off-Station Sorties.
       A12.3.1.1. Reference guidance contained in the 49 WG IFG F-22 Annex and AFI 11-
       209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures (static displays).
       A12.3.1.2. Pilots will request and coordinate cross-country flights using HAFB Form 40,
       Request for Off-Station Flights. Pilots will e-mail the completed form to the SQ/CC or
       SQ/DO. Once the SQ/CC or SQ/DO obtains 49 OG/CC approval, the request will be
       forwarded to 49 OSS Current Operations Flight (49 OSS/OSO) with courtesy copies to
       49 WG/CP, 49 OG/CC, and 49th Maintenance Group (49 MXG). Prior to departure,
       flight leads will ensure 49 WG/CP has received a copy of their itinerary and will notify
       49 WG/CP of any changes at the earliest opportunity.
       A12.3.1.3. Fuel: Obtain a gold AirCard (commercial airports) and white card (military
       airfields) from maintenance prior to departing HMN. Obtain a fuel receipt from each
       location and save for documentation upon return to HMN.
   A12.3.2. F-22 Flight Plans.
       A12.3.2.1. Refer to the HAFBI 11-250 Chapter 4 and the 49 WG IFG for stereo flight
       plans, departures, and ATC procedures. File flight plans through squadron operations to
       AM.
       A12.3.2.2. Units utilizing an AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization (FA),
       will create “unit approved remarks code as required” (11-401) to tie the “Remarks Code”
       block                                        to                                     the
       49 WG IFG Stereos. The PIC’s applicable Remarks Code and signature on the 4327
       constitutes his act of filing.
       A12.3.2.3. The squadron duty desk members (1COs or Ops Supervision) will convey,
       verbatim, applicable blocks from the 4327(a) to AM. Both the 4327 and 4327a have an
       RDS of one year and are therefore available IAW the flight plan RDS and inspection
       schedule specified in the HABI 11-250 and other AFI guidance.
       A12.3.2.4. Pilots will coordinate any real-time flight plan changes through squadron
       operations. Squadron ops will then pass the changes to AM. Once the flight plan change
       is in the system, Ground Control will notify pilots to contact Clearance Delivery.
   A12.3.3. F-22 Mission Planning.

  A12.3.5. F-22 Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS).
      A12.3.5.1. Upon declaration of FITS CAUTION, F-22 Ops Sup will institute the
      following procedures:
         A12.3.5.1.1. Ensure pilots carry water on each mission.
         A12.3.5.1.2. Limit preflight/cockpit/ramp time (non-air-conditioned) to 90 minutes.
         If pilots exceed 90 minutes, they will return to an air-conditioned facility for a
         minimum of 30 minutes, and only return to the aircraft with F-22 Ops Sup approval.
         A running F-22 with the canopy down is considered an air-conditioned facility.
         A12.3.5.1.3. Chemical Defense Training gear WILL NOT be worn.
         A12.3.5.1.4. FITS CAUTION becomes FITS DANGER if wearing anti-exposure
         suits.
      A12.3.5.2. Upon declaration of FITS DANGER, F-22 Ops Sup will limit
      preflight/cockpit/ramp time (non-air-conditioned) to 45 minutes. If the pilot exceeds 45
      minutes, he will return to an air-conditioned facility for a minimum of 30 minutes, and
      only return to the aircraft with F-22 Ops Sup approval.
      A12.3.5.3. Pilots are not necessarily restricted from stepping to spare aircraft nor limited
      to flying fewer sorties when FITS zones have been declared. F-22 Ops Sup will evaluate
      and make these decisions on a case-by-case basis.
      A12.3.5.4. If the FITS exceeds 115º Fahrenheit, all non-essential flights will be canceled.
  A12.3.6. F-22 Taxi Procedures.
      A12.3.6.1. Acknowledge receipt of ATIS and clearance when calling for taxi. For
      example; “Holloman Ground, Raptor 71, taxi two from the West Ramp with Bravo and
      clearance”.
      A12.3.6.2. Maximum taxi speed is 30 knots. The maximum speed in the West Ramp, in
      congested areas, or when turning, is 10 knots. Use caution when taxiing on the West
      Ramp due to taxiway slope.
      A12.3.6.3. Hangar procedures. Both hangar doors must be open prior to engine start.
      DO NOT start the auxiliary power unit (APU) in hangars without the APU exhaust
      system in place. Visually check and verbally confirm with the crew chief the APU
      exhaust system is fully retracted prior to taxi. If the APU is required during taxi into or
      out of the hangar, the pilot will ensure that the minimum practical time is spent with the
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                               159


     APU running and the APU exhaust system not in the lowered position. In no case shall
     this time exceed 5 minutes.
        A12.3.6.3.1. All pilots will visually check and verbally confirm with the crew chief
        that the ladder is removed from the cockpit sill prior to starting the APU and/or
        operating the canopy.
        A12.3.6.3.2. All pilots will visually check and verbally confirm with the crew chief
        that the APU duct is raised prior to taxiing from the shelter.
     A12.3.6.4. Live Load Procedures. The only munitions that may be loaded in the West
     Ramp are chaff/flare, internal gun ammunition 30MM or less (1.2.2 HEI or 1.4 TP), inert
     bombs and live or captive carry missiles. The main ramp is only authorized chaff/flare,
     (1.2.2 HEI or 1.4 TP) internal gun ammunition 30MM or less, inert bombs and inert
     missiles. North ramp can be used for chaff/flare, (1.2.2 HEI or 1.4 TP) internal gun
     ammunition 30MM or less, inert bombs, captive carry training missiles and 1.2.2
     Telemetry equipped missiles. Live bombs can only be loaded on GAF live load pad, EOR
     Echo, Echo LOLA, runway 25 and Bldg 1090 the old alert facility. All aircraft will be
     loaded IAW 91-201 approved HMN explosive site plans.
     A12.3.6.5. When loading live bombs or missiles on EOR Echo, aircraft must be parked
     on 12 inch by 12 inch square live load markings. The standard lead in lines on EOR
     Echo DO NOT provide minimum explosive safety distance separation between aircraft.
  A12.3.7. F-22 Quick Check/Arming.
     A12.3.7.1. All aircraft will stop in the arming area for quick check/arming.
     A12.3.7.2. The lead F-22 enters the arming slot as depicted in the 49 WG IFG. In
     general, it will be the slot farthest from the runway. Subsequent aircraft will take the next
     available slot. Pull forward to place the nose wheel on the proper mark, which will allow
     subsequent aircraft to taxi behind and in front of arming aircraft.
     A12.3.7.3. Keep hands in view of the ground crew anytime arming crews are under the
     aircraft. Visual signals will be used if intercom is not connected.
  A12.3.8. F-22 After Landing/De-arming.
     A12.3.8.1. All aircraft will de-arm when carrying live Air-to-Air weapons, hot gun,
     and/or any unexpended live/inert GBU-32(s). In any case, this will be non-standard and
     prior coordination will be needed with maintenance for arm/de-arm locations. For local
     training sorties, de-arm WILL NOT be utilized (see paragraph A12.3.8.4.).
     A12.3.8.2. Contact Ground Control and request taxi to park (or de-arm, as required).
     De-arm/Arming flow will be as depicted in the 49 WG IFG. In general, the first F-22 to
     clear will utilize the de-arming/arming slot farthest from the runway. Do not block the
     runway or taxiway while waiting for a de-arming/arming slot.
     A12.3.8.3. During normal recovery and landing on Runway 16, F-22 Ops Sup will
     coordinate with applicable agencies in order to ensure Taxiway Hotel is swept and
     vehicle traffic is blocked from proceeding onto Taxiway Hotel to allow F-22 to taxi west
     on Taxiway Hotel to the hangars. Confirm with Tower or Ground Control that Taxiway
     Hotel procedures are in affect prior to taxiing on Taxiway Hotel.

       A12.3.8.4. During normal training missions when de-arm is not required but flares have
       been expended, aircraft will open Expendable Countermeasures (EXCM) doors prior to
       taxi into the hangars.
A12.4. F-22 Flying Operations.
   A12.4.1. Command and Control and Aircraft Call Signs.
       A12.4.1.1. Flight leads will inform F-22 Ops Sup of line-up or aircraft changes. F-22
       Ops Sup will pass updates to the SOF.
       A12.4.1.2. If a flight member aborts and will not attempt a later takeoff, the flight lead
       may renumber the flight. The flight lead will advise F-22 Ops Sup of the new lineup. F-
       22 Ops Sup will inform the SOF.
       A12.4.1.3. All flights will use approved squadron call signs assigned by 49 OSS/OSOS.
   A12.4.2. F-22 Pilot Daily Sortie Limits.
       A12.4.2.1. Pilots will fly a maximum of 3 sorties per day (2 if any part of one is at
       night).
       A12.4.2.2. During Operational Readiness Exercises/Inspections, with SQ/CC or SQ/DO
       approval, pilots may fly 4 sorties per duty day if all are in the daytime; 3 sorties if any are
       flown at night.
   A12.4.3. F-22 Alternate Missions.
       A12.4.3.1. The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary mission and
       parallel with its intent. If not similar, brief the specific mission elements that are
       different. Mission elements/events may be modified and briefed “airborne” as long as
       flight safety is not compromised; however, avoid exercising this option to the max extent
       practical.
       A12.4.3.2. Squadron will approve each single-ship mission.
   A12.4.4. F-22 Weather Minimums. 49 OG/CC (or designated representative) approval is
   required to conduct flying operations if HMN is forecast to be less than 300ft AGL/1 SM.
   A12.4.5. F-22 Rolling Takeoffs. Rolling takeoffs are permitted with a dry runway only.
   Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff interval between aircraft when using afterburners.
   A12.4.6. F-22 Air Refueling Operations. IAW T.O. 1F-22A-1, Flight Manual, Sect. 8 &
   Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-56(B), Air-to-Air Refueling; additionally:
       A12.4.6.1. Single-ships may proceed to the tanker with F-22 Ops Sup approval.
       A12.4.6.2. Open the slipway door before engine shutdown for post-flight inspection on a
       sortie where refueling was accomplished.
   A12.4.7. F-22 Night Flying.
       A12.4.7.1. The VFR pattern will be closed to aircraft starting 30 minutes after official
       sunset. All aircraft will land from an instrument approach (precision preferred). The
       SOF is the final authority and will close the pattern when conditions require.
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                             161


      A12.4.7.2. Duty Limitations. Crew duty 10 hour restriction begins at night (defined as
      the end of civil twilight as published in the American Air Almanac). Crew rest
      requirements and waiver authority can be found in AFI 11-202V3.
      A12.4.7.3. The minimum external lighting required for night flying is one light on top or
      bottom of each wingtip (X-configuration) and the landing light.
   A12.4.8. F-22 NzW Mitigation Procedures.
      A12.4.8.1. All HMN F-22’s are restricted to 7G’s or less at fuel weights greater than
      15000 pounds. Once reaching 15000 pounds of internal fuel, the aircraft may be
      maneuvered to basic aircraft limits. Caution should be maintained on flights following
      air-to-air refueling (AAR) as the same considerations apply.
A12.5. F-22 Weapons Employment.
   A12.5.1. 20 MM Cannon Procedures.
      A12.5.1.1. The 20mm cannon will be cold unless scheduled for a hot gun mission.
      Ensure the gun is safe IAW T.O. 1F-22A-34-1-1, Avionics and Nonnuclear Weapons
      Delivery Flight Manual.
      A12.5.1.2. During a cold gun mission, if the HUD displays a rounds count greater than
      zero (Embedded Training de-selected) or the gun rotates, treat the gun as hot IAW AFI
      11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
      A12.5.1.3. General Hot Gun Procedures.
         A12.5.1.3.1. Takeoff/En Route: Leave the Master Arm in SAFE until a range sweep
         has been accomplished and cleared by the RCO.
         A12.5.1.3.2. Area Setup.
             A12.5.1.3.2.1. All live firing will take place in the designated live fire area. DO
             NOT fire after the expiration of the published range time. The shooting area is
             subject to change or cancellation due to activity having higher priority.
             A12.5.1.3.2.2. The range must be visually cleared along the firing track.
                 A12.5.1.3.2.2.1. Minimum weather for clearing under an overcast is 1500ft
                 AGL/5 SM. In marginal weather, consider a single-ship range sweep while
                 the flight holds at the shooter point. Be aware of terrain elevation in the
                 vicinity of the range and the Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA) for HMN, which
                 is 14200 MSL.
                 A12.5.1.3.2.2.2. If weather precludes clearing the range, the flight lead will
                 cancel firing and contact the SOF. The SOF will notify all squadrons.
                 A12.5.1.3.2.2.3. Live firing may proceed along the cleared firing track as
                 long as the same flight or RCO remains in the area. If not, the range must be
                 cleared again.
             A12.5.1.3.2.3. The RCO will activate the range with a call on UHF/VHF Guard.
             A12.5.1.3.2.4. Hot Gun Alternate Missions will be formation, AHC, or
             instruments. Verify master arm SAFE by lack of a gun cross in the HUD and DO

  a straight-in approach.
  A12.6.2. In-flight Emergencies - General.
     A12.6.2.1. During F-22 emergencies, the SOF is the primary point of contact for
     coordinating airfield closures and for gathering information critical to airfield and aircrew
     safety. If the SOF is not F-22 qualified, contact squadron operations for assistance with
     checklists and emergency procedure (EP) troubleshooting.
     A12.6.2.2. All aircraft emergencies resulting in approach or departure end arrestments
     will plan on shutting down both engines while in the cable. “Slingshot” procedures
     WILL NOT be used at HMN due to the possibility of aircraft damage.
  A12.6.3. F-22 Divert.
     A12.6.3.1. The primary divert field is KBIF (day) and KELP (night). The secondary
     divert field is KROW. If a cable arrestment is required, the primary divert is KDMA.
     A12.6.3.2. Normally divert in elements of two or more aircraft. Single-ship diverts are
     allowable to military fields. Refer to the 49 WG IFG F-22 Annex for divert base
     information and security requirements.
     A12.6.3.3. When possible, contact the SOF or 49 WG/CP if diverting.

      caused the incident (i.e., excessive control inputs, fuel imbalance, flight control
      malfunctions, mechanical failure, etc.).
      A12.6.5.2. All out of control incidents will be debriefed to the F-22 Ops Sup and
      documented in both maintenance debriefing and the unusual occurrence log. All such
      incidents require a safety report. F-22 Ops Sup will notify 49 OG/CC and 49 WG/CP for
      operations report (OPREP) requirements.

      proceed to the hot brake or hot gun area.
      A12.6.7.2. If the hung flare is discovered post-flight, declare a ground emergency and
      proceed to the hot brake or hot gun area.
      A12.6.7.3. It is imperative that EOR crews DO NOT approach the aircraft with hung
      flares until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crews have removed the flare/module,
      and the fire chief has indicated that it is safe to continue de-arming.
      A12.6.7.4. After the aircraft is chocked, ensure the doors are in the desired configuration.
      Shutdown the engines on the crew chief's signal. Exit and remain well clear of the
      aircraft.
      A12.6.7.5. Report to the on-scene fire chief whether or not an attempt was made to
      expend flares on the sortie and what time the EXCM was disarmed.
  A12.6.8. F-22 Hot Brake. Pilots suspecting hot brakes will notify the Tower/Ground
  Control and request clearance to taxi to the nearest hot brake area. Aircraft already past the
  hot brake areas or in parking will proceed as directed by Ground Control to a clear area.
  Park facing into the wind and DO NOT shut down the engines until fire-fighting equipment
  is available and you are signaled to shut down. If the hot brake condition is cleared, taxi to
  parking.
  A12.6.9. F-22 Hot Fuel. Ground Ops: Aircrew that use the phraseology “APPROACHING
  HOT FUEL” and request to taxi back to park or to EOR for takeoff will be given priority
  over other aircraft taxiing.
  A12.6.10. F-22 Search and Rescue (SAR).
      A12.6.10.1. ABQ ARTCC or WSRF are the coordinating agencies for overland
      ejections.
      A12.6.10.2. The first pilot to see the incident will initially be the on-scene commander.
      No aircraft will fly lower than any parachute. Aircraft not needed for the SAR Combat
      Air Patrol (SARCAP) will depart the area. The SARCAP commander will notify both
HOLLOMANAFBI11-250 27 JUNE 2014                                                           167


     the controlling agency and the SOF if possible. No aircraft will remain past Bingo Fuel.
     The SARCAP commander will coordinate for replacement aircraft if fuel becomes a
     factor prior to the rescue. After initial contact is made with the downed pilot, direct a
     frequency change to the backup SAR frequency. Mark the downed pilot's location by
     any means possible.
