                                SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

1.1. How To Use This Manual:
   1.1.1. Don't reprint or stock annual codes beyond the year in which they are current.
   However, if you belong to a comptroller activity, you may refer to previous codes as long as
   you need to. For pre-FY99 appropriation act symbols and codes, see previous editions of
   AFMAN 65-604, AFI 65-601V4, and AFR 172-1V IV.
   1.1.2. Time Limits for Appropriations:
      1.1.2.1. A single-year appropriation (575XXXX and 975XXXX) begins 1 Oct 2014,
      expires on 30 Sep 2015, and cancels 30 Sep 2020.
      1.1.2.2. A two-year appropriation (575/6XXXX and 975/6XXXX), such as RDT&E,
      begins 1 Oct 2014, expires on 30 Sep 2016, and cancels on 30 Sep 2021.
      1.1.2.3. A three-year appropriation (575/7XXXX and 975/7XXXX), such as those for
      procurement, begins 1 Oct 2014, expires on 30 Sep 2017, and cancels on 30 Sep 2022.
      1.1.2.4. Five-year appropriations (575/9XXXX and 975/9XXXX) begin on 1 Oct 2014,
      expire on 30 Sep 2019, and cancel 30 Sep 2024.
      1.1.2.5. A no-year appropriation is designated by an “X” after the Agency two digit
      prefix, i.e., 57X or 97X, which means there are no time limits on the availability of funds
      in the appropriation. Funds do not expire, which means they are available until
      completely expended. However, OMB or the Agency Head may cancel no -year
      authority provided that the purpose for which the authority was provided has been carried
      out and there have been no disbursements against the authority for at least two fiscal
      years.
1.2. How To Read Chapters 2 and 14:
   1.2.1. In Chapter 2, Air Force DoD appropriations appear grouped by appropriation type and
   in numerical order. Supplemental appropriations that have a unique appropriation symbol
   follow the primary appropriation.
   1.2.2. Each appropriation classification in paragraph 2.1 consists of an agency code, a fiscal
   year designation, and an appropriation symbol.
      1.2.2.1. The first two digits identify the agency code. The Air Force agency code is 57.
      The DoD agency code is 97. The Navy (including Marine Corps) agency code is 17. The
      Army agency code is 21.
      1.2.2.2. For one-year accounts, the third digit identifies the fiscal year; for
      example, 5753400 designates the FY 2015 Operation and Maintenance, Air Force,
      appropriation. For multiyear accounts, the third and fourth digits identify the multiple
      fiscal years of the appropriation; for example, 575/73010 designates the FY 2015/2017
      Aircraft Procurement, Air Force appropriation. No year funding may or may not have a
      fiscal year after the agency code. For example, BRAC has no fiscal years after the agency
AFMAN65-604 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  17


     codes. BRAC’s fiscal years are determined by the limit. The limit is the 4 digit alpha -
     numeric after the treasury symbol.
     1.2.2.3. The remaining digits (usually four) indicate the appropriation or account.
  1.2.3. Each appropriation also has a two-digit fund code, which is identified both in the
  appropriation summary at paragraph 2.1 and in the detailed listing of codes that follows in
  Chapter 2.
  1.2.4. The individual appropriation listing in table 2.1 includes a brief description of the
  appropriation or account content. Where applicable, each section also contains the individual
  program, project and sub-project codes for budget execution.
  1.2.5. Chapter 14 identifies the Air Force's centrally managed OBAs and allotments. Look
  under the funding appropriation in Chapter 2 for the account and subaccount codes used to
  execute these centrally managed accounts.
  1.2.6. Submit recommendations for changes to this manual through command channels to
  SAF/FMBM, 1130 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1130.

  provides for procuring investment type initial spares and repair parts required to support:
  new aircraft being procured; additional end items to the inventory; the modification (BP
  1100) and modernization program; updating changes; common ground support equipment
  (BP 1200); simulators and training devices; provisioning documentation; initial spares and
  repair parts for other production (BP1900) buys; whole spare engines and engine modules;
  and Readiness Spares Package (RSP) requirements tied to new acquisition (i.e., new systems,
  modifications, support equipment and miscellaneous production) or mission changes.
     4.1.15.1. Budget as initial spares investment items whose pipelines must be increased
     because of increased quantity of aircraft being procured. Initial spares managed by the
     Supply Business Activity require special budgeting considerations. Funds are required to
     reimburse the Supply Business Activity purchase of initial spares upon receipt or
     scheduled receipt of the ordered items for WCF items. For obligations by the Supply
     Business Activity, the standard reimbursement pattern is year 1, 2.9%; year 2, 17.0%;
     year 3, 32.6%; year 4, 23.8%; year 5, 23.7%. A program unique profile may be used
     after approval by SAF/AQXRF and SAF/FMBIZ. For non -WCF items, initial spares
     funds must be obligated at the time the aircraft is placed on order (full funding policy).

  4.1.17. 170000 WAR CONSUMABLES. This program provides for procuring war
  consumable equipment, which will provide additional wartime support needed, if there are
  hostilities, to sustain operations until expanded production provides the required level of
  support. Included in this program are auxiliary fuel tanks, missile launchers, pylons, ejector
  racks, decoys, and adapters consumed during wartime and peacetime operations.
     4.1.17.1. The initial complement of this equipment (normally installed equipment) for a
     new weapon system will be procured with BP1000 funds as an integral part of the
     weapon system buy. This makes the weapon system complete and usable when accepted
     by the Air Force. If, after production is complete, you discover a shortfall in this
     equipment, you should attempt to satisfy any existing initial equipage shortfall through
     the System Program Office (SPO). If, for some justifiable reason, the SPO is unable to
     satisfy this shortfall after production completion, consider the BP1700 line as the source
     of last resort. Do not consider the BP1700 line as the funding safety net for requirements
     erroneously perceived by some as less than critical to the initial buy of a weapon system.

STANDARD RULES:

The following standard rules apply to the two-digit subproject field for payments:

Based on an obligation policy change for FY09, the first position of the
subproject field is always “0” (numeric) since it is required to be paid out of
current year funds. This obligation policy change is effective with FY09, and will
be applied in all fiscal years subsequent to FY09. In prior fiscal years the first
position of the subproject field may have been “9” to identify when transfer
effective dates (TED) differed from the fiscal year of obligation. This permitted
citing and temporarily charging the current year appropriation for costs authorized
by the PCS order. DFAS-DE used a Standard Form 1080, Voucher for Transfers
Between Appropriations and/or Funds, to convert transactions with a “9” in the
first position of the subproject field to the correct year when the new appropriation
became available on 1 October of each year.

Additional instructions for using this subproject field are in the DFAS publication,
Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations. Due to the
change in obligation policy in FY09, the fiscal year in which the orders are cut
will be the fiscal year in which the obligation is accounted for and the first
position of the subproject field will always be “0” (numeric). The second position
of the subproject field will always be an alpha code as follows:
A--Pet Quarantine fees. Mandatory pet quarantine of a household pet, are
reimbursable not to exceed $550 per PCS move for pets in, or entering into,

7.127. Project 727**SPECIAL TRAINING. Special Tours are used to supplement AT and
IDT when the member needs additional training to achieve or maintain a required skill or skill
level in their assigned AFSC. Special Tours may be used to maintain or increase the member’s
mobilization readiness in support of Reserve needs. Special Tours must provide a primary
training content to the member during tours involving organized and planned specialized skill
training, combat crew training, unit conversion training, refresher and proficiency training,
officer acquisition training, professional development education programs, etc. Special Tours
may also be used to provide direct staff support to Reserve component programs in which
training for the member itself is not the primary objective, but a significant outcome. Projects
include annual screening, unit conversion to new weapon systems, supporting study groups,
training site visitations and exercises, short -term mission projects, administrative support
functions, conferences, staff visits, counter drug tours, Innovative Readiness Training (IRT).

8.3. 62****APPLIED RESEARCH. Applied research is systematic study to understand the
means to meet a recognized and specific national security requirement. It is a systematic
application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems or methods. It may
include design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet
general mission area requirements. Applied research translates promising basic research into
solutions for broadly defined military needs, short of system development. This type of effort
may vary from systematic mission - directed research beyond that in Budget Activity 1 to
sophisticated breadboard hardware, study, programming, and planning efforts that establish
the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges. It
includes studies, investigations, and non - system specific technology efforts. The dominant
characteristic is that applied research is directed toward general military needs with a
view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed
 130                                                          AFMAN65-604 1 OCTOBER 2014


solutions and determining their parameters. Applied research precedes system specific
research. Program control of the Applied Research program element is normally exercised by
general level of effort.

8.4. 63****ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (ATD). This budget activity
includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and
components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated
environment. ATD includes concept and technology demonstrations of components and
subsystems or system models. The models may be form, fit, and function prototypes or scaled
models that serve the same demonstration purpose. The results of this type of effort are proof of
technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and
producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use. Projects in this category
have a direct relevance to identified military needs. Advanced Technology Development
demonstrates the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied
to different types of military equipment or techniques. Program elements in this category
involve pre-Milestone B efforts, such as system concept demonstration, joint and Service
- specific experiments or Technology Demonstrations. Projects in this category do not
necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases. Analysis of Alternatives
(AoA) studies (to include system specific AoA studies), are funded from this budget activity
until the studies pass Milestone A.
   8.4.1. Projects in this category do not necessarily have to lead to subsequent development or

13.1. Air Force Working Capital Funds (AFWCF): Officially established in FY92, the
AFWCF (previously titled the Defense Business Operations Fund) is an expansion of the
revolving fund concept to a larger number of Defense Support functions. AFWCF captures all
costs of an operating business area and reflects the total cost of doing business in stabilized
prices charged to customers. The primary goal is to provide a management structure that allows
DoD managers to provide the best support at the lowest cost while enabling customers to
reassess their operational requirements in light of total costs.
   13.1.1. CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINMENT ACTIVITY GROUP (CSAG). The Air
   Force CSAG was established effective October 1, 2008, under the authority of Title 10,

   consumable items, and maintenance activities. CSAG combines the activities of the
   operations formerly known as Material Support Division (MSD) of the Supply Management
   Activity Group, and the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG). Under CSAG,
   business operations formerly known as DMAG and MSD are now referred to as Maintenance
   Division (MD) and Supply Division (SD), respectively.
