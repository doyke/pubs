SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been changed and requires full review. Minor changes have been made to
reflect the stand-up of 480 FS. Major changes were made to Table A2.1, Net Explosives Weight
Chart. These changes were driven by the reclassification of the munitions storage igloos.

1. General.
     1.1. Contractors and Construction Activities. Potential explosive sites (PES) present a
     hazard to contractors working on SAB. 52d Fighter Wing (52 FW) Weapons Safety Office
     (SEW) must be notified of planned contractor and construction activities inside explosive
     Clear Zones (CZ) as depicted on the D-8 tab of the Base General Plan Mapping system. If
     the required Intraline distance from explosives cannot be obtained, 52 FW/SEW will perform
     a thorough operational risk analysis that advises the contractor on explosives safety standards
     and the risks associated with working in proximity to any PES. The base contracting office
     is the primary point of contact to disseminate results of the risk analysis to workers.
     1.2. Construction Planning. Before construction can start for any project sited within the
     CZ, 52 FW/SEW must accomplish and receive approval for an Explosive Site Plan (ESP);
     the approval level is the DoD Explosive Safety Board. The ESP approval process can take
     from 6 to 18 months to complete. The M-3 tab of the Base General Plan mapping system
     depicts locations for future construction plans and assists 52 FW/SEW with prioritizing site
     plan requests. The 52d Civil Engineer Squadron (52 CES) Base Development Office (52
     CES/CECP) is the custodian of the M-3 tab.
     1.3. Flight Line Fire Symbols. Fire symbols will be posted at all entrances emergency
     response forces could use to enter the flight line. 52d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (52
     AMXS), 726th Air Mobility Squadron (726 AMS), 52d Logistics Readiness Squadron (52
     LRS) and 52d Equipment Maintenance Squadron (52 EMS) have the responsibility to ensure
     accurate and timely posting of flight line fire symbols.
        1.3.1. Flight line areas are defined as 480th Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) as one
        area, 81 AMU as one area, and 726 AMS (Ramp 5 and 6) as one area. Ramps 1, 2, 3, and
        4 are only sited for Hazard Class/Division (HC/D) 1.3 and 1.4 and therefore will not
        require symbols.
        1.3.2. Routine Training Activities. Only when HC/D 1.2 ammunition and explosives or
        higher are present will fire symbols be posted on the flight line.
     1.4. HAS Doors. All HAS’ are currently sited with the main doors closed (see Attachment
     2). When explosives are present, doors (front and rear) will remain closed except for short
SPANGDAHLEMABI91-201 15 NOVEMBER 2011                                                        3


  periods for towing, fueling, servicing, run-up, taxi, or when maintenance equipment or
  munitions are being moved into or out of shelters. During flying operations, do not open the
  doors until the air crew shows. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
  Maintenance Management, paragraph 18.9.6.4. states that aircraft shelter doors are to be
  open to ventilate hazardous exhaust vapors and fumes. To define this procedure further, for
  munitions loading / unloading the following procedures will be followed: Generation 1 HAS:
  the left door (as looking at the HAS from the hardstand) will be opened for ventilation only
  while Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) is running. Generation 3 HAS: the left door (as
  looking at the HAS from the hardstand) will be opened to the 10’ line for ventilation only
  while AGE is running. In addition to the HAS front doors being opened, the rear blast doors
  can also be opened to facilitate ventilation. Once AGE operations are complete, all HAS
  doors will be closed. During exercises, training munitions will be treated as live and will
  follow the same procedures in this paragraph.
  1.5. Munitions trailers containing 1.1 and 1.2 assets (except 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 items that are
  Quantity Distance exempted IAW AFMAN 91-201) will be disconnected from the munitions
  tow vehicle, and placed inside of the HAS with doors closed before commencing loading
  operations.
  1.6. Servicing aircraft in HAS with explosives. Munitions Line Delivery personnel may stop
  explosives laden munitions handling trailers on the hardstand directly in front of HAS to
  service aircraft parked inside of HAS. At no time will the trailer be disconnected from the
  tow vehicle unless trailer is being pushed into HAS. Quantity Distance criteria does not
  apply to munitions and explosives in the transportation mode. The time munitions and
  explosives in the transportation mode must be limited to the absolute minimum necessary to
  complete the task.
     1.6.1. Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) to Standard Military Ammunition
     and Explosives. The current annual EMR survey defines the minimum distances between
     small transmitting radios and electro-explosive devices (EED). Since most munitions
     used at SAB are EEDs (exceptions include general purpose bombs with mechanical fuses
     such as M904), apply the following criteria to all munitions. The following three
     situations apply:
         1.6.1.1. Worst Case Scenarios. An electric blasting cap removed from the container
         with the lead wires separated (untwisted or no shunt installed) to form an antenna is
         an example of a worst case scenario. In this case, personnel will not transmit from
         any hand-held radios within 17 feet of the EED or from any vehicle-mounted radios
         within 22 feet of the EED.
         1.6.1.2. Munitions Ground Handling. All-Up-Round missiles and/or other Precision
         Guided Munitions (PGM) with safety gear and electrical shorting devices properly
         installed are considered leadless EEDs. This condition applies during munitions
         transport and ground handling. Personnel will not transmit from vehicle-mounted or
         hand-held radios within 10 feet of any leadless EED. Munitions Line Delivery
         drivers towing live munitions meet the distance requirement and are allowed to use
         hand-held or vehicle mounted radios in the tow vehicle.

           1.6.1.3. Munitions Mated to Aircraft. Once all-up-round missiles and/or other PGM
           are properly mated to an aircraft launcher or rack, personnel will not transmit from
           vehicle-mounted or hand-held radios within 10 feet.
       1.6.2. Cellular Telephones. Use of personal cellular phones is prohibited at any location
       or in any room sited or licensed for explosives, when explosives are present. Cellular
       telephones represent an unknown hazard to explosives and, therefore, personnel and
       equipment. Personnel may carry government issued cellular phones for official purposes
       in the NNMSA or in the HAS areas. Land Mobile Radio manager will provide 52
       FW/SEW with manufacturer technical specifications of government issued cellular
       phones to ensure those devices are added to the EMR survey. Personnel will not transmit
       government issued cellular phones within 10 feet of munitions.
    1.7. D-8 Tab Distribution and Management. 52 FW/SEW will review, update, and distribute
    the D-8 Tab map to all affected agencies. 52 FW/SEW will provide the D-8 map to the
    following agencies in the number of copies listed:
       1.7.1. 52d Maintenance Group Commander (52 MXG/CC) - one copy.
       1.7.2. 52d Operations Group CC - one copy.
       1.7.3. 52 MXG/Weapons Standardization - one copy.
       1.7.4. 52d Operations Support Squadron Airfield Operations (52 OSS/OSA) - one copy.
       1.7.5. 52 EMS Munitions Flight (52EMS/MXMW) - five copies printed with grid to
       support Disaster Preparedness functions.
       1.7.6. 52d Maintenance Operation Squadron, Maintenance Operations Center (52

       Disaster Preparedness functions.
       1.7.12. 726 AMS – one copy
       1.7.13. 52 LRS – one copy
    1.8. Operational Risk Management during Expanded-State Operations. During short-term
    periods (not exceeding 12 months), when explosives required in properly sited ammunition
    and explosives storage facilities and/or HAS’ will exceed steady-state limits, Unit Weapons
    Safety Representatives (UWSR) will contact 52 FW/SEW with request. 52 FW/SEW will
    design compensatory actions needed to safely manage the explosives environment and
    conduct risk assessment in accordance with published directives.
    1.9. Licensed Explosives Facilities. Refer to Attachment 2. Units that require storage of
    explosives outside of the NNMSA shall limit requests to the minimum quantities only. Units
SPANGDAHLEMABI91-201 15 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            5


  will submit excerpts from the governing directives that require those quantities with each
  request.
     1.9.1. Units that require vehicle parking closer than 100 feet from the licensed facility
     will submit a parking distance reduction request using the official memorandum format.
     The base Fire Chief and 52 FW/SEW must approve the request using endorsement
     signature elements before personnel may park vehicles at a distance less than 100 feet
     from the facility.
     1.9.2. Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS) ONLY. Weapons Safety personnel who
     have attended the Weapons Safety Manager Course and have been awarded the 375
     Special Experience Identifier are authorized to validate, inspect, and renew explosive
     licenses IAW AFMAN 91-201. All other MUNSS Weapons Safety personnel not
     meeting this criteria must coordinate with 52FW/SEW for explosive licensing
     requirements.
  1.10. Applying Compensatory Actions. Refer to Attachment 3. Compensatory actions
  compensate for violations to explosives site planning criteria. They are directly associated
  with the presence of live ammunition and explosives in certain facilities regardless of
  whether munitions are present to support training, exercises, or contingencies. In all cases,
  personnel must initiate the appropriate compensatory actions as listed in Attachment 3. The
  objective of compensatory actions is to safely manage the environment whenever explosives
  are present, for any reason.
     1.10.1. Mission Impact from Compensatory Actions.                  Restrictions caused by
     compensatory actions vary by facility and amount of explosives. Flight line users must
     understand that while a facility may be sited for a certain NEW, maximizing the NEW
     may restrict the mission in other areas. There are three increasing levels of impact due to
     compensatory actions. Least restrictive are those that restrict the 52 AMXS area of
     operations, including the hardstands used by wing fighter aircraft. Next restrictive are
     those that affect airfield operations and restrict parking by transient and/or heavy aircraft.
     Most restrictive are those that restrict base activities and facilities separate from flight
     operations. In general, explosives operations should be planned to confine restrictions to
     the 52 AMXS areas first, then to other airfield operations and finally, to other base
     activities.
     1.10.2. Non-routine Training Activities. Non-routine activities are those activities that
     involve ammunition and explosives that present more risk than routine activities. Non-
     routine activities involve limited quantities of HC/D 1.1 explosives for load crew and
     pilot proficiency training. Examples of munitions employed during these activities are
     live air-to-air missiles, 500-pound bombs, 2.75-inch rockets with high explosives
     warheads, and air-to-ground missiles. When planning non-routine training activities,
     proper and careful HAS selection is essential to minimize the impact on other base
     functions.
     1.10.3. Contingencies and Exercises. Exercises are contingency training scenarios
     conducted in a controlled environment and require safe management practices that are
     identical to those employed during actual real-world contingencies. For that reason,
     when live explosives are involved, this instruction makes no distinction between
     contingencies and exercises.

        2.3.2. Conduct a restrictive easement inspection each calendar quarter (i.e. January
        through March, April through June, July through September and October through
        December).        The German Military District Administration Gerolstein
        (Standortverwaltung STOV Gerolstein) will conduct an annual survey to ensure there is
        no encroachment to the existing easements. Representatives from 52 CES Resources
        Flight (52 CES/CEAC) and 52 FW/SEW will accompany STOV on this survey. 52
        CES/CEAC personnel will conduct the other three quarterly surveys; STOV and 52
        FW/SEW are invited to assist. These surveys will help ensure that host-nation civilians
        and properties remain at safe separation distances from PES and those areas within the
        explosives CZ remain uninhabited.
        2.3.3. Provide a copy of the restrictive easement inspection results to 52 FW/SEW.
        2.3.4. Ensure that 52 FW/SEW is included in the Facility Utilization Board and
        coordinate any new construction within an existing CZ with 52 FW/SEW prior to

     2.5.1. Notify the FACC and 52 MOS/MOC immediately at the start and conclusion of
     explosives movements involving any HC/D 1.1 explosives to the flight line. Notification
     shall include point of departure, destination, and HC/D of explosives, as a minimum.
     Notify the FACC immediately after the start and conclusion of explosives movements
     involving any HC/D 1.1 explosives outside the Munitions Storage Area.
     2.5.2. Ensure munitions delivery crews notify Munitions Control (MC) immediately
     upon entry to the flightline area. MC will then pass this information to 52 MOS/MOC,
     which in turn notifies the applicable 52 AMXS/AMU to post fire symbols IAW
     paragraph 2.7.1.1.
     2.5.3. Monitor the explosives content of all PES’ located within the NNMSA, as well as
     any flight line PES designated as a HAMS, for each authorized HC/D.
     2.5.4. Notify the FACC, 52 MOS/MOC, and 52d Security Forces Squadron, immediately
     regarding any fire symbol and/or hazardous chemical symbol/code change for any
     NNMSA PES and/or HAMS. Reconcile recorded information with the FACC once per
     shift each duty day, as a minimum twice daily.
     2.5.5. Dispatch personnel to deliver ammunition and explosives, only after reconciling
     maximum authorized NEW’s with the total explosives contained in a PES before the
     planned delivery.
     2.5.6. Initiate compensatory actions related to explosives operations conducted in the
     NNMSA in accordance with this instruction and any operational risk assessments. See
     Attachment 3.
  2.6. 52 AMXS/CC will:
     2.6.1. Approve locally developed instructions and/or checklists designed to supplement
     this instruction or otherwise enhance safe management of the explosives environment.
     2.6.2. Coordinate with 52 FW/SEW on all locally developed guidance that affects or
     involves explosives.
     2.6.3. Plan non-exercise and/or contingency loading and training involving live
     ammunition and explosives in a manner that minimizes the impact of compensatory
     actions in accordance with this instruction.
  2.7. Weapons Expediters (COMBAT) will:
     2.7.1. Post the appropriate fire symbols at the designated entry control points, once
     explosives have been introduced or removed from their flight line area.
        2.7.1.1. 480 AMU Combat is required to post fire symbols at the Foxtrot and 480
        AMU vehicle ECP’s and at the vehicle ECP and taxiway Alpha vehicle ECP located
8                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI91-201 15 NOVEMBER 2011


          near Ramp 4. 480 AMU Combat will verify all 4 above mentioned locations when
          only one of these units has explosives in their respective areas. The 81 AMU combat
          is required to post fire symbols at the taxiway Alpha vehicle ECP near HAS 3019, the
          vehicle ECP’s near HAS 3012 and between HAS’s 3023 and 3024, lastly the lower
          vehicle ECP located near 3000.
       2.7.2. Report explosives content of aircraft shelters to 52 MOS/MOC in the following
       format: HAS, total NEW, explosives and hazardous chemical code by the most practical
       and expedient means available.
       2.7.3. Calculate NEW totals for each authorized HC/D (i.e. 1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 and
       1.3, ammunition and explosives) in all HAS, except those designated as HAMS. To
       calculate total NEW, multiply the explosives content of each munitions item by the
       number of items in a particular structure. Remember, HC/Ds 1.1 through 1.3 is
       cumulative. For example, a facility that contains 10 pounds (lbs) of HC/D 1.1, 50 lbs of
       HC/D 1.2.1, 100 lbs of HC/D 1.2.2, and 40 lbs of HC/D 1.3 actually contains a total
       NEW of 200 lbs of HC/D 1.1 explosives.
       2.7.4. Notify 52 MOS/MOC immediately when any explosive upload operation is
       started. When HC/D 1.1 and/or 1.2.x munitions are moved from one flight line PES to
       another, reconcile both the ―from‖ and the ―to‖ locations with 52 MOS/MOC in
       accordance with paragraph 2.9.1 immediately.
       2.7.5. During steady state daily training operations, all shelters with aircraft present or
       returning will be reported as having HC/D 1.3/1.4 when routine training loads are used.
       Calculate NEW totals for HC/D 1.3/1.4 during steady state training operations based on
       maximum load for training events possible. The exception is when 2.75-inch rockets
       with White Phosphorus warheads (HC/D 1.2) are present.
       2.7.6. Ensure personnel adhere to explosives safety practices.
    2.8. 52 OSS/OSA will:
       2.8.1. Immediately notify the 52 MOS/MOC regarding inbound explosive loaded fighter
       aircraft.
    2.9. 52 MOS/MOC will:
       2.9.1. Notify the FACC immediately regarding any fire symbol change for any flight line
       PES. Reconcile recorded information with FACC once per shift each duty day, as a
       minimum twice daily.

Terms
Clear Zone—The area designated around any potential explosion site that depicts the distance to
which blast overpressure and/or hazardous fragments are expected to affect exposed sites.
Compensatory Actions—Compensatory actions are measures taken to mitigate the potential
injury to personnel and damage to equipment as the result of an unintended explosion. These
management actions compensate for violations to criteria that establish safe separation distances,
distances needed to separate valuable resources from ammunition and explosives. For purposes
of this instruction, compensatory actions, management actions, and compensatory measures are
interchangeable terms.
Electro—Explosive Device (EED)—An EED is an explosive or pyrotechnic component that
initiates an explosive, burning, electrical, or mechanical train and is activated by the application
of electrical energy.
Expanded—State—For the purpose of this instruction, the term expanded-state refers to those
periods when the explosives quantities needed to support contingency or combat operations
exceed those limits established by approved steady-state explosives site plans.
Maximum Credible Event (MCE)—MCE refers to a quantity of explosives for a specific
class/division 1.2.1 item that is equal to the largest quantity of explosives expected to explode at
one time when a stack of those specific items is involved in a fire. Personnel can find the MCE
for each item by accessing the Joint Hazard Classification System.
Military Ammunition and Explosives—All national stock listed ammunition, demolition
material, solid rocket motors, cartridges, pyrotechnics, mines, bombs, grenades, warheads of all
types, explosives elements of ejection and aircrew egress systems, air-launched missiles and
those explosive components of missile systems and space systems, and assembled kits and
devices containing explosive material.
Exposed Site—Any facility exposed to any potential explosion site. Exposed sites may be
explosive (e.g. a licensed facility or munitions storage magazine) or non-explosive (e.g. flight
line kitchen or support building).
Net Explosives Weight—The amount of explosives contained in a particular item as listed in the
Joint Hazard Classification System.
Potential Explosion Site—Any facility authorized to contain ammunition and explosives.
Authorization is obtained through an approved explosives site plan, an approved explosives
facility license, or an approved operational risk assessment.
Steady State—For the purpose of this instruction, the term steady state refers to day-to-day
operations when the explosives quantities needed to support training sorties and increased
readiness are equal to or less than those limits established by approved steady-state explosives
site plans

Notes: Compensatory measures are cumulative. For example, if the explosives content of facility
number 3006 is greater than 1,520 lbs, but less than 2,763 lbs, then you must remove aircraft from and
suspend use of Hardstands 3005, 3007, 3014, and 3015. Net Explosives Weights for HC/Ds 1.1, 1.2.1,
1.2.2, 1.2.3, and 1.3 are additive. For example, a facility that contains 10 lbs of HC/D 1.1, 50 lbs of
HC/D 1.2.1, and 100 lbs of HC/D 1.2.2 actually contains 160 total lbs of HC/D 1.1.
