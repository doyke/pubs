                                             Chapter 1

                                        GROUND SAFETY

1.1. General. The Ground Safety Manager (GSM) manages the wing ground safety program for
the wing commander. The main objective of Ground Safety is to assist commanders in
preventing mishaps through education and awareness.
1.2. Unit Safety Program Management. The 354th Fighter Wing (354 FW) wing safety office
is responsible for implementing the Eielson AFB safety program. The host safety office
implements mishap prevention programs and processes for all 354 FW units and tenant units on
base unless otherwise specified in a Host/Tenant Support Agreement. Safety staffs at all levels
will assist with implementation and integration of Risk Management (RM) into all 354 FW
operations and missions.
     1.2.1. The purpose of a unit safety program is to prevent mishaps entirely or reduce the
     severity of personal injuries and/or property damage by identifying and eliminating unsafe
     acts of workers and unsafe conditions in the work area. Each unit commander/functional
     manager is ultimately responsible for the safety program within his/her unit.
     1.2.2. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals, with assistance from
     Wing Safety, identify rules, criteria, procedures, Occupational Safety and Health
     Administration (OSHA), Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire, and Health
     (AFOSH), explosive safety, or other safety standards that could help to eliminate unsafe acts
     or conditions that cause mishaps.
     1.2.3. Unit commanders will appoint, in writing, primary and alternate Unit Safety
     Representatives (USR), Unit Motorcycle Monitors (UMM), and Unit Risk Management
     Advisors (RM Advisor) to manage the unit’s safety program elements. Individuals appointed
     shall have a minimum of 12 months’ retainability. Commanders will publish the names of
     safety program monitors and notify unit personnel when monitors change (unit safety roster).
     The appointment of safety program monitors below unit level (i.e., flight, section) is optional.
     Do not send flight/section representative appointment letters to Wing Safety.
     1.2.4. Commanders will ensure appointees are available to perform selected positions. New
     appointees are required if both the primary and the alternate appointee are unavailable for
     more than 14 calendar days.
1.3. Mishap Reporting Procedures. Unit commanders and USRs are responsible for
developing and publicizing mishap notification procedures within their unit. Procedures must
ensure prompt up-channel notification. See Attachment 2 for an example of mishap reporting
procedures.
     1.3.1. All mishaps will receive a preliminary “in-house” investigation. Immediate
     notification of the mishap is critical. Mishap sites contain valuable information necessary for
     accurate investigation and the formation of corrective actions. The first line supervisor of the
     individual involved in the mishap will assist with the investigation and document it on
     PACAF Form 161, Ground Mishap Report Worksheet. For Air Force Motor Vehicle
     mishaps, the unit Vehicle Control Officer/Noncommissioned Officer, with the assistance of
     the USR, will conduct the investigation. Wing Safety will determine the reporting criteria.
354FWI91-202 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                     5


   The unit level investigator will forward PACAF Forms 161 through the USR and commander
   to Wing Safety within 5 calendar days of mishap occurrence. Civilian personnel who are
   injured on the job will notify their supervisor immediately. Supervisors will complete
   appropriate civilian mishap forms (CA-1, CA-16, LS1), for all civilian on-duty injuries, in
   addition to the PACAF Form 161.
      1.3.1.1. On-duty mishaps are reported to Wing Safety immediately (24 hours a day) after
      first notifying rescue, medical, and/or law enforcement agencies, if required. On-duty
      mishaps include on-duty military and civilian injuries, major Air Force motor vehicle
      accidents (regardless of whether or not the mishap involved injury), and damage to Air
      Force property. A major Air Force motor vehicle accident includes, but is not limited to,
      a total loss of vehicle and/or vehicle damage costs over $15,000.
      1.3.1.2. Off-duty mishaps (injuries to military personnel only) are reported to Wing
      Safety by the close of the first duty day following the mishap. If the mishap results in
      hospitalization or death, Wing Safety must be notified immediately.
      1.3.1.3. After normal duty hours, Wing Safety can be contacted through Command Post
      (907) 377-1500.
   1.3.2. The 354th Medical Group (MDG) will notify Wing Safety of all reportable injuries
   and illnesses and provide an AF Form 1488, Daily Log Patients Treated for Injuries, or
   equivalent to Wing Safety daily.
   1.3.3. The 354th Staff Judge Advocate (JA) will notify Wing Safety of any claims involving
   injury to persons or damage to private property as a result of an Air Force operation.
   1.3.4. The 354th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) will provide copies of AF Form 1315,
   Accident Report, when requested, and make the daily blotter available for review by Wing
   Safety.
   1.3.5. The 354th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) will provide cost assessments for damage
   to government property as a result of a mishap to Wing Safety.
   1.3.6. The 354th Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) will provide cost estimates for all
   reported damage to Air Force motor vehicles when requested by Wing Safety.
1.4. Unit Safety Representative Responsibilities. The USR is responsible for assisting the
commander with the unit mishap prevention program. The USR will:
   1.4.1. Maintain a Ground Safety Management Book (GSMB) with the following tabs.
      1.4.1.1. Tab A: Current unit safety monitor appointment letters with training certificates.

                                            Chapter 2

                                      WEAPONS SAFETY

2.1. General. The Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) manages the wing weapons safety
program for the wing commander. The guidelines for the weapons safety program are outlined
in AFI 91-202. AFMAN 91-201 and DOD 6055.9-STD weapons safety standards. Weapons
Safety is composed of three disciplines: explosive safety, missile safety and nuclear surety. In
accordance with AFI 91-202, units at or above squadron level must have a weapons safety
program if they have an explosive, missile, or nuclear mission.
2.2. Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representatives (ADWSR). If applicable, unit
commanders will appoint a primary and alternate ADWSR IAW AFI 91-202 to manage unit
explosive safety program. ADWSRs will be appointed in writing and a copy of the letter
provided to Wing Safety.
     2.2.1. The WSM provides training for the ADWSRs within 30 days of appointment.
2.3. Weapons Safety meetings. ADWSRs are required to attend the quarterly Weapons Safety
meeting which provides a forum for disseminating information of concern to the weapons
community. Discussions items include HHQ inspections, good and bad programs, training, site
planning, and licensing requirements. This meeting is chaired by the WSM, outside agencies
will be invited as needed.
2.4. Major Programs. Weapons Safety provides guidance and oversight on the major squadron
safety programs identified below:
     2.4.1. Site Plans. Site plans are formulated, coordinated, and submitted through the WSM.
     Site plans are also coordinated through the wing commander, NAF, MAJCOM, Air Force
     Safety Center, and the DDESB. New construction or modification shall not begin prior to
     site plan approval to preclude unnecessary expenditure of resources.
     2.4.2. Licensing Explosives Locations. Explosives storage and operating locations outside
     of the munitions storage area may be licensed for mission essential quantities of explosives.
     Licensing is a coordinated effort between the user, Weapons Safety, Security Forces
     Resource Protection, and the Fire Department.
     2.4.3. Red Flag/Major Exercise Liaison. Ensure development of weapon safety management
     for compliance with installation site plans. Wing Weapon Safety is the focal point for TDY
     units to ensure established Air Force and local criteria are followed.
2.5. Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) Damage Reporting.
     2.5.1. 354 MSG/CC and 354 MXG/CC will appoint primary and alternate Master Nuclear
     Certified List (MNCL) Monitors and provide 354 FW/SEW a copy of their appointment
     letters. These monitors will maintain an organizational listing of MNCL items used or
     maintained. Semi-annually, MNCL Monitors will provide 354 FW/SEW with a validated
     listing of their MNCL items. These monitors will ensure unit personnel deliver a 354 FW
     NCE Damage Worksheet to 354 FW/SEW to initiate notification of damage, malfunctions, or
     failures to MNCL items. 354 MSG and 354 MXG personnel will not classify damage to

                                           Chapter 3

                                      FLIGHT SAFETY

3.1. General. Guidelines for flight safety are outlined in AFI 91-202. The Flight Safety Officer
manages the flight safety program for the wing commander. IAW AFI 91-202, 18 AGRS, 353
CTS and 354 OSS will each have a squadron flight safety program. Although the squadron
flight safety program belongs to the squadron commander, the squadron flight safety positions
and activities specified in this section represent an extension of the wing flight safety program.
3.2. Wing Flight Safety.
   3.2.1. The Chief of Safety will appoint a Flight Safety Officer (FSO) and Flight Safety NCO
   (FSNCO). The FSO and FSNCO will monitor flight-related facilities and operations as part
   of a continuous quality-improvement program IAW AFI 91-202 as supplemented by
   PACAF.
3.3. Squadron Flight Safety.
   3.3.1. Manning.
       3.3.1.1. The 18 AGRS/CC and 353 CTS/CC will each appoint a Squadron Assigned
       Flight Safety Officer (SAFSO). The 18 AGRS/CC will also appoint an Additional Duty
       Flight Safety Officer (ADFSO) who will assist the SAFSO in managing the unit internal
       safety program.
       3.3.1.2. The SAFSO/ADFSO should report directly to the squadron commander. In
       addition to managing the squadron flight safety program, SAFSOs will be responsible for
       assisting Wing Safety with mishap prevention and investigation duties IAW AFI 91-
       202_PACAFSUP1. SAFSOs will support the wing flight safety program through
       participation in wing taskings, activities, and regular interface with the wing FSO and
       FSNCO. During periods of wing FSO manning shortages, it may be necessary for the
       SAFSO to perform Wing Safety FSO duties. SAFSO taskings beyond those specified in
       this instruction will be coordinated through the chain of command.
       3.3.1.3. The following factors should be considered when selecting a SAFSO:
           3.3.1.3.1. Individual job experience and knowledge of unit operations.
           3.3.1.3.2. Present workload of the individual. SAFSOs should not be assigned other
           duties that would detract from their abilities to manage the unit mishap prevention
           program.
           3.3.1.3.3. Completion of collateral training including mishap reporting, mishap
           investigating, and hazard reporting requirements.
           3.3.1.3.4. Duty as a SAFSO, on occasion, may restrict an individual’s scheduling
           flexibility.
   3.3.2. SAFSO/ADFSO Key Duties.
       3.3.2.1. Administer the unit flight safety program using AFI 91-202, as supplemented by
       PACAF and this instruction.
354FWI91-202 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                    11


     3.3.2.2. The SAFSO/ADFSO will receive local training from the wing FSO within 30
     days of appointment. It is highly desirable for SAFSOs to be a graduate of the USAF
     AMIC Course, but not a requirement. The primary job of the SAFSO is to manage the
     squadron commander's flight safety program.
     3.3.2.3. Document all actions pertaining to safety briefs, safety reports and safety matters
     discussed with squadron members.
     3.3.2.4. Document spot inspections. Spot inspections will be documented in the Flight
     Safety Duty Officer Binder spot inspection log daily when flying operations are being
     conducted.
     3.3.2.5. Maintain a file of applicable safety subjects discussed/briefed to unit
     supervisors. This can include current safety "items of interest" identified to the squadron
     commander, FSO, or maintenance. When outside agencies, such as ATC or the flight
     surgeon, brief pilots/aircrews at squadron flight safety meetings, document their active
     participation in the unit safety program.
  3.3.2.6.   Report any unusual occurrences or incidents to Flight Safety. Ensure the
  appropriate safety form is completed to preserve information, see Attachment 5.
  3.3.2.7. Be familiar with and brief local area hazards, environmental hazards, and seasonal
  hazards to local pilots, Red Flag-AK participants, and other visiting units.
     3.3.2.8. Establish, conduct, and document a safety orientation program for new aircrew
     that includes ground and flight safety topics.
     3.3.2.9. Ensure squadron safety reports are submitted to 354 FW Flight Safety.
     3.3.2.10. Provide nominations for safety awards IAW AFI 36-2833, AFI 91-202 as
     supplemented by PACAF and this instruction.
     3.3.2.11. In the event of a Class A or B mishap, assist the squadron commander and
     Wing Safety in completing required checklists contained in the 354 FW Mishap
     Response Plan.
     3.3.2.12. SAFSOs investigate and report mishaps and flight hazards (Class C/D/E,
     HAPs, HATRs, etc.) as assigned by Wing Safety. The SAFSO will forward reports
     through Wing Safety for review.
     3.3.2.13. 18 AGRS SAFSO should create and maintain a strong working relationship
     with maintenance personnel and become knowledgeable of their operations. The SAFSO
     will work with maintenance to investigate aircraft malfunctions, identify trends and
     report findings quarterly to 354 FW/SEF. Trends with mishap prevention value will be
     reported immediately to 354 FW/SEF and 18 AGRS CC or DO and consolidated for the
     next Quarterly Flight Safety meeting.
     3.3.2.14. High interest items, policies, procedures, and general flight safety topics will be
     discussed in an open forum. The SAFSOs may be asked to contribute to the wing's
     quarterly flight safety meeting. Commanders should ensure maximum attendance by all
     aircrew at these meetings. Squadrons are encouraged to have their own flight safety
     meetings, or at a minimum, incorporate flight safety into commander's calls or other
12                                                       354FWI91-202 28 AUGUST 2013


     squadron meetings. Minutes from the quarterly flight safety meeting will be forwarded to
     the squadron SAFSO for review by aircrew unable to attend quarterly meetings.
354FWI91-202 28 AUGUST 2013                                                                    13
