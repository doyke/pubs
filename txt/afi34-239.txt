                                           Chapter 1

                       FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Authorized Uses
     1.1.1. Title 37 United States Code Section 402 authorizes subsistence and directs the
     Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretaries concerned, to prescribe policies
     regarding use of dining and field messing facilities of the uniformed services.
     1.1.2. DoDD 1418.05, Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) Policy, and AFMAN 65-
     116V2, Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unite Procedures Excluding FSO,
     establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for military personnel subsistence.
     1.1.3. DoDFMR Vol 7A, Chapter 25 directs subsistence entitlement, eligibility, restrictions,
     and special provisions to include meal collections and rates.
        1.1.3.1. A military member being paid BAS must pay for all meals or rations received
        from a government mess or provided on behalf of the government (except when a patient
        in a hospital). This is a personal obligation of the individual.
        1.1.3.2. With the exception of basic trainees and certain categories of personnel, all
        military members draw BAS. Formerly known as meal cards, Essential Station Messing
        (ESM) is messing declared by the installation, base, or station commander responsible for
        single government quarters, that is essential to operate the government mess efficiently
        and economically, or that is necessary for the health and safety of enlisted personnel
        permanently assigned to single quarters. Those categories of enlisted members included
        in ESM will be charged for all meals made available whether eaten or not, except for
        approved missed meals.
     1.1.4. Do not provide food or drink paid from organization-type (Operation and Maintenance
     - O&M) funds for military members, civilian employees, or any other persons, except in
     cases specifically authorized by law. An exception is provided those members who are on
     Essential Station Messing (ESM) exposed to the elements for extended periods, have no
     reasonable access to refreshment sources, and where beverages are required to remain
     alert. Examples are: ESM Security Forces personnel manning gates plus guard posts, and
     ESM Civil Engineering personnel involved in snow removal, or who work locations where
     no reasonable access to refreshment is authorized. These ESM Airmen are authorized
     mission essential beverages provided at government expense (charged to the 3500
     Appropriation account). All other personnel, military or civilian, are required to pay for
     coffee and other beverages at Air Force dining facilities.
        1.1.4.1. AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 4 provides guidance
        for the use of organization appropriated funds for food and drink to include bottled water
        and sports beverages. Sports Beverages and bottled water (such as Gatorade) used as
        Mission Essential Beverages for Essential Station Messing (ESM) will not be purchased
        with 3500 Appropriation. Sports beverages and bottled water not supporting a meal will
        be purchased using Organizational O&M funds. Organizations must comply with AFI
        65-601V1, paragraph 4.58.6, Sports Beverages. Purchase determination must be made by
AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014                                                                     5


       the local medical treatment facility (MTF) commander, or a medically qualified
       representative.
       1.1.4.2. AFMAN 34-240, Food Service Management Program, provides guidance for
       emergency situations when installation commanders can allow off-base civilians,
       noncombatant evacuees, and family members evacuated from other Department of
       Defense (DoD) installations to eat in the base dining facilities.
1.2. Unauthorized Uses. Do not use appropriated fund (APF) food from food service for social
activities.
1.3. Nutrition Education. Refer to AFI 40-104, Health Promotion Nutrition, for specific
information on meeting recommended nutritional standards.
1.4. Menu Patterns. The Food Service Officer (FSO) and/or Food Service Section Chief

                  FOOD ORDERING AND INVENTORY PROCEDURES

4.1. Forecasting. For a new requirement, the FSSC gives the Defense Logistic Agency Troop
Support (DLA TS) account manager the forecast for food 30 days in advance for Continental
United States (CONUS) locations and 120 days for overseas (OCONUS) locations. (T-3). The
Prime Vendor (PV) forecast allows contracts to be tailored to the customer’s requirements and
allows the customer maximum flexibility.
4.2. Ordering. For manual operations, storeroom personnel log into Subsistence Total Ordering
and receipting Electronic System (STORES) Web to create subsistence orders. (T-3). When
purchasing from the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) resale store, use a food service
government purchase card. (T-3). For manual and automated operations, storeroom personnel
will input commissary purchases in Aloha’s inventory control. (T-3). In automated dining
facilities under PV, the user orders directly from the PV through an electronic catalog in Aloha’s
inventory control that lists all the items available for the customer to order. (T-3). If orders are
unable to be placed through Corporate Food Service (CFS), storeroom personnel will order
directly through STORES Web. (T-3). Catalog updates, requisitions, purchase orders,
acknowledgments, and receipts are transmitted electronically using a closed loop Electronic
Commerce system between the customer, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support (DLA TS)
and the contractor.
4.3. Reconciliation. The facility manager will turn in all paperwork to the food service
accountant within 24 hours of receipt of food items except when items are delivered on
weekends. (T-3). The accountant will:
   4.3.1. Record and reconcile all types of purchases and charges on the Purchases
   Reconciliation Worksheet. Charges to the subsistence account are billed on the SF 1080,
   Voucher for Transfer between Appropriation and/or Funds. Reconciliation of purchases
   should be done daily and validation of SF 1080 completed monthly, upon receipt from
   Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). (T-3).
   4.3.2. In automated operations, verify correct amounts on the Purchase (History) Journal and
   the Receipt Confirmation. If you do not receive receipt confirmation within 2 business days,
   contact STORES Web helpdesk for further assistance. (T-3).
   4.3.3. Correct any discrepancies using Inventory Control or STORES Web. Refer to the
   CFS Handbook, View/Edit Purchase Order, page 46. (T-3).
   4.3.4. Coordinate discrepancies with the DLA TS account manager. (T-3).
4.4. Inventory Control. Storeroom personnel control subsistence until issued to the production
manager on shift. (T-3).
   4.4.1. Keep all storage areas secured and issue out items to the kitchen to ensure security and
   accountability of subsistence items in the storeroom. (T-3).
   4.4.2. At non-automated operations record food transferred between facilities on AF Form
   3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. For automated operations transferred-ins are
   an Invoice Entry and transferred-outs are an Adjustment Entry. Refer to the CFS Handbook,
 14                                                                  AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014


   Enter and Send Inter-Unit Transfers, page 66 to manage transfers between food service
   operations. (T-3).
4.5. Physical Inventory. Facility managers will conduct a weekly inventory as defined in CFS.
FSOs/FSSCs assign members other than the storeroom personnel to take a physical inventory of
all food items on the close of business on the last day of the month. (T-3).
   4.5.1. The person taking the inventory:
       4.5.1.1. In manual operations record the inventory count on AF Form 3514, Inventory
       Count Worksheet. (T-3).
   4.5.1.2. In automated operations record the inventory count on count sheets then enter
   counts into the Physical Count Entry under Inventory Control in CFS. Ensure the Physical
   Count Entry is printed out prior to processing it in CFS. (T-3).
   4.5.2. The FSO/FSSC reviews and certifies the inventory. (T-3).
4.6. End of Fiscal Year (FY) Inventory.
   4.6.1. On the last day of the current fiscal year, the FSO or Sustainment Flight
   Commander/Chief assigns someone in writing outside of food service to conduct the physical
   inventory (T-3) using the following procedures:
       4.6.1.1. Facility managers provide inventory officers with printed count sheets (Physical
       Count Entry). (T-3).
   4.6.2. Storeroom personnel, under observation of the inventory officers, will physically
   count inventory items in storage locations, kitchens and production areas. (T-3).
       4.6.2.1. Storeroom personnel will enter inventory counts into CFS (Physical Count
       Entry) once the inventory is complete. Inventory officers will verify all counts are
       entered into CFS. Storeroom personnel will save the inventory count and reconcile the
       overages and shortages. Once complete, storeroom personnel will print the Edit List
       Count Sheet utilizing the directions and illustrations in the CFS Handbook. Inventory
       officers will then sign the Edit List Count Sheet, thus certifying the inventory is correct.
       Facility managers then sign the Edit List Count Sheet. (T-3).
   4.6.3. Once the inventory is completed, save the inventory and close out. (T-3).
       4.6.3.1. Facility managers will process physical counts the next day. Once counts are
       processed, verify that they were processed (look in Physical Counts and the Event
       Viewer). Refer to the CFS Handbook page 95. (T-3).
   4.6.4. Once this process is completed facility managers will print out three copies of the On
   Hand Summary Report (RCS: HAF-SVO (A) 0304). This is the new fiscal year starting
   inventory. The FSO/FSSC will sign the On Hand Summary Report. One copy of the report
   is given to the food service accountant; one is emailed to AFPC/SVOF.
4.7. Cost Corrections. Any cost corrections accomplished in automated operations, which
exceed one percent of the total dollar value of the item class (i.e., beef items are 111, poultry
112, etc.), must be approved by AFPC/SVOF. (T-2).
AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014                                                                    15

                                           Chapter 5

                  WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MANAGEMENT

5.1. Requirements. This section expands on responsibilities and policies in DoD Directive
(DoDD) 3110.6, War Reserve Materiel Policy, and AFI 25-101. The War Consumable
Distribution Objective (WCDO), USAF War and Mobilization Plan and MAJCOM ration
requirements summary specify the number of days, quantities, and types of rations to be
maintained as WRM funded levels by the principle MAJCOM for storage and use at the
operational level.
   5.1.1. Only requirements identified for each MAJCOM as described in paragraph 5.1. are
   programmed and funded as WRM. For identification installations must coordinate all Air
   Force Operational Plan (OPLAN) requirements with their MAJCOM/A1R/ A4L.
   5.1.2. MAJCOM/A1R/A4L provides their annual WRM ration requirements in writing to
   AFPC/SVOF by 15 March. Requirements identified for locations that do not have an Air
   Force food service activity assigned will be stored at the nearest Air Force installation that
   has a food service activity.
   5.1.3. MAJCOM/A1R identifies and approves all self-sustaining unit ration requirements in
   their annual ration requirements summary. These units may store their rations instead of
   food service activities. Rations and accountable forms will be issued on a hand receipt to
   receiving units.
   5.1.4. AFPC/SVOF budgets for WRM Rations for storage at Regular Air Force installations
   with ration requirements, and coordinates with the Defense Logistics Agency for storage in
   CONUS and OCONUS These wartime and operational rations include; Unitized Group
   Rations (UGR) and Meals Ready to Eat (MREs)
5.2. Requisitioning.
   5.2.1. AFPC/SVOF approves new or increased WRM requirements, and places annual
   requisitions for all CONUS installations. WRM rations are only approved for storage at
   Regular Air Force installations that have an Air Force food service activity, except as noted
   in paragraphs 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 above.
   5.2.2. Installations will not exceed or drop below WRM-funded levels.
5.3. Storage. WRM rations should be stored under refrigeration (ideal temperature is 35-50
degrees Fahrenheit) to extend their shelf life. The maximum shelf life is 36 months at 80 degrees
Fahrenheit. Installations unable to store under refrigeration need to contact AFPC/SVOF for
further guidance. (T-1).
   5.3.1. If current facilities are inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the installation
   commander will provide space elsewhere on the installation. The facility will be under lock
   and key and controlled by the FSO/FSSC and the person charged with the WRM program;
   furthermore, it must provide adequate security, so only those who control the rations have
   access to them. Erect a physical barrier (floor to ceiling) to prevent theft or pilferage should
   the facility be jointly used with another FSS or installation activity. (T-1).
AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014                                                                             17


   5.3.2. Store WRM rations by lot number and date-of-pack (First-in-First-Out (FIFO)) on
   standard 40” X 48” size pallets. (T-3).
   5.3.3. WRM rations may be stored in the same warehouse as food service stocks; however,
   they will not be commingled together (refer to paragraph 5.3.1). WRM and food service
   rations should not be stacked more than three pallets high—without warehouse rack shelving.
   5.3.4. Food Service will store the number of WRM rations to meet the installation’s WRM
   requirements. Food Service will not separate and store WRM rations for individual units.
   MREs will be stored on pallets of the same lot number. Individual MREs are issued to
   dining facilities and/or flight kitchens if the capability exists in support of authorized
   personnel. (T-3).
   5.3.5. Rations stored by self-sustaining units are issued on AF Form 3516, with a
   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed out by the issuing service and self-sustaining
   unit commanders. Refer to Attachment 7. Food service must account for these rations in
   the WRM account and report monthly on a separate AF Form 28, War Reserve Materiel
   (WRM) Ration Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)9601). Refer to Attachment 8 for reporting
   procedures. (T-1).
5.4. Issues and Transfers. If sufficient rations are not available in food service and WRM
rations have to be used for emergencies, the Force Support Commander or designated
representative must approve the release of all WRM rations in coordination with the installation
War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO) on AF Form 3516. (T-3).
   5.4.1. Regular Air Force units must obtain MRE/UGR rations through food service. Food
   service will order and issue rations to units using AF Form 3516. (T-3). Units will then be
   issued accountable forms, such as AF Form 79, for control of ESM and BAS funds when
   rations are consumed. Guidance will be provided by food service to units.
   5.4.2. Only authorized Regular Air Force units can use unit funds to purchase survival
   packets and emergency drinking water. These authorized units must obtain these rations
   through Installation Supply. Survival packets and drinking water will not be stored in the
   food service warehouse. Storage of these items is the authorized unit’s responsibility. (T-3).
   5.4.3. Issue all operational rations in full case lots only. If an open case is found, issue it to a
   facility that issues them out individually to authorized personnel. (T-3).
   5.4.4. Include date-of-pack, lot number, and quantity of rations issued on AF Form 3516. (T-
   3).
   5.4.5. All expired or expiring MREs/UGRs are inspected by Military Public Health. (T-3).
   If Military Public Health determines rations are fit for consumption they will extend their
   shelf life. Military Public Health is responsible in determining if rations are edible or need to
   be condemned. Military Public Health inspectors provide DSCP Form 5117, Report of
   Inspection of Operational Rations, or comparable documentation to food service personnel
   for the lot number and quantity of rations found unfit for consumption. (T-3). These rations
   are destroyed by food service. (T-3). Heater packs are considered hazardous material.
   Contact AFPC/SVOF for further guidance on how to destroy and dispose of MRE heater
   packs.
 18                                                                AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014


   5.4.6. Return rations to food service activities if there is not a recurring demand for them.
   Accept full cases only, and have Military Public Health inspectors inspect rations for
   serviceability before accepting them into APF food operations. (T-3).
   5.4.7. For support of exercises and contingencies, transfer operational rations from one
   installation to another using DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document. A
   document number must be obtained from AFPC/SVOF and rations must be inspected by
   Military Public Health prior to shipment in accordance with DLA TS Handbook 4155.2,
   Inspection of Meal, Ready-To-Eat (MRE) Rations (Appendix A). A copy of the inspection
   report accompanies the shipment. (T-2).
5.5. Rotation. AFPC/SVI/SVO develops and monitors rotation of all pre-positioned WRM
assets to include those stored by food service. MREs must be rotated annually to ensure
serviceability of rations. Contact AFPC/SVOF by April/May each year to identify and
coordinate ration rotation replacement requirements.   AFPC/SVOF will also inform
MAJCOMs/A1Rs of quantities and types of WRM rotation requirements DLA TS has of stocks
stored in CONUS. (T-2).
   5.5.1. AFPC/SVI/SVO identifies rations yearly that are not used in local exercises and
   coordinates with MAJCOMs/A1Rs for redistribution to other installations. (T-2).
   5.5.2. Rotate new rations into WRM upon receipt of annual replacement rations. Record
   rations under quantity (QTY) Purchase on the AF Form 28. Rotate old WRM MREs into
   operational inventory. No other action required on the AF Form 28. (T-3).
   5.5.3. Use AF Form 28 to report each type of ration (MREs and UGRs) in storage by lot
   number and date-of-pack. Refer to Attachment 8 for additional guidance on reporting
   procedures. (T-3).
5.6. Inventory. Conduct a physical monthly inventory to determine and certify on hand
quantity and monetary value of rations. On hand quantities are inventoried and recorded by date-
of-packs, and lot numbers. WRM assets will not exceed or drop below the funded-level
established by AFPC/SVOF. (T-2). Perform a physical inventory on the last workday of each
month.
   5.6.1. Self-sustaining units will inventory issued rations monthly, and report results (lot
   numbers and quantities) to food service personnel. Food service reports these rations on a
   separate AF Form 28 for those units. (T-3).
AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014                                                                        19



5.7. Revaluation. Each fiscal year (1 October) the case purchase price (not sell price) of MREs
may change. Food service personnel will re-value MRE inventories to account for the price
change. Two AF Forms 28s will be submitted. Food Service personnel will conduct an end of
fiscal year inventory on 30 September for the cost (not sell price) using that current year’s case
price. The end of year quantity will then be transferred to a new AF Form 28 for the next fiscal
year. The AF Form 28 for 1 October (start of the new fiscal year) will reflect the new case
purchase price for the new fiscal year. (T-3).

                      USE OF AIR FORCE APF DINING FACILITIES

A2.1. The Air Force operates APF enlisted dining facilities to meet the mission feeding
requirements of the installation. This facility provides subsistence entitlements to enlisted
members who reside in dormitories. In addition, the dining facility provides food service to all
Airmen, military and civilian, while on duty. Facilities also provide a structured on-the-job
training environment for food service personnel to meet our war-fighting mission, and to provide
flight and operational meal service in support of daily operations. . Use of the dining facility is
limited to military heritage meeting (First Sergeant, Chief Group, DV Visits) , all other non-
heritage and catered events are not authorized. Attachment 3 lists the meal rates for the
following customers and other situations where it is appropriate for the installation commander
to authorize personnel to eat in dining facilities. Meal rate charges are determined by the Under
Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (USD/C), and are published annually. All waivers to meal
charges must be approved by USD/C.
A2.2. Enlisted Members:
   A2.2.1. Enlisted members who are essential station messing (ESM) are authorized to use the
   dining facility at no charge.
   A2.2.2. Enlisted members who receive BAS are authorized to use the dining facility as a
   cash-paying customer.
   A2.2.3. Enlisted members receiving the meal portion of per diem are authorized to use the
   dining facility as a cash-paying customer.
A2.3. Officers:
   A2.3.1. The installation commander may authorize officers to eat meals in the dining facility
   after determining other facilities, including NAF food activities, installation exchange
   cafeterias, and installation restaurants, are not available, adequate, or readily accessible to the
   duty station and that sufficient capability to provide this meal service is available within the
   dining facility operation.
   A2.3.2. Officers receiving a meal portion of per diem are authorized to use dining facilities
   when the authorization is included in TDY orders by the orders authorizing official. Officers
   may only be authorized to use dining facilities at locations where the installation commander
   has determined government meals are available for DoD TDY travelers. Locations where
   government meals are available to TDY travelers are listed in AFMAN 34-102.
A2.4. Civilians:
   A2.4.1. The installation commander may authorize DoD civilians to eat meals in dining
   facilities after determining other facilities, including NAF food activities, installation
   exchange cafeterias, and installation restaurants, are not available, adequate, or readily
   accessible to the duty location, and that sufficient capability to provide this meal service is
   available within the dining facility operation. .
   A2.4.2. DoD civilians receiving a meal portion of per diem are authorized to use dining
   facilities upon presentation of their TDY orders. Civilians may only use dining facilities at
28                                                                  AFI34-239 17 APRIL 2014


  locations where the installation commander has determined government meals to be available
  to DoD TDY travelers.
  A2.4.3. Dependent family members of military personnel. Generally, dependent family
  members of military personnel are not authorized to use the enlisted dining facility. When
  family members of military personnel E1-E4 are authorized to eat in the enlisted dining
  facility, they are charged the discount meal rate (food cost only). The installation
  commander may authorize family members of military members and family members of
  DoD civilians assigned overseas to eat meals in the dining facility after determining other
  facilities, including NAF food activities, installation exchange cafeterias, and installation
  restaurants, are not available or adequate and that sufficient capability to provide this meal
  service is available within the dining facility operation.
  A2.4.4. Retirees. Installation commanders have the authority to allow retirees to use the
  enlisted dining facility. When making such a decision, the installation commander should
  consider the capability of the dining facility, the service impact on delivering the subsistence
  entitlement to Regular AF enlisted members, and the service impact on TDY travelers.
  Where such permission does not degrade our ability to serve our primary customers, use of
  the enlisted dining facility may be granted.

Notes: Youth groups consist of nonprofit youth groups sponsored at the national or local level and ad hoc groups of
youths. The distinction between the two groups is that an organized youth group has continuity over time and a
structure (such as officers, advisors, organization rules), while an ad hoc group does not. For example: A local high
school Key Club, which may be sponsored by the Kiwanis Club, would qualify as an organized nonprofit youth
group. On the other hand, if the children of a local Kiwanis Club’s members visited an installation, they would be
