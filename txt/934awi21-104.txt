procedures for notification and calibration of test measurement diagnostic equipment (TMDE). It
applies to all activities at the 934th Airlift Wing (AW) who possess locally-calibrated TMDE or
items which are calibrated at the certified precision measuring equipment laboratory (PMEL)
located at Duluth International Airport (IAP), MN. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through Major

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Minor changes made for clarity and to meet new format requirements outlined in AFI 33-360,
934th Airlift Wing Sup I, Publications and Forms Management.
1. Responsibility. The Test Measurement Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) user-owner is
responsible to ensure that all equipment covered under Technical Orders (T.O.) 00-20-14, Air
Force Metrology And. Calibration Program, T.O. 33K-1-100-1, Maintenance Data Collections
 2                                                         934AWI21-104 27 FEBRUARY 2014


Codes and Calibration Measurement Summaries, and T.O. 33K-1-100-2, TMDE Calibration
Interval Technical Order and Work Unit Code Reference Guide, are properly calibrated at the
required intervals and prior to use of new equipment. All organizations with equipment to be
calibrated will ensure timely delivery and pickup at avionics flight, building 805.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. The TMDE master listing is controlled by Precision Measuring Equipment Laboratory
     (PMEL) at Duluth International Airport (IAP), MN and all equipment changes must process
     through the Duluth PMEL lab. For changes to Master Inventory Listing, notify the Duluth
     PMEL lab (218)723-7445/DSN825-7445.
     2.2. Deliver TMDE due calibration to Avionics Branch, building 805 room 3B, with a
     completed AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. Avionics personnel will sign the
     receipt and return it to the owner of the equipment. Items requiring calibration must be in the
     Avionics building no later than 1500 hours on the Monday prior to the dates determined by
     the PMEL lab and distributed to OWC contacts via Avionics personnel. Shipments are made
     on the Tuesday prior to the scheduled date generally, but not always, every third Wednesday
     beginning January 2014.
     2.3. Equipment owners will pick up completed TMDE within two working days after
     notification by avionics personnel. Notification will be made by phone and/or email. It is
     the responsibility of the OWC to notify avionics personnel and the PMEL lab when the OWC
     contact information changes.
     2.4. All TMDE being turned into base supply for disposal will be properly tagged and the
     Duluth PMEL lab (218)723-7445/DSN 825-7445 will be notified of the label number.
     AFTO Form 108, TMDE Certification, AFTO Form 394, TMDE Certification, AFTO Form
     99, Limited/Special TMDE Certification, and AFTO Form 398, Limited TMDE Certification,
     will be removed prior to turn in.
