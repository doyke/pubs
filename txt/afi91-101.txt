                                PROGRAM INFORMATION

1.1. Goal. The goal of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program is to incorporate
maximum nuclear surety, consistent with operational requirements, from weapon system
development to dismantlement.
1.2. Nuclear Weapons Surety (also referred to as Nuclear Surety). Policies, procedures,
controls, and actions that encompass safety, security, and control measures, which ensure there
will be no nuclear weapons accidents, incidents, unauthorized detonation, or degradation of
weapon effectiveness during its Stockpile-to-Target Sequence (STS).
1.3. Surety Standards. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program ensures personnel
design and operate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems to satisfy the safety standards
in Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
The four DoD nuclear surety standards are:
     1.3.1. There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or
     incidents, or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield.
     1.3.2. There shall be positive measures to prevent DELIBERATE prearming, arming,
     launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders
     or when directed by competent authority.
     1.3.3. There shall be positive measures to prevent INADVERTENT prearming, arming,
     launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal
     environments.
     1.3.4. There shall be positive measures to ensure adequate security of nuclear weapons,
     under DoD S-5210.41-M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual.
AFI91-101 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                         5

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Commanders’/Directors’ Emphasis. Commanders at all levels are responsible for the
success of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. Commanders MUST emphasize that
safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are of great importance to the
United States. The following is not an all-inclusive list of restrictions dealing with nuclear
weapons. Commanders shall review the Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSRs) for their
specific weapon system(s) found in AFIs 91-111 thru 91-117. (T-1)
   2.1.1. Do not use nuclear weapons to troubleshoot faults, that is, to confirm a fault exists, to
   aid in fault isolation, or to verify fault correction. AFI 91-107, Design, Evaluation,
   Troubleshooting, and Maintenance Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems, contains specific
   guidance. (T-1)
   2.1.2. During exercises, do not wear complete chemical ensembles when handling war
   reserve nuclear weapons. Remove the gas mask, to aid in personal identification, and gloves,
   to ensure weapons are not inadvertently damaged. (T-1)
   2.1.3. Storing nuclear weapons in one facility and conventional munitions in another facility
   within the same weapons storage area (WSA) is not considered simultaneous presence and
   does not require MAJCOM approval. Conventional munitions inherently part of a nuclear
   weapon system and/or nuclear weapon component (e.g., forward shroud, forward section,
   electrical explosive devices, and limited life components) located in the same assembly,
   surveillance, and inspection (AS&I)/maintenance and inspection (M&I), vault or storage
   facility are not considered simultaneous presence. Examples of conventional munitions
   include Mk82, Mk84, and Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). Do not store nuclear
   weapons and conventional munitions together, except: (T-1)
       2.1.3.1. As part of flightline or protective aircraft shelter operations conducted IAW
       WSSRs. (T-1)
       2.1.3.2. The MAJCOM/CC may approve the temporary storage of nuclear and
       conventional munitions within a WSA facility to facilitate the warehousing of these
       materials in order to meet immediate operational requirements. AFMAN 91-201,
       Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety
       Criteria, contain specific guidance.    Reference AFMAN 91-201 when storing
       conventional munitions inside a hardened aircraft shelter with a weapons storage and
       security system (WS3) vault. (T-1)
       2.1.3.3. The wing commander may approve the immediate storage of nuclear and
       conventional munitions within a WSA facility for 72 hours in the event of fire, flood, or
       natural disaster, or if the nuclear storage facility can no longer be secured. Initiate
       PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV) procedures prescribed in
       AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Storage for more than 72 hours requires
       MAJCOM/CC approval. (T-1)
       2.1.3.4. Storage of nuclear and conventional munitions within a WSA facility for more
       than 90 days requires approval by Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE). At a minimum, the
6                                                                AFI91-101 15 AUGUST 2014


       approval request shall include a mitigation plan containing the following: the reason for
       the request, risk assessment, any corrective action and expected duration. While the
       AF/SE approval is in existence it will be reviewed at least quarterly by the affected
       wing/CC and MAJCOM/CC for validity and progress updates. (T-1)
    2.1.4. Implement local procedures:
       2.1.4.1. Prohibit direct over flight, in airspace controlled by the base, of WSAs, weapon
       movements, nuclear-loaded aircraft, and aircraft shelters with nuclear weapons inside.
       Over flight of aircraft shelters where the weapons inside are secured in a WS3 vault is
       permitted. (T-1)
       2.1.4.2. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance, to the maximum extent possible,
       will not be parked pointed toward Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) flightline
       operations or active convoy routes. (T-1)
       2.1.4.3. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance must be limited, to the maximum
       extent possible, from sweeping across PNAF flightline operations and active convoy
       routes. (T-1)
       2.1.4.4. Prohibit direct over flight of PNAF aircraft during ground operations within the
       airspace controlled by the base. (T-1)
    2.1.5. Training:
       2.1.5.1. Commanders and supervisors at all levels must ensure individuals receive
       instructor-led initial nuclear surety training and 15-month recurring nuclear surety
       refresher training before they work with nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems,
       certified critical components, perform nuclear-related duties, or control entry into No-
       Lone Zones. At a minimum, these individuals will receive initial nuclear surety training
       prior to performing nuclear-related duties and recurring training will be accomplished by
       the end of the 15th month thereafter. Individuals must complete a closed-book test with a
       minimum passing score of 80 percent. A test score of less than 80 percent requires
       remedial training and retesting with a different test before that person may perform
       nuclear-related duties. Training/testing will include at a minimum the standardized
       nuclear surety lesson plan and testing materials described in para 2.2.1.8. Document
       initial and 15-month recurring nuclear surety training. (T-0) Initial and recurring
       training will include the following mandatory topics:
           2.1.5.1.1. Importance of, and need for, a US nuclear capability. (T-0)

                                           Chapter 3

      SPECIAL NUCLEAR SURETY POLICY AND GUIDANCE WAIVER PROCESS

3.1. Purpose: This chapter supplements the AFI 33-360 policy and guidance waiver process by
establishing special procedures and delineating specific responsibilities for units requesting
waivers to nuclear enterprise-related policy and guidance. This chapter refers to this special
process as the Nuclear Deviation Reporting Program (NDRP). The NDRP augments the AFI 33-
360 process by implementing an initiative designed to catalog/track deviations to nuclear
weapons and nuclear weapons systems-related publications, standardizes approval/risk
acceptance processes, and prescribes periodic review/reporting criteria.
3.2. Scope/Applicability. The NDRP is applicable to directive publications, as defined by AFI
33-360, prescribing policy and guidance throughout the Air Force nuclear enterprise. The NDRP
will be utilized anytime an organization requests a waiver to a compliance item within a nuclear-
related publication.
   3.2.1. Security Forces units will follow the nuclear security deviation process as outlined in
   DoD S-5210.41-M-V2_AFMAN31-108V2, Enclosure 7, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual:
   The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual for nuclear security deviations.
   3.2.2. For Weapon System Safety Rules, see DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System
   Safety Program Manual.
3.3. General. The NDRP was established to address deviations from nuclear weapons and
nuclear weapons systems-related publications to systematically and uniformly identify, assess,
and approve by the proper level of command and allow for informed risk decisions to be made.
Additionally, the NDRP will:
   3.3.1. Evaluate the potential impact of deviations on entire systems since individual
   deviations by themselves may or may not create vulnerabilities.
   3.3.2. Ensure adequate compensatory measures are implemented and remain in place until
   the deviation is no longer required.
   3.3.3. Ensure timely and aggressive actions are taken to apply resources to implement
   corrective measures to eliminate deviations.
   3.3.4. Ensure programmatic/operational risks are fully vetted and accepted by the proper risk
   acceptance authority.
   3.3.5. Provide a feedback mechanism to validate requirements against operational feasibility.
3.4. Functional Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. Headquarters USAF.
       3.4.1.1. As the Authorizing OPR for Air Force publications and forms, they serve as
       review authority for deviations to nuclear-related guidance for which they are OPR as
       stipulated in AFI 33-360, Publication and Forms Management. Approval shall ensure
       adequate compensatory measures have been established to meet guidance intent.
       3.4.1.2. Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) will:
AFI91-101 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                  21

       3.4.6.1. Review, and sign requests for deviations as Requestor/Initiator. Submit request
       for deviations to MAJCOM NDRP OPR, through the NAF (if applicable). (T-1)
       3.4.6.2. Include deviation status as a topic during Wing/Base Nuclear Surety Councils.
       (T-1)
       3.4.6.3. Implement compensatory measures immediately upon identification of the
       deficiency. Pursue/implement corrective actions until the deviation is corrected or no
       longer required. If deviation cannot be corrected within 30 days a deviation must be
       submitted to the MAJCOM/CC. (T-1)
   3.4.7. Program Managers (PM) will:
       3.4.7.1. Provide support to the Lead/Using MAJCOM/CC to evaluate the potential
       impacts of submitted deviations on nuclear weapons safety design and evaluation criteria.
       (T-2)
       3.4.7.2. Implement programmatic changes as required by applicable guidance. Any
       programmatic changes should be accompanied with funds. (T-2)
3.5. Deviations and Categories. A nuclear deviation is an inclusive term identifying specific
departure from a nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons systems related publications for
operational necessity based on strategic and compelling reasons. Nuclear deviations are further
categorized as technical, temporary, or permanent deviations depending on duration, threats, and
associated vulnerabilities. Note: Deviations do not always equate to vulnerabilities.
   3.5.1. Technical. A technical deviation is a departure from a nuclear weapons and nuclear
   weapons systems related requirement but essentially affords the same level of nuclear surety.
   Technical deviations do not create vulnerabilities and, as such, do not require compensatory
   measures, and may be approved for an indefinite period of time.
   3.5.2. Temporary. A temporary deviation is the approved temporary continuation of a non-
   standard condition which deviates from established standard and requires compensatory
   measures. Temporary deviations shall be approved for a period not to exceed 12 months.
   3.5.3. Permanent. A permanent deviation is a departure from a nuclear weapons and nuclear
   weapons systems related guidance that creates vulnerability and the corrective actions are
   either not feasible or not cost effective. Permanent deviations require compensatory
   measures. Permanent deviations need only be approved once and do not require an
   expiration date. However, the owning MAJCOM will review permanent deviations for
   validity annually, and whenever criteria or conditions change that may positively or
   negatively affect them.
3.6. Compensatory Measures. A compensatory measure is an action designed to mitigate risk
to an acceptable level. If appropriate, one compensatory measure may suffice for more than one
deviation.
   3.6.1. Compensatory measures shall be instituted whenever two or more technical
   deviations, taken together, are determined to constitute a vulnerability.
   3.6.2. Compensatory measures shall also be instituted for each temporary and permanent
   deviation.
AFI91-101 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                      23


3.7. Deviation Submission/Cancellation Process. Deviations will be initiated by local
commander and must be reviewed by the applicable HAF functional and then approved by the
MAJCOM/CC. Deviation cancellation requests, stemming from the originating organization,
shall follow the same process as approval thereby ensuring all the appropriate offices/agencies
have verified that corrective actions are sufficient for cancellation.         All deviations
submissions/cancellations will be submitted on AF IMT 116, Request for Deviation from
Security Criteria. (T-1)
   3.7.1. Deviation requests shall be initiated by the organization tasked to implement the
   applicable guidance. The request must be routed through the weapon safety manager for
   approval by the Wing Commander or equivalent. The request will be submitted to the
   MAJCOM NDRP OPR for tracking, routing, functional review, and approval. (T-2)
   3.7.2. Each deviation shall be evaluated and approved on a case-by-case basis. Any level in
   the chain of command may recommend disapproval of a request for deviation and return the
   request to the initiator.
   3.7.3. When considering a deviation request for a particular system, ensure a thorough
   review of all other approved deviations currently in effect for that system. This review is to
   ensure that the collective deviations do not establish an overall system vulnerability greater
   than the designated compensatory measures.
   3.7.4. MAJCOM NDRP OPR will forward request to MAJCOM functional. The MAJCOM
   functional will review the deviation, compensatory measures, associated risks, and if
   required, route the deviation request to the HAF functional. The HAF functional may deny
   the request, recommend approval, or return it to the MAJCOM functional requesting
   additional information.
   3.7.5. The MAJCOM functional will submit the deviation request to the MAJCOM
   Commander for final approval and risk acceptance. MAJCOM functional will return the
   approved deviation to the originating organization with courtesy copy to the MAJCOM
   NDRP OPR.
   3.7.6. MAJCOM NDRP OPR will update the tracking status and route approved deviations
   to AFSEC/SEW.
3.8. Deviations to Nuclear Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria. Deviations related to the
design of a nuclear weapon system shall follow established processes in accordance with AFI 63-
131, Modification Management, AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements
Development, AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, AFI 63-103, and AFI 63-
125.
   3.8.1. If the design conflicts with criteria in AFMAN 91-118 or AFMAN 91-119, Safety
   Design and Evaluation Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems Software, PMs shall submit a
   notification via memorandum to AFSEC/SEW requesting disposition. (T-1)
   3.8.2. AFSEC/SEW shall provide direction to comply with policy, obtain a deviation to
   requirements, or to initiate changes to the publications as appropriate.
   3.8.3. If a deviation is required, PM’s will submit an AF Form 116 to AFSEC/SEW. If a
   publication change is required, PMs will submit an AF Form 847 to AFSEC/SEW. (T-1)
 24                                                            AFI91-101 15 AUGUST 2014


   3.8.4. Upon receipt of the deviation, AFSEC/SEW will send the AF Form 116 to the
   applicable Lead/Using MAJCOM NDRP OPR for further coordination and operational risk
   acceptance. (T-1)
   3.8.5. Once the deviation is approved, the Lead/Using MAJCOM NDRP OPR will update
   tracking status and route the AF Form 116 to AFSEC/SEW.
   3.8.6. AFSEC/SEW will return the approved AF Form 116 to the PM. (T-2)
3.9. Risk Management. Commanders at all levels must ensure risks to nuclear weapons and
nuclear weapon systems are identified and understood and shall establish procedures to reduce
such risks. Notify the Combatant Commander for all issues affecting combat capability of
allocated nuclear systems. AFI 90-802, Risk Management, will be utilized as a framework for
reducing risk to the lowest level commensurate with operational requirements, unless the Office
of Secretary of Defense directs a different framework. For acquisition-related programs, risks
will be managed in accordance with DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition
System, AFI 63-101/20-101, and MIL-STD-882E, Systems Safety. (T-0)
3.10. Annual Reporting. MAJCOM Commanders shall report all nuclear surety deviations
annually to AFSEC/SEW who shall forward to the Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE).
MAJCOM NDRP OPR will prepare the annual report and obtain functional coordination prior to
submitting it for MAJCOM/CC approval. MAJCOMs will submit current year AF Forms 116 to
AFSEC/SEW NLT 1 February.
   3.10.1. The annual nuclear weapon deviation report shall be submitted NLT 15 February and
   include all deviations valid and cancelled during the reporting period. The reporting period
   is 1 January through 31 December.
       3.10.1.1. AFSEC/SEW will provide MAJCOMs a template NLT 15 October each year
       for deviation annual report.
       3.10.1.2. USAFE shall annually report North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
       approved deviations through U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) directly to
       AFSEC/SEW.
   3.10.2. AFSEC/SEW shall consolidate MAJCOM reports, evaluate the impacts to nuclear
   surety, and provide an analysis of the deviation reports to the CSAF through AF/SE by 1
   March. This analysis shall be a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the impact to
   nuclear surety resulting from the aggregate of all deviations.

Targeting—Operations that involve identifying specific target sets, transferring target data to a
guidance computer, and following the programmed flight path to the specified target. (USAF)
Technical Deviation— A departure from a nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons systems
related publications, but does not create vulnerabilities nor require compensatory measures.
(USAF)
Technical Nuclear Safety Analysis (TNSA)—An independent technical analysis of a nuclear
weapon system and its associated operational procedures. The TNSA provides the Nuclear
Weapon System Safety Group with an independent opinion as to whether the weapon system's
design safety and security features, in conjunction with its operational procedures, satisfy the
DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Standards. (USAF)
Temporary Deviation— A departure from a nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons systems
related publications that creates a vulnerability. Temporary deviations shall not exceed 48
months. (USAF)

through one communication system with different channel samples staggered in time to form a
composite pulse train. (USAF)
Two-Person Concept—Designed to ensure that a lone individual is denied access to nuclear
weapons, nuclear weapon systems or critical components, never allowing the opportunity for
tampering, damage, or an unauthorized act to go undetected. The Two-Person concept requires
the presence at all times of at least two authorized persons, each certified under PRP,
knowledgeable in the task to be performed, familiar with applicable safety and security
requirements and each capable of promptly detecting an incorrect act or improper procedure
with respect to the task to be performed. Both members must have completed required
