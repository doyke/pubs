                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy . It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect,
and destroy its classified and unclassified information and material consistent with national
policy. This general policy statement also applies to unclassified controlled information
(Attachment 2) under the purview of relevant statutes, regulations and directives [Reference
DOD 5200.1-R, C1.1.]
1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the
Information Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by
delegating authority to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk
management principles; focusing on identifying and protecting only that information that
requires protection; integrating security procedures into our business processes so that they
become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands their security roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in
its infrastructure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of
our security policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support
of commanders at all levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information
Security Program Manager (ISPM) and security manager system. Both play an integral role in
ensuring unit personnel know and understand their role in protecting classified information
against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.2.]

  sites in Singapore, Diego Garcia, and Australia. ISPR for Wake Island will be conducted as
  evolving mission change necessitates.
  1.4.2. (374AW) Program reviews are examinations of a unit‘s information, personnel, and
  industrial security programs. Program reviews are not "compliance inspections" and they are
  not rated. Instead, they are "assistance" oriented visits to identify noteworthy and problem
  areas in the Information, Personnel and Industrial Security Program of the activity visited. A
  random sampling method may be used to determine the overall status of unit program
  effectiveness.
     1.4.2.1. (Added-374AW) . Unit commanders and staff agency chiefs review program
     review reports and, when necessary, take appropriate corrective action on problem areas

     inspections.
     1.4.3.2. (374AW) The unit security manager is responsible for knowing when
     semiannual self-inspections are due. Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs will
     appoint, in writing, an individual to conduct the unit semiannual self-inspection and
     forward a copy of the appointment letter to 374 AW/IPO. Security managers will not
     inspect their own programs but will monitor and assist as necessary. Cross inspections,
     which permit one unit security manager to inspect another, are encouraged. The
     inspection of each element of the security program may be made on the basis of random
     sampling, but the inspection must be extensive enough to show compliance with required
     security directives. The person conducting the inspection will send a written report of
     findings to the unit commander or staff agency chief who reviews it to determine
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                  17

                  ORIGINAL AND DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION

2.1. Original Classification Authority (OCA) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.2.]
   2.1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the OCA and may further delegate this
   authority.
   2.1.2. The process for delegating OCA authority is as follows:
      2.1.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force delegates Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential
      authority.
      2.1.2.1. (PACAF) PACAF original classification authorities (OCA) are: Top Secret:
      COMPACAF and NAF Commanders; Secret: PACAF/A3/5/8.
      2.1.2.1. (374AW) PACAF original classification authorities (OCA) are: Top Secret: 7th
      Air Force Commander (7 AF/CC) and 13 AF Commander (13 AF/CC); Secret: Pacific
      Air Forces Director of Operations, Plans, Requirement and Programs (PACAF/A3/5/8).
      2.1.2.2. SAF/AA delegates Secret and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.3. All requests for the delegation of OCA will be forwarded through command IP
      channels to SAF/AAP, Director of Information Protection, 1720 Air Force Pentagon,
      Washington, DC 20330-1340, for processing.
          2.1.2.3.1. Address requests for original Top Secret authority to the Secretary of the
          Air Force.
          2.1.2.3.2. Address requests for original Secret and Confidential authority to SAF/AA.
          2.1.2.3.3. Only individuals in senior military or civilian positions (usually General
          Officer or Senior Executive Service level) at the first or second echelon of command
          carrying out a unique mission with responsibility for one of the eight subject areas
          prescribed by EO 12958, as amended, may be designated as an OCA.
          2.1.2.3.4. OCA is assigned to a position, not a person. OCA will not be delegated
          other than identified in paragraphs 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2 above. However, deputies,
          vice commanders, chiefs of staff and similar other subordinates of an OCA are
          empowered to act as an OCA when they assume the duty position of an OCA in an
          ―acting‖ capacity and have certified in writing that they have been trained in OCA
          responsibilities and classification principles in addition to the basic security training
          on the proper safeguarding of classified information and the criminal, civil, and
          administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails to
          protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure before exercising this
          authority.
      2.1.2.4. All requests will contain the full position title, functional office symbol, a
      detailed explanation of why the position requires OCA and an estimate of the annual use
      of the delegated authority.
 22                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   2.1.3. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of Air Force OCAs and post on the
   Information Protection Directorate Community of Practice (CoP). Periodically, SAF/AAP
   will request OCA validation from the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU IPMs.
       2.1.3.1. Personnel will submit requests for changes or new requests through IP command
       channels as they occur.
       2.1.3.2. See the Information Protection Directorate Community of Practice (CoP) web
       site for OCA training requirements
       2.1.3.2. (PACAF) ISPM is responsible to ensure OCAs receive training and for filing
       documentation annotating the training.
2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information
Security Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
   2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be
   expected to cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and
   that the interests of the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the
   Information Security Program to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who
   have been specifically delegated the authority to do so, have received training in the exercise
   of this authority, and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information
   [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
       2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that
       classification guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans
       or other memoranda.
       2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification
       decisions.
       2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs‘ decision must be rendered verbally due
       to the priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within
       seven days.
       2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
       2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony
       in courts of law concerning classification of national security information and be
       prepared to defend and justify their original decisions.
   2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or
   for, or is under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered
   for classification only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO
   12958, as amended.
2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating
in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material
consistent with the markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily
consists of a classified document or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all
cleared personnel can perform derivative classification.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   23


   2.3.1. Originating Agency‘s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an
   approved marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that
   have been created after October 14, 1995.
   2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any
   originally classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
   2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that
   contains OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following
   information in the Declassify On line:
        DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is
                               applicable)
        Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)

   2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date
   of the source document.
2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal
   violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person,
   organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of
   information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security [Reference
   EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD 5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security
   Guidance 16 April 2004].
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information
   requested under the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO
   12958, as amended, should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]
2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or
   unnecessarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or
   equivalent, staff agency chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over
   the information in question.
   2.5.2. (PACAF) Send copies of challenges to PACAF/IP.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain
   classified until a final resolution is reached.
2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7
   for sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate
24                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


  declassification instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the
  classified system, plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
     2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
     2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
     2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing
     address, organizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions
     regarding the classification guide.
     2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
     2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be
     downgraded, or not to be declassified.
     2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and,
     when useful, specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one
     level of classification will be annotated for each element of information.)
     2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the
     applicable classification category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
     2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
     2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic
     declassification pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification
     provisions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of
     information to be exempted from declassification to include:
         2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when
         citing the exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable
         statute, treaty or international agreement; and
         2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5
  2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
     2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification
     guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of
     their information. NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing
     classification guidance in other forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans,
     system protection guides, AFIs. In these cases, the applicable publication will be
     considered the guide and the publishing requirements in paragraph 3.3 still apply.
     2.6.2.1. (PACAF) PACAF OCAs shall coordinate Security Classification Guides
     (SCGs) with PACAF/IP.
         2.6.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) ISPMs will be the focal point for SCGs established by
         the NAF OCAs.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                               25


     2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4 below) their security
     classification guides to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information
     section:
         2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be
         taken when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or
         unprotected World Wide Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned
         approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed for such release
         must ensure that it is not susceptible to compilation with other information to render
         sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The search and data mining
         capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk management
         perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or
         unprotected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication
         according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any
         doubts, do not release the information.
     2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before
     final approval.
     2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as
     circumstances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major
     changes implemented by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force
     classification/declassification guides will be reviewed no later than 31 December 2005,
     and every five years thereafter.
  2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
     2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the
     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed
     the guide, the document will be sent to SAF/AAP who will forward it to the ISCAP for
     approval.
     2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/
     declassification guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center
     (DTIC) using DD Form 2024. DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
     2.6.3.2. (PACAF) Provide copies of DD Form 2024, DoD Security Classification Guide
     Data Elements, to PACAF/IP.
     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to
     SAF/AAP        at     SAF.AAP.workflow@pentagon.af.mil         and     AFDO        at
     AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
     2.6.3.4. (PACAF) Electronic versions of SCGs will be forwarded to PACAF/IP.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of all Air
  Force classification/declassification guides and will provide guides made available on the
  MOSIAC SIPRNET Community of Practice (CoP). Guides are also located on the DTIC
26                           AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


  web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC account. The URL for this is
  http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy
  (DoE) issue joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear
  weapons. The Air Force issues security classification policy for information relating to
  nuclear weapons. Most of these products are classified and users will require the appropriate
  security clearance before accessing them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE
  classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users forward requests for copies of these
  guides to SAF/AAP (1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through
  command IP channels. Requests must include the name, address, and phone number of the
  activity POC, and the POC‘s level of access. IPs will validate this information before
  submitting the requests to SAF/AAP. For all other Air Force or other agency guides, go
  direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD Index of Security Classification
  Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons classification guidance
  are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                            Chapter 3

               DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the
authority to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive
Number 1, Section 2001.21(3)(i).
   3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the
   duration of protection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO
   Directive Number 1, Section2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified,
   original classifiers will determine which of the following four declassification instructions
   will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declassification instruction that will result in
   the shortest duration of classification.
       3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to
       identify such a date or event;
       3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
   3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The ―Declassify on‖ line must include one of the
   following:
       3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
       3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995); or
       3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003);
       or
       3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
       3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).
3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD
or FRD are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date.
RD must be reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents
containing FRD prior to release.
3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force
activities that possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years
old or older should have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec
2006.
   3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force
   Declassification Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3
   of EO 12958, as amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old
   or older as of 31 December 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have
   permanent historical value. The Air Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web
 28                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm). It is critical that records management and
   information security personnel work together to ensure that requirements of both are met on
   classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or Federal Records
   Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year
   that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the
   exemption categories (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved
   through the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security
   classification/declassification guide. (See paragraph 2.6 and Attachment 7.) The Air Force
   has an approved list of exemption categories (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan);
   however, the specific item must still be annotated in the security classification/
   declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For original
   classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than ―25X1-human,‖ is permitted on the
   ―declassify on‖ line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event
   less than 10 years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking ―25X1-
   human.‖ This marking may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected
   to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the
   only 25X marking that does not require a date or event for declassification to be cited with
   the 25X marking.
3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough
   specificity to allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air
   Force Appellate Authority for MDRs.
3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for
conducting systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These
   records will be reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting
   declassification reviews for all other classified records.
3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as
amended, Section 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34,
and has been referred to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for
processing Air Force referrals. Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found
in the Air Force Declassification Plan.
3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it
has been approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   29


The same holds true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet
site that can be accessed by the public.
3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate
when the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be
properly protected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the
information and has authority over the information may downgrade information.

                                         MARKINGS

4.1. General. Air Force personnel who originally and derivatively classify information will
mark those products according to DOD 5200.1-R and the ISOO Marking Booklet. Material other
than ordinary paper documents, e.g., e-mail transmitted over a secure network, must have the
same information either marked on it or made immediately available to holders by other means.
[Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.1.]
4.2. Required Markings. Classified documents are required to have the following markings:
4.2. (PACAF) ISPMs will perform random sampling of classified documents to ensure the
required markings exist:
   4.2.1. The overall classification of the document.
   4.2.2. The agency, office of origin, and date of the document.
   4.2.3. The office or source document that classified the information.
       4.2.3.1. If it is originally classified, the document will reference the office. Example:
       CLASSIFIED BY: SAF/AAP.
       4.2.3.2. If a document is derivatively classified, it will reference the source document or
       the security classification/declassification guide. Example: DERIVED FROM: HQ
       USAF/A3/5 Memo dated 12 Jan 2008. Subj: Funding Problems.
   4.2.4. The reason for classification. Each originally classified document shall bear a concise
   statement of the reason for classification, determined by the original classifier. [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.4.] The classification categories are listed in EO 12958, as amended,
   Section 1.4; DOD5200.1-R Interim Information Security Guidance, Chapter 2, Para 1.
   Example: REASON: 1.4(e)
       4.2.4.1. If a document is derivatively classified, the ―REASON‖ is not required to be
       carried over to the derivative document.
   4.2.5. Declassification instructions, and any downgrading instructions that apply. Example:
   DECLASSIFY ON: 15 MARCH 2010
       4.2.5.1. If marking material that falls within one of the 25-year exemption categories, the
       correct marking will be as follows (NOTE: only derivatively classified documents will
       carry a 25X marking, with the exception of 25X1-human, which is allowed on originally
       classified documents):
                                DECLASSIFY ON: 25X5, 15
                                    February 2010
   4.2.6. Page and portion markings to identify the specific classified information in the
   document and its level of classification. When marking a document that is derivatively
   classified, ensure all markings and caveats are carried over from the source document to the
   derivative document.
   4.2.7. Control notices and other markings that apply to the document.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                 31


   4.2.8. When a document has been declassified or downgraded, the following markings shall
   be applied:
      4.2.8.1. The word ―Declassified‖ or the new classification if being downgraded.
      4.2.8.2. The authority for the action (the OCA‘s office symbol and the identification of
      the correspondence or classification instruction that required it).
      4.2.8.3. The date of declassification or downgrading action.
      4.2.8.4. The overall classification markings that appear on the cover page or first page
      shall be marked through with a straight line. If downgraded, the new classification will be
      written in.
      4.2.8.5. Page and portion markings will be remarked as required.
   4.2.9. Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be
   conspicuously marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the
   appropriate overall classification marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of
   the notebook, binder, folder, etc.
   4.2.10. (Added-PACAF) The Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO)
   guidelines will be used as a standard to mark classified documents. Additional guidance can
   be found on the SIPRNet CAPCO page at http://capco.dssc.sgov.gov.
4.3. Special Control and Similar Notices. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.9.]
   4.3.1. Working Papers. Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created
   in the preparation of finished documents and material. Working papers containing classified
   information will be:
      4.3.1.1. Dated when created.
      4.3.1.2. Marked with the highest classification of any information contained in the
      document and annotated ―WORKING PAPER‖.
      4.3.1.3. Destroyed when no longer needed.
      4.3.1.4. Protected IAW the assigned classification.
      4.3.1.5. Marked in the same manner as a finished document at the same classification
      level when transmitted outside the facility or if retained for more than 180 days from the
      original creation date.
   4.3.2. Communications Security (COMSEC). See AFI 33-211, Communications Security
   (COMSEC) User Requirements, for guidance on marking COMSEC documents and media.
   4.3.3. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical

   4.3.5. Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD). [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1,
   Subpart A.)
       4.3.5.1. Documents containing RD shall be marked:
                                          RESTRICTED DATA


         “This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy
        Act of 1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal
                                        sanctions.”
       4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:
                                       FORMERLY
                                    RESTRICTED DATA


        “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.
        Handle as Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic
                                   Energy Act, 1954”
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.
4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69,
United States Implementation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and
procedures contained in C-M(2002)49 and it‘s supporting directives take precedence, where they
conflict, over the guidelines expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.
4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification
   designations. Moreover, many foreign governments and international organizations have a
   fourth level of classification that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of
   unclassified information that is protected by law in the originating country and is provided on
   the condition that it will be treated "in confidence." A table of U.S. and foreign government
   classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify
   the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification
   designation has been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable
   U.S. English language designation, only the identity of the originating country need be
   applied to the document. Examples:
       A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked:
                                DEU SECRET.
       A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked:
                                GBR SECRET.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                33


   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a
   DOD Component on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked
   to identify the originating government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in
   confidence." Additionally, they shall be marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling".
   Example:
            A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte‖ would be marked:


                  FRENCH RESTRICTED INFORMATION Protect as:
                          CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling
      4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI
      provided in confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government
      unclassified information provided in confidence), such information must be classified
      under EO 12958, as amended. Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least
      equivalent to that required by the foreign government or international organization that
      provided the information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the
      protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following requirements
      shall be met:
          4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
          need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
          4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling
          instructions.
          4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.
4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
   4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature
   declassification or unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that
   contain FGI shall be marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
   (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to
   identify the classification level and the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the
   identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the cover or first page of the document
   shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
   INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI together with the
   appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
   maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
   4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification
   sources. If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line
   shall contain the marking "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the
   foreign government will be maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A
   U.S. document shall not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the
   document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that
   originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification
 34                            AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document to the originating
   foreign government.
   4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall
   be marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO
   information (e.g., NS). When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED
   information is included in otherwise unclassified DOD documents, the following statement
   shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the page containing the information: “This page
   contains (indicate NATO or country of origin) RESTRICTED information”. The
   restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The cover, (or first page, if no
   cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This document contains
   NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of source) and
   shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69".
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to
   identify the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided
   to a DOD component, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether
   they are restricted or provided in confidence.
4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original
classified audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include
footers/headers showing the applicable classification markings. However, the required
classification markings must be placed on the outside of the container and reel. All copies made
from the original tapes must include headers/footers that show the applicable classification
markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is not inadvertently erased
during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]
4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP
Media Classification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708,
Confidential ADP Media Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP
Data Descriptor Label, on removable information systems storage media. These are available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs
5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that
   precludes application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must
   be permanently marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions
   upon, and prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage
   media for classified systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or
   destruction, procedures for unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing
   takes place. Personally owned information systems storage media are prohibited in areas
   where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using
   them for storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     35


   accidental loss must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these
   procedures in the semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.
4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented
   Information, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of
   SCI. The Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the
   Dissemination of Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy
   provide criteria for release of intelligence to foreign officials.
4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep
2004, subject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
   4.10.1. ―REL TO‖ identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to
   be releasable based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign
   disclosure official or has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures
   and channels, to the foreign country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
   4.10.2. ―REL TO‖ cannot be used with ―Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals‖ (NOFORN)
   on page markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions,
   NOFORN takes precedence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
   4.10.3. The full marking ―REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international
   organization or coalition force tetragraph‖ shall be used after the classification and will
   appear at the top and bottom of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one,
   the first page and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. ―REL TO‖ must include
   country code ―USA‖ as the first country code listed. After the USA, country trigraphic code
   shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international organization/coalition
   tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
   4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code
   separated by a space, a lower case ―and‖ and a space. EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO
   USA, EGY and ISR.
   4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different
   from the countries listed in the ―REL TO‖ at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is
   releasable to all the countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked
   ―REL‖. EXAMPLE: (TS//REL)
   4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the
   overall ―REL TO‖ marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific
   countries/organizations listed alphabetically. EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is
   ‗SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.‖ However, the portion marking may be:
   (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that information contained in this
   portion is also releasable to Australia.
   4.10.7. ―NOFORN‖ is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW
   DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use
   the ―NOFORN‖ dissemination control marking on any document, including derivatively
 36                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   classified documents, without first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and
   that the marking is actually warranted.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   3166 trigraphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.
4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail)
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or
   unclassified, will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not
   be transmitted on the NIPRNET.
   4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of
   the e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified.
   Following this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
   Example: Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
   4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an
   unclassified network.
   4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the
   classification marking and the text.
   4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion
   marking. Use the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and
   subparagraphs.
   4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion
   markings. Indicate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated
   classification symbol in parentheses before the attachment icon.
   4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the
   signature block on the left margin.
4.12. (Added-PACAF)       Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE).
   4.12.1. (Added-PACAF) Computer monitors that process images and do not have the
   capacity to store or process classified information will not be labeled with SF Form
   706/707/708.
   4.12.2. (Added-PACAF) ADPE marked with SF Form 706/707/708 will be considered to
   contain classified information and will be secured IAW Chapter 5 of this instruction.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                  37

                                      SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for
safeguarding classified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording,
or removing, for any unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is
prohibited.
   5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing
   means to quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or
   transmission devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information
   increases the risk to that information.
   5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas
   containing Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial
   Wireless Devices, Services, and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global
   Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information
when required for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance
eligibility according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF
312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the
information. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator‘s approval
before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the originator of
the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1 of this AFI. [References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO
12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
   5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with
   Top Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented
   information to make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The
   verbal attestation must be witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who
   presides over the attestation and manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The
   procedures for personal attestation include:
       5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the
       Organization block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
       5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF
       312. The witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the
       Acceptance block.
       5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
 38                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   5.2.2. Confirm an individual‘s access level. The holder of the information must confirm
   valid need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access
   to classified information will confirm a person's access level by:
       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person
       signed the SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or
       supervisor. See paragraph 5.5 for further guidance.
5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access
(see paragraph 5.2). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for
ensuring their employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee‘s personnel
records. If they have not signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified
Information Nondisclosure Agreement (Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people
on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through JPAS prior to sending the signed form for
retention. NOTE: When the employee‘s access level is passed to another office or activity, that
office or activity can assume the employee has signed one.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will
   retain the NdAs for 50 years.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21,
       Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4723.
       5.3.1.2. For AFRC and ANG members, to HQ ARPC/DPSFR, 6760 E. Irvington Place,
       #4450, Denver, CO 80280-4450.
       5.3.1.3. For retired flag or general officers or civilian equivalents receiving access under
       the provisions of AFI 31-501 and who do not already have a signed NdA in their retired
       file, ISPMs send NdAs to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMR, 550 C St., W, Suite 21, Randolph AFB
       TX 78150-4723.
       5.3.1.4. For Air Force civilians, to the servicing civilian personnel office:

         approving the request.
     5.4.1.3. The authorizing official will coordinate the processing of the NAC request with
     the nearest Air Force authorized requester of investigations.
     5.4.1.4. Individuals with approval must sign an NdA before accessing information. Upon
     completion of access, individuals must sign an AF Form 2587, Security Termination
     Statement.
  5.4.2. Congress. See AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress, for guidance when
  granting classified access to members of Congress, its committees, members, and staff
  representatives. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.1]
  5.4.3. Government Printing Office (GPO). The GPO processes and confirms their
  personnel‘s access. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.2]
  5.4.4. Representatives of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). See AFI 65-401,
  Relations with the General Accounting Office, for access requirements. [Reference DOD
  5200.1-R, C6.2.2.3.]
  5.4.5. Historical Researchers. AFHRA OL-A/HOR is the authority for granting access to
  historical researchers on behalf of the Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO). [Reference DOD
  5200.1-R, C6.2.2.4.]
     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be
     processed only in exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access
     will be granted to the researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available
     declassification processes (i.e., the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access
     clearly supports the interests of national security.
     5.4.5.1. (PACAF) Request for classifed access by historical researchers will be
     coordinated through the installation historian office and PACAF/HO.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the
         access. The application will fully describe the project including the sources of
         documentation that the researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation
         security forces office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC
         according to AFI 31-501.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                41


         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves
         access, the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and
         manuscript(s) for security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure
         the documents do not contain any classified information and, if so, determine if they
         can be declassified. Send the SF 312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified
         information will not be removed from government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
             5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is
             possible. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in
             the months before the end of the original agreement.
             5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
             5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential
             information but does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP
             information. Access to Top Secret or SCI information is not authorized.
             5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO,
             AFHRA, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
             5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating
             offices in the Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing
             by the originating offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the
             researcher to secure this approval.
  5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making
  positions to which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon
  departure from office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S.
  Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information they
  originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that was addressed to them while serving in their
  official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.5.]
     5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the
     interests of national security;
     5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4 of
     this AFI;
     5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force
     OCA has classification jurisdiction;
     5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the
     custody of the NARA; and,
     5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual‘s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit
     any notes and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that
     the documents do not contain classified information or to determine if any classified
     information should be declassified.
  5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information
  regarding the release of classified information in litigation.
 42                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


   5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1 above. [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.2.2.7.]
   5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of
   classified information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international
   organizations only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting
   classified information to foreign governments.
   5.4.9. (PACAF) Request for authorization to disclose information to non-US organizations
   or individuals will be forwarded to PACAF/IP.
   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These
   individuals need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or
   JPAS. (see paragraph 5.3.1.3).
5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD
and DOD contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security
clearance information unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
5.5. (374AW)Coordinate all visit requests from civilian contractors with 374 AW/IPO. Do
not allow civilian contractors access to classified information until the visit request, DD Form
254 and other industrial security-related documentation has been coordinated with 374 AW/IPO.
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee
   requires access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the
       office to be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE
       Form 5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted
       Data. Also see paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority
   for visits to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel,
   including DOD contractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff
   agency chiefs receiving a visit request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government,
       process the visit request according to AFI 16-201.
5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for
guidance on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in
personal or commercial articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general
publication or distribution.
5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders
allow access under the rules of the originating agency.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                 43


5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with
   Top Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These
   procedures ensure stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our
   most critical and sensitive information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and
   disposes of such administrative records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
      5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or
      equivalents, and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch
      Top Secret material establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control
      Officer (TSCO), with one or more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff
      agency chief will notify the installation ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the
      names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form143, Top Secret Register Page, to account
      for each document (to include page changes and inserts that have not yet been
      incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or equipment to include
      IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs must either
      describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach a
      list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost
      or stolen. EXCEPTIONS:
      5.8.1.1. (PACAF) ISPMs will be responsible to ensure Top Secret Control Officer
      (TSCOs) receive training. TSCOs must be appointed in writing and ISPMs will maintain
      copies of the appointment letters.
      5.8.1.1. (374AW) Units or agencies having a need to store top secret material must
      contact 374 AW/IPO prior to or immediately after receiving the information. The 374
      AW/IPO will train all TSCOs.
          5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret
          messages kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30
          days. Instead, use message delivery registers or other similar records of
          accountability.
          5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don‘t use AF Forms 143
          as a receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts
          suffice for accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims
          Records Disposition Schedule. NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long
          as all of the required information is included in the information system.
      5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
          5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover
          Sheet, as the disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret
          material. Each person that accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the
          form prior to initial access.
          5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several
          hundred documents) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the
          material. NOTE: This applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and
          appropriately cleared personnel identified on an access roster.
44                          AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


     5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
     chiefs:
        5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret
        material in the account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in
        TSCOs. These officials must be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of
        the TSCA being inventoried. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top
        Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies resolved, and its status is correctly
        reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
        5.8.1.3.1. (PACAF) ISPMs will monitor annual inventories of Top Secret
        documents and will provide oversight for discrepancies noted on the reports.
        Collateral Top Secret documents courtesy stored in SCI Facilities are not exempt
        from annual inventories or during ISPRs.
        5.8.1.3.1. (374AW) Annual inventories or audits of all top secret material will be
        conducted during the month of January or whenever the TSCO changes. Provide a
        copy of the inventory report and corrective action taken (if any) to 374 AW/IPO.
        5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the
        inventory report.
        5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are
        maintained with the account.
        5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material
        in repositories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents
        and material be limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated
        below. If account discrepancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff
        agency chief must determine if the random sample percentage method will suffice or
        if a higher percentage inventory will be accomplished. If the higher percentage
        inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will increase by no less than 20 percent.
           5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret
           documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top
           Secret documents.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                 45


              5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret
              documents.
      5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability
      requirements prescribed by the AFSAPCO.
      5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring
      Top Secret material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
      5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy
      of the main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the
      register page and disclosure record will be faxed along with the document to the
      addressee. The addressee will sign and return them immediately to the sender for
      inclusion in the TSCA.
   5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for
   internal control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution
   system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
   5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked
   to do so by the originating activity.
   5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for
   receipting requirements.
   5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims
   Records Disposition Schedule.

Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
      5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret
      Cover Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2
      above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
      5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF
      Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through
      the Air Force Publications Distribution system.
      5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services
      Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage
      rooms.
   5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault
   may preclude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
 46                             AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or
generates classified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified
material is stored appropriately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each
working day and record them on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if
the container was not opened that day. The ―Checked By‖ column of the SF 702 does not require
end-of-day documentation. Activities that are continuously staffed will establish local procedures
to provide for daily security checks. Document those daily security checks on the SF 701. Note:
Additional security and safety checks may be added in the blanks on the SF 701. All security
containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (374AW)SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, and SF 702, Security Container Check
Sheet, will be maintained for 90 days.
5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
   5.11.1. SECAF and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from
   designated working areas. Requesters send requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing
   Secret and Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C63.7.2.]
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up
   the classified container and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]
   5.11.4. (Added-PACAF) ISPMs will conduct inspections of residential secured storage
   containers for compliance with DOD 5200.1-R and Chapter 5 of this instruction.
5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed
   awareness program ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers,
   and billeting staff are aware of the availability.
   5.12.1. (PACAF) Installation Commanders will establish in writing, an authorized
   overnight repository for classified information.         ISPMs will ensure this approved
   memorandum is posted at operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry control points,
   Security Forces Control Centers, and the billeting office.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-
   processing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security
   container and the in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.
   5.12.3. (Added-374AW) . The in-transit storage repositories for transient classified
   material are the 374 OSS/OSAM (Bldg 703), the 374 AW/CP (Bldg 315), and the USFJ/J34
   (Bldg 714). If the transient classified material is too large for these places, it may be stored
   at the 730 AMS/TROCS (Bldg 79). As a last resort, it may be stored at the DCSS-YO (Bldg
   97) if it meets the criteria in the Defense Courier Service Manual.
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                 47

   supervisors of operations dispatchers, passenger services personnel, base entry controllers
   and billeting personnel will ensure those personnel know the location of in-transit storage
   repositories listed in paragraph 5.12.3 above.
5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of
   meetings, conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall
   be limited to appropriately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor
   locations. Auditoriums, assembly halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public
   gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be used for a classified meeting at which
   Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even though it is located on a portion
   of the contractor‘s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
       5.13.1.1. (Added-374AW) . Units or agencies that hold classified meetings will:
           5.13.1.1.1. (Added-374AW) .      Develop procedures to ensure all protection
           requirements outlined in DoD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.8, and other classified
           protection requirements are met.
           5.13.1.1.2. (Added-374AW) . The unit or agency conducting the meeting, with
           assistance from that unit and agency‘s security manager, will ensure all classified
           information is properly protected prior to, during and after the meeting.
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the
   need to establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally,
   secure conference or classified training facilities are only established at locations where
   frequent classified meetings or forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store
   classified information, secure construction requirements are not mandated. However, if
   installation commanders or their designees determine the local threat and security
   environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
   5.13.2. (PACAF) ISPMs will be the focal point for facility approval for classified meetings
   and conferences on the installtion.
   5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of
   Classified and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for specific guidance.
   5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or
   equivalents, and staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based
   on mission sensitivity and threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical
   Surveillance Countermeasures Program for additional guidance.
5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are
routinely carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum
standards for the protection of classified material and components while minimizing the impact
on aircrew operations. The following minimum standards are established to provide cost
effective security of classified material and components and to ensure detection of unauthorized

  5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it
  may be necessary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or
  vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be
  constructed IAW DOD 5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to
  preclude unauthorized access. Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an
  appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified material/information
  within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall
  be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure
  to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. The nature of the
  classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may preclude the use of
  cover sheets.
     5.18.2.1. (Added-374AW) . To add security in-depth, all security containers will be
     stored in lockable rooms or offices. Security containers not located in lockable rooms or
     offices must be under the constant surveillance of cleared personnel.
  5.18.3. (Added-PACAF) The ISPM, in concert with the Base Civil Engineer, will inspect
  vaults, secure rooms, cargo security cages, and munitions storage facilities to ensure

                                            Chapter 6

                        TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
   6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand
   carrying classified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in
   critical situations. Whenever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for
   relaying the data, e.g., mail through secure channels or through approved secure electronic
   means. Authorizing officials must assess the risk before authorizing the hand carrying of
   classified material. Some factors to consider during the risk assessment process are:
   6.1.1. (374AW) Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs are the approval authority for
   hand-carrying classified information aboard military and commercial passenger aircraft.
       6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the
       chances of the material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing
       AFOSI office should be able to assist in determining the risks associated with the
       environment.
       6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the
       United States if the information was compromised.
       6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight
       layovers, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military
       installation or other government facility.
   6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop
   computers are an especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When
   using laptops to handcarry classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks
   are prepared according to paragraph 6.6.3 In addition, as required for all classified material,
   couriers must take special care to ensure laptops and disks are kept under constant
   surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
   6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation
   Policy. SAF/AAP establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and
   transportation of classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation
   commanders approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and
   procedures provide adequate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel
   may acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC
   information and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201,
   AFI 33-211, AFI33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010                                                 59


   6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to
   owners of other agency information to request permission to release the information outside
   the DoD [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]
6.2. Transmission and Transporting Top Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.2.]
   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via
   electronic means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8 [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier
   service [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport
   classified material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]
      6.2.3.1. Transporting classified material through or within countries hostile to the United
      States or any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic
      pouch. Personnel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local
      military postal office.
6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
   overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
   DOD Components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
   Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico when overnight
   delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the conditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R,
   paragraph C7.1.3.3, have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.3.]
   6.3.2. (PACAF) Recipients of packages sent via the GSA contract courier (i.e., FedEx
   Corp) must protect packages as Secret until determined otherwise. Overnight express
   delivery service is not authorized for classified information delivery to Guam.
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract
      overnight delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery
      of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when
      overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service.
      However, classified COMSEC information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled
      Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified
      material.
 60                            AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures
      that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend.
      However, the security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the
      receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared
      person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that
      he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.4. (374AW) Units or agencies will only allow personnel with security clearances
      to receipt for registered mail. All registered mail must be protected as classified
      information until opened.
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.
   6.3.3. For more information on protective security service carriers see DOD 5220.22-R,
   Industrial Security Regulation, AFI 31-601, AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air
   Force Materiel, and AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.8.]
   6.3.4. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Secret information via
   electronic means from the supporting Information Assurance office.
6.4. Transmitting Confidential Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.4.]
   6.4.1. Since first class mail bearing the ―Return Service Requested‖ notice is an option for
   transmitting Confidential material, recipients must protect it as Confidential material unless
   they determine the contents are unclassified. EXCEPTION: Official Mail Center (OMC) and
   Activity Distribution Offices (ADO) will comply with the provisions of DOD 4525.8-M/AF
   Sup.
      6.4.1.1. The outer envelope or wrapper shall be endorsed with ―Return Service
      Requested‖ instead of ―POSTMASTER: Do Not Forward‖.
6.5. Transmission of Classified Material to Foreign Governments. [Reference DOD 5200.1-
R , C7.1.5.]
   6.5.1. Also see AFI 31-601 and AFPD 16-2, Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign

   envelope will be marked with the unit address only.

Section 6C—Escort or Handcarrying of Classified Material

6.7. General Provisions [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.]
   6.7.1. Authorization [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]
       6.7.1.1. The unit commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief authorizes appropriately
       cleared couriers to handcarry classified material on commercial flights. See DOD 5200.1-
       R, paragraph C7.3.1.2., for required documentation and this AFI, paragraph 6.1.1, for a
       cautionary statement regarding handcarrying classified material.
       6.7.1.2. The unit commander or equivalent, staff agency chief, or security manager
       authorizes appropriately cleared couriers to handcarry classified material by means other
       than on commercial flights.
   6.7.2. Security managers or supervisors brief each authorized member handcarrying
   classified material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.2.]
   6.7.3. Each Air Force activity or unit that releases classified material to personnel for
   handcarrying: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]
       6.7.3.1. Maintains a list of all classified material released.
       6.7.3.2. Keeps the list until they confirm all the material reaches the recipient‘s activity
       or unit.
6.8. Documentation. Unit commanders or equivalents, staff agency chiefs, or security
managers issue and control DD Form 2501 (Safeguard), Courier Authorization (available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution system), for handcarrying classified material by
 62                              AFI31-401_PACAFSUP_374AWSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2010


means other than on commercial flights. This doesn‘t preclude the use of a courier authorization
letter for infrequent courier situations. EXCEPTION: Documentation is not necessary when
handcarrying classified information to activities within an installation (i.e., Air Force installation,
missile field, or leased facilities within the local commuting area). NOTE: Account for DD Form
2501 (Safeguard) as prescribed in AFI 33-360, Volume 2, Content Management Program-
Information Management Tool (CMP-IMT) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C73.2.2.]
   6.8.1. (Added-374AW) . Use the DD Form 2501 when hand carrying classified material
   outside the legal (controlled) boundaries of the installation or installation entry gates. Unit
   commanders or security managers are authorized to issue the DD Form 2501. Security
   managers should develop issue and control procedures for the DD Form 2501 and include
   these procedures in their OI. OIs should include, as a minimum, accountability, issue and
   storage procedures (DD Forms 2501 must be stored in a lockable container or file cabinet).
   Each issued DD Form 2501 must have a 374 AWVA 31-5, Bilingual Attachment to DD
   Form 2501, attached to its reverse to meet the requirement of the Status of Forces
   Agreement. Use 374 AWVA 31-6, Bilingual Exemption Notice, when transporting classified
   material off military installations. When hand-carrying classified materials on-base during
   increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCON) Charlie and Delta, which implement
   inspection points at facilities, units may use either the DD Form 2501 or a courier
   authorization letter signed by the unit‘s commander or security manager. During FPCON
   Normal, Alpha and Bravo, no courier documentation is necessary when hand-carrying
   classified information to activities within the installation.
   6.8.2. (Added-374AW) . During emergency situations that occur during increased FPCON
   (e.g., relocation of unit or group control center), personnel who need to transport or relocate
   classified information do not need a DD Form 2501 or a courier authorization letter.
6.9. (Added-PACAF) See Attachment 8 for sample courier authorization letter, and
Attachment 9 for sealed package exemption notice.

                        SECURITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

Section 8A—Policy

8.1. General Policy. Effective information security training is a cornerstone of the Air Force
Information Security Program. All Air Force personnel need information security training
whether they have access to classified information or not. All Air Force personnel are
individually responsible for protecting the national interests of the United States. All security
infractions and/or violations must be immediately reported, circumstances examined and those
responsible held accountable and appropriate corrective action taken. Commanders or
equivalents, and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring that personnel are
knowledgeable and understand their responsibility to protect information and resources deemed
vital to national security.
   8.1.1. (Added-374AW) . Security managers will outline in an OI the unit‘s security
   education plan. Security education will be based on unit or staff agency mission, functions
   of the activity and the degree of involvement with classified material. Develop the unit‘s
   security education plan using training standards outlined in the Air Force Information
   Security Training Standard. As a minimum, units will conduct initial and quarterly training
   (on cleared and uncleared personnel) on information security related subjects and document
   training conducted. Documentation will include who was trained, when training was
   conducted and what training information was provided. 374 AW/IPO will assist in
   developing or providing training material for use by the security manager.

    ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
   9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to
   minimize any possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify
   appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
   security incidents. Further, if the security incident leads to the actual or potential compromise
   of classified information, a damage assessment will be conducted to judge the effect that the
   compromise has on national security.
   9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall
   be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the
   suspected disclosure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and
   disciplinary action to be taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]
9.2. Definitions.
   9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as
   defined in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
       9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
           9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure
           of classified information.
           9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the
           requirements of this order or its implementing directives.
           9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as
           amended.
       9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the
       requirements of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
   9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have
   had access to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals
   with the appropriate security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
   9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official
   concludes that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a
   result of a security incident.
9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving
information systems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to
begin an evaluation on the impact of the incident to national security and the organization‘s
operations. If COMSEC material is involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC
Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Volume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).

materiel through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).
9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and
   security incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if
   they contain classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable
   unauthorized individuals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In
   the latter case, the documentation must remain classified until the information has been
   retrieved and appropriately safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports
   pertaining to security incidents that have occurred in the information system environment
   when the system has been appropriately purged and the correspondence does not contain
   other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the
       classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.

   9.8.1. Personnel who learn of a security incident must immediately report it to their
   commander or equivalent, supervisor, or security manager who will in-turn report the
   incident to the servicing ISPM by the end of the first duty day.
       9.8.1.1. (Added-374AW) . Unit security OIs will outline procedures to follow upon
       discovering a security incident. Procedures will include securing the classified
       information, reporting the incident to the ISPM NLT the end of the first duty day
       following the security incident, securing reporting procedures when classified
       information is unsecured and accessible to uncleared personnel and appointment of
       investigating officials.
   9.8.2. After assigning a case number beginning with calendar year, base, and sequential
   number for tracking purposes, the ISPM will:

security, a specific degree of protection against unauthorized disclosure, coupled with a
designation signifying that such a determination has been made.
Classification/Declassification Guide—a documentary form of classification/declassification
guidance issued by an OCA that identifies the elements of information regarding a specific
subject that must be classified and establishes the level and duration of classification for each
such element.
