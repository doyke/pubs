       posting of an armed entry controller whenever the Battle Staff/CSS/SRC formation has been
       directed. The off-going guard will brief the on-coming guard on command post entry control pro-
       cedures prior to being relieved of duty. Additionally, as new ECP guards come on duty, they must
       notify the EAC controllers and receive an evacuation procedures briefing.
           4.6.1.1. Personnel not possessing the proper restricted area badge must be signed into the CP
           by an authorized escort official and released into custody of an appropriate WOC member.
    4.7. CONTINUITY. All members will develop and maintain position continuity books with job
    descriptions, checklists, and responsibilities for individual CSS/SRC positions. These books will be
    written with the inexperienced member in mind and must address all requirements associated with
    each position.

5. INFORMATION FLOW
    5.1. GENERAL. The success of the WOC is dependent on the rapid flow of information. Whenever
    possible, secure communications will be used.
    5.2. BATTLE STAFF DIRECTIVES (BSDs). DRAGONSLAYER generates BSDs. Once approved
    by the Senior Battle Staff, they are passed to the IME for distribution via TBMCS or by the next avail-
    able secure means to the UCCs. Upon receipt of a BSD, each UCC must ensure the widest degree of
    dissemination. There are two types of BSDs: pre-positioned and situational.
       5.2.1. Pre-Positioned Battle Staff Directives (Pre-BSDs). Provide established guidance for all
       exercises and contingencies. 35 FW/XPP is the wing OPR for Pre-BSDs. Each organization must
       ensure current Pre-BSDs are maintained at their respective CSS/SRC and UCC positions.
       5.2.2. Situational BSD. BSDs distributed throughout the duration of an exercise or contingency to
       address Battle Staff actions. BSDs activate Pre-Battle Staff Directive (Pre-BSDs) and provide fur-
       ther guidance for personnel in response to changes in readiness conditions or contingencies. Time
       critical BSDs such as LERTCON or Force Protection Condition changes will be coordinated
       through the Senior Battle Staff only before release to ensure a timely base response.
    5.3. WOC EVENT REPORTS OR 35 FW form 107, WOC Event Report . These reports are gener-
    ated by CSS/SRC members as notifications and are received from UCCs or any agency that becomes
    aware of an incident warranting WOC action or consideration. CSS/SRC members will use these
    reports to record information of interest to the DRAGONSLAYER, MADDOG, CP, or Senior Battle
    Staff. The originator may retain one copy and the remaining copies are taken to the DRAGON-
    SLAYER for coordination and dissemination.
35FWI10-203 7 JUNE 2007                                                                                   7


  5.4. POST-ATTACK REPORTS. Upon receipt of damage or casualty information, attack reports must
  be up-channeled to the WOC as soon as possible. Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment
  (SALUTE) reports and Post-Attack damage and casualty reports will be used.
     5.4.1. SRC Responsibilities. The information contained in an attack report is critical to base sur-
     vival and recovery operations. It is critical that this information is communicated accurately and
     quickly to the other SRC representatives and to the Battle Staff.
     5.4.2. UCC Responsibilities. UCCs must report as quickly as possible after an attack. This allows
     the WOC representatives to prioritize and begin recovery operations quickly. If all of the desired
     information is not available, file an initial attack report and follow it up with update reports as the
     situation becomes clearer.
  5.5. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. It is the responsibility of all agencies within the WOC to
  pass voice and TBMCS information. Dissemination of hardcopy traffic is the responsibility of the
  IME and CSS/SRC members. Information is disseminated in the following ways:
     5.5.1. Classified e-mail is available via the TBMCS network and should be used whenever possi-
     ble. LERTCON attainment information is classified and will be relayed between UCCs and the
     SRC via secure means.
     5.5.2. Classified Waste. Outdated classified must be destroyed as needed to reduce build up and to
     expedite WOC evacuation security sweeps. All paper products will be treated as if it were classi-
     fied and be shredded. No paper will be thrown in the trash bins.
  5.6. SITUATION REPORTS (SITREP). The Battle Staff will accomplish SITREPs IAW AFMAN
  10-206, Operational Reporting and AFI 10-206 PACAFSUP1, Operational Reporting.
  5.7. SITUATION BRIEFING (SITBRIEF). MADDOG is the OPR for putting together the SIT-
  BRIEF. SRC/UCC representatives are responsible for updating their respective slides. All SITBRIEF
  slide briefings are due to MADDOG and the IME NLT 45 minutes prior to the scheduled brief time.
     5.7.1. Periodic Situation Briefings. These briefings occur after the initial SITBRIEF and occur as
     specified by BSD. As much as possible, subject area experts should brief their own material. In
     their absence, the MADDOG may cover their information. The briefing should be presented
     quickly and tailored to inform oncoming WOC personnel of the current base status.
     5.7.2. Generation Briefing. The Generation Briefing will be given at R-hour 1+30. The purpose is
     to disseminate guidance and information in accordance with the planned generation.
     5.7.3. Deployment Concept Briefing. Time will be announced during the initial SITBRIEF. It is
     scheduled IAW the Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) and presented by the 35 FW Installation
     Deployment Officer (IDO). The purpose of this briefing will be to inform the Battle Staff and unit
     commanders of upcoming deployment operations.

    natural disaster. Emergency evacuation will be directed by the Battle Staff commander.
    7.2. PRE-EVACUATION PREPARATION. Preparation for evacuation includes pre-packaging of all
    material to the greatest extent possible. Each position must keep a relocation case, with an inventory
    of all materials to be placed within it, at each position.
    7.3. EVACUATION RESPONSIBILITIES. All WOC personnel must be knowledgeable on evacua-
    tion procedures, checklists, emergency exits and primary/alternate evacuation methods.
       7.3.1. SRC LRS Representative. When the Battle Staff/SRC/CSS is formed, 35 LRS will make
       provisions to expeditiously transport the WOC personnel to the alternate command post during
35FWI10-203 7 JUNE 2007                                                                                  9


     evacuations. 35 LRS will accomplish this by having two 44-passenger buses on a 15-minute
     response, on-call basis. If vehicles are pre-positioned, they should be parked nose out next to
     building 755 (35th Maintenance Squadron, Wheel & Tire Facility) in the Office of Special Inves-
     tigations parking lot. Vehicles must be locked and the keys are to be left with the SRCD. Any devi-
     ations from this plan must be coordinated through the SRCD.
     7.3.2. SRC CS Representative. Send a 35 CS telephone/radio/network technician to the alternate
     command post to ensure all communications equipment is operational. Operational checks will be
     performed on a regular basis until the Alternate Command Post is manned.
     7.3.3. 35 SFS. Ensure the alternate command post, rally points/facilities, and pre-positioned vehi-
     cles are swept by 35 SFS personnel and a military working dog. Part of the sweep will include
     checking to ensure the facilities are locked, or occupied and ready for evacuations. 35 SFS will
     sweep rally facilities and pre-positioned evacuation government owned vehicles every 12 hours as
     directed by the local threat or threat working group.
     7.3.4. MOC. Ensure the primary rally facility, Bldg 755 (Wheel and Tire Shop), is available and
     that the WOC has keys or codes to enter the facility. 35 MXS must provide keys and/or codes to
     the SRCD.
  7.4. EVACUATION PROCEDURES. When the actual evacuation occurs, secure all laptops and clas-
  sified material not relocating in the SRC safe. All chemical and field gear must be carried or worn as
  directed. The SFS SRC Representative will call the WOC entry controller (PAPA 1) and Security
  Forces Control Center (SFCC) to ensure dissemination of the evacuation type and time initiated. Per-
  sonnel will normally exit the building in teams, keeping a low profile (i.e. minimum noise, lights, etc.)
  and taking evasive action as necessary enroute to the rally facility and relocation vehicles.
     7.4.1. Base Notification. SRC members will notify their corresponding UCCs of the relocation to
     the alternate command post by directing them to "Implement Pre-BSD 131." Pre-BSD 131 details
     the relocation procedures and provides a means of notifying the base that the Battle Staff/CSS is
     relocating without stating so in the clear.
     7.4.2. Transportation. Once the vehicles are swept and underway with 35 SFS escort, drivers will
     proceed to the alternate command post and follow safety directives to the degree dictated by mis-
     sion requirements. Drivers and passengers will respond to all MOPP and alarm condition changes.
     7.4.3. Alternate Command Post Entry. Upon arrival at the alternate command post, each team will
     offload separately to avoid congestion. Each team leader or accountable officer will be checked
     for identification and authorization to enter using a validated Entry Authorization Listing. The
     team leader or accountable officer will be responsible for vouching for every member on his/her
     team and should check each one as they come in with the guard. The entry controller will verify
     USAF Restricted Area Badges if time permits.
