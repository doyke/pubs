                                             Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides guidance for commanders to operate their ranges safely,
effectively, and efficiently to meet operational needs while taking appropriate account of
potential effects on the environment and the surrounding communities.
1.1. (ANG)Purpose. This supplement further defines Air National Guard (ANG) specific
requirements and responsibilities to manage ANG ranges in addition to guidance in Air Force
Instruction 13-212. All ANG ranges have significant land mass constraints and/or operational
limitations. Due to these limitations, a high level of operational oversight, command and control
is required to protect these national training assets.
1.2. Scope. This instruction applies to all USAF-operated ranges except Space Launch Ranges
and those dedicated to small arms training addressed in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
Outside the United States, USAF-operated ranges will comply with this instruction, DoDD
4715.12, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Operational Ranges Outside the
United States or host-nation rules whichever is more restrictive. On non-USAF operated ranges,
the range user will confirm suitability of weapons delivery or ordnance use with the range
operator and comply with this instruction, other service published procedures or host-nation
restrictions, whichever is more restrictive.
1.3. Description of Ranges. A range is an area established for operations, training, research
and development, and test and evaluation of military systems, personnel, tactics, munitions, and
explosives.
     1.3.1. Primary Training Range (PTR). PTRs are normally located in close proximity to their
     primary users, accommodate basic to intermediate air-to-surface, electronic combat (EC), or
     air-to-air training and consist of a limited land area (typically 5,000-100,000 acres). Typical
     PTRs contain target arrays, threat simulators, and weapons scoring systems and provide
     Class A, B, C and/or D service. (See paragraph 1.4.6).
     1.3.1. (ANG) ANG managed/operated bombing ranges are service Class "A" ranges. The
     266th RANS provides electronic combat support at the Mountain Home Complex.
     1.3.2. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and
     Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and AFI 99-109, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB)
     Test and Evaluation Resource Planning, govern specific DoD Test & Evaluation activities.
     Although MRTFB activities function primarily to enable DoD test and evaluation support
     missions, they may also perform other missions (operations, training, R&D, etc.). USAF
     MRTFB activities include: The Air Force Flight Test Center (Edwards AFB); the Air
     Armament Center (Eglin AFB); the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR); the Utah Test
     and Training Range (UTTR); the 30th Space Wing; and the 45th Space Wing.

                                           Chapter 3

                                     RANGE PLANNING

3.1. Planning for Ranges. Accomplish range planning to ensure future training and testing
needs are met. When planning indicates that a major change is required, the Major Actions
Planning Process must be followed as outlined in paragraph 3.3.
3.2. Comprehensive Range Planning. Comprehensive Range Planning is accomplished to
identify shortfalls in current and projected capabilities and guide sustainable range development
to close the shortfalls. A hierarchy of plans addressing the ten investment areas for ranges will
guide future development while identifying and integrating range requirements. The detailed
planning cycle timeline is published in the Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision.
   3.2.1. Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision. AF/A3O-AR will publish an AF
   Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision to identify service-wide needs, consolidate the inputs
   of the MAJCOMs, CTRs, TIPP and other services and agencies as applicable and guide
   MAJCOM- and range-level planning. AF/A3O-AR will initiate a review process for the AF
   Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision document every four years in conjunction with the
   development and release of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-AR participates in two planning forums that provide unique test and training
   community inputs to The AF Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision.
       3.2.2.1. Combat Training Range (CTR) Executive Reviews. HQ ACC/A3A, with the
       assistance of AF/A3O-AR, SAF/AQPW, AAC/WMR and 84th CBSG, will conduct
       semi-annual executive-level reviews of all CTR programs covered by PMD 0111(35)/PE
       0604735F/0207429F Air Combat Training Systems. ACC, AETC, AFRC, AFSOC, ANG,
       PACAF, and USAFE will send senior voting representatives (normally O-6) to the CTR
       Executive Reviews. AF/A3O-AR, AAC/WMR, 84th CBSG, and SAF/AQPW participate
       as non-voting members of the CTR Executive Reviews. The CTR Executive Reviews
       provide a forum to discuss ongoing programs, advocate new requirements, and vote on
       funding priorities. The voting members (as delegated by their parent MAJCOMs) have
       approval authority on CTR funding allocations and program validation. They also
       provide requirements direction to AAC/WMR, SAF/AQPW, and 84th CBSG. ACC/A3A,
       in conjunction with the user, AAC/WMR, and 84th CBSG prepares the necessary
       requirements documentation to implement user-prioritized programs. Day-to-day "user"
       management of CTR programs is the responsibility of ACC/A3A per the Seven-
       Command CTR Charter and the "total force" concept.
           3.2.2.1.1. CTR Program/Procurement of Instrumentation, Threat Systems, and
           Test/Training Range Engineering Development. CTRs need improvements to
           increase combat realism, aid tactics development, and enhance day-to-day training.
           This includes realistic simulations of the projected threat environment, as well as
           instrumentation for: readiness training, Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E),
           tactics development and evaluation, command and control, safety, and real-time flight
           monitoring. These systems provide precise monitoring, reconstruction, and debriefing
           of aircrews after single and multiple aircraft training missions, including reaction to
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                             21


         air defense threats and live or simulated ordnance exchanges. A continuous
         modernization program is required to ensure CTRs meet these requirements.
         3.2.2.1.2. Range Improvement Requirements. HQ ACC/A3A is the lead agency for
         range improvement requirements representing AETC, AFRC, AFSOC, ANG,
         PACAF, and USAFE. AMC will develop Mobility Air Forces (MAF) requirements
         and coordinate with the CTR. AFOTEC will coordinate on Combat Air Forces (CAF)
         requirements that need an OT&E input or may effect OT&E as well as Development
         Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Force Development Evaluation (FDE), JT&E, and
         Expeditionary Force Experiments (EFX). The members of the CTR Executive
         Reviews, AAC/WMR, 84th CBSG, and the test community should attempt to
         combine requirements and form partnerships to seek procurement synergy.
     3.2.2.2. Test Investment Planning and Programming (TIPP) Process. Test infrastructure
     is a key contributor to the test process. AFPD 99-1 states, ―The Air Force will operate,
     maintain, and improve test and evaluation facilities, including the Major Range and Test
     Facility Base (MRTFB) … to support US Air Force, Department of Defense, and other
     valid user requirements. In addition, the Air Force will continually evaluate test
     infrastructure requirements and capabilities to ensure essential Air Force needs are met,
     and to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense of excess test resources.‖
         3.2.2.2.1. The TIPP process governs all investments in the Air Force's test and
         evaluation infrastructure within the AF Improvement and Modernization (I&M)
         program elements (Major Test and Evaluation Investment and Threat Simulator
         Development) and identifies potential joint Service investment for funding under the
         Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP). TIPP is used to identify
         the most critical shortfalls in the test and evaluation community, develop alternatives
         to solve them, and deliver a corporate investment plan for budgeting and funding
         through the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. HQ
         AFMC/A3 manages the Air Force TIPP process to identify test resource investments
         needed to support military systems testing. Those investments that have possible
         multi-Service applicability may be referred to the CTEIP for funding IAW AFI 99-
         109.
  3.2.3. MAJCOM Ranges and Airspace Roadmaps. MAJCOMs will produce a Ranges and
  Airspace Roadmap approved by AF/A3O-AR. Each roadmap should have a ten-year
  planning horizon, support the Air Force Ranges and Airspace Strategic Vision, focus on the
  ten investment areas described in paragraph 3.2.4.1.1 and compare current and future mission
  needs against the current range capabilities to identify shortfalls. It will describe the
  MAJCOM vision for the future and the strategies to attain that vision. The roadmap will also
  provide tailored planning direction to each range to guide their comprehensive range
  planning. Roadmap development provides an opportunity for all MAJCOM organizations
  and staff to provide inputs, coordinate actions within the command and across the MAJCOM
  staff. MAJCOMs will coordinate the plan with all other MAJCOMs that it supports on its
  ranges to ensure their needs and concerns are addressed.
  3.2.4. Comprehensive Range Plans (CRPs). Each ROA will maintain a CRP for coherent and
  sustainable development that considers the interests of all organizations supporting or using
  the range. CRPs will be reviewed bi-annually and revised at least every four years or
22                                                AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


  whenever significant changes occur. MAJCOMs will review and approve all CRPs. CRPs for
  new ranges require additional approval of AF/A3O-AR (and AF/TE, for test and evaluation
  ranges).
     3.2.4.1. CRP Format. Each plan will consolidate the individual planning of all range
     support organizations. Each plan will include an executive summary, address the ten
     range investment areas and assess the situation, communicate a vision and formulate a
     strategy.
        3.2.4.1.1. Range Investment Areas. The main body of the plan is written for the
        technical person, details analysis of the investment areas and validates the
        requirements in support of the vision for the range. It culminates in a time-phased
        investment program to support each specific range objective to enable summarizing
        investments by FY, investment area and objective to support resource programming.
        Over time, strategy execution will be measured against the plan and documented in
        subsequent revisions to the CRP. The ten investment areas below are detailed in the
        Range and Airspace Strategic Vision published by AF/A3O-AR
            3.2.4.1.1.1. Land. This investment area includes all surface land and water areas

Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS) process detailed in AFI 13-201.
   3.3.1. Development of the Proposals. Proposal development will comply with the National
   Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347. Proposals can consider
   single (i.e. distinct) actions or numerous actions covered by an overarching plan (i.e.,
   Comprehensive Range Plans). NEPA requires proponents for all major federal projects to
   consider environmental impacts, prior to making an irrevocable or irretrievable commitment
   of resources (personnel, facilities or dollars). While NEPA does not require the decision-
   maker to choose the most environmentally advantageous alternative, it does require the
   decision-maker to make an informed decision and consider all potential impacts. Refer to
   AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as promulgated at 32 CFR Part
   989, for specific guidance. Range specific planning factors are listed on the RMAST wiki
   website under Range Construction and Maintenance.
   3.3.2. Airspace Establishment and Land Acquisition.
       3.3.2.1. Airspace. Before establishing a need for new airspace, proponents must ensure
       they comply with AFI 13-201, AFI 32-7061, and applicable FAA Orders & Directives.
       3.3.2.2. Land. Land acquisitions require lead times as long as 7 years. Proponents need
       to work through the Base Civil Engineer with the Unit/MAJCOM, SAF/IEI, and the AF
       Real Property Agency (AFRPA) to acquire land IAW AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real
       Property. Factors to be examined when considering the acquisition of land include
       confirmation that the proposal cannot be accommodated within or by modifying existing
       areas, and issues associated with procuring private land or withdrawing federal lands. The
       Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and Title 43, United States Code,
       Section 155-158, Engle Act, require Congressional approval for any public land
       withdrawal, reservation, or restriction of over 5,000 acres for any DoD project or facility.
       In addition, proponents need to prepare an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) for
       land acquisitions IAW AFI 32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate
       Transactions.
       3.3.2.3. Funding. If funding for range real estate is received in one allotment, acquisition
       for all lands should proceed immediately. If funds are received incrementally over
       multiple budget cycles, acquisition should proceed according to a plan that will obtain an
       initial operational capability at the earliest date. For example, a range complex consisting
       of a Class A and two Class C tactical range areas can be acquired in three increments.
       Funds from the first increment should be used to acquire lands providing the highest
       benefit to the Air Force. Each increment should provide an operational capability of its
       own.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                  25


       3.3.2.4. Other Agency Cooperation. Agreements with other federal, state, local, and
       tribal government agencies should be finalized and signed during the acquisition phase.
       In some locations, USAF ranges require liaison and cooperation with many agencies in
       connection with livestock management, fish and wildlife conservation, forest
       management, immigration and border control, irrigation development, etc. It is important
       that any issues effecting operations or safety be settled before the range activation date.
       Base commanders having parent command jurisdiction of an Air Force range must
       investigate and ensure liaison and cooperation with appropriate agencies of federal, state,
       local, and tribal governments. Refer to AFI 32-7060, Interagency and Intergovernmental
       Coordination For Environmental Planning for specific requirements. Coordination IAW
       Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, 14 July 1982, is
       required for any actions that might influence another agency's plans, programs, or
       projects.
           3.3.2.4.1. Additional information on coordination, outreach and interagency/
           intergovernmental agency cooperation can be found on the RMAST website/wiki.
   3.3.3. Moving or establishing a live munitions area is a Major Action. To do so, the ROA
   will accomplish a T/TSNS and will comply with the EIAP with the assistance of the parent
   MAJCOM.
   3.3.4. Closing or Transferring of Ranges. When declared excess to the range requirements
   by the ROA, land will be surface cleared in accordance with AF standards. The ROA will
   notify the supporting Civil Engineering organization with real property responsibility of the
   excess status for subsequent action to determine a new use and accomplish required
   clearance for the new use. It is Air Force policy to clear safe for the proposed future land use
   and issue Certificates of Clearance for excess ranges or ranges converted to other uses but
   remaining on the installation property inventory. The supporting Civil Engineering
   organization will ensure clearance IAW 6055.9-STD, excess declaration IAW AFI 32-9004,
   Disposal of Real Property and NEPA actions IAW 32 CFR Part 989, Airspace transfer IAW
   AFI 13-201 and disposition of government owned range equipment and facilities IAW with
   MAJCOM guidance.
3.4. National, Regional, and Local Range and Airspace Meetings. Actions involving use,
creation, modification, or transfer of military airspace/ranges generate significant public interest.
The Air Force must be prepared to address concerns raised at the local, regional, or national level
during the development of any airspace/range action. AFI 13-201 describes the various forums
that allow units, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF to focus on airspace/range issues and exchange
information and lessons learned in airspace/range development.
3.5. Planning Tools. Each range will maintain documents and graphical information used in
planning IAW AFMAN 33-363 to ensure that records remain available to range staff.
   3.5.1. Document Management System. Documents may be stored and indexed physically or
   electronically. If managed electronically, documents should be made available to all range
   users and supporters through secure means (request/reply or secure access).
   3.5.2. Geographic Information System (GIS). The most basic of systems would be hard
   copies of maps that describe the range’s attributes in each of the investment areas. Ideally,
   range geospatial data should be maintained in an accessible, relational database. The database
 26                                            AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


   of geospatial features should be readily accessed by the GeoBase web-based viewer
   application as well as the range management and scheduling tools.
3.6. (Added-ANG) Financial Planning Reporting Requirements. ANG Ranges will submit
copies of Fin Plans (due 1 July) and spending reports (due 15 Nov) annually to NGB/A3A.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                              27


                                           Chapter 4

                           RANGE OPERATIONS AND SAFETY

4.1. Range Operations. Range operations will be IAW this instruction, AFI 13-201, AFI 11-
214, T.O. 1-1M-34, Aircrew Weapons Delivery Manual, T.O. 1-1M-34-1, Aircrew Weapons
Delivery Manual (classified), aircraft specific weapons delivery T.O.s, aircraft specific AFI 11-
2MDS series, and Air Force Weapons School (AFWS) instructional texts.
4.1. (ANG)Range Operations. RCOs must be familiar with Joint Publications 3-09 Doctrine
for Joint Fire Support, 3-09.1 Joint Laser Designation, and 3-09.3 Joint Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures and Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for the Joint Application of
Firepower (JFIRE) for Close Air Support to ensure range procedures are compatible and
consistent with appropriate operational doctrine.
   4.1.1. Additional operating restrictions during range clearance and maintenance are
   contained in paragraph 7.6.
4.2. Written Agreements for USAF-Operated Ranges. The ROA will maintain a copy of all
agreements pertinent to their range and ensure they are readily available to the ROO and RCO.
   4.2.1. Domestic Users. The ROA or MAJCOM will conclude written agreements with any
   regular range user not identified in the range supplement. Written agreements are not
   required for limited use during exercises, deployments, evaluations, or inspections.
   4.2.2. Foreign Users. These agreements include the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
   Letter of Agreement (LOA), Host-Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA), Inter-service Support
   Agreement (ISA) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Letter of Offer and Acceptance. Each
   signatory ensures that these agreements meet the needs of the organization without
   compromising the mission and without obligating the organization beyond its intent or
   authority. Coordinate the draft agreement with the staff Judge Advocate General. If a conflict
   arises regarding one of these agreements, the ROA should resolve the issue at the appropriate
   level.
   4.2.3. Types of Written Agreements.
   4.2.3. (ANG) Memorandums of Understanding, Host-Tenant Support Agreements and other
   formal agreements between Air National Guard Units and other MAJCOMs/Services
   concerning range use will be forwarded to NGB/A3A for review.
       4.2.3.1. Memorandum of Understanding. A MOU is required for Air Force units to use
       weapons ranges belonging to another nation. Individual units normally author these
       MOUs. MAJCOM/FM, JA, and the State Department Mission in the host country review
       these MOUs for legal and financial implications.
       4.2.3.2. Letter of Agreement. Use LOAs to specify procedures at the local level, such as
       those between the operating agency and the controlling agency of the local airspace.
       4.2.3.3. Host-Tenant Support Agreement and Inter-service Support Agreement. When
       required, prepare an HTSA or ISA IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures.
       As a guide, an HTSA or ISA should be entered into when a unit from another service
       uses an Air Force owned or operated range more than 12 days per calendar year or
 28                                                   AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


       supporting the recurring use by another service is a significant portion of range
       utilization.
4.3. Joint and Shared Use of Ranges.
   4.3.1. Joint Use. Joint Use will be established by HTSA, ISA, LOA, license, or other written
   agreement between the Host range and joint user IAW AFI 25-201. All written agreements
   should ensure the ROA can terminate user activities detrimental to the range’s natural,
   cultural, or physical infrastructure and obtain compensation or redress.
   4.3.2. Shared Use. Shared use of ranges with non-DoD users is encouraged when it will not
   compromise public safety, nor detract from mission accomplishment, nor impair range
   operations in any way. In all cases, public access to live ordnance areas and other areas
   where hazardous activities occur is prohibited until they are decontaminated IAW DoD
   6055.9-STD or other appropriate standards determined by the DoD Explosives Safety Board,
   or meet the criteria set forth in paragraph 4.12.4. All visitors granted access to the range must
   be briefed on range safety IAW paragraph 4.13.4.3. Shared Use may be characterized as
   either Concurrent Shared Use or Non-Concurrent Shared Use.
       4.3.2.1. Concurrent Shared Use. Civil activities may occur concurrently with range
       operations provided human access is prohibited in the Hazard Area. Agriculture, grazing
       and timber management are examples of activities that are conducive to concurrent
       shared use. The ROA will determine suitability and manage grazing programs IAW AFI
       32-7064.
          4.3.2.1.1. Grazing Programs can be a complementary activity on USAF ranges.
          Grazing programs on Department of the Interior lands withdrawn for USAF use are
          generally the responsibility of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). An INRMP
          must be prepared for all ranges addressing all issues associated with natural
          resources.
          4.3.2.1.2. Other Commercial Activities. Air Force ranges may also offer other
          commercial uses such as timber management, agricultural out-leasing, and mining.
          Again, many of these programs are generally the responsibility of the BLM. The
          Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior manages the oil and gas
          exploitation on the outer continental shelf applicable to USAF over-water ranges.
       4.3.2.2. Non-Concurrent Shared Use. Civil use of range land and airspace may be
       allowed within the Hazard Area (exclusive of live ordnance areas) IAW paragraph
       4.12.4. Recreation and education programs are often compatible because many ranges
       encompass large airspace, land, or water areas and may contain significant natural
       resources, wild areas, historical sites, or archaeological sites. As custodian of this public
       property, the USAF has the responsibility to maintain it in the best manner possible
       consistent with the military mission. The INRMP will outline public access to natural
       resources. This plan is prepared in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
       the state fish and game agency. Additionally, the Cultural Resources Management Plan
       will manage and preserve sensitive areas while addressing public concerns.
4.4. Supersonic Flight. Supersonic flight restrictions within the U.S. National Airspace System
are contained in AFI 13-201. Overseas locations will comply with host nation rules.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               29


4.5. Flare, Chaff and Electronic Attack (EA) Employment. Unless further restricted by
MAJCOM or local supplements, flares will be employed IAW AFI 11-214, while Chaff and EA
will be employed IAW CJCSM 3212.02, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and
Canada for Tests, Training and Exercises and AFI 11-2MDS series instructions. This guidance
assumes use of current inventory flares and chaff, and an adequate environmental assessment of
action. The use of flare or chaff cartridges having significantly different characteristics
(pyrophoric flares or double squibbed chaff) is restricted to authorized test and evaluation
activities until their use is authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM.
4.5. (ANG)Flare, Chaff and Electronic Attack (EA) Employment. Minimum altitude will be
no lower than 1000’ AGL for employment of countermeasure flares.
4.6. Jettison Areas. All ranges will have an area within the Hazard Area designated for jettison
of ordnance and stores. The location of jettison areas and jettison procedures will be designed to
minimize the hazard to ground personnel and range structures as well as aircraft and aircrew.
4.7. Armament Safety Procedures. Prior to first release when carrying expendable ordnance
(live, inert, or training), final switch configuration for weapon release will not be accomplished
until the aircraft is in such a position that any accidental release will be contained within the
range. MAJCOMs will develop specific guidance for armament system configurations for
multiple passes. After completing final weapons delivery, each flight member will perform a
weapons system safety check. Refer to AFI 11-214, aircraft specific AFI 11-2MDS series
operating procedures, and individual range supplements for additional guidance.
4.7. (ANG)Armament Safety Procedures. During multiple pass operations; aircraft operating
on ANG range will abide by either their aircraft specific 11-2MDS operating procedures or the
local range supplement whichever is more restrictive.
4.8. Weapons Release Authority. Acceptance of weapons release authority incurs sole
responsibility for the safe release of ordnance.
   4.8.1. Terminology Conventions. To prevent miscommunication, the term ―cleared‖ will
   only be used when authorizing weapons release. For all other matters, ―approved‖,
   ―authorized‖ or any term other than ―cleared‖ will be used. The term ―continue‖ will be used
   IAW JP 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS) to
   acknowledge requests or indicate approval to proceed with an attack or action without
   providing clearance to release any ordnance yet.
   4.8.2. On Class A ranges, weapons release authority resides inherently with the RCO. For
   each pass, the RCO will authorize weapons release with a ―cleared hot‖ radio call unless
   release authority has been delegated. The RCO may delegate weapons release authority to a
   qualified flight lead, individual pilot, Forward Air Controller-Airborne (FAC[A]), JTAC or
   other briefed person by issuing an ―Authorized (flight lead, individual pilot, FAC[A], JTAC,
   etc.) Control‖ radio call. The RCO, who will remain in either the main or flank tower (or
   another MAJCOM approved location), retains overall range authority at all times and can
   withdraw release clearance or abort a release at any time.
   4.8.2. (ANG) Weapon Release Authority. (Added) RCOs primary responsibility is to
   ensure air and ground safety, regardless of cases where weapons release authority is
   delegated.
 30                                                  AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


       4.8.2.1. (Added-ANG) The RCO will ensure that any JTAC given release authority is
       current and qualified. All non-current or non-qualified JTACs must be under direct
       supervision of a qualified JTAC Instructor to be allowed release authority on the range.
   4.8.3. On Class B and C ranges, weapons release authority devolves hierarchically to the
   JTAC, FAC(A), flight lead, individual pilot or other briefed person who may then delegate
   the authority as desired.
4.9. Simulated Weapons Release Authority. Except during flight-lead or individual control,
to emulate the clearance procedures contained in JP 3-09.3, the weapons release authority should
issue a ―continue dry‖ radio call to signify authority to simulate weapons release.
4.10. Weapons Employment and Airdrop Operations.
   4.10.1. Do not employ weapons outside approved DoD SUA.
   4.10.2. The ROA will notify the public when a WDZ footprint will fall outside the lateral
   confines of the rangeland and will conduct a risk assessment to minimize the hazard to the
   public and non-DoD property.
   4.10.3. Except as noted below, ROAs will prohibit weapons employment unless an
   applicable WDZ Tool/SAFE-RANGE footprint, test footprint or surface danger zone has
   been applied to the target for the specific delivery platform, weapon and employment
   parameters. ROAs may expedite analysis by grouping targets together or combining aircraft
   type, weapon type, and tactics, as appropriate. Test footprints are not authorized for training
   missions, nor are applicable training footprints, by themselves, sufficient for test missions,
   but training footprints may be used as part of the ROA’s overall risk assessment.
       4.10.3.1. Where containment is software selectable, ROAs will apply SAFE-RANGE
       footprints, weapons danger zones and surface danger zones (SDZs) that provide the
       following containment of projectiles, fragments, debris and components as a minimum:
           4.10.3.1.1. Surface fires: 99.9999% (Expressed as 1:1,000,000 escapement for SDZs)
           4.10.3.1.2. Aviation-delivered gun ammunition: 99.999%.
           4.10.3.1.3. All other aviation-delivered ordnance: 99.99%.
       4.10.3.2. For test missions only, if the application of footprints would preclude the
       accomplishment of test objectives, the ROA, in conjunction with the test Safety Review
       Board (SRB) may authorize the use of a risk management policy. The ROA will perform,
       and the SRB must validate, a risk assessment to identify and minimize hazards consistent
       with test objectives. (See AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation)
       4.10.3.3. ROAs may continue to use legacy SAFE-RANGE footprints until the end of
       the sixth month following ACC/A3A’s official fielding of the applicable, successor,
       probabilistic WDZ Tool footprint.
   4.10.4. The WDZ Tool is the successor to the SAFE-RANGE Program. It creates
   probabilistic weapons impact footprints to help the ROA conduct safe range operations by
   defining aircraft-delivered WDZs per paragraph 4.12.4.1. The WDZ tool software identifies
   weapons impact point probabilities from a variety of platforms and parameters, providing an
   analytical foundation for sound and objective range planning and execution decision-making.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                             31


  Although similar to SAFE-RANGE, the WDZ tool is a joint-use range safety tool with a
  different hazard analysis methodology.
     4.10.4.1. WDZ tool methodology. The WDZ tool application methodology allows the
     ROA to identify possible target locations; modify allowable delivery ground tracks to
     eliminate or reduce hazards; identify the best location for range improvements; or design
     a new Impact Area/range. The methodology is based on WDZ footprints developed from
     a combination of actual weapon impact data and simulation results. A WDZ defines the
     minimum land required to employ a given munition safely, using a certain aircraft and
     delivery tactic, over a specific soil density and target type. Each WDZ footprint
     incorporates a probability distribution function (PDF), which provides the information
     necessary to perform a quantitative risk assessment and evaluate the relative risk of an
     identified hazard. See the RMAST wiki website for detailed application methodology for
     WDZ footprints for air-to-ground training operations.
     4.10.4.2. Training WDZ Footprints. HQ ACC/A3A is the lead USAF agent for procuring
     and modifying WDZ footprints except as noted below. Other MAJCOMs, services and
     foreign countries will fund their unique WDZ footprint requirements to include any costs
     for software licenses and equipment. MAJCOMs will coordinate with ACC/A3A at least
     6-9 months prior to the need date. Foreign countries will coordinate Direct Commercial
     Sales acquisition through ACC/A3A at least three months prior to the need date. For
     acquisition through the FMS Case, foreign countries will submit a Letter of Request
     through SAF/IA at least six months prior to the need date.
         4.10.4.2.1. Specialized Footprints. Specialized WDZ footprints are available from
         HQ AFSOC/A3TW for the MH-53 (Sidefire program) and the AC-130H/U (Gunship
         Safety Footprint program).
  4.10.5. Test Footprints. MRTFB ROAs are responsible for ensuring test footprints are
  developed and applied for test missions (See AFI 99-103).
  4.10.6. Precautions with expendable munitions. Aircraft with free-falling and/or forward-
  firing ordnance will not over fly or point their guns at manned sites with intent to expend or
  employ weapons. Aircraft with moveable guns, such as helicopters and AC-130 Gunships,
  will not point their guns at any manned site. Facilities where the risk of damage is deemed
  unacceptable must not be within the WDZ and/or weapon fragmentation and ricochet pattern.
  4.10.7. Weapons Employment Near Manned Equipment, Facilities and Sites. In general,
  manned equipment, facilities and sites, such as range towers, simulated threat emitters, and
  observation posts (OP), may be located within the hazard area during range operations,
  provided training ordnance is used and an operational risk assessment was conducted and
  approved by the ROA IAW paragraph 4.14. At a minimum, this will include a WDZ
  footprint analysis to assess the risk. The ROA must approve each proposal in writing. The
  ROA may delegate approval authority for short notice, temporary locations known to be in a
  low risk area. However, each location authorized by the delegated approver will be for one-
  time use only. Additional requests must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis and approved by
  the ROA.
  4.10.8. ROAs will approve Improved-Container Delivery System (I-CDS) deliveries only if
  the Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (PADS-MP) derived 3-sigma(99.987)
 32                                                  AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


   footprints for success and chute failure overlay only government owned, leased or otherwise
   controlled land with no non-mission essential personnel present and a Collateral Damage
   Estimate (CDE) acceptable to the ROA has been accomplished. ROAs will approve JPADS
   guided deliveries only if the PADS-MP derived point of impact, the 3-sigma(99.987)
   footprint for chute failure and the guidance failure footprint overlay only government owned,
   leased or otherwise controlled land with no non-mission essential personnel present and a
   Collateral Damage Estimate (CDE) acceptable to the ROA has been accomplished. If the
   load will or may transit non-Restricted Airspace during its fall (e.g. footprints are not wholly
   contained within restricted airspace), ROAs will also ensure the user complies with
   applicable rules contained in Federal Aviation Regulation 105.25.
      4.10.8.1. Equipment, facilities and mission essential personnel are permitted within the
      3-sigma(99.987) success, chute failure and the guidance failure footprints if the ROA has
      conducted and approved an operational risk assessment IAW paragraph 4.14. Because
      users utilize weather observation and drop sonde wind updates to revise their footprint
      analyses up until the time of delivery, ROAs should ensure the user is aware of the ROAs
      exclusion requirements and provided with the location of airspace/range boundaries and
      any personnel or equipment the ROA cannot or chooses not to allow in the footprint as
      part of his risk analysis.
4.11. Laser and Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) Operations.
   4.11.1. Laser Device Range Operations. The ROA will not authorize laser device operations
   unless the range is certified IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139, Laser Radiation Protection
   Program; American National Standard Institute Z136.1, Safe Use of Lasers; MIL HDBK
   828A, Laser Safety on Ranges and in Other Outdoor Areas; and American National Standard
   Institute Z136.6, Safe Use of Lasers Outdoors. Laser devices include designators,
   rangefinders, and illuminators/pointers.
   4.11.2. DEW Range Operations. Except as noted below, the ROA will not authorize DEW
   operations (to include, but not limited to, high-energy lasers, weaponized microwave and
   millimeter wave beams, explosive-driven electromagnetic pulse devices, acoustic weapons,
   laser induced plasma channel systems, non-lethal directed energy devices, and atomic-scale
   and subatomic particle beam weapons) unless the range is certified IAW applicable
   instructions, including DoD Instruction 6055.11, Protection of DoD Personnel from
   Exposure to Radiofrequency Radiation and Military Exempt Lasers; ANSI/IEEE C95.1
   Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
   Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz; AFOSH Std 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation
   (RFR) Safety Program; and AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
      4.11.2.1. Research and Test and Evaluation (T&E) activities involving laser
      devices/DEW (RF devices) do not require range certification if conducted IAW AFI 99-
      103, Test Management, AFMCI 99-103, Test Management, and (if applicable) AFRLI
      61-103, AFRL Research Test Management. Include the Base Laser Safety Officer on the
      Safety Review Board hazard assessment team. The SRB must show the control of the
      hazards from the beginning of operations commencing until termination. Hazards
      extending beyond restricted airspace or controlled government land must show the
      appropriate levels of federal and local coordination are in place. The Installation
      Commander is the final approval authority in lieu of formal range certification.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               33


     Additional expertise regarding Test and Evaluations can be obtained by contacting the
     711th Human Performance Wing (711HPW) or the Air Force Research Laboratory
     (AFRL).
  4.11.3. Range Certification. The ROA will request laser device range certification and/or
  DEW (i.e. RF device) range certification through the MAJCOM to the 711HPW/RHD.
  711HPW/RHD will report certification results to the ROA, base bioenvironmental engineer,
  and MAJCOM. DEW evaluations will be a collaborative effort between 711HPW/RHD,
  AFRL/RD, and any other agency needed to ensure foreseeable health and material safety
  concerns are considered. Laser range evaluations will be conducted by 711HPW/RHDO in
  collaboration with other agencies as needed to enable safe mission accomplishment.
  Evaluations will include an on-site survey, a review of proposed activities (weapons, targets,
  and tactics) and provide range-specific laser device or DEW safety footprints, safety
  recommendations, and systems approved for use on that range.
  4.11.4. Annual Reviews. The LSO and/or DEWSO will review applicable operations with
  the ROO/ROA annually and report findings as directed by AFRL.
  4.11.5. Certification Validity. Certifications expire at the end of the third fiscal year
  following issuance (e.g. a certification dated 3 Dec 2006 expires on 31 Sep 2010). Upon
  expiration, the certification must be reaccomplished IAW paragraph 4.11.3. Prior to
  expiration, the certification is valid for the equipment, aircraft, targets, tactics and weapons
  evaluated as long as the report’s recommendations are complied with, land and airspace
  boundaries remain unchanged, annual reviews are submitted within 45 days of the initial
  report’s anniversary and periodic removal of specular hazards for lasers meets the
  requirements in paragraph 4.11.6. The reinstatement or extension of a certification will be at
  the discretion of AFRL based on the scope of changes.
     4.11.5.1. (Added-ANG) An LSO (Laser Safety Officer) will be present during any
     operation/mission employing lasers (emitting ocular and/or skin hazard) or IR pointers.
  4.11.6. Laser Device and Laser DEW Range Operations. The director of Base Medical
  Services will be notified of the specific type of laser activity that will occur on the range.
  Range personnel will have a baseline eye exam before working in the laser hazard
  environment. During laser operations, all range personnel in the Laser Surface Danger Zone
  (LSDZ) will wear laser eye protection of appropriate optical density. Periodically remove
  specular hazards from the LSDZ surrounding the targets; reference guidance in MIL HDBK
  828A as necessary. Lasers will not be operated without the approval of the LSO and the
  ROO (RCO on Class A Ranges). The user will notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of
  laser activity. The ROO or RCO will acknowledge termination and the ROA will record the
  start and stop time of range periods when laser operations take place.
  4.11.7. Non-Laser DEW Range Operations. Non-Laser DEW systems will not be operated
  without the approval of the DEWSO and the ROO (RCO on Class A Ranges). The user will
  notify the ROO or RCO upon termination of DEW activity which will be acknowledged. The
  ROA will record the start and stop time of range periods when DEW operations take place.
  4.11.8. Ground Lasers. Ground lasers will not be directed at targets or Hazard Areas where
  the laser beam will terminate with an ocular hazard beyond the range boundary unless the
 34                                                  AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


   laser will exclusively transit SUA below FL600 and terminate in space without affecting
   non-participating satellites.
       4.11.8.1. (Added-ANG) ANG ranges will not allow use of a single source
       pointer/marker/laser as the sole method to identify or mark targets.
   4.11.9. Injury Reporting. Report laser injuries IAW AFOSH Standard 48-139 and
   radiofrequency radiation injuries IAW AFOSH Standard 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation
   (RFR) Safety Program.
   4.11.10. Laser Weapon, Device and DEW Certification on foreign and other U.S. service
   ranges. When USAF aircraft operate on another nation’s/service’s range, MAJCOMs will
   ensure procedures have been developed and are promulgated by the host nation/service prior
   to employing lasers weapons, devices and/or DEW systems. In the event procedures have not
   been developed, laser weapon, device and DEW operations will comply with this instruction.
4.12. Range      Access. MAJCOMs         and     ROAs      will    develop      procedures   for
permitting/deconflicting ground party and non-military activities on the range. (Note: Where the
terms Essential Personnel, Mission Essential Personnel and Nonessential Personnel are used
below, reference Attachment 1 of this instruction.)
   4.12.1. In addition to the signs required by AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
   Program (FOUO), ROAs will post approved signs (multi-lingual where required and as
   depicted on the RMAST Wiki site or MAJCOM-approved substitutes) on the boundary:
       4.12.1.1. Where crossed by roads, paths, trails, streams, streambeds or railways.
       4.12.1.2. At 200m intervals where roads, paths, trails or railways parallel the range
       boundary within 500m.
       4.12.1.3. At 1000m intervals in other readily accessible areas not included above.
   4.12.2. Signs are not required in areas that are not readily accessible on foot or with wheeled
   vehicles (e.g. mountainous terrain, swamps, lakes, etc.).
   4.12.3. Impact Areas. The Impact Area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the
   target(s) or designated mean point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance delivery. Public
   access to Impact Areas is prohibited at all times. Access to Impact Areas when the range is
   inactive will be limited to Essential Personnel. The Impact Area demarcation will be
   determined locally using ORM analysis IAW paragraph 4.14, but should normally be no less
   than either a) 500 feet from the center of a target or designated mean point of impact (DMPI)
   approved for live ordnance, or b) 300 feet from the center of a target or DMPI used solely for
   inert or practice ordnance.
   4.12.4. Hazard Areas. The Hazard Area is a composite of all WDZs and surface danger
   zones (SDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events against targets or DMPIs approved
   for actual ordnance expenditures. Public access to Hazard Areas is prohibited unless
   specifically authorized by the ROA. All live munitions must be accounted for in a Hazard
   Area or the applicable portion of a Hazard Area before public access is authorized. Access to
   active Hazard Areas is limited to Mission Essential Personnel. Access to inactive Hazard
   Areas is limited to Essential Personnel. Hazard Areas may be segmented based upon the
   targets, weapons, and tactics being utilized at a given time. If Hazard Areas are segmented,
   ROAs will ensure segment borders are readily identifiable by ground personnel. Access to
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                35


   Hazard Areas will be determined locally based on an ORM analysis per paragraph 4.14. On
   ranges where another agency controls Hazard Area access, the ROA will establish
   procedures to verify access control and inform that agency of potential hazards.
      4.12.4.1. Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ). The WDZ encompasses the ground and
      airspace for lateral and vertical containment of a user-determined percentage of
      projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching,
      and/or detonation of aviation delivered ordnance. This three-dimensional zone accounts
      for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, and broaches (resurfacing) of a specific
      weapon/munition type delivered by a specific aircraft type.
      4.12.4.2. Surface Danger Zones (SDZ). The ground and airspace designated for vertical
      and lateral containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris,
      and components resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation of weapon systems to
      include explosives and demolitions. See the U.S. Army’s Range Manager’s Toolkit
      Software for specific SDZ information.
   4.12.5. Danger Areas. The Danger Area is the composite area of the Hazard Area and all
   active LSDZs and active Directed Energy Weapons Danger Zones (DEWDZs). When the
   range is in use, access to those portions of the Danger Area comprised only of active LSDZs
   or active DEWDZs is limited to Mission Essential Personnel. When the range is not in use,
   access does not need to be restricted.
   4.12.6. Observation Posts (OPs). Notwithstanding paragraphs 4.10.7 and 4.12.3 to 4.12.5,
   OPs within a hazard area may be used by Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) or other
   briefed personnel involved in CAS/air-to-ground training. If training requires personnel to be
   inside Hazard Area or Impact Area, they must remain outside the Minimum Safe Distances
   for Ground Parties (Live Fire Training) Table (MSD-T) contained in AFI 11-214,
   Attachment 6. ROAs will conduct a risk assessment of the proposed OP or maneuver area
   prior to the ROA approving the OP’s use. All personnel will wear protective gear IAW AFI
   13-112V1, Terminal Attack Controller Training Program while inside the hazard area. For
   weapons not listed in the AFI 11-214 chart, TACPs or other briefed personnel must adhere to
   restrictions contained in paragraphs 4.12.3 to 4.12.5.
4.13. Range Safety.
   4.13.1. Visual Identification of Manned Equipment, Facilities and Site. To the maximum
   extent possible, equipment and facilities, manned or unmanned, that are not targets should
   include visual identification systems, such as high contrast paint (white or orange), IR
   strobes, etc. White or orange paint will not be used on any ―bombable‖ targets with the
   exception of strafe ―rags‖ or specific test targets where white supports test objectives.
   4.13.2. Range Demonstrations and Visitor Procedures. Each ROA must publish or reference
   procedures in their local range supplement to ensure positive control of all spectators. Visitor
   locations must be analyzed using the appropriate weapons footprint/hazard area program to
   ensure that spectators are not within the hazard area during operations. The ROA will have
   control in those limited cases where DoD personnel or contractors must be within the hazard
   area during operations to accomplish a specific mission-related task.
   4.13.3. Flight Safety.
36                                                 AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


     4.13.3.1. Airspace Activation. The RCO will activate range airspace with the local ATC
     facility or Air Traffic representative IAW local agreements between the ROA and the
     controlling agency. The request for activation should be timed (before a scheduled
     mission) to allow shared or joint users to clear the area and for the controlling agency to
     make internal adjustments.
     4.13.3.2. Weather Observation. The RCO will monitor weather conditions to include
     altimeter setting, temperature, ceiling, visibility and winds. Observations may be obtained
     from the local base weather station, command post, Automated Weather Observing
     System (AWOS), or ATC agency at least hourly, if the capability is not available at the
     range. The local weather detachment or command post should advise the RCO of any
     sudden adverse weather changes that might effect range operations or safety.
     4.13.3.3. Aircraft Accident Procedures. In case of an aircraft crash during Class A range
     operations, the RCO will initiate all necessary emergency actions. These include
     appropriate notifications, closing of the range, and assuming responsibility as the interim
     on-scene commander until the crash response team can be organized. During Class B and
     C range operations, the flight lead, individual pilot, FAC(A), JTAC or other briefed
     person will start the emergency actions, and if feasible, act as the interim on scene-
     commander. Investigations will be conducted IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
     Reports.
     4.13.3.3. (ANG) Aircraft Accident Procedures: Ranges will conduct an exercise, at a
     minimum annually. Document all training exercises.
         4.13.3.3.1. (Added-ANG) The ROA will be the approving authority for resuming
         range operations following an aircraft accident involving range operations.
  4.13.4. Ground and Explosive Safety.
     4.13.4.1. Fire Suppression Equipment. On Class A and manned Class B ranges,
     appropriate fire suppression equipment and personnel must be available to deal with local
     fire hazards. This capability may be provided through USAF, landowner, in-service
     civilian, independent contractor assets, or through agreement with another government
     agency such as the BLM or US Forest Service. Sufficient hand-operated fire suppression
     equipment must be assigned directly to the range for emergency use.
     4.13.4.1. (ANG) Fire Suppression Equipment: All Range personnel responsible for
     range fire response will be trained to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG)
     Equivalent Firefighter II IAW Table 12.1, AFI 32-7064.
         4.13.4.1.1. (Added-ANG) One responder per range will receive additional training
         in the following courses: S-131, Advanced Fire Fighting Training; S-133, Look Up,
         Look Down, Look Around and S-200, Initial Aircraft Incident Commander.
         4.13.4.1.2. (Added-ANG) Appropriate personnel protective equipment will be
         maintained as defined in NFPA 1977 and includes: Helmet, Goggles, Gloves,
         Protective Footwear, and Flame-resistant clothing. Fire shelters may also be required,
         see the requirements of your State forestry.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                37


          4.13.4.1.3. (Added-ANG) Ranges will conduct a Wildland Fire exercise with
          recurring training, at a minimum annually. Fire breaks will be maintained to ensure
          proper fire prevention and protections.
       4.13.4.2. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures will be readily available to the
       RCO for use during range operations.
       4.13.4.2. (ANG) Emergency Procedures:           These procedures will also be readily
       available to responding range crew.
       4.13.4.3. Safety Briefing Requirements. The ROA or contractor will provide and
       document initial and yearly ground and explosive safety briefings IAW AFI 91-202, to
       personnel assigned to operate and maintain Air Force ranges. Non-EOD personnel and
       augmenting EOD Personnel will receive appropriate training from the lead EOD unit
       (normally the associate EOD unit) before assisting in range clearance. Authorized visitors
       and personnel who infrequently visit the range must be briefed on range safety.
       4.13.4.4. Hazard Condition Watch. The RCO and all range personnel must continually
       watch for hazardous conditions such as trespassers, fires, bird activity conditions, etc.
       Range users will be notified immediately of any hazardous conditions on the range. If
       safety is in question, the RCO or other appropriate authority will stop range operations
       until the situation is remedied.
   4.13.5. (Added-ANG) Depleted Uranium (DU) (add to attach 1) and Cluster Bomb Units
   (CBU) are not authorized for use on any ANG range.
4.14. Operational Risk Management (ORM) Program. ROAs will implement an ORM
program for the range IAW AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines
and Tools. As a minimum, the ORM development team will consist of operations, civil
engineering, legal, public affairs, safety, and EOD. The ORM analysis examines geographic
features, frequency of EOD sweeps, type of ordnance authorized, employment tactics, type of
proposed joint or shared use, etc.
4.15. Night Operations.
   4.15.1. Aircraft reduced, covert and blacked-out lighting operations will not be conducted on
   Class A ranges unless the RCO is equipped with binocular, generation-III NVDs. NVDs will
   be tested, adjusted and focused by the RCO before use with (in order of preference) the
   Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye lane or equivalent tester. Perform NVD testing,
   adjustment and focusing procedures IAW appropriate T.O.s and MAJCOM guidance.
       4.15.1.1. (Added-ANG) If the RCO cannot positively determine that aircraft parameters
       exist for safe ordnance release, the RCO may delegate release authority. The RCO still
       retains responsibility for range safety.
       4.15.1.2. (Added-ANG) The Night Vision Goggle CBT program is available through
       NGB/A3A to assist in NVD training requirement.
   4.15.2. Range Lighting.
       4.15.2.1. Class A Range Identification Lighting. Class A ranges that support night
       operations must have available a distinctive pattern of lights visible by aircrews, with and
       without NVDs, to ensure positive orientation and identification of the range and target
 38                                                  AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


      area. These lights should be readily identifiable but not so as to distract aircrews during
      weapons delivery or wash out target locations. ROAs will ensure that no similar pattern
      of lights exists near the range that could be misidentified as targets or the Impact Area,
      but cultural lighting inside or outside the range boundary may serve as a portion of the
      distinctive pattern of lights.
      4.15.2.2. Class B Range Identification Lighting. Class B ranges that support night
      operations will have lighting as described above unless the ROA has determined that the
      lighting is not required based on a documented, ORM analysis (based on range size,
      remoteness, etc.)
      4.15.2.3. Target Lighting. Lighting for the specific purpose of illuminating the target is
      only required on ranges that support users accomplishing unaided visual deliveries. If
      required (or desired by other users), target lighting may be accomplished using
      incandescent lights, lanterns, or flares. Lights and lanterns should be NVD compatible or
      reduced in intensity to produce the minimum halo around each light when viewed
      through NVDs. Every effort should be made to prevent the target from appearing as a
      light with a halo to allow positive target identification.
      4.15.2.4. Range Facility Identification.
          4.15.2.4.1. Range Tower and Routinely-Manned Facility Lighting. Lighting is
          required on all routinely-manned range facilities and range towers to facilitate
          positive identification by aircrew. Proper management of tower lighting is important
          to maximize performance of NVDs used by range personnel. Tower lighting (interior
          and exterior) should be minimized to those necessary to conduct operations and all
          unnecessary lights should be extinguished or taped over. NVD compatible lighting is
          highly recommended. Consider moving tower, routinely-manned facility and
          obstruction strobe lights to locations that will best support night operations.
          4.15.2.4.2. Other Manned Locations. Other manned locations (such as OPs, visitor
          locations, vehicles, etc.) will, as a minimum, mark their location by any means
          described in JP 3-09.3 for ―friendly marking‖ that facilitates positive identification by
          aircrew.
          4.15.2.4.3. (Added-ANG) ANG target lighting will be a steady (not flashing, strobe,
          etc.) style light. Manned sights will be marked with flashing and/or strobe lights.
          Range boundaries, if marked, will also be marked with flashing or strobe lights.
   4.15.3. IR Pointers and/or Lasers. A single, steady IR pointer will not be used as the sole
   means of target identification. If using an IR pointer to mark targets, either the target or
   friendly terminus of the pointer must be positively verified by another means (snaking,
   friendly location marking, etc.). Do not lase unprotected personnel within the laser’s
   Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD). When ground based lasers/designators are used
   to designate targets, attack headings within 10° of the laser designator to target line (safety
   zone) are prohibited and run-in headings are restricted to a 50° cone on either side of the
   safety zone.
4.16. Communications Requirements. The ROA will submit all normal communications
capability requirements to the Base-Level Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager
(STEM-B) for system planning. Consult AFI 33-101, Communications and Information
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               39


Management Guidance and Responsibilities for planning guidance. Test-specific systems on
MRTFBs may be obtained by local acquisition methods.
   4.16.1. Class A, B and C ranges will have reliable point-to-point communications with the
   parent or using base and manned sites on the range. On Class A ranges, the range control
   tower will have redundant communications capability with the flank tower(s) and operations
   building(s). All parties or individuals must maintain two-way voice contact with the main
   tower, range office, and/or parent base while in the Hazard Area. Portable or mobile radios
   may be used for backup communications and to maintain contact with personnel in the
   Hazard Area.
   4.16.2. Class A, B and C ranges will have ground-to-air radios to communicate with aircraft
   on the range. Primary systems will normally be ultra high frequency (UHF) radios, but very
   high frequency (VHF), or frequency modulation (FM) radios are authorized at ranges where
   all users are similarly equipped. On Class A ranges, the RCO will have a backup,
   independent radio. Provision of dual, multi-band radios should be considered to maximize
   mission flexibility and safety monitoring capability. Class B ranges, if staffed, must have the
   capability to communicate with the aircraft to provide scores.
      4.16.2.1. All UHF, VHF, FM and Land Mobile Radios (LMR) voice frequencies being
      used on range will be recorded at all times.
      4.16.2.2. The RCO will ensure that all recorders are working properly. Each recording
      will contain the range name, date, and time. Recordings containing records of any range
      incident will be kept and secured until released by the investigating agency.
      4.16.2.3. All aircraft utilizing the range will monitor Guard frequency.
      4.16.2.4. Aircraft using UHF, VHF, or FM radios on the range will utilize range assigned
      UHF, VHF, or FM frequencies for primary operations.
      4.16.2.5. (Added-ANG) Range Control Officers will monitor Guard Frequency and will
      transmit on UHF/VHF guard frequencies as appropriate.
   4.16.3. Communication Operations. Range personnel will normally operate all
   communications equipment used on range. Assign communications personnel as radio
   operators only when special conditions warrant.
   4.16.4. Intra-flight communications. All intra-flight communications should be
   accomplished on the assigned range frequency using standard terminology to allow safety
   monitoring by the RCO.
4.17. Range Operations Support.
   4.17.1. Supply. The ROA should establish procedures with the parent or servicing base
   supply organization to obtain materials for range operations, as well as salvage and disposal.
   When required, establish a separate supply section at the range to administer all supply
   activities.
   4.17.2. Vehicles. Use of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) vehicles in contract
   operations should be kept to a minimum per AFI 24-301, and Federal Acquisition Regulation
   (FAR) Part 45 § 304, Providing Motor Vehicles.
 40                                                   AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


   4.17.3. Utilities. The ROA will ensure ranges are provided the utilities (gas, water, electric
   and sewer) required to enable range operations. Commercially provided services should be
   used when available, suitable and cost-effective.
   4.17.4. (Added-ANG) ANG Ranges support both day and night operations and weekend
   operations to meet using unit training requirements.
   4.17.5. (Added-ANG) Some ranges, which are geographically separated from their host
   unit, must complete range vehicle and equipment maintenance functions.
   4.17.6. (Added-ANG) All ranges will maintain emergency generators sufficient to operate
   all utilities required for flight operations in the event of commercial power outage.
4.18. (Added-ANG) Unmanned Aircraft System Operations.
   4.18.1. (Added-ANG) RCOs shall ensure briefings are conducted to include lost link
   procedures, lost communication procedures, use of UA Zones and UA Operating Areas.
   4.18.2. (Added-ANG) RCO qualifications for use of Class 1,2 and 3 unarmed UAS
   incapable of delivering ordnance, firing lasers or engaging in hazardous activity will be IAW
   AFI 13-212 para 2.5.29.
4.19. (Added-ANG) UAS Procedures. The following procedures will be applied at all ANG
managed ranges. Local procedures will at a minimum address the areas below and be developed
using the following guidance:
   4.19.1. (Added-ANG) All UA pilots/operators will comply with RCO instructions.
   4.19.2. (Added-ANG) Deconfliction of UA and other manned traffic will be accomplished
   by use of altitude restrictions, visual holding points with specific lateral and vertical limits,
   use of ground observers or other locally determined procedures.
   4.19.3. (Added-ANG) The UA mission commander/operator shall advise RCO of initiation
   and completion of flight operations.
   4.19.4. (Added-ANG) Radio check between UA pilot/operator and RCO will be conducted
   prior to operations.
   4.19.5. (Added-ANG) UA pilot/operators will report all in-flight emergencies to the RCO
   as soon as possible.
       4.19.5.1. (Added-ANG) If primary radio communications between the UA
       pilot/operator and RCO are lost, UA pilot/operator or RCO will be notified immediately
       via designated alternate communications method. Failure to establish or maintain radio
       communications between UA pilot/operator and RCO will require termination of UA
       operations.

                   ELECTRONIC COMBAT TRAINING OPERATIONS

5.1. Electronic Combat Training Operations. Electronic Combat (EC) Training Operations
facilities provide a realistic electronic threat environment for aircrew training through the use of
Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) threat emitter simulators.
These facilities also provide Electronic Combat support for composite force training, unit
exercises, unit gunnery competitions, normal training missions, and higher HQ exercises or
inspections. To fulfill these requirements, EC threat equipment and operating procedures must
closely parallel those of the anticipated enemy threat systems.
   5.1.1. Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS). ESSs are normally located near instrumented MTRs,
   MOAs, and/or Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) and only require a small
   land area for equipment location. An ESS has the capability to provide mission debriefings
   detailing individual aircrew or large force analysis/feedback on the effectiveness of ECM and
   threat avoidance procedures.
   5.1.2. Electronic Combat Ranges (ECRs) are collocated with ranges or in close proximity to
   MOAs, MTRs, and other SUA. All ECRs have the capability to provide analysis/feedback on
   the effectiveness of package or individual aircrew ECM and/or threat avoidance procedures.
   ECRs provide a limited or robust EC training capability and consist of multiple
   geographically separated threat emitters coordinated to simulate an Integrated Air Defense
   System (IADS). Mobile emitters are used to provide scenario flexibility.
   5.1.3. EC Personnel Training. To provide a realistic threat environment for aircrew combat
   training, ECR/ESS electronic threat operators will have a working knowledge of EC doctrine
   and employment concepts.
       5.1.3.1. Training Programs. Management criteria, administrative practices, and training
       policies required to conduct a comprehensive ECR/ESS training program will include
       academics and practical application in live and simulated environments. ECR/ESS
       personnel should be familiar with applicable MAJCOM training events and requirements
       defined in AFI 11-2MDSv1s and Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking Messages.
       5.1.3.1. (ANG) ANG Ranges will provide basic to advanced electronic threats as
       required by units in accordance with range capabilities.
       5.1.3.2. Responsibilities. ROAs are responsible for the selection and written designation
       of instructor personnel who will conduct site training for government personnel. The unit
       training officer/site manager is responsible for developing the unit training programs,
       training schedules, quarterly and annual unit training plans, and lesson plans, and is the
       unit approving authority for all unit-developed training courses or programs. For
       contractor run operations, the contract must specify the minimum training requirements.
5.2. Electronic Combat Equipment Management. EC range equipment consists of SAM and
AAA emitter/simulators, Smokey SAM training rockets and associated EC threat systems (See
Attachment 1 for emitter/simulator definition). Reference the RMAST Wiki website for special
equipment and systems used to simulate enemy threats, or AFI 99-109 for threat system
configuration management under test auspices as a MRTFB.

   5.2.1. Requests for Threat System Additions, Reallocation or Modification. IAW AFI 10-
   901, Lead Operating Command--Communications and Information Systems Management,
   HQ ACC is the designated lead command for all requests for new/additional range threat
   emitters, simulators, and systems. Development of new threats systems will be approved by
   the CTR Executive Review. The affected MAJCOMs will mutually agree upon requests for
   reallocation of threat systems and AF/A3O-AR will arbitrate any disputes. See AFI 99-109
   for test procedures.
   5.2.1. (ANG) NGB/A3A is the validating agency for new or additional threat systems for
   ANG range inventory. The originating ROA will validate the requirement with NGB/A3A.
   The request must include the number and type system required, mission requirements,
   frequency authorizations and confirmation of maintenance facility, funding and personnel to
   adequately support the requested system.
   5.2.2. Requests for Disposition of Equipment. No emitter/simulator will be deactivated,
   transferred, or decommissioned without MAJCOM approval. All deactivation/decommission
   and final disposition requests will be approved by the parent MAJCOM and HQ ACC with
   AF/A3O-AR arbitrating any disputes.
   5.2.2. (ANG) NGB/A3A is the approval authority for deactivating or decommissioning any
   ANG electronic threat asset. NGB/A3A will provide disposition instructions for all ANG
   electronic threat equipment.
   5.2.3. Equipment Inventory and Configuration Control. HQ ACC/A3A will develop and
   maintain a system that accurately inventories, tracks equipment, and documents the
   configuration of threat emitters and simulators.
5.3. Radio Frequency Spectrum Issues. ROAs will identify the frequency spectrum required
for range operation and coordinate requirements with the appropriate Installation Spectrum
Manager. The ROA will ensure that a frequency assignment has been obtained prior to using any
RF emitting equipment.
5.4. Electronic Warfare (EW) Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG). The EW
PIWG is co-chaired by the Range Threat Systems Program Office (SPO), ACC/A3AR, and
ACC/A6OF IAW AFI 21-118, Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and
Maintainability (R&M). The primary goals are to interact with and receive feedback from
equipment users, jointly establish priorities for future efforts, develop solutions to R&M
problems, and provide updates concerning on-going efforts.
5.5. Electronic Scoring Site / Electronic Combat Range Activity. ROAs will make every
effort to provide scores/feedback for requested EC activity. These shall be documented and
delivered in a mutually agreed upon format.
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                               43

                    TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Reporting Requirements. AF/A3O-AR in conjunction with the MAJCOMs will develop
and maintain an AF range utilization database to track range use, as well as usage data on
electronic threat, scoring, and instrumentation feedback systems.
6.1. (ANG)Reporting Requirements. ANG ranges will submit monthly utilization reports no
later than 10 workdays following the reporting period IAW the format and procedures
established by NGB/A3A.
   6.1.1. Classified Data. If required, submit classified information separately from unclassified
   data.
6.2. Range Utilization Reporting. Utilization reporting requirements will be directed by
periodic publishing of a ―Range Utilization Tasking Memo‖ which can be obtained from the
library on the USAF RMAST website.
6.3. Expended Munitions Tracking. IAW Title 40 CFR, §266, Military Munitions, DoDD
4715.11, Environmental and Explosives Safety Management on Operational Ranges Within the
United States, and DoDD 4715.12, ROAs will maintain records of all expenditures (types,
quantities, locations, using organization, and estimated dud rates) of ammunition and explosives
for each target. ROAs will maintain those records as required by AFMAN 33-363.
6.4. Range Clearance Report. This report is a detailed report of clearance events and will
precisely identify the areas that have been cleared and include the number of people and the
amount of money and material used to accomplish the work. When closing or transferring ranges
the range clearance report will be attached to the Certificate of Clearance which becomes an
official document certifying that all dangerous and explosive materials reasonably possible to
detect have been removed.
6.5. RAMPOD Configuration Management System. System inventory, configuration and
operational status accounting, utilization, and maintenance data collection are accomplished
using the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability Logistics Engineering Support System for
Pods (RAMPOD) which can be accessed at https://rampod4.robins.af.mil/. The RAMPOD
(G100) data collection system is a PC-compatible, database system that is used to track asset
location, movement (deployment), configuration, utilization, and maintenance status. Field
units/contractors are required to update the database system to reflect any changes in location,
configuration, or maintenance status of ACTS equipment and associated support equipment
(automated test sets, containers, etc). This system provides visibility into the disposition and
configuration of these assets to all levels of command. AFMC and ACC (CAF Lead Command)
provide cooperative insight/oversight for the data management system. The RAMPOD system
policies and procedures apply to CAF, AETC, AFRC, and ANG units utilizing ACTS pods.
   6.5.1. Purpose. RAMPOD provides a viable means to collect and report the necessary data to
   maximize ACTS mission capability and sortie effectiveness, reduce the cost of ownership,
   manage system configuration inventory, and compile reliability and maintainability factors to
   support ongoing product support and improvement initiatives. RAMPOD provides regularly
44                                                  AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


  updated and verified inventory, status, and maintenance data for users at all levels of the Air
  Force community.
  6.5.2. Responsibilities. RAMPOD receives funding through its own PMD and PE 27040F.
  Direction for implementation of RAMPOD is provided in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
  Equipment Maintenance Management and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
  Utilization Reporting. MAJCOMs will provide direction to field units by establishing
  procedures and contractual vehicles to ensure data is submitted to RAMPOD as required.
  WR-ALC/ITM will collect maintenance data for Reliability and Maintainability (R&M),
  warranties, and other information as deemed necessary to function as the system of record for
  Air Force pods.
  6.5.3. Policy. ACC/A3A will work day-to-day issues and any additional changes to
  approved plans for asset transfer. AF/A3O-AR will arbitrate any unresolved differences.
  Under no circumstances will units move system equipment either on a temporary or
  permanent basis without documentation in the RAMPOD and appropriate resource
  management system.
  6.5.4. Temporary Transfer. Units may coordinate temporary (no transfer of ownership) inter-
  unit equipment loans (lateral support) to fulfill contingency requirements. Temporary loans
  will be annotated by the lending unit in the RAMPOD database NLT the date of transfer and
  all transfers will include projected return dates. Shipping costs will be the responsibility of
  the gaining unit. Pods will be returned in the same maintenance status as they were received.
  6.5.5. Permanent Transfer. Units requesting additional system equipment or related support
  equipment to fulfill mission requirements on a permanent basis (transfer of ownership) will
  attempt to resolve these requests inter-MAJCOM. The coordinated request will be forwarded
  to ACC/A3A. Shipping costs will be the responsibility of the gaining unit. Additionally, the
  CTR Executive Review members will coordinate with ACC/A3A, who will provide final
  distribution plans for new production pods/test-sets to AAC/YBR.
  6.5.6. New Requirements. Unfulfilled requirements will be forwarded to ACC/A3A through
  Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB) or CTR using AF Form 1067, Modification
  Proposal.

                                         Chapter 7

              RANGE MAINTENANCE AND CLEARANCE OPERATIONS

7.1. Range Maintenance. Ranges will be constructed and maintained in compliance with
AF/A3O-AR approved range construction and maintenance methods as described on the
RMAST wiki site which will be periodically updated with best practices and field inputs.
7.1. (ANG)Range Maintenance. ROAs will submit exemptions IAW paragraph 1.5 to the
clearance criteria for areas that cannot be cleared due to accessibility or other conditions.
7.2. Range Clearance. Each MAJCOM/ROA is responsible for the clearance of operational
ranges under its control IAW DoDI 3200.16, Operational Range Clearance, DoDI 4140.62,
Management and Disposition of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard
(MPPEH), and Title 40 CFR, Parts 260-270. Furthermore, each MAJCOM/ROA must dispose of
radioactive wastes IAW the Air Force Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office (AFRMWO) and
AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force.
   7.2.1. Funding and Scheduling Range Clearances. The ROA is responsible for funding and
   scheduling all MPPEH/range clearance, and should include clearance activities in the CRP.
   The ROA should publish a clearance schedule on the range web page IAW paragraph 2.5.13.
   The ROA or ROO may temporarily postpone range clearance on a case-by-case basis for
   severe weather or other unforeseen circumstances that warrant delays.
   7.2.2. EOD Support for Range Clearances. When the requirement for range clearance
   support exceeds the capability of the associated EOD unit, shortfalls are managed within the
   ACES Range Support Tasking (RST) program.
       7.2.2.1. Development of the annual range clearance plan will be a collaborative effort
       between the ROA and the associate EOD unit (or MAJCOM) finalized at least six months
       prior to the first clearance activity. The associate EOD unit (or MAJCOM) will enter
       RST requests into ACES as required to meet clearance requirements.
       7.2.2.2. Finalize all ROA range scheduling and EOD RST support at least 45 days before
       the start of the clearance operation.
7.3. Range Clearance Operations. Range clearance includes the removal or disposal of all
ordnance, inert ordnance debris, Training Projectile (TP) ammunition, and other range debris
reasonably possible to detect (normally down to four inches in size).
   7.3.1. Ordnance Removal and Disposal. Normally, only EOD Personnel will perform
   explosive operations (detonation/energetic material destruction). When a fully coordinated
   waiver or exemption has been approved by AF/A3O-AR, UXO-Qualified Personnel may
   perform limited explosives operations (venting or disposing of practice bombs) in areas of
   ranges that have never been used for live munitions. (Reference Attachment 1 for EOD
   Personnel and UXO-Qualified Personnel definitions).
       7.3.1.1. Warning: Except for training gun ammunition on targets designated solely for
       that use, and expended Smokey Sam missile simulators, non-EOD Personnel will not
       move or attempt to move munitions unless they have been marked ―safe to move‖ by
       EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel.
46                                                 AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


     7.3.1.2. Warning: Non-EOD Personnel will not remove, move or process a used target
     until is has been marked ―safe to move‖ by EOD Personnel following thorough
     inspection to ensure that no UXO is present in target debris.
     7.3.1.3. Warning: Range clearance operations are prohibited when snow covers the
     ground. However, if specifically authorized in the MAJCOM supplement, range
     maintenance (placement of new targets, target maintenance, removal, and replacement)
     may be authorized during these periods.
  7.3.2. Other trained persons who are not classifiable as EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified
  Personnel will only remove safe or inert ordnance debris, TP ammunition, and other range
  material that have been inspected and marked for removal by EOD personnel or UXO-
  Qualified Personnel. These other trained persons will be supervised by either EOD Personnel
  or UXO-Qualified personnel to ensure hazardous items are not inadvertently moved or
  removed.
  7.3.3. MPPEH Processing. MPPEH processing (also known as ―Range Residue Removal‖
  [R3]) is normally accomplished by UXO-qualified contractors. Bases must institutionalize a
  chain of custody process for MPPEH from collection to final disposition. This is particularly
  necessary when two or more agencies (e.g., military and contracted) are involved in the
  MPPEH process.
     7.3.3.1. EOD Personnel will brief non-EOD personnel augmenting range clearance on
     the possible hazards and the safe handling of debris. EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified
     Personnel will inspect ordnance debris. Debris will be double-inspected or subjected to a
     mechanized process to ensure MPPEH is not released to the public.
     7.3.3.2. To prevent co-mingling, segregate processed and inspected MPPEH awaiting
     disposal from MPPEH awaiting processing and inspection. Segregation may be
     accomplished by any means that ensures physical separation and controlled access (e.g.,
     bins, buildings, or fenced compounds under lock and key).
     7.3.3.3. Disposal of MPPEH may be accomplished by any means consistent with DoDI
     4140.62 and may be accomplished by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service
     (DRMS) under a MOA or through direct commercial sales or contracts.
     7.3.3.4. MPPEH disposal should not be viewed as a funds generating activity.
     Management and disposal of MPPEH must consider safety first. Additionally, AFI 32-
     7080, Pollution Prevention Program, excludes ―ships, planes, or weapons that must
     undergo demilitarization or mutilation before sale‖ from being sold through a qualified
     recycling program. The proceeds from their sale SHALL NOT be returned to a qualified
     recycling program.
  7.3.4. To identify, safeguard, and dispose of UXO, MAJCOMs will ensure that all ROAs
  accomplish the following:
     7.3.4.1. Safely clear UXO from ranges consistent with the stated mission of the
     installation and for the continuing viability of the range. If there is no organic EOD
     capability, establish a policy agreement document for range clearance support with the
     nearest EOD unit. Resolve all conflicts between explosive safety and other requirements
     with the objective of minimizing explosive hazards. Controlled burning will not be used
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                             47


     to accomplish UXO clearance, but may be used to support UXO clearance if
     environmental and safety requirements are met.
     7.3.4.2. Prepare a plan for range clearance operations that at a minimum considers the
     number of personnel involved, types of ordnance anticipated to be encountered and/or
     recovered, support requirements, expected levels of contamination. Range clearance plan
     will be coordinated with the supporting EOD unit.
        7.3.4.2.1. ROAs should consider requesting an advanced echelon (ADVON) element
        from the supporting EOD unit to conduct a GPS mapping survey of UXO locations
        and debris-densities/distances around the targets at least two weeks prior to arrival of
        the main body to economize and finalize clearance planning.
     7.3.4.3. Respond promptly to protect personnel and property from any UXO located off a
     military installation IAW AFI 32-3001.
     7.3.4.4. Notify installation personnel and the public, as appropriate, if any range
     operation presents a potential explosive hazard off the range. This includes informing the
     public of any mishap that could influence the local community and may require
     additional precautions and/or restrictions.
     7.3.4.5. Respond immediately to releases or substantial threats of release of hazardous
     UXO constituents, when such release or threat of release poses an imminent and
     substantial threat to human health or the environment IAW DoD Response authorities
     under Title 10 U.S.C. § 2701, Environmental Restoration Program and Title 42 U.S.C. §
     9604, Response Authorities.
     7.3.4.6. On operational ranges, the procedures for evaluating and responding to
     explosives safety, human health, and environmental risks will be IAW Title 40 CFR Parts
     260-270.
     7.3.4.7. Conduct cluster munitions release on designated Impact Areas only and make all
     reasonable attempts to employ inert and live cluster munitions on different targets.
     7.3.4.7. (ANG) ANG Ranges will not permit Cluster Munitions or DU munitions.
     7.3.4.8. To the maximum extent practicable, designate separate Impact Areas for live and
     inert ordnance training.
     7.3.4.9. IAW AFMAN 33-363, maintain records of:
        7.3.4.9.1. All expenditures (types, quantities, locations, using organization, and
        estimated dud rates) per target of ammunition and explosives IAW DoDD 4715.11.
        7.3.4.9.2. All mishaps attributed to UXO that occur on or off the installation IAW
        DoDI 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Recordkeeping.
        7.3.4.9.3. All EOD incidents or range clearance operations conducted on ranges.
        7.3.4.9.4. All areas known or suspected to contain UXOs using range maps and/or
        installation master planning maps. Conduct historical research as necessary.
     7.3.4.10. Remove all munitions debris from targets awaiting disposal.
 48                                                   AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012


7.4. Range Clearance Types and Requirements. On active ranges programmed for continued
use, clear the surface of all UXO, MPPEH, and inert debris as described below.
   7.4.1. The following general rules apply to all clearance activities:
      7.4.1.1. Mechanized gathering procedures coordinated with the associated EOD unit and
      approved by the Air Force Safety Center (HQ AFSC) may be used to clear sub-scale
      practice munitions (e.g. BDU-33) as long as un-probed munitions are only handled by
      EOD Personnel or UXO-Qualified Personnel.
      7.4.1.2. Only perform subsurface UXO and MPPEH removal as required in current or
      former Hazard Areas for construction, cable burial, etc. Report subsurface MPPEH
      removal and range clearance separately.
      7.4.1.3. Ranges adjacent to the land of another service that prohibits clearance activities
      will be exempt from clearance requirements on those portions when the other service
      provides written acknowledgement of the ramifications. These areas will be considered
      ―Extremely Hazardous Contaminated Impact Areas‖ and handled accordingly by the
      ROA.
      7.4.1.4. ROAs will receive authorization from adjacent facilities prior to
      decontaminating/clearing adjacent impact areas. ROAs will document all access denials
      for clearance activities and report occurrences to the parent MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AR.
      7.4.1.5. Hazard Areas used specifically for live munitions containing extremely
      hazardous fuzing (influence, random-delay, etc.) will be identified as "Extremely
      Hazardous Contaminated Hazard Areas." Range clearance requirements of ―Extremely
      Hazardous Contaminated Hazard Areas‖ will be based on an Environmental, Safety, and
      Occupational Health (ESOH) risk assessment, and if warranted, a waiver or exemption
      request will be accomplished IAW paragraph 1.5 and staffed through the appropriate
      USAF ESOH agencies.
   7.4.2. Low-Angle Strafe Targets. If used for low-angle strafe by aircraft that fly past or over
   the target within 500 feet of the target (slant range), hand-police daily if utilized and clear
   IAW approved range maintenance methods after 15,000 scored rounds (or twelve use-days
   for non-scored targets).
   7.4.2. (ANG) Approved maintenance will include disk harrow, chisel plow, digger-strainer
   or magnetic sweeper. Disk harrow or chisel plow the area to keep the soil in a loose
   condition to the 12‖ depth. The decision to disk harrow, chisel plow, digger- strainer or
   magnet sweeper will be made by the ROA after considering such factors as the type of soil,
   condition of the soil in the strafe target area and its moisture content. In addition to the
   weekly maintenance, the following maintenance will be accomplished on the strafe target
   area before the first mission of the day. The area 23 meters (75’) in front of the target to 30
   meters (100’) behind the target including 15 meters (50’) either side of the centerline, and the
   areas around the berms and tops of the berms will be hand-policed. All hard objects 3‖x2‖ or
   larger, spent projectiles and other hazardous debris will be removed. Document all strafe
   target maintenance.
   7.4.3. Improved Conventional Munition (ICM) targets (e.g. CBU grids) are normally cleared
   after accumulating a specific number of weapons. The maximum accumulation amount for
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                                   49


   ICM targets will be specified in the Range CRP and for approval by the MAJCOM with the
   concurrence of AF/A7C. After the maximum accumulation amount is achieved, clear ICM
   targets to the radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre and at least
   500 feet from the target.
   7.4.4. Range Clearance Requirements. The sub-paragraphs below define minimum clearance
   requirements; ROAs should consider conducting clearances more frequently or to greater
   radii if required to maintain targets or realistic appearance if EOD support is available.
   During periods of high operations tempo, ROAs should coordinate with their associated EOD
   unit or MAJCOM to synchronize scheduling with AEF deployment cycles.
   7.4.4. (ANG) Ranges that are co-located on other services’ land may need to submit a
   waiver and will do so IAW this publication.
      7.4.4.1. As required: Class A, B, and C and MRTFBs. No later than 12 months since last
      accomplished, or when targets are emplaced, replaced or relocated, clear the access ways
      to the target and the area 50 feet on either side of primary target access roads (only those
      roads noted on installation maps and those used for sole access to targets/arrays).
      7.4.4.2. Semi-Annual: Class A and MRTFBs (Except ANG, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB
      and Pacific Alaskan Range Complex [PARC]). Clear the area around each DMPI
      associated with a target used for weapons expenditure to a radius of 150 feet either a)
      after six months or 150 Use-Days, whichever occurs later, or b) after 20,000 weapons
      have been expended against it. (Note: If two years elapse before the accumulation of
      20,000 weapons, the Semi-Annual requirement is negated by the Biennial requirement in
      paragraph 7.4.4.3 below.)
      7.4.4.3. Biennial: Class A, B, C and MRTFBs. No later than two years since last
      accomplished, clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure as follows:
          7.4.4.3.1. Clear targets not used for live munitions to either a) a radius of 300 feet or
          b) the shorter radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre.
          7.4.4.3.2. Clear live munitions targets to either a) a radius of 500 feet or b) the
          shorter radius where the debris density factor is less than five items per acre.
      7.4.4.4. Decennial: Class A, B, and C. No later than 10 years since last accomplished,
      clear the area around a target used for weapons expenditure to either a) a radius of 1,000
      feet or b) the shorter radius where the density of debris items is less than five per acre.
      ROAs may elect to clear all areas within 1,000 feet of targets every ten years and may do
      so incrementally (e.g. 20% of the required area biennially for ten years).
   7.4.5. (Added-ANG) At the conclusion of each range clearance, a chain of custody will be
   established for all residue inspected by EOD/UXO personnel. The residue will be secured in

  aircraft damage by fragments from explosives operations. Strict adherence to the procedures
  outlined below is mandatory.
     7.6.3.1. When range maintenance or clearance personnel are present on the range and
     explosives operations are not planned, aircraft will remain at or above 3,000’ AGL unless
     a lower altitude is specifically approved by the ground party and RCO or ROO.
     7.6.3.2. When explosives operations are planned, aircraft will remain at or above 7,000’
     AGL to ensure containment of H-6 fill Mk-84 fragmentation.
     7.6.3.3. When no personnel are on the range, but the range is closed for maintenance or
     clearance operations, aircraft operations may proceed with no additional altitude
     restrictions, but only simulated weapons deliveries IAW applicable directives, and eye
     safe laser operations are authorized during range maintenance and range clearance
     closures. All restrictions will be clearly identified in the range schedule and reinforced by
     range NOTAMS.
     7.6.3.4. Chaff and flares are prohibited below 5,000’ AGL above range clearance
     operations.
     7.6.3.5. Do not conduct supersonic flight below 10,000’ MSL over or within 5NM of
     EOD operations.

                                           Chapter 9

      NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND ENCROACHMENT
                          PREVENTION

9.1. Range Natural Infrastructure Management & Encroachment Prevention. In order to
ensure mission readiness, adequate natural infrastructure (air, land, water, and frequency
spectrum) are needed to test, train, and perform the Air Force’s varied missions at its ranges.
These resources can be degraded or denied in some locations due to environmental issues or
encroachment. Encroachment comes in many forms, but often results in diminished operations or
significant workarounds, inconveniences, and additional costs of doing business. Therefore, it is
important to maintain natural infrastructure and protect against encroachment wherever possible
to meet operational requirements.
   9.1.1. In order to document and track efforts to sustain, restore and modernize (SRM) the
   natural infrastructure to ensure operational capability, each range in conjunction with a multi-
   disciplinary team, including wing civil engineering, safety, EOD, legal, etc., shall develop
   and maintain a CRP as discussed in paragraph 3.2.4.
   9.1.2. The CRP will document encroachment issues, both internally and externally, for
   ranges and associated airspace describing impacts on the mission. Internal factors include,
   but are not limited to, wetlands, threatened and endangered (T/E) species, hazardous waste
   sites, frequency spectrum, and UXO. External factors include, but are not limited to,
   incompatible land use zoning, frequency spectrum restrictions, and local and regional
   environmental constraints. The ROA will work with the surrounding federal, state, and local
   governments to minimize external encroachments.
   9.1.3. Regulatory compliance is necessary and desirable. Protection of human health;
   conservation of wetlands and endangered species; and conservation of cultural resources are
   essential range management activities. Compliance activities and attendant metrics, however,
   do not provide an adequate measure of program management effectiveness absent a clear
   linkage to operational requirements. Therefore, it is Air Force policy to sustain, restore, and
   modernize our natural infrastructure over its useful life to ensure adequate resource capability
   for the warfighter and to minimize encroachment. Protection of human health and conserving
   cultural and natural resources are inherent in this requirement.
9.2. Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Program. Air Force ranges will conserve
natural resources pursuant to the Sikes Act and other applicable laws and regulations. The
cultural resources program will be implemented by an approved ICRMP. The INRMP is the sole
tool for implementing the military installation natural resources program. The ICRMP is the sole
tool for implementing the military cultural resources program. Each INRMP and ICRMP will be
written IAW AFI 32-7064 and AFI 32-7065 to support the current and future known mission
requirements identified in the CRP and will be amended as mission requirements change
significantly.
9.3. Environmental Compliance, Conservation, and Pollution Prevention.
   9.3.1. Environmental Compliance. Air Force ranges will conduct their activities according to
   national environmental policy and meet environmental compliance guidelines set forth in
   AFI 32-7047, Environmental Compliance Tracking and Reporting, and DoDI 4715.6,
AFI13-212_ANGSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2012                                                              55


   Environmental Compliance. The Air Force will comply with applicable Federal, State, and
   local environmental laws and standards. Air Force activities in foreign countries will comply
   with the DoD Final Governing Standards, or in their absence, the environmental criteria of
   the DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document.
   9.3.2. Conservation and Pollution Prevention. The Air Force will conserve natural and
   cultural resources through effective environmental planning. The Air Force will prevent
   future pollution by reducing use of hazardous materials and releases of pollutants into the
   environment through source reduction, recycling, and hazardous material substitutions.
   Commanders at all levels as well as all Air Force employees are responsible for full
   compliance with national and Air Force environmental policy and are accountable for the
   environmental consequences of their actions.
   9.3.3. Military Munitions Rule (MMR). The regulations governing the cradle-to-grave
   management of hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR Parts 260-270. The portion of
   those regulations that determine when military munitions become solid waste and provide
   standards for their management as hazardous waste are codified in Title 40 CFR , Part 266,
   Subpart M, ―Military Munitions‖ (40 CFR §§ 266.200 -- 266.206). MAJCOMs/ROAs will
   comply with the standards established in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
   MMR to meet EPA regulatory requirements on active and inactive ranges. Ensure
   environmental management flights are involved in the process.
   9.3.4. Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). MAJCOMs/ROAs
   should manage active and inactive ranges under their control to maintain long-term viability
   of DoD ranges while protecting human health and the environment and to minimize future
   clearance costs. Ranges and munitions should be designed to minimize potential explosive
   hazards and harmful environmental impacts and to promote resource recovery and recycling.
   Each MAJCOM/ROA will comply with DoDI 4140.62 and DoDD 4715.11 and 4715.12.
9.4. Programming Guidance. Eligible environmental requirements shall be identified for
funding in ACES. The ranges should be projecting environmental requirements in POM
submissions. Your host installation Civil Engineer (CE) Environmental Office can assist you in
identifying projects eligible for environmental funding versus environmentally related
operational requirements that must be funded with the ranges operations and maintenance funds.
9.5. Environmental Database. It is critical for the Air Force Operational Range Environmental
Program to have an accurate database of environmental attributes of operational ranges. This
database supports informed and accurate environmental resource decisions to sustain our
operational ranges into the future. Each range shall respond to annual data calls and provide the
requested information in coordination with the host CE squadron/environmental office.
9.6. Operational Range Environmental Assessment Program. Ranges shall work with the
host CE squadron/environmental shop to conduct operational range munitions constituent
migration assessments IAW DoDD 4715.11, DoDD 4715.12, DoDI 4715.14, Operational Range
Assessments, and implementing Air Force guidance.
