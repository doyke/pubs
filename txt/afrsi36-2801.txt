       recipient, and why the award was presented.
3. Funding and Accountability:
   3.1. Per AFRSI 65-601, Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) Budget and Financial
   Management, financial management, a function of command, is decentralized to the
   maximum extent possible. However, to ensure consistency in the quality and quantity of
   awards purchased throughout AFRS, the awards program must be managed closely to
   prevent excessive expenditures for awards. Make every effort to bulk-purchase awards
   through General Services Administration (GSA) suppliers. Do not use appropriated funds to
   purchase such items as going away and retirement plaques.
   3.2. According to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, trophies,
   plaques, emblems, certificates, and similar items designed for display purposes are
   considered awards. Under the purview of this instruction and for production incentive awards
   only, HQ AFRS, groups, and squadrons may purchase merchandise in place of awards for
   quarterly and annual awards and any special incentive programs approved by commanders at
   all levels. Note: An individual may not receive two items at the same level for winning a
   particular award. For example, if a person wins Top Recruiter, he/she may not receive
   additional plaques or merchandise type awards (recruiting watch; briefcase; pen and pencil
   set; etc.) for the same accomplishment. However, awards may come from higher
   headquarters.
   3.3. The recommended total budget for each RCS FY awards program should not exceed
   $45 for each authorized person as of the first of the FY (for example, 1 October, 100
   authorized (military and civilian personnel; total 100 x $45 = $4,500). The total budget for
   each RCG FY awards program should not exceed $20 for each authorized person as of the
   first of the FY (for example, 1 October, 14 authorized (military and civilian) personnel at the
   RCG and 600 authorized (military and civilian) personnel from all RCSs within the RCG;
   total 614 x $20 = $12,280). Suggested cost ceilings for each award follow: annual - $80;
   quarterly - $60; and monthly - $50. Track costs associated with enhancements (framing,
   engraving, and certificates), and include them as part of the individual awards recommended
   limitation. Keep documentation on all expenditures.
4. Commander's Special Incentive Programs. The AFRS/CC may initiate incentive programs
throughout the year to support special needs of AFRS. Additionally, AFRS/CC (or designated
representative) may recognize individuals or contributions to the success of the AFRS mission
 6                                                         AFRSI36-2801 24 OCTOBER 2012


with the award of the AFRS medallion or pewter plate. Individuals recognized may come from
the Air Force, any government agency, or the civilian sector. RCG and RCS commanders may
initiate similar programs at their discretion.
5. Recruiting Service FY Awards:
     5.1. Attachment 3 lists the authorized FY annual awards for AFRS, RCG, and RCS.
     Commanders will ensure the award matches the level of accomplishment.
        5.1.1. The RCS commander will limit the number of squadron-level awards issued at the
        annual banquet to the following: Top Enlisted Accessions Flight Chief; Top Recruiter;
        Top Enlisted Accessions (EA) Recruiter; Top Rookie Recruiter; Top Enlisted Accessions
        Flight; Top Recruiting Support Award; Spouse of the Year; Top Civilian; and the
        Commander’s, Superintendent’s, Production Superintendent’s, and First Sergeant’s
        Achievement Awards. Note: The Commander’s, Superintendent’s, Production
        Superintendent’s, and First Sergeant’s Achievement Awards are effort-based awards for
        any member or team in the squadron.
        5.1.2. Awards may be procured locally; however, comparative pricing through a central
        location may offer cost savings. See Attachment 4 for suggested types of award. Present
        awards in the following order: RCS, RCG, and AFRS. Silver, Gold Recruiting Badge,
        and Olympiad Medals are considered AFRS-level awards. The Gold Recruiting Badge is
        the final award presented at the banquet (see Attachment 5).
        5.1.3. Award the Top Flight Recruiter Award for each flight, quarterly awards, and other
        emphasis awards to include the Senior or Master Recruiter Badges at appropriate
        opportunities during annual training.
     5.2. AFRS awards are presented to the command’s top performers.
        5.2.1. If a RCS commander gives a recruiter a letter of reprimand or takes disciplinary
        action of a greater degree, the recruiter is ineligible for any awards.
        5.2.2. A commander should not bypass an individual being considered for an award
        (keep in mind that an individual is innocent until proven guilty). In such cases, the
        prudent track would be to delay making a decision on the award until the investigation is
        closed (if possible).
        5.2.3. If a designated award winner comes under investigation for an allegation occurring
        during the period of award, the award will be withheld pending the results.
     5.3. AFRS presents squadron, flight, branch, and individual awards. Attachment 3 lists all
     awards and criteria pertaining to each award.
6. AFRS CY Awards. In conjunction with AFPD 36-28 and AFI 36-2805, this instruction
establishes the procedures for the AFRS Calendar Year Awards Program. It provides guidance
for recognizing outstanding company grade officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian employees
assigned to AFRS. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned to AFRS and subordinate
units. The following AFRS awards are based on CY nominations: Company Grade Officer of the
Year, SNCO of the Year, NCO of the Year, Airman of the Year, and Civilian of the Year
(Categories I through III), and First Sergeant of the Year. For additional civilian award
guidance, see Attachment 7.

   concept. Military nominees must not have negative quality force indicators, for example,
   reprimands, unfavorable information file entries, or control roster actions. Civilian nominees
   must not have current disciplinary action. Note: This list is not all inclusive; be sure to only
   nominate individuals deserving of an award.
   7.2. Category. Each group and HQ AFRS may nominate one individual per category. All
   nominees must meet eligibility requirements in paragraph 7.1 and 7.4.

      award nominations to HQ AFRS/CCF by the 25th day of the month, following the end of
      the quarter. 1st thru 3rd quarter FY awards will be forwarded to HQ AFRS/RSOT by the
      25th of the month following the end of the quarter. The suspense for FY 4th quarter
      awards will be set by AFRS/RSOT each year in order to meet timelines for presentation
      of awards at annual training meetings.
      7.3.2. Annual. The suspense for CY annual awards will be determined to meet higher
      headquarters deadlines. The suspense for FY annual awards will be set by AFRS/RSOT
 8                                                         AFRSI36-2801 24 OCTOBER 2012


        each year in order to meet timelines for presentation of awards at annual training
        meetings.
        7.3.3. HQ AFRS-Only Awards. Submission dates for the HQ AFRS-only selection
        boards will be determined as local Joint Base San Antonio – Randolph officials set the

        60 days during the period for which they are nominated.
        7.4.2. Annual. Individuals submitted for annual awards do not have to be quarterly
        award recipients. Nominees will compete in the category for which they held their grade
        the longest period (for example, a senior Airman promoted in October to staff sergeant
        would compete in the Airman of the Year category for that year). HQ AFRS and each
        recruiting group may submit one nomination in each category to compete for an annual
        award. Airman, NCO, and SNCO annual award winners will be AFRS nominees to HQ
        AETC for 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year competition.

   career. The Senior Recruiter Badge is awarded through a nominative process to individuals in
   Tier 3 and a select few who have completed certification or at least 1 year in Tier 2 recruiting
   positions. Squadron commanders will nominate individuals with the recommendation of the
   Production Superintendent and Flight Chief as applicable. Nominations will be forwarded via
   memorandum to the RCG Superintendent for review and final approval by the RCG
   Commander. For Tier 2 and Tier 3 recruiters assigned to RCG and AFRS positions,
   nominations will come from the respective branch chief or superintendent for approval by the
   group commander or division chief as applicable. Forward approved nominations to
   AFRS/RSOT to request the Senior Recruiter test. For recruiters assigned outside of AFRS
   squadron, group, or headquarters positions, their respective supervisors nominate them
   through AFRS/RSOT to AFRS/RSO for approval.
      A5.4.3.1. Senior Recruiter Test. The Senior Recruiter Test is composed of multiple
      choice and true/false questions from various AFRS references including but not limited
      to; AFRSI 36-2001, AFRSI36-2801 and AFRSI36-2201 as well as Professional Sales
      Skills and Coaching. The Senior Recruiter test will be sent by AFRS/RSOT to the
      Squadron Superintendent or Production Superintendent who will assign a test
      administrator or administer the test themselves. Recommended test administrators other
      than the CCY/CCU include: squadron First Sergeant, Operations or Support Flight
      commander, Senior Trainer, or Operations Flight Chief. The test is considered controlled
      material and no extra copies shall be made or distributed. The test will be administered in
      a controlled environment (no smart phones, laptops or notes) and test material returned to
      the test administrator. Completed tests will be scanned and e-mailed by the administrator
      to AFRS/RSOT for scoring and recording (destroy/delete test material when completed).
      A minimum score of 80% is required to pass the Senior Recruiter test; anyone failing the
      test may retest in 1 year. Test scores will be recorded and group training will be sent the
      names and test results. Badges should be awarded within 90 days in an appropriate
      ceremony.
   A5.4.4. Master Recruiter Badge. The Master Recruiter Badge has a distinctive wreath
   atop the badge with a 3D nautical star set in a blue background. This Badge may be awarded
   to a certified flight chief or above through the nomination process and testing. Having a
   Master Recruiter Badge is a prerequisite to being placed on the Production Superintendent
   list, therefore individuals who do not yet demonstrate the potential for this level of leadership
   should not be nominated. Upon receipt of approved nominations, AFRS/RSOT will assist
   with administering the Master Recruiter Test. A minimum score of 80% is required to pass
   the test; anyone failing the Master Recruiter test may retest in 1 year. Completed tests will be
   forwarded to AFRS/RSOT for scoring and recording. Once individuals are notified of
   selection, the Master Recruiter Badge should be awarded within 90 days in an appropriate
   ceremony.
   A5.4.5. Command Master Recruiters. Ten Master Recruiters are selected to serve as
   Command Master Recruiters. This leadership council represents the senior most level of
   recruiting experience and expertise and serves as the primary advisory body to the AFRS/CC
   on all recruiting matters (See AFRS supplement to AFI-2117). Command Master Recruiters
   will be designated with a gold star on the Master Recruiter Badge.
A5.5. Requests for Badges and Rings:

  A5.5.1. Each RCG will order projected requirements for Silver Recruiter Badges, Gold
  Recruiter Badges, and numbered stars through their appropriate supplier. Note: Order rings
  through HQ AFRS/RSOT and present to recipients as soon as possible after receipt.
  A5.5.2. The RCS commander will send written requests for badges to the RCG commander
  after the end of the FY or at the end of the initial 12 months for out of cycle requests. The FY
  suspense date will vary based on the start date of the annual cycle. Each operations branch
  will validate production data based on AFRS criteria and will forward badges to the
  requesting squadron. Commanders have disapproval-for-cause authority when, in their
  opinion, awarding a badge would discredit the Air Force or AFRS.
