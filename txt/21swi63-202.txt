SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The policies in this document are substantially revised; therefore the document should be
completely reviewed. Revision and clarification includes: Add guidance to incorporate
standardized processes for assigned 21 OG space control units; add specific responsibilities for
the 21 OG Technical Director (21 OG/TD); add system change scoring and prioritization
information; add information pertaining to assessment of mission data quality or effects
assessment to be included in Trial Period (TP) briefings; add option for use of System
Requirements Validation Board (SRVB) in place of a Unit Requirements Validation Board
(URVB) for like systems; modify the naming convention for ITW/AA system version releases to
facilitate configuration control for Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA)
changes that occur independent of traditional version releases; specify timeline requirements for
Installation Checkout and Evaluation (ICE) plans and reports; change unit requirement to submit
ICE reports to 21 OG from 14 to 21 duty days; remove reference to ―Fix‖ modifications being
processed as wing-level change; remove information specific to the Depot Level Maintenance
(DLM) process and modify information on DLM follow-up requirements; modify information
regarding use of technical documentation during testing and TP; update Deficiency Report (DR)
categories; require AF Form 1067 Modification Proposal and Standard Change Form (SCF)
data sheet use for all ITW/AA system changes; update Site Adaptable Parameter (SAP) change
process and include requirement to maintain a pre-coordinated list of potential SAP change
parameters for situational use; remove references to and distinction for static and dynamic SAP
changes; remove specific example attachments for AF Form 1067, SCF data sheet, and wing and
unit approval board minutes; incorporate requirements for participation in Test Readiness
Review Boards (TRRB) and test-related Safety Review Boards (SRB); remove requirement for
monthly wing and unit Requirements Validation Board (RVB) meetings. Organizations will use
the self inspection program checklist (21 SW Form 1a) to verify compliance with this
publication. For the purposes of this instruction an ITW/AA system is defined as one where a
purposeful decision is made to control the configuration baseline of the system according to NI
10-3 or USSTRATCOM Instruction 508-10 and applicable subordinate instructions and may
include actual ITW/AA systems and non ITW/AA systems such as those used for Space
Surveillance and/or Missile Defense. If there are cases where this instruction contradicts HHQ
instructions, HHQ instructions take precedence. Contact the Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) for assistance in resolving conflicting guidance.

     1.6.8. Consolidate unit scoring inputs, coordinate a prioritized list of those inputs with
     internal and external organizations for WRVB and mission area team review, and provide a
     prioritized list of changes to 21 OG/CC for final approval.
     1.6.9. Maintain standardized briefing templates for TP entry/exit and for DRB meetings and
     distribute completed briefings, when available, to participating organizations at least one day
     prior to meetings.
     1.6.10. Provide TP information as requested by the operations acceptance authority so it can
     be pre-coordinated with external organizations. The information is provided to the
     operations acceptance authority no later than 7 duty days prior to the desired TP start date.
     1.6.11. Ensure equipment manuals and any other SPO-provided technical documentation
     necessary to develop unit ICE plans is available to the unit NLT 15 duty days before an ICE
     plan must be submitted to 21 OG/TD for approval signature.
1.7. 21 OG Squadrons and Detachments (i. e., Units). 21 OG units who operate mission
systems have the following responsibilities:
     1.7.1. Unit commanders maintain ultimate responsibility for their mission at all times and
     ensure no unauthorized changes to assigned weapon system(s). Authorized changes are
     those specifically approved by SPO CCB/JCCB, WRVB action (or higher) and those which
     have met other criteria described in this instruction.
     1.7.2. When an ITW/AA system generates a false Launch and Predicted Impact message,
     commanders must consider their option to request assistance using DLM options.

  USSTRATCOM SIB, TRRB, SRB, TRB and other meetings when considering the unit’s
  system changes.
  1.7.15. Apply scores to change proposals using standardized criteria.
  1.7.16. Use approved change priorities when discussing future system changes with the SPO
  and other organizations.
  1.7.17. Provide the minimum information for TP entry as required by the operations
  approval authority to 21 OSS no later than 10 duty days prior to the desired TP start date for
  pre-coordination with the other external organizations. Information may include but is not
8                                                             21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


    limited to, change project identifier, TP start date/time, TP duration, and system recovery
    plan in case of failure (i.e., fallback plan).
    1.7.18. Use a 21 OG standardized template to prepare TP entry/exit and DRB briefing
    material. Submit completed material to 21 OSS by the designated suspense.
    1.7.19. Brief using completed slides for TP entry/exit and for DRB meetings.
    1.7.20. Work with SPO representatives to identify and document a system-specific listing of
    adjustable, organizational level (i.e., level one) mission software parameters to meet mission
    situational requirements as SAPs (see chapter 8).
    1.7.21. Identify a Test Support Manger (TSM) to support test and evaluation activities and
    serves as a liaison between the operational unit and the Lead Test Organization (LTO). The
    TSM will support the testing process from test planning through reporting.

                          INDIVIDUAL CHANGE PROPOSALS

2.1. General. This chapter outlines processes used for weapon system changes including
IAVAs. Any change to the hardware or software baseline of a mission system, mission system
communications systems, or mission system interface requires application of control processes to
ensure proper system operation and integrity.
   2.1.1. Any system(s) assigned to 21 SW that follow(s) a rapid reaction process for system
   modifications will use AFI 63-114 which establishes a process for responding to warfighters’
   Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) identified during conflict or crisis situations that are life
   threatening or combat mission essential. The rapid reaction process does not replace normal
   acquisition or sustainment procedures, but rather speeds the fielding of systems/capabilities
   to satisfy wartime needs. System modifications may be used to satisfy an UON that has been
   validated IAW AFI 10-601 and joint urgent operational needs (JUON) that have been
   validated IAW CJCSI 3470.01.
   2.1.2. Any organization having knowledge of a particular system and the need to make a
   change to the system may initiate a change proposal. To meet the needs of this control
   process, non-ITW/AA system changes use an AF Form 1067. ITW/AA changes are
   processed using an AF Form 1067 and a NORAD/USSTRATCOM SCF data sheet. These
   documents allow for various levels of validation and approval for individual changes as
   described in subsequent paragraphs. Specific requirements for completing the AF Form
   1067 can be found in AFI 63-131. When a wing-level change is determined appropriate and
   within the scope of higher instructions, the WRVB chairperson will sign the AF Form 1067
   in blocks applicable to both ―Using‖ and ―Lead‖ command and the WRVB chairperson will
   ensure a notation is placed in Block 18 to denote validation as a wing-level requirement.
   2.1.3. ITW/AA-specific SCF data sheets use a standardized Universal Control Number
   (UCN) for tracking. The UCN is applied by 21 OSS and is used to track the change in an
   SCF database through all phases of approval and implementation. Applying the UCN ―locks
   down‖ the data sheet for additional changes, therefore 21 OSS may facilitate unit-level, or
   like-system review of change proposals prior to assigning a UCN. After assigning the UCN,
   21 OSS sends the proposal to the appropriate URVB or SRVB chairperson for action.
2.2. Change Processing and Implementation Timelines. Individual change proposals are
categorized as emergency, urgent, or routine IAW SI 534-22. The wing scoring process provides
additional guidance which influences implementation priority and associated timelines.
   2.2.1. Upon identification of a solution, accomplish emergency changes as soon as possible.
   Compress timelines for approval processing for emergency changes when needed using ―out-
   of-cycle‖ board actions, etc. Depending on the severity of the issue causing the emergency
   proposal, and the timeline for the proposed change, board actions may lag actual
   implementation. In such cases, all participants in the process must work together to clearly
   communicate requirements and solutions to ensure integrity of the mission systems which
   require emergency action.
   2.2.2. Consider urgent changes for the next planned version release, depending on priority
   categorization, wing specific scoring, and other implementation-specific factors.
 10                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


   2.2.3. Implement routine changes in a future version release based on categorization, the
   relative priority of all pending changes, and the cost and risk associated with implementation.
2.3. Wing Requirements Validation Board (WRVB). 21 OSS carries out the functions of the
WRVB on behalf of 21 OG. Members of the WRVB may include representatives from 21 OG
squadrons, USSTRATCOM, HQ AFSPC, 14 AF, RAF Fylingdales, the SPO and others with
business coming before the board. The 614 AOC Technical Director (614 AOC/CN) is routinely
invited to the WRVB for cases where a change to a space situational awareness (i.e., space
surveillance) sensor may be discussed or when changes that impact Distributed Space Command
and Control - Dahlgren (DSC2-D) are considered. The WRVB will:
   2.3.1. Meet when necessary to consider validation for proposed changes, change projects, or
   at the direction of 21 OG/TD. Change proposals should be scored by a URVB or SRVB
   prior to consideration by the WRVB.
   2.3.2. Make a determination to process changes as either command-level or wing-level. Use
   guidance in AFSPC instructions (e.g., AFSPCI 63-104 or AFSPCI 63-131) to assist in proper
   process determination.
   2.3.3. Coordinate with appropriate experts to obtain supporting information for a given
   change when necessary.
   2.3.4. Publish agenda, minutes, and other documentation necessary for participation.
   2.3.5. Develop/use a tracking system (i.e., change form database, etc.) to ensure board
   decisions can be documented as a historical record.
   2.3.6. Send validated wing-level changes to the SPO (e.g., PRB representative) for
   preliminary analysis and cost, for entry into a Requirements Definition and Analysis process,
   or other such action as determined by the SPO.
   2.3.7. Send WRVB-validated command-level changes to the Modification Control Point
   (MCP) (i.e., HQ AFSPC/A4) for action. The WRVB sends space control-related changes to
   14 AF/A3, who will forward appropriate change proposals to the MCP.
   2.3.8. Return disapproved change proposals to the originator and disposition deferred
   changes according to the reason for deferral.
   2.3.9. Provide the MCP copies of all wing-level change actions.
   2.3.10. When recommended by the SPO for deployment or implementation, provide final
   approval/disapproval for any collection of changes (version change).
   2.3.11. Approve or disapprove URVB-recommended SAP change listings.
2.4. Unit Requirements Validation Board (URVB) or System Requirements Validation
Board (SRVB). The URVB/SRVB provides the first level of review in the change approval
process. A SRVB may be convened for like weapon system units to consider proposed changes
that impact multiple units, whereas a URVB typically involves only a single unit. The
URVB/SRVB has the following responsibilities:
   2.4.1. Meet when necessary to prevent a delay in action of longer than 30 duty days for any
   individual change proposal, or as needed to conduct other essential business as determined by
   the chairperson.
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                   11


   2.4.2. Make a determination to process changes as either command-level or wing-level. Use
   guidance in AFSPC instructions (e.g., AFSPCI 63-104 or AFSPCI 63-131) to assist in
   process determination.
   2.4.3. Recommend approval, disapproval, deferral, and/or closure for proposed changes and
   provide a prioritization score for validated change proposals. Units with like systems must
   provide a single prioritization score on requirements that affect multiple units before sending
   change proposals to the WRVB for consideration. Review language used on DRAFT change
   proposals when requested.
   2.4.4. Revalidate at the at the 3-year point and every 3 years thereafter each proposed change
   that is not implemented or selected for implementation.
   2.4.5. Prepare and distribute agenda and minutes. Distribution must include the 21 OSS
   (i.e., WRVB point of contact), and may also include the SPO, like systems, and other
   organizations. Minutes must be disseminated within 7 duty days of the meeting. Include
   decisions of the board, change scoring information, and any other supporting documentation
   deemed necessary by the URVB/SRVB chairperson.
   2.4.6. Recommend a SAP change listing (when used) that has been precoordinated with the
   unit’s SPO representative for WRVB approval.
2.5. Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA) Change Proposals. The Air
Force releases IAVA notifications for changes that may affect weapon systems using
―Commercial Off The Shelf‖ (COTS) solutions or open source-type software applications as part
of their configuration baseline. An example of an IAVA change is a regularly released security
patch to an Oracle-system database used by a 21 SW weapon system in the course of normal
operations.
   2.5.1. The SPO maintains awareness on required IAVA updates for 21 SW mission systems.
   Upon release of an IAVA notification, the SPO makes every effort to implement the change
   before the required implementation date. When implementation does not appear feasible by
   the required date, the SPO initiates an implementation date waiver request. The ability to
   successfully obtain a waiver is secondary to ensuring proper operating parameters for the
   weapon system. The SPO and the unit will work together to implement the change.
   2.5.2. When IAVA implementation also requires other tangent mission system hardware or
   software changes, the IAVA must become a new configuration controlled change project
   (i.e., version release) for the weapon system.
   2.5.3. Follow the SAP change process described in this instruction when IAVA changes are
   not controlled and implemented as part of a standard change project. Alternatively, if the
   IAVA represents a critical deficiency and is not implemented in another way, then an
   Emergency Depot Level Maintenance (EDLM) option is available.
   2.5.4. The operational unit conducts ICE if OT&E does not test the IAVA change. Units
   may coordinate a standard ICE plan for pre-approval by 21 OG/TD, which can be executed
   for a wide variety of IAVA changes. This minimizes the lead time necessary while retaining
   process rigor to ensure operational system integrity in testing IAVA changes. When using
   the standardized ICE plan approach, plans will be re-coordinated for signature by 21 OG/TD
   every 2 years, at a minimum.
 12                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


   2.5.5. IAVA naming convention. When IAVA changes are implemented for ITW/AA
   systems independent of a traditional change project, the naming convention used begins with
   the last version operationally accepted by the AFSPC OAP. After that version number, place
   in parentheses the fiscal year and the IAVA number installed for that fiscal year (FY). For
   example ―AS/11-2B (IAVA 12-1)‖ indicates version 11-2B was previously ops accepted by
   the OAP and, during FY 12 the 1st IAVA change has been made.
   2.5.6. An operational acceptance decision may or may not be required for an IAVA change
   depending on the method used for implementation.              For ITW/AA systems a
   USSTRATCOM/J65 system certification decision will be based on a decision of the SIB and
   documented results of testing or ICE.
2.6. Documentation Changes. Changes to configuration controlled baseline documentation
required due to hardware, software, firmware, or communications media changes are covered by
the change proposal documentation associated with that change and usually follow standard
change processes for Technical Order (TO) changes. ITW/AA configuration baseline
documentation changes which are not caused by a specific software, hardware, firmware, or
communications media change, and cannot follow the standard change processes for TOs, may
be implemented with a SCF data sheet or similar request format which can follow the
configuration change approval processes described in this instruction. When the SCF data sheet
is used, the "DZ" identifier will be applied as the last two characters of the UCN. Changes to
configuration baseline documentation will be prioritized, along with other change proposals.
2.7. Changes to Off-line Software or Hardware Components. Off-line components consist
of system-unique utilities that are not part of the configuration controlled baseline. Off-line
components are primarily used for operations data analysis and interpretation or for preplanning
routine and special events for optimal mission success. The URVB is the final approval
authority for off-line computer software changes. Products of off-line systems may not be
introduced into the mission system unless the off-line system is brought under configuration
control but, the results of off-line components may be used for operational decisions when such
decisions are guided and directed by operations or maintenance procedures. Adding an off-line
capability to the configuration controlled weapon system must be done by following the change
control process described in this instruction. The URVB ensures that all off-line computer
changes are accompanied by up-to-date documentation. Changes to RAF Fylingdales’ UK-
specific and Globus II-specific systems will be managed according to the current Combined
Logistics Support Arrangement.
2.8. Change Proposal Scoring and Prioritization. The purpose of scoring and prioritization is
to provide an operations group-level perspective on changes for use by sustainment partners and
fiscal decision makers. Scoring change proposals provides 21 OG/CC a sense of the importance
across all assigned systems for sustainment priorities or for advancing mission areas. Operations
units score change proposals using 21 OG standardized criteria.
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                   13


                                           Chapter 3

                                    CHANGE PROJECTS

3.1. Change Projects. A process is used to establish a set of changes that will be delivered for a
given mission system. This is defined as version content, and for ITW/AA systems, is described
in a Version Content Notification (VCN). Change projects can be specific to a given weapon
system location or to a family of systems (i.e., just 16 SPCS or all UEWR locations). The
mission operator (i.e., 21 OG unit), the SPO, HQ AFSPC, and others work together to determine
which approved changes are implemented based on wing priorities given constraints of budget
and complexity. Change projects may contain just one or any number of individual changes as
long as each has been properly approved following the guidance in this instruction.
   3.1.1. After the initial dialog to tentatively establish version content, the SPO provides a
   proposal to 21 OG for coordination. 21 OG may ask the WRVB to review and assess the
   SPO implementation approach. Although the SPO may choose to use any coordination
   format, the 21 OG preferred coordination approach is accomplished using a detailed system
   requirements specification which will match all version content to specific performance
   expectations and which is pre-coordinated between the units undergoing the change and the
   SPO before being sent to 21 OG for final coordination. After 21 OG coordination, the SPO
   prepares the project and briefs the planned version implementation in detail at their
   CCB/JCCB meeting. Upon CCB/JCCB approval, the change project is prepared for
   implementation and the on-site work schedule is de-conflicted with the operations unit where
   the project applies.
   3.1.2. For ITW/AA systems, if the CCB/JCCB chairperson agrees with the planned project,
   the result is a ―CCB/JCCB Decision Directive‖ requesting the operations community create a
   version in the change form database. Non-ITW/AA systems may use a variety of means to
   communicate change project decisions. The SPO representative provides the Decision
   Directive to 21 OSS, who prepares the version for a final wing-level decision at the WRVB.
   Each VCN will specify the software and/or hardware version identifier (i.e., nomenclature)
   and the system impacted by the software or hardware version. Each VCN will also identify
   all approved changes that will be implemented within the version, including the UCN
   number and associated short title. If the WRVB chairperson approves the VCN it is
   considered final and the WRVB releases the notification via WRVB minutes. Proposed
   versions that are not approved are returned to the SPO until remaining issues can be
   addressed.
   3.1.3. The information that follows is the OAP approved VCN nomenclature for ITW/AA
   systyems: A two-digit prefix (system identification) to denote the weapon system (or family
   of systems), the calendar year (CY) the version is initially planned to be implemented, the
   sequential number of the version for that CY, a suffix for the sequential number (when out-of
   cycle planning dictates a release between sequential numbers of the same CY), and, when
   applicable, a sequential designation for hardware only releases. A textual title is normally
   assigned to a version number to assist in summarizing and clarifying the number. See
   Table 3.1, ITW/AA Version Release Nomenclature. Hardware only versions do not
   require the use of the hardware only designation, rather use a hardware only designation to
   add clarity to version tracking. The numbering scheme is used by the WRVB secretariat to
 14                                                         21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


   ensure proper tracking of version and contents within the SCF database. Although versions
   are planned for sequential implementation according to the nomenclature, a variety of unique
   situations may require non-sequential implementation. Such occurrences should be the
   exception rather than the rule.

  Monitor Replacement       Textual Title (Optional)
3.2. Implementation. The operational community supports SPO implementation of change
projects. Support includes attending and evaluating information presented at design reviews, TO
reviews, Technical Interchange Meetings, and other development activities as they occur.
Support also includes communicating current status of change projects to 21 SW leadership.
3.3. Amending a change project. Once approved, a change project can only be modified when
mission failure is deemed imminent if the project proceeds without such a change. A project is
not amended because it is a convenient time to include a routine or any other change or
modification. Modification may include adding or removing one or more previously approved
individual change proposals to the project.
3.4. Milestone Schedule. The SPO provides a milestone schedule as soon as possible after a
change project is approved. The schedule includes all activities up to and including operational
acceptance. Unit’s use this schedule to deconflict with operational priorities when providing
their downtime schedule inputs. When operational activities must take priority, the operations
units work with the SPO to ensure minimal impact to the milestone schedule.
3.5. Mission System Activities (MSA). The MSA is the name given to a compilation of project
information associated with units undergoing weapon system changes. 21 OSS maintains the
MSA. 21 OG units provide information to support accurate accounting of changes affecting
their system(s). A unit’s close, recurring coordination with the SPO is essential to ensure the
most up to date MSA information is provided in a timely way. 21 SW leadership uses MSA
information. MSA information includes a summary of change(s) documented in terms of
mission capability or sustainment requirement as well as the specific dates associated with
various phases of a change project (e.g., formal on-site DT&E, OT&E, ICE, TP, etc.).
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                       15

                                   TEST AND EVALUATION

4.1. General. The SPO’s project implementation schedule, combined with operational
requirements, drives testing milestones when implementing a change project. Implementation
schedules are coordinated to ensure operational requirements are met with minimal impact to
change projects. In all cases, the unit/deployment commander must retain overall responsibility
for safety, security, and the mission of the system at all times. A statement to this effect must be
included in all ICE plans.
4.2. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Testing must consider ORM. 21 OG units
identify risks and mitigating factors directly within an ICE plan. Risk that cannot be fully
mitigated must be acceptable by the commander of the unit associated with the operational
mission. The unit commander’s signature on the ICE plan verifies acceptance of residual risk.
4.2.1. Uncertified ITW/AA Software. ITW/AA software that has yet to be certified by
USSTRATCOM for unrestricted operational use must be carefully controlled using unit-
established two-person control procedures. See paragraph 5.2 “Restricted Operational Use”.
4.3. Test Plan Approval. Tests involving 21 SW weapon systems will occur with an approved
plan. Forms of testing that require a plan include: DT&E, OT&E, ICE, demonstrations,
experiments, studies, beta, prototype, or first article testing, radar frequency verification testing,
information assurance testing, high altitude electromagnetic pulse, shielding effectiveness, other
contractor testing, etc. Any agency that plans to conduct testing with an operational asset must
obtain 14 AF approval to use an operational asset by sending a test plan prior to test execution
IAW AFSPCI 99-103. As directed in AFSPCI 99-103, when the required operational asset is
under the Operational Control of another Combatant Command (COCOM), the Numbered Air
Force Commander will coordinate with that COCOM for approval or to obtain their assistance
with another Combatant Command. An operational asset is defined as any AFSPC system,
component, or unit used to conduct or support an AFSPC or Air Force mission. In order to
ensure adequate time for approval, originators should submit a test plan to 14 AF no later than 60
duty days prior to the test start date. 21 OG is the final approval authority for ICE plans
submitted by 21 OG units for use by 21 OG units that operate systems assigned to 21 OG, 14
AF approval is not required to execute an approved ICE plan.
4.4. Integrated Test Team (ITT). The ITT works together as a cross-functional team to map
out the test and evaluation strategies and activities across the lifecycle of sensor systems and is
the central focal point to enable integrated testing. The Sensor Support ITT (SS-ITT) oversees
and coordinates test activities and test product development and provides advice on test activities
to acquisition and operational decision makers. The SS-ITT objective is to provide an efficient
test process for acquisition and sustainment programs. The ITT construct ensures representation
from testing communities and key stakeholders (e.g., users, operators, requirements sponsors,
developing contractors, other services, etc.). Co-chair organizations for the SS-ITT are the
17 TS and ESC. There are numerous organizations represented as core members including
21 OG. Other members may be added on an ad hoc basis to resolve issues as they arise.
21 OG/TD represents 21 OG for the ITT.
 16                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


4.5. Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E). The SPO is the LTO for DT&E. DT&E
may be conducted in a variety of environments ranging from in-plant or mock-up systems to
tests using the operational system. All reasonable and prudent measures must be taken to
safeguard operational systems, therefore, on-site testing using the operational system will only
occur when all other avenues for testing a given change or set of changes has been exhausted,
however, final DT&E is normally done on the operational system. 21 OG commonly refers to
this final stage of DT&E as formal, on-site DT&E. All testing that occurs before formal on-site
DT&E is considered ―pre-DT&E activities‖ by 21 OG. The SPO Program Manager certifies in
writing to the LTO (21 OG/CC for ICE) that the system has successfully completed DT&E.
4.6. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). The Air Force Operational Test and
Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) is the Air Force level OT&E organization and the 17th Test
Squadron (17 TS) is the AFSPC-level OT&E organization. When the ITT deems appropriate,
and when HQ AFSPC concurs, fielded 21 SW systems typically undergo a category of OT&E
called Force Development Evaluation (FDE). The 17 TS conducts FDE for many 21 SW
systems.
4.7. Installation Checkout and Evaluation (ICE). ICE is a wing-level operations checkout.
Any system change that does not undergo OT&E will normally undergo ICE. A 21 OG unit is
considered the LTO for ICE. The commander of the unit responsible for operating a weapon
system is also responsible for planning and conducting ICE to ensure the weapon system
continues to meet operational requirements and that is remains supportable as fielded with the
change(s). A 21 OG approved ICE plan gives the authorization to conduct ICE. ICE plans that
impact DSC2-D will have Det 1/CC, 614 AOC and Det 1/CC, 20 SPCS as signatories and will
be approved by 21 OG/TD. Commanders ensure ICE results are captured and documented in an
ICE report.
   4.7.1. The LTO (a 21 OG unit) prepares the ICE plan. For GEODSS detachments and other
   units where on-site O&M is contracted, the plan is prepared by the contractor under the
   direction of the unit commander. 21 OSS maintains an ICE Writing Guide for units to use
   when developing ICE plans. The plan is drafted to include a broad range of traditional
   operating parameters associated with the system undergoing change. It may also include an
   evaluation of change specific change parameters when necessary to ensure the system
   performs or retains specific new or changed operating conditions. The plan must provide
   sufficient standardized information so all test personnel, approval authorities, and reviewers
   can understand objectives, risk and mitigation, evaluation methodology, assumptions,
   limitations, etc. When areas of an ICE plan are deemed unnecessary those areas should be
   labeled ―Not Applicable‖ rather than omitted such that they will clearly indicate they have
   been considered. The ICE plan will be formatted to include information contained in the ICE
   writing guide maintained by 21 OSS.
4.8. Installation Checkout and Evaluation (ICE) Completion Reporting. When conducted, a
quick-look summary of the ICE is included in TPRP entry or exit briefings. Information must
include an overview of findings and an assessment of the system’s ability to meet operational
requirements under the changed configuration. Explain any exceptions and include an
assessment of the suitability of any changed procedures, checklists, maintenance support,
documentation, and any other change requirements. The information provided must be sufficient
to facilitate an assessment of the readiness to enter or exit TP. The quick-look assessment is
followed by a final ICE report. For ITW/AA systems, final signed reports are sent to
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                  17


USSTRATCOM/J65 for use in a certification decision. Providing the ice report within 21 duty
days will prevent a delayed certification decision can lead to delay in removing legacy
equipment. The final ICE report should be formatted to address the following areas:
   4.8.1. Executive Summary. A high level overview which includes a brief discussion of the
   purpose of the test, a description of the system being tested, relevant background associated
   with the purpose of the test, a summary of the COIs tested, an overview of the DRs with
   successful corrections and disposition and a recommendation for operational acceptance and
   certification.
   4.8.2. List of Tables. Include when use of tables will clarify information.
   4.8.3. Section I – Introduction. General test related information, purpose and background,
   system specific information, a description of the operational environment, a review of the
   program structure under which testing occurred, an ICE description, limitation and planning
   considerations, and the reporting methodology.
   4.8.4. Section II – Summary of Results. Identify and descibe the COIs and all associated
   objectives, scope and test concept, planning considerations and limitations, system contractor
   involvement, ICE schedule and readiness requirements.
   4.8.5. Section III – Detailed Analysis Results. Describe the method used for data collection,
   the results and the key findings for each COI. The COI should include MOPs and MOEs
   with ratings.
   4.8.6. Section IV – Deficiencies. Include priority, category/priority, title, capability, and
   status.
   4.8.7. Section V – Conclusions/Recommendations. Describe associated reports, briefings,
   DRs and enhancements.
   4.8.8. Abbreviations and Acronyms.
4.9. Combined Testing. DT&E, OT&E, and ICE are separate and distinct activities, but the
resources needed to conduct and support the testing efforts are often similar. Much of the test
data generated by each is beneficial to all PTOs. Therefore, for some modifications, combined
testing may be conducted to minimize resources or mission down time. For combined testing,
the necessary test conditions and data collection requirements may be captured in a single plan,
or in separate plans. Results are normally analyzed and reported independently.
4.10. Test Objective Worksheet (TOW). For ITW/AA systems, a TOW provides information
to arrange tests with Cheyenne Mountain and other participating organizations. The LTO will
submit a TOW for each Cat A, B, F, and G test, IAW NI 10-3. If DT&E and OT&E are
combined, PTOs will decide which organization is the LTO for purposes of TOW development.
When ICE is conducted in lieu of OT&E and category testing is required, category testing will
be accomplished concurrently with DT&E, and the LTO for TOW development will be the
DT&E organization. The LTO will must submit the draft TOW to 721 MSG/TC.

                                          Chapter 5

                                      TRIAL PERIOD

5.1. Trial Period (TP). A TP demonstrates to all levels of command that the unit/system can
perform its designed operational mission(s) over time. TP follows successful completion of
DT&E, OT&E, or ICE, and either resolution or other proper disposition for all identified
deficiencies that may have been identified prior to TP entry. System performance criteria which
cannot be gathered during testing or ICE can be collected during TP to support an operations
acceptance recommendation. The length of the TP is determined by the scope of a system
change. An operational unit undergoing a change may recommend duration for TP, but in all
cases it will not be less than 72 hours. For ITW/AA systems, unless HQ AFSPC/A3 or the
AFSPC OAP grants permission in advance, a TP may not start on any Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
on a U.S. government holiday, or the day prior to a U.S. government holiday. U.S. federal
holidays can be obtained by searching the internet site www.opm.gov for ―holidays‖. 21 OSS
may assist in coordinating approval for exceptions.
   5.1.1. ITW/AA TP Coordination. ITW/AA units wishing to enter trial period must provide
   the following information to 21 OSS a minimum of 10 duty days prior to the desired start of
   TP for subsequent coordination with the operations acceptance organization (i.e., HQ
   AFSPC/A3 or the AFSPC OAP) and others: change project number or title (e.g., VCN);
   recommended TP duration; identification of a fallback position, including previously ops
   accepted change project number and or title when applicable or the
   hardware/communications fallback method; the time required to successfully implement the
   fallback process. For ITW/AA systems, 21 OSS will forward information to the AFSPC
   OAP using an OAP provided TP coordination worksheet no later than 7 duty days prior to
   the planned start of TP.
   5.1.2. Trial Period Review Panel (TPRP). The TPRP will convene prior to TP entry and
   again prior to TP exit. For short duration TPs, an approval to exit may be granted at the TP
   entry, contingent upon successful TP. 21 OSS will secure TP chairpersons, teleconference
   information, and disseminate meeting information to the membership. Membership may
   include (but is not limited to) representation from the operations acceptance authority (e.g.,
   HQ AFSPC/A3 or the AFSPC OAP), other HQ AFSPC organizations, USSTRATCOM, 14
   AF, the SPO, 21 OG, 21 OSS, the unit commander or designated representative, the LTO,
   and any representation needed to sufficiently validate quality of operational of weapon
   system data (e.g., HQ AFSPC/A9, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC),
   Missile Defense Agency, Missile Correlation Center, etc.). The Commander, Det 1, 614
   AOC will co-chair TPRPs impacting DSC2-D.
       5.1.2.1. 21 OSS maintains a standardized template for use by 21 OG units for TP entry
       and TP exit briefings. At least 2 duty days prior to a TPRP, the unit undergoing a change
       will provide completed briefing slides to 21 OSS. During the TPRP meeting, the unit
       commander, operations officer, or other designated briefer provides summary facts
       relating to trial period success, and, for TP exit briefings, provides an operations
       acceptance recommendation to the operations acceptance authority. Based on the unit’s
       recommendation, the TPRP chairperson provides an official memo to the operational
       acceptance authority (e.g., AFSPC OAP, etc.) to enter or exit TP and the TPRP
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                  19


      chairperson approves TP entry when authority to do so is delegated from the operational
      acceptance authority.
      5.1.2.2. 21 OG units factually report on an assessment (by proper authority) of mission
      data quality, quantity, and transmission timeliness as an integral component of all TP
      entry and TP exit briefings. Also, depending on specific missions assigned, weapon
      system effects validation may be required from other external sources. Assessment
      results in each of these areas must be obtained through pre-coordination with a proper
      source. Units must use caution to ensure they represent source information accurately.
      The proper source will have the means to accurately measure against system
      requirements and/or historical performance. Assessment is required for each of the
      following data types, depending on specific mission(s) assigned.
          5.1.2.2.1. ITW/AA Messages. When a specific system change has potential to
          impact ITW/AA message formats or transmission timelines, a category test is
          conducted.    ITW/AA message transmission and receipt is validated against
          requirements by the RTO. The RTO is a valid source for information used to
          populate TPRP entry or exit briefing slides for ITW/AA data.
          5.1.2.2.2. Metric Space Surveillance Observation (METOB) Messages. The primary
          source for METOB quality assessment is HQ AFSPC/A9. In some cases, an
          assessment may be made by JSpOC personnel. These sources look at a wide variety
          of criteria depending on a given change and they are the ONLY authorized sources
          for METOB quality assessment. HQ AFSPC/A9 may offer 21 OG units a
          standardized way to request METOB quality assessments.
          5.1.2.2.3. Space Object Identification (SOI) Messages. In most cases, receipt of the
          standard SOI data quality message from NASIC will suffice as the proper authority
          for SOI assessment. For proper reporting in the TPRP, unit-level experts will use the
          unit's historical SOI response performance as a baseline measure for SOI performance
          following a given change. If a specific change requires more detailed SOI
          assessment, or if the unit, developer, or operational tester observes questionable or
          ambiguous SOI response information, they should contact the NASIC POC listed on
          the SOI quality response message and request assistance with detailed analysis of the
          issue.
          5.1.2.2.4. Unit-level experts assess the ability of a 21 OG mission system to receive
          mission messages each time a system change has potential to impact receipt.
   5.1.3. A unit may exit trial period for cause including mission failure or severe degradation.
   Prior to entering TP a unit will identify fallback plans for such cases. Fallback may include
   restoring previously operationally accepted version of software or a previously operationally
   accepted hardware configuration, or both. Fallback plans are briefed to the TPRP as part of
   the TP entry briefing. The decision to implement a fallback plan is made by the operational
   unit commander. When the decision is made to fallback, notification is made to the
   operational command and control organization, the operations approval authority, and to 21
   OG.
5.2. Restricted Operational Use. System hardware/software configurations can be used to
support operational missions during TP (and following operational acceptance, but before
 20                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


certification for ITW/AA systems). During this time, the system is considered approved for
―restricted operational use‖ meaning sufficient test results, operational safeguards, and other
prudent and reasonable measures necessary are in place to prevent erroneous data transmission.
During periods of restricted operational use, ITW/AA systems must be capable of being returned
to the most recently certified configuration. When making a specific change would prevent a
system from being returned to a certified pre-change configuration, USSTRATCOM/J65 is the
waiver authority. Similarly, USSTRATCOM/J65 is also the waiver authority when pre-change
equipment must be removed prior to certification of the new configuration.
5.3. Training and Documentation. A unit will not enter TP until all personnel are trained and
have the proper technical documentation. IAW AFI 63-101 and TO 00-5-3 formatted
Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs) shall be verified during DT&E. When combining DT&E
and OT&E (or ICE), accomplish PTO verification during OT&E or ICE with HQ AFSPC
concurrence and approval of the SPO. Only formal TOs or verified PTOs shall be used during
OT&E and TP. PTOs may be used for initial development of training plans and course
syllabuses. 21 SW organizations may only use preliminary technical data for hands-on training,
operations, or maintenance provided such documents have been verified and authorized by the
SPO (or representative) along with concurrence from HQ AFSPC. Authorization for the use of
preliminary data shall not exceed 180 days unless readdressed. An authorization memorandum
must accompany the preliminary data at all times. Verification status pages shall be included in
all TOs and PTOs that contain unverified procedures to ensure they are not used for operations or
maintenance on systems used in an operational environment.
21SWI63-202 21 November 2011                                                                     21


                                            Chapter 6

                                DEFICIENCY PROCESSING

6.1. Deficiency Review Board (DRB). The DRB provides a forum for discussing deficiencies
encountered during system change processes. All organizations and individuals involved with
system changes have a responsibility to identify deficiencies. A DRB may be called at any point
in the change implementation process. The primary purpose of the DRB is to prevent abnormal
system response or indications from impacting mission execution. The primary activity of the
DRB is to evaluate anomalous system behavior, assign (or update) a problem category and
subcategory IAW AFTO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution
System, and facilitate resolution or other appropriate disposition. The SPO has the responsibility
to maintain a database for collecting, storing, processing, and reporting DRs and watch items. A
contractor may elect to establish and chair a reporting board independent of this guidance
according to its own internal practices for test activities prior to formal, on-site DT&E (i.e.,
during beta and/or prototype testing, dry run DT&E, etc.). The SPO, at the beginning of formal
on-site DT&E will evaluate all open contractor development problems, board such problems as
potential deficiencies, and, as a result of the boarding process enter deficiencies and watch items
into the government’s deficiency reporting system. For a deficiency a 21 OG unit discovers
during TP or ICE, the unit will brief the deficiency and recommend a category and priority using
a standardized DRB briefing template maintained by 21 OSS.
   6.1.1. Deficiency Review Board (DRB) Process. During a DRB meeting the membership
   will discuss facts that should lead to a decision about the proposed DR(s). The chairperson
   will work toward consensus of the membership. If agreement on the categorization cannot
   be reached, the DRB chair will make the final decision. A DRB chair does not have to side
   with the majority. Any DRB member or consulting organization may officially disagree with
   the approved DR category/subcategory or disposition. The dissenting member or
   organization may elect to notify the chairperson, in writing, identifying specific cases and
   supporting rationale. Contractor representatives may attend DRB meetings, as necessary, to
   assist in understanding deficiencies, corrective actions, and verification. The chairperson
   will ensure all required participants are aware of scheduled meetings and provide a record for
   meetings held.
   6.1.2. Deficiency Report (DR). A DR is a written record that documents a deficiency, fault,
   failure, anomalous condition, or incorrect behavior of a mission system. A DR is considered
   a candidate until it is discussed and approved by a DRB. A candidate DR may be created
   and submitted for a variety of identified problems including, but not limited to: technical
   performance, operational effectiveness, operational suitability, reliability, compatibility,
   integration, interoperability, safety, vulnerability, survivability, human factors, difficulty of
   operations or maintenance, expense of operations or maintenance, design, utility,
   maintainability, logistics supportability, reparability, quality, security, and environmental
   impact. The written record should contain the following information: proposed title; name
   of originator (and screener or reviewer); date of occurrence or observation; failure symptom
   narrative/fault diagnosis; specific area of software or hardware component/assembly;
   summary of relevant operation or maintenance underway at occurrence; operational impact;
   workaround if any; recommended category and priority.
 22                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


   6.1.3. Watch Item (WIT). A WIT documents anomalous system behavior of unknown
   cause that manifests itself in an inconsistent, unrepeatable, or infrequent random manner. A
   WIT is brought to the attention of the DRB using the same form that is used for a candidate
   DR, but either the originator’s recommendation, or the decision of the board results in WIT
   determination rather than assignment of a category and priority. If a WIT reoccurs, it will be
   raised, categorized, and processed as a deficiency or closed if supporting information and
   DRB direction supports such action. When a WIT does not reoccur, it will remain open until
   specific DRB action directs closure. A WIT is closed as a result of DRB action following TP
   when a WIT identified as part of that change project does not recur.
6.2. DRB Membership. A DRB may consist of representatives from any or all of the
following: the operations unit(s), the SPO, 21 SW/SE, 21 OG, the PTO, USSTRATCOM,
AFSPC OAP, 14 AF, HQ AFSPC/A9, JSpOC, NASIC, and, for deficiencies related to the Royal
Air Forces (RAF) Fylingdales site, the RAF’s HQ Air Command. DRB members work together
to understand failures that impact the ability of a system to perform its assigned mission(s).
DRB members discuss a deficiency in order to assign a category and priority and to determine
when the status of a DR should be changed (e.g., closed, a WIT to a DR, etc.). DRB members
collaborate on ways to minimize or prevent mission impact when specific fix actions are
unavailable (i.e., workaround). Care must be taken so a planned workaround does not result in
unintended consequences while trying to temporarily overcome a deficiency. The operational
unit must agree that any workaround is acceptable before a final implementation decision.
   6.2.1. DRB Chairperson. The chairperson is dependent upon the specific implementation
   activity (i.e., DT&E, OT&E, ICE, or TP) in progress at the time the deficiency is identified.
   Table 6.1. DRB Chairperson, identifies the association between activity and chairperson.
   The DRB chairperson is responsible for arranging the DRB meeting and for distributing
   documented results.

6.3. DR Life Cycle. The following description is a broad overview of the typical life cycle of a
DR. When required, variants to the process may be used, as long as technical orders and other
instructions will not be violated.
   6.3.1. Initial Identification. A deficiency can be documented and reported by anyone
   associated with the system undergoing a change. The person who does this is the originator.
   The originator must record sufficient details including the conditions under which the
   deficiency was observed. The originator provides the candidate DR to the DRB chairperson
   who schedules participants for discussion.
   6.3.2. Initial DRB Review and DR Analysis. The candidate DR is discussed at the DRB
   meeting where a category and priority may be assigned. The DRB may also reject or defer a
   candidate DR. A DR is deferred when an apparent problem exists but lacks sufficient
   mission impact for categorization. Identification of specific root cause is not a valid reason
   to defer. If a DR is deferred, the chairperson may request the originator, the SPO, or other
   participating organization to provide additional information. After a DR is categorized it is
   considered ―open‖ until specific action is taken to withdraw or close it. The chairperson may
   ask the SPO or other participating organization to determine root cause and/or recommend a
   fix for an open DR.
   6.3.3. Follow-up DRB. The chairperson may call a follow-up DRB meeting to reassess
   mission impact for a deferred DR or to determine if root cause or fix action will meet
   requirements. When a deficiency is deemed an emergency, the chair will normally require a
   fix before a change project is allowed to proceed to a subsequent phase (e.g., from DT&E to
   ICE, or from OT&E to TP, etc.). If the DRB does not concur with the analysis or
   recommended fix, then the status will remain as ―Open‖ and the responsible organization will
   provide updates at subsequent follow-up DRB meetings.
   6.3.4. Resolution and Verification. When a fix is directed, it is implemented and tested
   before the chairperson calls a DRB to determine if the fix satisfies the problem causing the
   deficiency. A DR remains open until technical documentation and training associated with a
   fix is complete.
   6.3.5. DR Closure. A deficiency can be closed when the DRB chairperson recognizes the
   fix satisfies the problem causing the deficiency. A deficiency may also be closed when it is
   prioritized as less than an emergency and an AF Form 1067 or SCF data sheet is used to
   document the need for future action.
 24                                                           21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


                                           Chapter 7

       DEPOT-LEVEL MAINTENANCE (DLM) FOLLOW UP REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Depot-Level Maintenance (DLM) Process. When an unsafe condition or mission
impacting deficiency arises, units use all available in-house resources to resolve problems before
DLM support is requested. The unit commander may authorize interim actions necessary to
prevent loss of life and/or retain mission capability. Emergency actions must correct or
minimize the condition such that the maintenance performed is acceptable to the mission
commander. Units should follow TO 00-25-107 and TO 00-25-108 when processing DLM
requests.
7.2. Follow-up Requirements. When actions taken to resolve deficiencies represent a change
to an operationally accepted system baseline, standard mission system change processes
described in this instruction must be followed to ensure the changed baseline is accurately
documented, controlled, tested, and accepted for operations. For EDLMs, change control
processes described in this instruction may be followed after repair actions have begun or are
implemented. All remaining activities normally associated with the change process must be
accomplished as soon as possible after the emergency declaration is made. In all cases, change
integration testing and all normally required data analysis must be conducted and results
available before the system can be used operationally. Such information must be made available
to the community via TPRP before the system can enter TP. OT&E or ICE may be performed
after the system has entered TP when there is significant justifiable operational need to restore
the mission and only after the SPO regression testing and data analysis can otherwise
substantiate a reasonable expectation of mission success. Circumstances for operational need
must be justified by appropriate data customers.

                 ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL SOFTWARE CHANGES

8.1. Organizational-Level Software Change Control Process. This chapter outlines the
approval processes for organizational-level weapon system changes. Various 21 SW systems
have the ability to conditionally change a software parameter known as a SAP according to the
following process in order to meet mission requirements. Implementation of an organizational-
level change is the responsibility of the system operator; however the SPO must be aware of all
changes made to a configuration controlled system. Units will maintain an approved list of
potential SAP change parameters from which to choose based on situational criteria. The unit
must coordinate with the SPO in advance to create the SAP change listing. The URVB
recommends approval of the listing to the WRVB. The WRVB approves or disapproves items
on the unit list. To enable changes from the approved list, a unit will use a 21 SW Form 1,
Organizational-Level Software Change Form to follow the SAP change process. Before making
a change, an originator submits a 21 SW Form 1 to the URVB/SRVB for review/approval then to
21 OSS and the SPO for coordination. Before making a change that is required within 10 duty
days, the originator completes the form, the URVB/SRVB approves or disapproves, the
originating organization implements and verifies it, and submits the documentation to 21 OSS.
21 OSS provides the form to the SPO for information. The following paragraphs provide
additional specific guidance for units to use when following the organizational-level software
change process.
8.2. For a SAP change that is required within 10 duty days to meet unique mission
performance objectives, the unit will hold a URVB/SRVB to validate the change. Validated
SAP changes are implemented and verified by the unit. The URVB documents a validated
change requirement on the Organizational-Level Software Change Form and forwards it to 21
OSS and the unit’s SPO representative.
   8.2.1. 21 OSS will forward applicable SAP change forms to the 614 AOC/CN office for
   situational awareness.
8.3. For a SAP change outside of a 10-day window, the unit will hold a URVB to validate
the proposed change. The URVB documents a validated change requirement on the
Organizational-Level Software Change Form and forwards it to 21 OSS and the unit’s SPO
representative.
   8.3.1. The SPO conducts impact analysis, coordinates with the 614 AOC/CN if necessary,
   and returns an assessment via the Organizational-Level Software Change Form to 21 OSS
   and the unit.
   8.3.2. If the SPO recommendation is to NOT implement the SAP change, the URVB must
   re-evaluate the proposal, to assess alternative approaches, or to follow the standard (depot-
   level) change control process outlined in this document to ensure system integrity.
   8.3.3. On-site O&M personnel validate SAP changes. The unit updates and archives
   Organizational-Level Software Change Form. The unit provides a final copy to 21 OSS and
   to the unit’s SPO representative.
26                                                   21SWI63-202 21 November 2011

Terms
Change Priority.—An initial assessment (before wing scoring/ranking) of the general urgency
of a proposed change.
Emergency.—A change priority reserved for changes or problems demanding immediate
resolution, such as serious compromise of national security, fatal or serious injury to personnel,
and extensive loss of or damage to equipment. The proposed change(s) are required to be
operational as soon as possible because they prevent fulfillment of the assigned sensors or
system mission.
Urgent.—A change priority used to correct problems that cause serious degradation of a sensor
or system mission. Urgent changes are implemented to prevent serious degradation of mission,
injury to personnel, and loss of or damage of equipment.
Routine.—Priority assigned to all configuration changes that do not meet the criteria for
emergency or urgent.
Configuration Control.—The systematic process used to validate requirements, and to approve
and implement changes in a baselined configuration of weapon system hardware or software.
Configuration control begins with the establishment of the physical and functional baseline and
continues throughout the life of a system.
Configuration Item (CI).—An aggregation of hardware or software that satisfies an end use
function and is designated by the government for separate configuration management.
Configuration Management (CM).—A discipline applying technical and administrative
direction and surveillance to identify and document the functional and physical characteristics of
a system; control changes to a system and its documentation; and also to record and report
change processing and implementation status.
ITW/AA Systems: For the purposes of this instruction, ITW/AA systems are those systems
designated by NORAD or USSTRATCOM as having to following NI 10—3, SI 534-22.
Operational Acceptance.—A decision made by HQ AFSPC/A3 (or delegated authority), based
upon successful completion of a TP and based on 21 OG recommendation, to use a changed
system operationally and, in the case of ITW/AA systems, use changed software pending
certification by USSTRATCOM/J65.
Site Adaptable Parameter (SAP). A SAP is a unique, software selectable parameter for a
system that can be used for optimization, geolocation, calibrations, or other capability
refinement. A listing of potential SAP changes is pre—coordinated with the SPO, maintained
by the unit, reviewed by the URVB, and approved by the WRVB.
Standard Change Form (SCF).—One of the forms used by ITW/AA systems to propose
hardware, software, firmware, or communications media changes.
System Program Office (SPO).—As used in this instruction, can mean any of the following:
System Program Director, System Program Organization Manager, Product Group Manager,
System Manager, Single Manager, Sustainment Manager, or acquisition program manager and
any of these designated representative. Within the 21 SW the SPO is normally either a Space
and Missile Systems Center (SMC) or Electronic Systems Center representative.
 32                                                          21SWI63-202 21 November 2011


Trial Period—(TP). Demonstrates to the operations commander that the unit/system can
perform its designed operational mission(s). The length of this TP may vary significantly and, in
some cases, may not exist at all (in cases where the TP may have occurred prior to or during the
OT&E). Each system’s TP length should be defined in the system’s ORD or by its ICT. TP
ends when AFSPC/CC declares IOC.
Two—person Control. For ITW/AA systems, any combination of military or civilian personnel
who can verify correct data line or system configuration and simulation (SIM) media handling
procedures to ensure system safety, validity, and integrity. Two people are required for SIM
media release from or return to storage. Two people are required to perform coordinated actions
to mount and load SIM media into the sensor system.
Universal Control Number (UCN).—An alphanumeric code assigned to each system
controlled by the ITW/AA system change proposal database, used to help identify and track the
change through the approval and implementation process.
