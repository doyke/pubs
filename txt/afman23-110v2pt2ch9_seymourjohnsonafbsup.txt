SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The supplement reflects changed office symbols and responsibility of the transportation action
requirement/Supply discrepancy report program.       Removed requisition override record
(modifier) E -- HAZPHARMCY.
9.6.2. Local Purchase Requisition Reconciliation. Assets are now purchased through either
Government purchase card (GPC) or coded mission standard report designator, due to stockage
 2               AFMAN23-110V2P2CH9_ SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP 17 MAY 2011


reduction initiative, and ordered through non-contracting avenues. The quarterly reconciliation
requirements are therefore deleted.
9.7.7. Report of discrepancy (ROD)/supply discrepancy report (SDR) process (Standard
Form 364). Customer Support (LGRMC) is responsible for preparing, controlling, filing,
submitting, and follow-up actions on supply discrepancy reports. Refer to AFMAN 23-110 V2
P2 C10, Physical Asset Management, and AFJMAN 23-215 for more information.
9B5.1.1. General Requisition Serial Number Assignment. Off-line requisition serial
numbers are assigned as follows: (1) 9800-9815 -- Customer Support (4 LRS/LGRMC); (2)
9816-9825 -- Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) (4 LRS/LGRMSA); (3) 9826-9839 --
Registered Equipment Manager (REM) (4 LRS/LGRVM); and 9840-9849 -- Reserved for future
use. A requisition register will be maintained for assigned off-line requisition numbers in each
applicable flight/element. The register will include the requisition number, stock number,
quantity and routing identifier.

9B11.1. Purpose. Customer Support (LGRMC) will keep letters on file supporting assignment
of locally assigned requisition exception notice codes and requisition modifier codes. Exception
codes and exception control records (ECC) must be maintained by the appropriate monitor.
Local requisition exception (REX) codes/modifiers will not be loaded or deleted without written
approval from the LGRMC. Due to the deletion of base support radio combat deployable stock
numbers, no REX code F will be loaded. Commander elects exception notice code P for REX
code 5. Local requisition override records (modifiers) are assigned below:

9B24.6. Calendars. Due to reorganization and deletion of base service store, neither method is
used. Base requirements are obtained with the use of the GPC.

9B24.8. Field Maintenance (JBD), Training Aid Fabrication (JBT), Base Civil
Engineering (JBE) and Industrial Fund (JBI) Activity Locally Manufactured Items. All
local manufacture functions/processes are the responsibility of maintenance.

9B24.24.1. Demo DRMO Withdrawal Policy. Procedures are covered in AFMAN 23-110
Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 1-10_Seymour-Johnson AFB Supplement, Paragraph 3.16.1.

9B24.24.2. DRMO Withdrawal Authorization. Customer Support (LGRMC) is authorized
to authenticate Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) withdrawals.

9B.24.27 Lateral Support Requisitioning. Lateral support and redistribution orders (RDO) are
a shared responsibility between 635/735 SCOG and LGRMC. 635/735 SCOG will process all
RDOs received through supply interface system. Any reject or management notice that 635/735
SCOG cannot clear, will be forwarded to LGRMC for research and clearance. 635/735 SCOG
performs lateral support checks to satisfy requirements and processes lateral support shipment
requests. LGRMC will accept and process all lateral support shipment requests during post-post.
LGRMC will notify the 635/735 SCOG or other theater SCOG when a lateral mission capability
(MICAP) is a warehouse refusal and take action to correct the out of balance condition. When no
shipment status is loaded, the 635/735 SCOG will refer bases performing manual follow-up on
processed lateral shipments to LGRMC for assistance.

9B.25.1 Purpose. 735 SCOG submits requisitions, performs follow-ups and sources MICAPs
and awaiting parts. The Flight Service Center will perform all time compliance technical order
kit follow-up action on kitted NSN(s) only. The MRSP will perform all linkage actions and
ensure all project codes and required delivery date are loaded and correct for kit due-outs.
