1. General. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training AF cybercrews
according to AFPD 10-17.
     1.1. Program Goals. The AF CTP ensures all cybercrew members obtain and maintain the
     certification/qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit’s mission.
     The objective of the CTP is to develop and maintain a high state of mission readiness for
     immediate and effective employment across the full range of military operations, while
     structuring each training mission to achieve optimum training experience.
        1.1.1. Cybercrews consist of individuals who conduct cyberspace operations and are
        assigned to a specific cyber weapon system. Personnel who perform cyberspace
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) functions do not fall under the
        purview of this instruction; training for these personnel is addressed in the 14-2XX series
        of AF Instructions.
        1.1.2. This AFI applies to cybercrew positions that are designated mission ready/combat
        mission ready (MR/CMR) in guidance provided by the lead major command. Personnel
        filling MR/CMR positions at the 624 OC and the 960 CyOG-Det 1 (854th Command
        Control Squadron (CSS) (AFRC)) will adhere to guidance in Paragraphs 1 through
        1.3.5.6, and applicable Lead MAJCOM provided policy and guidance.
        1.1.3. Individuals who perform cyberspace support functions but are not assigned to a
        MR/CMR crew position within a weapon system follow the Quality Assurance policy in
        AFI 33-150, Management of Cyberspace Support Activities, and/or AFI 36-2201, Air
        Force Training Program, as applicable.
     1.2. Waiver Authority. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
     publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the
     compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a
     description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers
     as described in this paragraph.

     1.2.1. HQ USAF/A3C/A6C is the waiver authority for this instruction. Unless otherwise
     noted in this AFI, HQ USAF/A3C/A6C delegates waiver authority to HQ AFSPC/A3T.
     Waivers will be granted on an individual and controlled basis. Waiver authority for this
     AFI may not be further delegated.
     1.2.2. Forward all waiver requests via email through the applicable Group/CC, NAF/A3
     or NAF/OV (as applicable), to HQ AFSPC/A3T. Describe the specific requirement and
     state the reason a waiver is required. Include risk management steps, as needed. Indicate
     when the waiver will no longer be required. Intermediate command levels will
     recommend approval or disapproval of the waiver request.
     1.2.3. If approved, waivers remain in effect for the life of the published guidance, unless
     HQ AFSPC/A3T specifies a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change
     that alters the basis for the waiver.
     1.2.4. AF Reserve Units. HQ AFRC/A3T is the waiver authority for this instruction for
     reserve units. AFSPC gained units will process waivers IAW paragraph 1.2 through their
     appropriate reserve group commander. The appropriate reserve group commander will
     submit waiver requests through 10 AF/A3 to HQ AFRC/A3T. HQ AFRC/A3T will

2. Qualification Training. This section defines cybercrew operational status and specifies
minimum training requirements for Initial Qualification Training (IQT) and Mission
Qualification Training (MQT).
   2.1. Cybercrew Operational Status. A cybercrew member may be assigned Basic Cyber
   Qualified (BCQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready/Combat Mission Ready
   (MR/CMR) status.
      2.1.1. Basic Cyber Qualified (BCQ). A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily
      completed IQT.
      2.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily
      completed IQT and MQT, but is not in fully-certified MR/CMR status. The cybercrew
      member must be able to attain MR/CMR status to meet operational taskings as specified
      in the applicable lead MAJCOM-provided guidance. BMC requirements will be
      identified in this lead MAJCOM-provided guidance.
      2.1.3. Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR). A cybercrew member who
      has satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, and maintains certification, currency and
      proficiency in the command or unit operational mission is MR. A cybercrew member
      who has satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, and maintains certification, currency
      and proficiency in the command or unit combat mission is CMR. Minimum requirements
      include:
          2.1.3.1. Completion of IQT, MQT, and a formal Stan/Eval evaluation.
          2.1.3.2. Certifying Official’s (first operational commander in the member’s chain of
          command, or his/her designee) certification as well as certification of completion of

          2.1.3.3. Once a certifying official (or his/her designee) certifies an individual as
          MR/CMR, the individual maintains MR/CMR status based on Continuation Training
          (CT) requirements identified in paragraph 3.
6                                                                 AFI10-1703V1 2 APRIL 2014


    2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). One or more courses covering system specific
    and/or positional specific training as a prerequisite to Mission Qualification Training (MQT).
       2.2.1. Method. Unless otherwise specified in applicable lead MAJCOM guidance, the
       primary method of IQT is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training
       course(s) listed in the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) found at
       https://etca.randolph.af.mil, USAF Formal Schools. Completing the appropriate formal
       course(s) satisfies all IQT requirements.
       2.2.2. In-Unit IQT. When formal course attendance is not practical or quotas are not
       available, units will request waivers as specified in the applicable lead MAJCOM-
       provided guidance, to conduct in-unit IQT, using formal school courseware (T-2).
       Approved in-unit training must be accomplished IAW applicable formal school
       courseware and the following guidance (T-2):
           2.2.2.1. Training lessons should be completed in order; however, if mission
           scheduling or student progress dictates otherwise, the unit commander or designee
           may change the order.
           2.2.2.2. Training syllabi will establish a maximum time lapse between training
           events. Failure to accomplish training as scheduled will require documentation and
           corrective action (T-2).
           2.2.2.3. With operations group commander (OG/CC) (or equivalent) approval, IQT
           requirements may be completed during operational missions under the supervision of
           an instructor certified on the task of like specialty. Comply with restrictions in
           appropriate lead MAJCOM-provided guidance, MAJCOM directives, and applicable
           operation orders (OPORD).
           2.2.2.4. Cybercrew members entered into in-unit IQT will be dedicated to that
           program (i.e., give training requirements priority over non-training related duties) (T-
           2). EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may continue their normal duties as time
           permits.
       2.2.3. IQT Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each cybercrew member
       must comply with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites prescribed in the
       applicable syllabus (T-2).
    2.3. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT prepares an individual for a successful
    formal evaluation. It focuses on filling training requirements not met at IQT, mastering local
    procedures, and increasing proficiency as needed. MQT ensures a smooth transition from
    IQT to MR/CMR status.
       2.3.1. Method. MQT is comprised of training at a Formal Training Unit (FTU), if
       applicable, and local training at the unit. Units will determine MQT training requirements
       in accordance with Lead MAJCOM policy and guidance (T-2). Cybercrew members
       entered into MQT will be dedicated to that program (i.e., give training requirements
       priority over non-training related duties) (T-2). EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel
       may continue their normal duties as time permits.
       2.3.2. MQT Prerequisites. Before entering MQT, each cybercrew member must
       successfully complete IQT requirements IAW para 2.2 if applicable (T-2).
AFI10-1703V1 2 APRIL 2014                                                                         7


       2.3.3. Time Limits. Training time limitations for MQT completion are contained in
       applicable lead MAJCOM-provided guidance. In-unit MQT will begin no later than 45
       days (90 days for the Air Reserve Component [ARC]) after reporting to a new duty
       station or unit, unless waived by the MAJCOM cybercrew training function (T-2).
   2.4. Requalification Training. A cybercrew member is considered unqualified upon loss of
   currency exceeding 6 months, expiration of his or her qualification evaluation, or completion
   of a qualification evaluation in a different weapon system (unless multiple qualification has
   been approved prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first. The duration of unqualified
   time is measured from the date the cybercrew member became unqualified until the specific
   retraining start date. An unqualified cybercrew member can requalify IAW the following:
       2.4.1. Loss of currency 6-12 months: Completion of training in all delinquent items (as
       applicable), additional training as directed by the certifying official and a requalification
       evaluation IAW AFI 10-1703 Volume 2.

       requalification evaluation IAW AFI 10-1703 Volume 2.
       2.4.3. Expiration of qualification evaluation not exceeding 6 months: Completion of
       training in all delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the
       certifying official, and a requalification evaluation AFI 10-1703 Volume 2.
       2.4.4. Expiration of qualification evaluation exceeding 6 months: Recompletion of MQT
       and a requalification evaluation IAW AFI 10-1703 Volume 2.
3. Continuation Training (CT). Training that provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned position and at
the designated certification/qualification level. This training is identified within the respective
lead MAJCOM-provided guidance.
   3.1. Currency. Currency requirements for cybercrew members are identified within the
   respective lead MAJCOM-provided guidance.
   3.2. Recurrency Training. A cybercrew member is considered not current upon loss of
   currency as specified in the applicable lead MAJCOM-provided guidance. For loss of
   currency up to 6 months a cybercrew member must demonstrate proficiency with an
   instructor in all delinquent items (T-2).
   3.3. Responsibilities.
       3.3.1. Squadron Commander. The squadron commander or designated representative will
       ensure individuals receive training to successfully attain/maintain required
       certifications/qualifications, complete unit missions and maintain individual proficiency
       (T-2).
       3.3.2. Cybercrew Members. Each cybercrew member is responsible for monitoring and

4. Upgrade Training. Training needed to qualify to a cybercrew position of additional
responsibility for a specific weapon system (e.g., from a crew member to a crew commander).
See applicable lead MAJCOM-provided guidance for applicable positions, instructions, and
additional requirements.
5. Multiple Qualification.
     5.1. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one weapon system for
     crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is
     economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below the MAJCOM level,
     except for the Lead MAJCOM, which may further delegate within its command, but not
     lower than wing commander.
     5.2. Restriction on multiple qualification in para 5.1 does not apply to cybercrew members
     selected for reassignment to another weapon system who attend training prior to PCS.
6. Instructor Training and Certification. Instructors will complete appropriate training
program and certification requirements, as specified in the appropriate lead MAJCOM-provided
guidance (T-2). Instructor trainees will be observed and supervised by the Chief of Training (or
equivalent or their designee) (T-2). Instructors will be current and certified in any task they
instruct (T-2). At a minimum the training will consist of (T-2):
     6.1. Applicable equipment configuration and scheduling procedures (e.g., simulator and on-
     line equipment configuration, instruction scenario control procedures).
     6.2. Instructional System Development (ISD) process and procedures.
     6.3. Construction, conduct, and administration of classroom training as appropriate for the
     weapon system.
     6.4. Construction, conduct, and administration of simulator, ops floor, and field training as
     appropriate for the weapon system.
     6.5. Observance, at a minimum, of one certified instructor conducting training in the
     classroom, in the simulator, on the ops floor, and in the field, as appropriate for the weapon
     system.
7. Cybercrews Operating on Non-US Air Force Weapon Systems and/or with Non-US Air
Force Units. Air Force cybercrews performing appropriate duties on non-US Air Force systems,
or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for cyber operations, are only required to
maintain their training records.

Terms
Basic Cyber Qualified— A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT.
Basic Mission Capable— A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and
MQT, but is not in fully-certified MR/CMR status. The cybercrew member must be able to attain
MR/CMR status to meet operational taskings as specified in the applicable instructional
supplements. This status is primarily for individuals in units that perform weapon system-
specific operational support functions (i.e., formal training units, operational test and tactics
development). BMC requirements will be identified in the appropriate lead MAJCOM-provided
guidance.
Certification— Designation of an individual by the certifying official (or his/her designee) as

                               TRAINING DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Training development: Will define the special set of skills required for mission
accomplishment (T-2). Applicable published training standards establish the minimum training
task performance standards required and provide constraints for all performance scenarios. These
will include all tasks/subtasks, along with associated performance standards, conditions,
proficiency codes and applicable timing requirements (T-2). For standardization levels see AFI
10-1703v2, Cyberspace Operations Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Program.
   A2.1.1. Tasks Standard Level Descriptions. Three task standard levels will be used for each
   task: A, B, and C (T-2). All tasks/subtasks will be documented in a comprehensive task/sub-
   task list developed by the units, approved by the NAF, and coordinated through Lead
   MAJCOM/A3T (T-2).
A2.1.2. Level A/Critical task/sub-task. Critical tasks are tasks that could result in mission
failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury or death. Critical tasks have the greatest
potential for extreme mission or personnel impacts and drive the most stringent training and
evaluation program requirements. Critical tasks apply to time-sensitive tasks or tasks that must
be accomplished as expeditiously as possible without any intervening lower priority actions that
would, in the normal sequence of events, adversely affect task performance/outcome.
A2.1.3. Level B/Essential task/sub-task. Essential tasks are tasks deemed integral to the
performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and
mission execution. Essential tasks drive significant training requirements.
A2.1.4. Level C/Non-Essential task/sub-task. Non-Essential tasks are rudimentary or simple
tasks related to weapons system operations that by themselves have little or no impact on
mission execution. Non-Essential tasks require the least stringent training requirements.
A2.1.5. Ensure the requirements contain detailed givens/constraints, performance, and standards
for all critical tasks/subtasks (T-2).
A2.2. Use the sample Task/Subtask List: and task requirements tables on the next pages as
examples only.
A2.3. Table A. 2.1 is an example only. CCC is cyber crew commander, CA is Cyber Analyst,
and CO is Cyber Operator.
