PURPOSE: This Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) publication describes a theory and
philosophy of command and control (C2) for the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) in a
deployed environment. The intent is to describe how the AFMS can reach effective military
decisions and implement effective military actions faster than an adversary in any conflict setting
on any scale. In so doing, this publication provides a framework for all medics for the
development and exercise of effective C2 when deployed in support of military operations.
This publication represents a firm commitment by the AFMS to a bold, even fundamental shift in
the way it will view and deal with the dynamic challenges of C2, focusing on the direct
relationship between the AFMS and its Line of the Air Force (LAF) commanders.

APPLICATION: This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel
(including Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC] and Air National Guard [ANG] units and
members when deployed in Title 10 status). The doctrine in this document is authoritative but
not directive.

SCOPE: The AFMS must be able to rapidly respond to the full-spectrum of mission
requirements within the Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) construct. This document
provides airmen information on the overarching principles, processes, procedures, and
organizational framework through which the AFMS plans, directs, and executes the health
service support mission in deployed conditions. It does not address domestic response or in-
garrison C2. Although this TTP is written for Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETF)
in deployed settings, it has applicability across the spectrum of military operations.

                                         CHAPTER 1

                 ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction. To support the Expeditionary Air Force and global engagement
requirements, senior Line of the Air Force (LAF) and medical leadership must ensure command
and control (C2) infrastructures are in place, understood, and executable. Health Service Support
(HSS) C2 should be flexible, versatile, and capable of ensuring commanders and HSS personnel
receive the most current planning, pre-deployment, deployment, employment, and redeployment
information as well as associated post-deployment activities to support the warfighter. HSS
provides casualty care and management, force sustainment, force health protection, human
performance enhancement, and medical threat assessment in the area of operations (AO) (See
AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services for a further description of the Air Force Medical Service
[AFMS].)

    1.1.1. The following medical tenets apply to the guidance contained in this TTP:

       1.1.1.1. Sustainment of the Human Weapons System. HSS provides a broad range of
       services to ensure that personnel are physically and mentally prepared and sustained for
       contingency operations.

       1.1.1.2. Evacuate and Replace. HSS doctrine has evolved from a return to duty focus
       to an emphasis on evacuate and replace. The large theater medical infrastructure of
       contingency hospitals, fixed medical treatment facilities, and clinics has drawn down
       commensurate with overseas LAF forces. With this reduced medical footprint, the
       interface between HSS facilities, Patient Movement Requirement Centers (PMRC), and
       Service patient movement systems is even more critical.

    1.1.2. Headquarters Air Force Surgeon General (HQ AF/SG), and Major Command
    Surgeons (MAJCOM/SGs). HQ AF/SG and MAJCOM/SGs play an important role in HSS
    tactical doctrine. Each executes the medical portion of Service Department responsibilities
    under Title 10, United States Code to “organize, train and equip” to meet Combatant
    Commander requirements. Each provides trained, technically proficient, well-equipped and
    highly organized medical personnel to meet the mission requirements employed and
    sustained by the theater/deployed AFFOR/SG staff. The HSS policies and protocols for a
    theater of operations are directed by the AFFOR/SG. There is no relationship to parent or
    previously hosted command MAJCOM/SG policies or protocols.

1.2. Command and Control.

    1.2.1. C2 is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over
    assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2 functions are
    performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and
    procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling
    forces and operations for mission accomplishment. (Reference AFDD 2-8, Command and
    Control.) Key terms associated with C2 are in the glossary.
    AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                     5

        1.2.2. It is crucial that airmen understand their chain of command. For the medic,
        appropriate C2 achieves the unity of effort and integration required to meet support
        requirements across the entire spectrum of HSS operations. HSS resources, including
        money, manpower and materiel, are scarce and must be planned, deployed, and employed for
        the maximum operational effect. Deploying personnel should receive a chain of command
        briefing prior to deployment.

        1.2.3. LAF Command and Control of the AFMS. HSS C2 is vested through the LAF.
        From an independent duty medical technician (IDMT) serving in a remote site, to the
        commander of an Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH), to the Air Force Forces Surgeon
        (AFFOR/SG), all report to and are accountable to the LAF personnel at their level of
        command for execution of the HSS mission.
Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF). An AEF is an organizational structure composed of force
packages of capabilities that provides combatant commanders with rapid and responsive air and space
power. These force packages are tailored to meet specific needs across the spectrum of response options
and will deploy within an Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF), as Air Expeditionary Wings
(AEWs), Air Expeditionary Groups (AEGs) or Air Expeditionary Squadrons (AESs).

1.3. Joint Task Force Structure.

    1.3.1. Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). (See Figure 1) In any operation, a
    COMAFFOR is designated from the USAF and serves as the commander of USAF forces
    assigned and attached to the USAF component. USAF elements deployed in an
    expeditionary role are designated as an Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF).
    Normally, deployed forces come under the command of a Joint Force Commander (JFC)
    (See JP 3-0, Doctrine for Joint Operations).

    1.3.2. Special Staff: Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG). The AFFOR/SG, a corps-
    neutral medical officer usually at the rank of colonel, is a member of the COMAFFOR
    special staff and is the director of USAF health service operations. The AFFOR/SG is
    responsible for overall health resources management and provides information on health
    surveillance and risk assessments, sustainment, and other force health protection issues. The
    AFFOR/SG does not exercise command authority or direct control over medical forces, but
    provides a policy, planning, coordination, and oversight function for the combatant
    commanders.

1.4. Air and Space Expeditionary Wing. An Air and Space Expeditionary Wing (AEW) is a
deployed wing attached to an AETF by G-series orders. An AEW normally is composed of the
wing command element and two or more expeditionary groups. (See Figure 1.2).

The AEW commander has administrative control (ADCON) of all assigned AEW assets,
including medical support (except Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel—See paragraph
AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                     7

1.9).   C2 of HSS operations in joint and combined operations is defined in the
warning/execution/operations order.    The elements of medical support fall under the
Expeditionary Medical Group (EMG). AE assets fall under the Expeditionary Operations Group
(EOG), reference AE TTP 3-42.5 for further discussion. During deployments, understanding
who controls forces is critical. EMG/CC controls the fixed Medical Treatment Facility (MTF),
Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility, and Expeditionary Medical Support
(EMEDS)/AFTH. (See Figure 1.3).

1.5. Expeditionary Medical Group:

   1.5.1. Deployed Medical Commander (DMC). The DMC is the commander of the
   deployed HSS assets, designated on G-series orders specifically for the deployment and is
   responsible to the AEW commander for HSS of the deployed population. The DMC
   functions similarly to a medical group commander (MDG/CC), and exercises professional
   oversight of all assigned or attached Air Force medical personnel, including squadron
   medical elements (SMEs) and independent duty medical technicians (IDMTs). The DMC
   communicates and coordinates with the AFFOR Surgeon on theater medical support issues
   and with other joint and combined medical units at his location. If an EMEDS or AFTH
   facility is deployed to an existing site with a MTF), the DMC and the MDG/CC establish the
   framework for cooperative efforts among AF medical personnel.

   1.5.2. Squadron Medical Elements (SMEs) or Independent Duty Medical Technicians
   (IDMTs) With and Without Deployed Medical Facility Support. SMEs and IDMTs are
   under the C2 of LAF commanders; specifically, the commander of the unit to which they are
   assigned. However, while they report to their LAF commander, they are a part of and
   contribute a valuable resource to the overall medical capability of a base or operating
   location. As such, SME and IDMT personnel are under the professional guidance of the
   DMC (vice ADCON or tactical control [TACON]) when deployed along side an EMEDS or
   AFTH facility. In these instances, the DMC establishes the framework for cooperative
   efforts among Air Force medical personnel at the deployed location, ensuring a seamless and
   continuous medical support system for the warfighter. As the operations allow, the SMEs
   and IDMTs should be integrated into the day-to-day operation of the deployed medical
   facility, including sick-call coverage, mass immunizations, industrial/shop inspections, and
   other force health protection efforts. If no EMEDS/AFTH component is present, the
   senior medical member (i.e., SME or IDMT) present is responsible for coordinating
8                                                               AFTTP 3-42.1      14 MAY 2004

    health service support activities. If SMEs or IDMTs are deployed to an existing site with
    an MTF, the MDG/CC exercises medical/dental professional oversight of the SMEs and/or
    IDMTs. In these instances, the MDG/CC establishes the framework for cooperative efforts
    among Air Force medical personnel and communicating with the AFFOR Surgeon and
    MAJCOM/SG staff. (See AFI 48-149, Squadron Medical Elements for further details).

       Soon after arrival the US Army Command Surgeon for the Hungarian AOR called to
inform us that we reported to him. 60 AEW stated we reported to them and the 86th in
Ramstein AB asked us to report to them. We decided to report to the 60th but courtesy
copied the other units. The 74 ACS was also located in Budapest but with no flight surgeon
support. We volunteered to support their operations although they reported directly to 16
AF in Aviano AB.
       A published medical chain of command for reporting should be established prior to
deployment.
                                                  -Deployed Medical Commander in OEF



1.6. Aeromedical Evacuation.

    1.6.1. AFTTP 3-42.5, Aeromedical Evacuation describes AE command and control in detail.

    1.6.2. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Command and Control. C2 functions exercised
    over AE missions are consistent with those for all air mobility missions and are handled in
    accordance with the C2 structures described in JP 3-17, Joint Doctrine and Joint Tactics,
    Techniques, and Procedures (JTTP) for Air Mobility Operations; AFDD 2, Organization and
    Employment of Air and Space Power; AFDD 2-6, Air Mobility Operations; and Air Force
    Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42.5, Aeromedical Evacuation. The
    Tanker/Airlift Control Center, Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) or theater
    AOC, provides C2 for air mobility assets used to accomplish AE missions within their
    respective areas of operation during mission execution. Decisions that affect patient medical
    care or destination medical facilities takes place with the advice and coordination of the
    Patient Movement Requirements Centers (PMRCs). When medical requirements warrant
    changes to a specific AE mission, those changes are coordinated through the AE cell within
    the appropriate airlift control center.

   1.6.3. Patient Movement Requirements Centers (PMRCs)—Global, Theater, and Joint.
   The PMRC is a joint activity that coordinates patient movement for all modes of
   transportation, ground, water, or air. PMRCs should exist at the joint level, as an element of
   the joint movement center, to ensure coordination of joint Service capabilities. PMRCs are
   the single responsible agents in their respective theaters or area of responsibility (AOR) for
   patient movement management, projected patient movement requirements for Unified
   Command validation, regulating to appropriate medical facilities for treatment, coordination
   with component lift agencies for evacuation, and patient in-transit visibility. PMRCs have
   the authority to ensure patient movement and bed requirements are communicated to
   supporting agencies, healthcare facilities, and government agencies within their AOR. The
   PMRC may be joint, reporting to the joint task force surgeon; theater, reporting to the theater
   surgeon; or global, reporting to the US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) surgeon.

1.7. AFMS Support in Military Operations Without a COMAFFOR. Some military
scenarios requiring medical support may involve AFMS personnel as the only AFFOR in an
AOR. An example is a humanitarian relief operation, in which an Air Force medical team, in
support of a JFC mission, provides medical support to a host nation’s indigenous population. In
10                                                                AFTTP 3-42.1      14 MAY 2004

a situation of this nature, a medical commander is designated and the medical unit may be
attached to the JFC who exercises command authority over the Air Force medics. Or, the
medical unit may be in direct support of the JFC mission and command authority resides within
the supporting commander’s channels. (Reference JP 0-2, Unified Action Armed Forces
[UNAAF], for additional discussion of command authorities and relationships.) In these cases,
the medical commander may be designated as the COMAFFOR. If a COMAFFOR is not
designated, a deployed medical element should communicate operational issues with the theater
SG staff responsible for the theater of operation. Medical commanders will have no command
authority over LAF forces.

1.8. Air Force Medical Support for Special Operations Forces (SOF). Air Force Special
Operations Command (AFSOC) is unique in that it is aligned under a functional unified
command, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). AFSOC functions as both an Air
Force MAJCOM and as the air component of USSOCOM. With this type of relationship,
command and control is dependent on the structure assigned for the given operation or mission.
Traditionally, when AFSOF are tasked to perform joint force special operations component
commander missions, C2 should be through an established joint special operations air
component commander. AFSOC operational medical personnel are under the C2 of the Air
Force commanders. While they report to a LAF commander, they are part of, and contribute a
valuable resource to, the overall medical capability of a base or operating location. In addition to
providing medical support in a forward area, AFSOC medics perform casualty evacuation
missions, assist with personnel recovery, and infiltration/exfiltration missions. When collocated
with conventional medical assets or in a joint arena, the AFSOC DMC or senior member
establishes the framework for a joint cooperative effort. AFSOC medical personnel may be
under the professional oversight of a conventional medical commander (i.e., the DMC) or the
senior medical officer on the base or operating location for clinical issues; or where applicable,
the joint special operations task force surgeon. With the possibility of dual C2 and LAFs of
communication at one operating location, it is essential medical roles and missions be
communicated and an operating framework established.

1.9. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Personnel. Under full mobilization, full ADCON
authority goes to the COMAFFOR. Under less than full mobilization, the COMAFFOR receives
specified ADCON that includes Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) authority, force
protection requirements, and other specific authorities written in G-series orders. The Air
Reserve Component (ARC) retains all other ADCON authorities. The DMC may also receive
specified ADCON (with UCMJ authority), written in G-series orders, for deployed ARC
personnel.

                      HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT OPERATIONS

2.1. Introduction. The drive to the AEF has created an expeditionary mindset through the Air
Force. Central to this mindset has been the need to meet mission requirements while responding
more quickly, with more flexibility, and with a smaller logistics footprint and infrastructure.
AEF has generated a planning environment where the Air Force may have only hours and days,
rather than weeks or months, to project air and space power. HSS commanders and staff must
understand each phase of the deployment process, to include an understanding of the levels of
orders (e.g., Alert Order, Warning Order) and associated timelines. (Reference JP 5-0, Doctrine
for Planning Joint Operations and AFSC PUB 1, The Joint Staff Officer’s Guide for additional
discussion on crisis action phases/planning/procedures and levels of orders.)

2.2. Preparation. Preparation begins with the earliest possible assignment of qualified
personnel to tasked Unit Type Codes (UTC). Those assigned to EMEDS UTCs should be given
top priority for attendance at the EMEDS Basic Course, Brooks AFB. This course should be
complemented with multiple classified and unclassified sources, including:

   2.2.1. LAF Intelligence reports/briefings, Judge Advocate General analysis, communication
   and logistical analysis.

   2.2.2. Local medical intelligence officer (public health officer): disease threats and
   countermeasures, host nation medical capabilities, food and food sources, environmental
   conditions.

   2.2.3. Local medical logistics office: allowance standard for assemblage; equipment
   familiarization; physical inventory of equipment UTCs.

   2.2.4. Local medical readiness office: review AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and
   Training requirements.

   2.2.5. MAJCOM Readiness offices: establish relationship for future communication, current
   modernization efforts for UTC, after action reports from previous deployments and exercises.

   2.2.6. International Health Specialists consultation.

   2.2.7. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Command for UTC (note:
   Air Combat Command (ACC) is MEFPAK for ground medical assemblages; Air Mobility
   Command (AMC) for AE and AE ground support UTCs; and Air Force Special Operations
   Command (AFSOC) for SOF Medical UTCs.)

   2.2.8. On-line open resources: News sites for current and background information; CIA Fact
   Book – http://www.cia.gov/; www.GlobalSecurity.org ; routine word searches for potential
   host nation information on common browsers such as www.google.com.

   2.2.9. Courses listed in Chapter 4 of this publication.
12                                                              AFTTP 3-42.1       14 MAY 2004


2.3. Pre-deployment. Upon receipt of an alert, prepare to deploy, warning order, or other
notification from higher headquarters, the local medical readiness officer should conduct a pre-
deployment conference and review of key documents and responsibilities with deploying UTC
team chiefs.

     2.3.1. Documents. Key documents include the unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
     statement and Status of Resources and Training System report; Medical Readiness Decision
     Support System, AEF Resourcing Tool, formal orders; time-phased force deployment data
     (TPFDD); medical intelligence reports; general intelligence reports; and force protection
     threats and responsibilities. The deploying medical commander should also accomplish the
     following actions:

        2.3.1.1. Review appropriate medical doctrine and consider taking a CD-ROM or hard
        copy of applicable operational and tactical doctrine. AFMS doctrine can be found at
        https://www.afms.mil/sg/index.htm.

        2.3.1.2. Verify deployability of UTC-assigned personnel. Identify and track shortfalls to
        resolution.

        2.3.1.3. Establish mechanism for contacting supporting communications, intelligence,
        logistics, and security force units for input on services and capabilities relating to, or
        provided at, the deployed location. Obtain base support plan if available.

        2.3.1.4. Confer with public health/medical intelligence officer for location-specific
        information on disease and environmental threats, countermeasures, host nation medical
        capabilities, approved sources for food and water, and other environmental factors.

        2.3.1.5. Personally assess the deployability of equipment UTCs. Identify shortfalls, fill
        actions and work-arounds prior to deployment.

        2.3.1.6. Compile references including applicable Air Force instructions and Concept of
        Operations (CONOPS) and prepare CD-ROM to carry on deployment. As a minimum,
        commanders should consider taking the Preventative Aerospace Medicine, Biological
        Augmentation Team, EMEDS, and Mobile Field Surgical Team CONOPS. Current
        CONOPS editions are available at https://www.afms.mil/sgxr/conops.cfm.

        2.3.1.7. Review deployment order for command relationships, special instructions, and
        force health protection issues including public health, biological warfare/chemical
        warfare (BW/CW) threats, and immunization needs.

        2.3.1.8. Contact local Logistics Readiness Squadron for transportation schedule. Note:
        personnel and equipment may not travel together.

        2.3.1.9. Contact MAJCOM Readiness offices for relevant TPFDD analysis. The TPFDD
        presents a wealth of information on planned forces and capabilities at locations
        throughout the theater. Specific information to be extracted includes:
AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                         13


          2.3.1.9.1. Origin of all medical UTCs deploying to the location of interest.

          2.3.1.9.2. Medical capabilities at all theater locations.

          2.3.1.9.3. Identification of lead LAF units and their deployed locations.

          2.3.1.9.4. Population at risk by location.

          2.3.1.9.5. Location of the PMRC.

          2.3.1.9.6. Locations of AFFOR headquarters and AFFOR/SG, component surgeons
          and theater combatant commander’s surgeon.

          2.3.1.9.7. Medical resources already deployed or arriving prior to unit of interest.

          2.3.1.9.8. After TPFDD analysis, contact other medical UTC team chiefs planned for
          the common destination.

   2.3.2. Pre-Deployment Orders. The operation order (OPORD)/execute order identifies
   operational control (OPCON), tactical control (TACON), mission objectives, rules of
   engagement, force protection, handling of classified information, hazardous cargo, and other
   mission specific requirements for the deployment. It must be thoroughly understood.

2.4. Deployment/In-Transit Phase. The movement phase is critical for DMCs who must strive
to maintain maximum control over deploying medical personnel and assemblages. Careful
attention must be given to:

   2.4.1. Designation of troop commanders.

   2.4.2. Establishing accountability standards for deploying personnel (reporting for
   movement.)

   2.4.3. Clarifying transition of “ownership” of the deploying UTCs from the supplying
   MAJCOM to the theater combatant commander.

   2.4.4. Establishing procedures for individuals who become ill, incapacitated, or reassigned
   enroute.

   2.4.5. In-transit visibility of movement of UTCs deploying from different origins and aerial
   ports of embarkation.

   2.4.6. Appointment of designated couriers for controlling and securing hand-carried
   classified materials, weapons and ammunition, and controlled items (e.g., narcotics).

   2.4.7. Timely and accurate Medical Report for Emergencies Disasters, and Contingencies
   (MEDRED-C) reporting.
14                                                                 AFTTP 3-42.1      14 MAY 2004


2.5. Employment. To maintain appropriate C2 over deployed medical assets, the DMC must
address the following areas: force beddown; base operating support, security and force
protection; patient movement and patient movement items; logistics and resupply; procurement;
blood products; and medical organizational structure and personnel management. Each of these
areas is addressed in the OPORD. Upon arrival, the DMC must identify appropriate points of
contact and establish procedures to do the following:

     2.5.1. Track arriving personnel (through personnel support for contingency operations) and
     equipment (through logistics plans) UTCs.

     2.5.2. Fill transportation/vehicle requirements (rentals, pre-positioned vehicles). Establish
     communications to include cellular phones, secure telephone equipment phones, Secure
     Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router
     Network (NIPRNET) links and computer networks.

     2.5.3. Prepare and exercise mass casualty plans.

     2.5.4. Obtain contracting support for local purchase as needed.

     2.5.5. Prepare and provide for the installation casualty plans.

     2.5.6. Generate medical reports (see Chapter 3).

     2.5.7. Implement public health and bioenvironmental engineering services.

     2.5.8. Meet specific aviation medical requirements.

     2.5.9. Implement behavioral health services and critical incident stress management
     processes.

     2.5.10. Host nation medical facilities and joint/combined medical units that meet acceptable
     standards of care serve as force multipliers. Local capabilities should be fully assessed to
     determine medical and surgical specialties and capacities available. Relationships may be
     forged through inter-facility education and mass casualty exercise opportunities in addition to
     formal memorandums of agreement.

2.6. Redeployment. The theater combatant commander authorizes the redeployment of medical
resources. The DMC must receive approval from the local LAF commander and theater
combatant command surgeon (via the AFFOR/SG) before redeployment of any medical
personnel or materiel assets. The DMC must actively participate in redeployment planning,
including preparing a time-phased reduction in medical services consistent with the deactivation
of the deployed location and the threat scenario. If no EMEDS/AFTH component is present, the
senior medical officer present will coordinate medical redeployment activities. Associated
activities include:
AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                   15

  2.6.1. Careful and thorough reconstitution of deployed medical assets, to include inspection
  and preparation of equipment assets by the bio-medical equipment technician.

  2.6.2. Cargo and personnel transportation planning requirements.

  2.6.3. Transition planning, if required.

  2.6.4. Blood and biological waste disposition.

  2.6.5. Post-deployment medical surveillance requirements (health questionnaires).

  2.6.7. Termination and close-out of final reports.

  2.6.8. Destruction or storage/transportation of classified materials.

  2.6.9. Disposition of dated items not suitable for redeployment (pharmaceuticals, sterile
  supplies, etc.) and BW/CW antidotes.

  2.6.10. Personnel actions, including performance reports, letters of evaluation, and
  decorations.

  2.6.11. Preparation of debriefs and after-action reports in AFFOR/SG-specified format.

                                           CHAPTER 3

COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (C3I)

3.1. Introduction. Command, Control, Communication, and Information Systems (C3I) assets
must be identified in the planning process and deployed to meet tactical and strategic C2 mission
requirements. C3I must also link forward medical elements, through each level of command to
final destination hospitals.

3.2. Coordination with the Host AEW Infrastructure.                  The HSS communication
systems/equipment used must be interoperable to optimize joint area communications and
frequency management operations. Communication planners must coordinate frequency
requirements through appropriate frequency management channels (e.g.; installation, MAJCOM,
and theater) to ensure all radiating equipment is spectrum certified and frequency supportable.
Also, host-nation coordination must be initiated before a full-scale deployment. Non-
programmable systems are usually not acceptable or recommended in a deployed theater of
operation. Compatibility between intra-base radio systems is essential. Commanders should not
assume compatibility since units come from multiple CONUS installations. Land-Mobile Radio
systems integral to HSS tactical elements may or may not be compatible (especially with secure
or private-LAF systems) with each other. It is essential that all HSS communications and
computer systems can be sustained through maintenance capabilities provided by the deployed
Expeditionary Communications Squadron or Flight. Recommend particular attention to
communication and maintenance support in bare base locations where communication
infrastructure is limited. Commanders should actively communicate with the AFFOR Surgeon
to avoid taking equipment that cannot be maintained in theater.

3.3. Organic HSS Communication & Information Systems. Prior to deployment, the
deploying medical commander should ensure any organic communication and computer systems
are compatible with deployed forces’ communication and computer systems by coordinating
requirements and capabilities to higher headquarters planners. This is especially important when
organic satellite communications are engaged to support telemedicine and other medical unique
system requirements.

3.4. Medical Reports and Communication. All medical reports are submitted in accordance
with AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting and specific Combatant Commander, JTF, and
AFFOR guidance.

     3.4.1. Medical Report for Emergencies Disasters, and Contingencies (MEDRED-C).
     The MEDRED-C is a status report of HSS operations. This report is accomplished daily and
     communicated to the AFFOR surgeon, supported and supporting MAJCOM/SGs, and the
     HQ AF/SG. For sustained operations, the MEDRED-C may be required weekly with the
     concurrence of the AFFOR/SG. (See Attachment 2 for example of the MEDRED-C.) The
     MEDRED-C is an on-site assessment of the deployed medical unit ability to complete its
     mission. This report provides information on the operational readiness status, unit
     availability, and patient care activities of HSS units on alert for contingency operations, or
     which have come under the influence of an unusual occurrence (natural disaster or other
     emergencies). (See AFM 10-206, Operational Reporting for further information.)
AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                     17


   3.4.2. Situation Report (SITREP). As a minimum, the MEDRED-C and deployed wing
   commander’s SITREP must be accomplished. The SITREP is prepared in a narrative format,
   evaluating significant factors relating primarily to readiness, mobilization, personnel, and
   logistics. It supplies an overall mission review of a deployed UTC. The SITREP will often
   include the number of people supporting (Population at Risk), diseases by category being
   seen and numbers of individuals in each.

   3.4.3.   USTRANSCOM Regulating Command and Control Evacuation System
   (TRAC2ES). In transit visibility may be accomplished through standard mobility automated
   systems or the TRAC2ES. Patient Movement Requests are submitted to the PMRC by the
   service medical patient administration person in each facility and can be communicated
   through TRAC2ES.

   3.4.4. Additional reports. Every deployment may require different deployment reports.
   These reports provide information that is used to make operational decisions on HSS and to
   perform medical intelligence analyses during contingency operations. Additional reporting
   may be established, based on mission, or specific theater requirements. Some of these
   reports may include: Joint Force Headquarters required Blood Status (BLOODSTAT)
   Reports, Logistics Status (LOGSTAT), Disease Reports, and Bed Status (BEDSTAT)
   Reports.

       3.4.4.1. These reports are typically defined and prescribed in the theater or JTF-
       Surgeon’s series of Letters of Instruction (LOIs), the Joint/Air Component OPORDs
       (Annex K), and theater/JTF’s Joint Communications-Electronics Operating Instruction.
       When time permits commanders and AFFOR staffs should fully indoctrinate and
       familiarize themselves with all of these documents and publications before deploying to
       the theater of operations. As the theater matures, fragmentation orders (FRAGO) and
       amendments to these documents will further clarify and refine instructions for
       communications and systems. In addition, theater maturation will drive a migration
       towards the implementation of CONUS in-garrison like communication systems practices
       and procedures. These include, but are not limited to Communications Security
       (COMSEC)/ Operations Security (OPSEC) Management, Work Group Manager (WGM)
       Certifications, Software Anti-Piracy Training and Education (SATE) Certification, and
       Local Area Network (LAN) Certifications.

       3.4.4.2. It is important to remember, that in spite of higher headquarters reporting
       requirements, the HSS commander should always insure that the AEW Commander and
       staffs are aware of these requirements. If necessary, they should be coordinated with
       them prior to release of any significant operationally sensitive messages from the
       installation. This is especially important when submitting MEDRED-Cs as a result of
       significant medical or infrastructure impacting events (e.g. mass casualty incidents, or
       facility damage incidents) that may or may not impact other AEW resources.

3.5. Secure/Non-Secure Communications. HSS or casualty information becomes an OPSEC
issue when linked to a particular military mission or operation. While HSS information itself is
not normally classified, in the context of a mission, it should be protected as part of the
18                                                              AFTTP 3-42.1       14 MAY 2004

combatant commander’s overall OPSEC program to deny information to the enemy.
Observations made by HSS personnel may be integral to the overall intelligence gathering effort.
The deployed HSS commander must be aware of the potentially valuable and sensitive nature of
their operational observations and ensure that they are protected by applicable secure
transmissions. In many cases classified storage and special space allowance requirements need
to be taken into consideration when using secure communication devices. Storage for secure
telephone keys and key tapes need to be planned for and employed. The location of these devices
also needs to be considered in the facility floor plan and layout to insure sensitive information,
when discussed, is protected. In many cases primary and secondary crash networks will
eventually be placed on secure tactical phone systems that will require special protection.

                                   FORMAL TRAINING

4.1. Introduction. C2 training programs should be designed around realistic Force Health
Protection scenarios that demand decision making within realistic timeframes to increase the
training effect. This is achieved through dynamic curricula that anticipate the evolving
environment. Training programs involving the full range of air and space power capabilities
within a wide range of military operations provide a comprehensive training experience.

4.2. Training Courses. AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training directs specific
basic training requirements for medical personnel. There are several additional training courses
that enhance understanding of both LAF and HSS C2 principles and practices. The following
curriculums are recommended:

   4.2.1. Joint Operational Medical Managers Course. The Joint Operational Medical
   Managers Course is a course intended for commanders and executive staff members of
   deployable medical assemblages, but is a must for anyone holding a key senior staff position
   on the AFFOR SG staff. All AFFOR/SGs should be graduates of this weeklong course held
   twice a year through the Defense Medical Readiness Training Institute, Ft Sam Houston, San
   Antonio, TX.

   4.2.2. Joint Task Force Surgeon Seminar. This course is hosted by the U.S. Joint Forces
   Command Surgeon, Norfolk, Virginia and held once a year. Only officers identified for
   AFFOR Surgeon and possible Joint Task Force Surgeon assignments should attend. This is a
   O-6 forum for theater medical command maturation. The ACC Surgeon solicits applications
   every year for this one-week course.

   4.2.3. Military Operations Other Than War Course. The Military Operations Other Than
   War Course is hosted by the Expeditionary Warfare Training Center, Little Creek Naval
   Base, Virginia. It is designed to teach the planning and sustainment of military operations in
   lesser than wartime scenarios. It is a joint, multifunctional course. All AFFOR
   planners/staff members should attend this one-week course.

   4.2.4. Joint Medical Planner Course. The Joint Medical Planner Course is hosted by the
   Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Directorate of Medical Plans and held at Bethesda,
   Maryland. It is a three-week joint medical planner’s forum for learning key deployment and
   employment planning. It is joint oriented and does not key on specific AFFOR SG
   processes. Along with Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC), it is one of the core
   courses for all AFFOR SG staff members.

   4.2.5. Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC). The CWPC educates airmen in
   grades E-5 though O-5 in the art and science of contingency war planning. Provided through
   the Air University, should be the “first stop” for all AFFOR/SG planners to understand the
   language and processes involved in both Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning (CAP).
   However, the CWPC is a two-week deployment course supporting in-
   garrison/predeployment CAP processes, and does not include in theater employment,
20                                                                 AFTTP 3-42.1       14 MAY 2004

     generation, force protection, sustainment and redeployment considerations.    More
     information can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/au_catalog_2002_03/au_cat_2002-
     03.pdf.

     4.2.6. Crisis Response Senior Seminar. The Crisis Response Senior Seminar is offered by
     the Joint Special Operations University, Hurlburt Field, FL and is designed to educate
     colonels and above in the joint response aspects of DOD response to terrorism events. It
     combines the concepts of Crisis Management and Consequence Management as defined by
     Presidential Decision Directive 39. All potential AFFOR and JTF Surgeons should attend. A
     TOP           SECRET            clearance          is       required.                 See
     https://www.hurlburt.af.mil/milonly/tenantunits/jsou/.

     4.2.7. Emergency Preparedness Course. The Emergency Preparedness Course supported
     through HQ USAF/XOH, at Mt Weather, VA and is a one-week course that teaches DOD
     response to disasters. While this focuses primarily the principles for a domestic response, it is
     applicable to overseas U.S. territories and possessions.

     4.2.8. EMEDS Basic Course, provided at the USAF School of Air and Space Medicine,
     Brooks AFB, TX. A one-week course designed to familiarize personnel assigned to EMEDS
     UTCs with operational orientation.

     4.2.9. Selective SOF C2 and area study courses provided by the Joint Special Operations
     University,        at          Hurlburt          Field,   Florida.                  See
     https://www.hurlburt.af.mil/milonly/tenantunits/jsou/.

     4.2.10. Aeromedical Evacuation Contingency Operations Training Course.               The
     Aeromedical Evacuation Contingency Operations Training Course is the premier USAF
     training course on AE operations for both clinical and operational element, as well as
     integration of crews into the theater AE system. This course is located at Sheppard AFB,
     TX.

     4.2.11. Tactical Aeromedical Training Course. The Tactical Aeromedical Training
     Course provided through Air Mobility Command, is a theater AE tactics and procedures
     course that builds upon the training provided in Aeromedical Evacuation Contingency
     Operations Training and expands the tactical level of experience for the AE operations
     leader.

     4.2.12 Air Mobility Operations Course, Air Mobility Warfare Center, McGuire AFB, NJ.
     The Air Mobility Operations Course is a LAF course which teaches the full-spectrum of
     airlift operations. This course for all functional areas within the airlift community. All senior
     AE officers should attend this course.

Glossary

advanced echelon (ADVON). An initial deployment element of personnel and equipment
within a specific unit type code (UTC). The ADVON portion of a UTC normally consists of the
equipment and personnel required to establish an austere operational capability for a period of up
to seven days.

aeromedical evacuation (AE). . The movement of patients under medical supervision to and
between medical treatment facilities by air transportation (JP 1-02)

Air Force Aeromedical Evacuation System. Provides fixed-wing movement of patients
requiring supervision by AE personnel to locations offering appropriate levels of medical care.
The AE system can operate as far forward as fixed-wing aircraft are able to conduct air/land
operations.

air and space expeditionary force (AEF). Composite organizations of air and space
capabilities from which a tailored task force, composed of Air Expeditionary Wings, Groups and
Squadrons; is created to provide forces to meet theater combatant commander requirements. An
AEF is not a discreet warfighting unit. (AFI 10-400)

air wing (AEW). A wing or wing slice assigned or attached to a task force or an in-place NAF
by MAJCOM G-series orders. An AEW is composed of the wing command element and some
groups. The AEW commander reports to a COMAFFOR.

command. 1. The authority and responsibility for effectively using available resources and for
planning the employment or organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling military forces
for the accomplishment of assigned missions. It also includes responsibility for health, welfare,
morale, and discipline of assigned personnel. (JP 1-02)

commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). Serves as the ‘single-voice’ Air Force
commander to the joint force commander forhealth service support, and is responsible for all Air
Force forces assigned or attached to the air component in joint or combined operations.

control. 1. Authority that may be less than full command exercised by a commander over part
of the activities of subordinate or other organizations. (JP 1-02). [For the purposes of this
document, the processes that happen before and during an operation. These involve dynamic
balances between commanders directing operations and allowing subordinates freedom of action
and is often two-way and involves influencing subordinates and monitoring results. Lastly, there
are four basic C2 functions: planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling.] Words in
brackets are added for clarity.

distributed operations.      The process of conducting operations from independent or
interdependent nodes in a teaming manner. Some operational planning or decision-making may
occur from outside the joint area of operations. The goal of a distributed operation is to support
the operational commander in the field; it is not a method of command from the rear. (AFDD
1.2) [The Transportable Blood Transshipment Center (TBTC) and the theater Aeromedical
Evacuation Coordination Team (AECT) are examples of independent nodes that team to support
24                                                                AFTTP 3-42.1       14 MAY 2004

the theater medical system. While the relationships may vary according to the nature of the
operation, the design of a distributed operation should enable a more survivable C2 network
through distribution of tasks and information. In some instances, the commander may establish a
formal supported/supporting relationship between distributed nodes. In other instances,
distributed nodes may have a horizontal relationship.] Words in brackets are added for clarity.

designed operational capability (DOC) statement. The DOC statement prepared by the parent
MAJCOM for each measured unit that outlines the DOC of the unit and contains unit
identification, mission tasking narrative, mission specifics, and resources to be measured. It
provides a unit commander a clear definition of their unit’s wartime capability, based upon the
authorized manpower and materiel strength of the unit.

Expeditionary Air and Space Force. The concept which defines how the Air Force will
organize, train, equip, and sustain itself by creating a mindset and cultural state that embraces the
unique characteristics of air and space power – range, speed, flexibility, precision – to meet the
national security challenges of the 21st century. (AFI 10-400).

expeditionary medical support (EMEDS)/Air Force theater hospital (AFTH). The
EMEDS/AFTH provides individual bed-down and theater-level medical services for deployed
forces or select population groups within the entire spectrum of military operations. The
EMEDS/AFTH supports theater combatant commander requirements by providing a modular
and flexible theater hospitalization capability.

Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The JSCP provides guidance to the JCS, combatant
commanders, and the Services to accomplish tasks and mission based on current military
capabilities, apportions resources to combatant commanders, based on military capabilities
resulting from completed program and budget actions and intelligence assessments and is the
principle vehicle by which the combatant commanders are tasked to develop OPLANs,
CONPLANs and functional plans.

joint task force (JTF). A JTF is a force composed of two or more Military Departments
established by the Secretary of Defense or commander of unified/sub-unified command or other
JTF. The JTF’s mission has a specific limited objective and the JTF is dissolved when its
purpose has been served.

JTF surgeon. Appointed by the JTF commander and responsible for establishing, monitoring,
or evaluating joint force health service support, including evacuation of the wounded, injured or
sick. The JTF surgeon is responsible for coordinating and integrating health service support
within the AO.

Medical Operations Center (MOC) – Pentagon. Assigned to the Air Force Contingency
Operations Staff. Serves as the AF/SG functional area manager (FAM) for all medical UTC
management activities. The MOC also serves as the focal point for all Joint Staff Actions for the
CJCS and for medical planning reviews and advice to the JCS J-4, Medical Readiness Division.
AFTTP 3-42.1 14 MAY 2004                                                                         25

patient movement requirements centers (Global, Theater or Joint) (PMRC). PMRCs are
the single responsible agents in their respective theaters or AOR for collaborative patient
movement planning, patient movement management, and patient in-transit visibility.

reachback. The process of obtaining forces, materiel, capability, or information support from
Air Force organizations not forward stationed or forward deployed. (AFDD 2, AFDD 1-2)
[Communications and information systems facilitate reachback by providing a seamless
information flow of prioritized data to and from forward and rear locations. The reachback C2 is
normally provided from a supporting/supported relationship. This relationship gives the
forward-deployed Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) the support necessary to
conduct operations while maintaining a smaller deployed footprint. Effective reachback C2
enhances the operational capability and facilitates informed decision-making of the engaged
COMAFFOR. Taking this concept to the tactical level, telemedicine is a prime example of
reachback, e.g. providing specialty consultation from outside the AO versus deploying every
potential medical capability.] Words in brackets are added for clarity.

split operations. Subset of distributed operations. It is usually used to describe those
distributed operations conducted by a single C2 entity physically split between two or more
geographic locations. A single commander must have oversight of all aspects of a split C2
operation. (AFDD 1-2) [For example, sections of the ATO may be developed from a rear area
or backup operation center to reduce the deployed AOC footprint. In this case the AOC, the
single C2 entity, is geographically separated and we refer to that as split operations. As a general
rule, medical command and control does not include split operations.] Words in brackets are
added for clarity.

supported commander. 1. The commander having primary responsibility for all aspects of a
task assigned by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan or other joint operation planning authority.
In the context of joint operation planning, this term refers to the commander who prepares
operation plans or operation orders in response to requirements of the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. 2. In the context of a support command relationship, the commander who
receives assistance from another commander’s force or capabilities, and who is responsible for
ensuring that the supporting commander understands the assistance required. (JP1-02)

supporting commander 1. A commander who provides augmentation forces or other support to
a supported commander or who develops a supporting plan. Includes the designated combatant
commands and Defense agencies as appropriate. 2. In the context of a support command
relationship, the commander who aids, protects, complements, or sustains another commander’s
force, and who is responsible for providing the assistance required by the supported commander.
