            5.4.3.7.3. (Incorporating AFGM1) Weapons used during M4/M9 performance
            evaluations will be readily identifiable; the M4 must have a blue muzzle cap

            wrapped around the pistol grip. Magazines used will be readily identifiable
            through the use of blue tape or blue paint. The M4 and/or M9 used during the
            performance evaluation will be cleared by a certified clearing barrel attendant
            IAW AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. Additionally, prior to
            initiating performance evaluations, the evaluator will verify the weapon is cleared,
            by locking the bolt/slide to the rear and inserting a cleaning rod into the muzzle
            end of the barrel until it passes through the bore and chamber to ensure no
            ammunition is present in the chamber, and then remove the cleaning rod. NOTE:
            Use of live ammunition or spent brass casings is not authorized for performance
            evaluations. Dummy rounds are the sole authorized rounds for performance
            evaluations and will be maintained and strictly controlled by Stan-Eval.

                in the same room as the evaluator, but not within eight feet of the evaluation
                area. The evaluation area should be clearly demarcated with blue tape or blue
                paint. The person being evaluated will remove his/her home-station duty belt
                or DFLCS kit with the weapon still in the holster (M9) or remove the
                magazine (M4) and place the weapons in the cabinet. The evaluator will lock
                the weapons in the cabinet and maintain possession of the key throughout the
                evaluation. After the weapon evaluation is complete, the person being
                evaluated will exit the demarcated evaluation area. The evaluator will unlock
                the weapon storage cabinet and the evaluated member will retrieve his/her
                duty weapons.
                5.4.4.1.7.1. (Added) Confinement DPEs are not required for AETC
                installations without facilities. A functional area inspection will be conducted
                IAW paragraph 5.4.4.1.
                5.4.4.3.9.2. All E-6 and below S-Staff personnel will maintain Operations
                Flight duty position certifications. DPEs will not be conducted for the actual
                S-Staff function.
        5.4.5.1. (Added) DPE reports (hard or electronic) will be maintained IAW with the
        records disposition schedule at
        https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
     5.5.2. For non-critical duty positions, individuals must receive at least a 70% to pass the
     written portion of the DPE. For critical duty positions, individuals must receive at least
     an 80% to pass the written portion of the DPE.
        5.5.4.1. If any task is not successfully completed on the second attempt, the
        individual will receive a “No-Go” for that particular weapon. In addition, the
        individual will then immediately have their authority to bear the firearm associated

    to schedule a complete DPE (written, verbal and performance). Stan/Eval will
    reevaluate the individual no later than 30 calendar days after being notified by S-
    3/Training.
       6.4.3.2.1. (Added) DFCs will provide Tier 2B training to defenders postured
       against a DWS UTC, but not tasked during their deployment vulnerability
       window, prior to Tier 3 sustainment training courses.
       6.4.6.2.1. (Added) Initial allocations for IDC3 will be determined during annual
       data calls, additional seats may be allocated through the MRT “out of cycle”
       program.

       defender’s RTC course completion certificate will be used as documentation of
       training completion.
