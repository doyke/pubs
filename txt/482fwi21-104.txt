ONLY. Maintenance supervisors at all levels should be constantly aware of changing weather
conditions. They shall take appropriate actions in securing facilities and initiating notification
procedures via the 482d Maintenance Operations Flight (482 MOF)/Maintenance Operations
Center (MOC). The Base Weather Flight shall be the central point for information flow
concerning severe weather. Supervision shall ensure all assigned on station personnel are briefed
to minimize any unnecessary outdoor exposure during severe weather watch and warnings. The
maintenance production supervisor of the applicable shift shall be responsible for ensuring all
aircraft and flight line maintenance equipment is secured as required by this instruction.
     1.1. Severe Weather Watch.
        1.1.1. Flight Line. During severe weather watch, all personnel must be prepared to cease
        all outside operations and seek shelter without delay.
        1.1.2. Hail. If greater than one-half inch hail is forecasted in a weather watch, aircraft
        shall be sheltered in accordance with locally developed procedures.
        1.1.3. Tornadoes. If Homestead Air Reserve Base (HARB) is under a weather watch for
        tornadoes, aircraft shall be sheltered in accordance with locally developed procedures
        when directed by the Wing Commander or designated representative.
        1.1.4. Hurricanes. The Wing CC shall determine whether to shelter or evacuate aircraft
        to a safe location based on weather predictions.
     1.2. Individual Severe Weather Detection. All personnel that detect severe weather
     conditions (e.g., high winds, lightning, hail, thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding) with no
     known Watch or Warning being issued should notify the MOC via the most expeditious
     means available and take shelter as applicable.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. Notification.
        2.1.1. After notification of an ADVISORY for high winds/lightning (within 5 NM):
        2.1.2. MOC shall initiate Checklist (CL) # E04, Severe Weather and make a radio call
        advising all maintenance net users of the advisory.
        2.1.3. Work centers shall initiate local developed procedures.
     2.2. After notification of a WARNING for high winds/lightning within 5 Nautical Miles
     (NM):
        2.2.1. MOC shall initiate a Radio Call advising all maintenance net users of the warning.
        2.2.2. Personnel shall cease outside operations and seek shelter. If towing of an aircraft
        has been initiated, continue to destination, the nearest suitable alternate location (e.g., sun
        shade), or cease towing as directed by maintenance supervision. Seek shelter
        immediately after securing the tow vehicle and aircraft. Aircraft engine operation in the
        hush house, trim pad and aircraft parking area may continue during a lightning warning.
        2.2.3. All fueling operations shall cease.
        2.2.4. All liquid oxygen servicing shall cease.

       Instruction (482 MXGOI) 21-106, Munitions Electrical Storm Hazardous Weather
       Warnings for guidance.
       2.2.6. Aircraft shall not be armed or de-armed during a Lightning Weather Warning.
       2.2.7. All fuel system maintenance shall cease.
       2.2.8. All egress explosives maintenance shall cease.
       2.2.9. Uninstalled engine operation at the hush house shall cease.

       starvation, or distressed pilot, minimum ground crew required shall respond and remain
       in enclosed vehicles until chocking is required.
          2.2.10.1. Impending fuel starvation during weather warning: Aircraft on the
          ground under a Severe Weather Warning (e.g., Lightning Warning) shall be directed
          by the Top 3 when to shut down if the aircraft fuel totalizer will reach 600 pounds of
          fuel prior to the termination of the weather warning. (This is to prevent fuel pump
          damage from impending fuel starvation.) Top Three and maintenance supervision
          shall determine the best time to shut down based on the weather conditions.
          Maintenance supervision shall direct the flight line personnel via the MOC to chock
          the aircraft per procedure in paragraph 2.2.10.2 in this instruction.

          Personnel shall minimize their exposure during this emergency response period.
          Personnel shall immediately evacuate to a vehicle or shelter. Supervision shall
          minimize their personnel to exposure during this emergency response period.
3. Fuel System Repair Hanger and Alternate Repair Area: Upon notification of lightning
within 10 miles or less, Fuel Shop Supervisor shall suspend all fuel system maintenance to give
ample time to secure aircraft and repair area as follows:
   3.1. Tack all removed fuel panels, filler caps and cover seams with tape (if temporary panels
   are used, panels will be manufactured from non-conductive materials).
   3.2. Close hanger doors.
   3.3. Secure loose items (tools, boxes, TO's, and move work stands away from aircraft and
   lock wheels, etc.).
   3.4. If high winds (above 30 knots) are expected, the procedures shall be the same as stated
   before, except that the stands and stanchions shall be brought inside until the high winds
   subside and work can be resumed.

automatic fire suppression system is inoperative. A two person fireguard team shall be in-place
if assigned aircraft are hangared with any munitions loaded/installed.
5. Vehicles:
     5.1. All vehicles shall be secured.
     5.2. Mission essential vehicles shall be sheltered to the maximum extent possible, when time
