This instruction implements AFI 33-118, Radio Frequency (RF) Spectrum Management. It applies to all
government and commercial users of the Eastern Range (ER). The ER, in the context of this instruction,
consists of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Patrick Air Force
Base (PAFB), Malabar Tracking Annex, and Jonathan Dickinson Missile Tracking Annex (JDMTA).
Also, included in this definition of the ER are commercial facilities on and adjacent to 45 SW facilities for
commercial space ground pre-launch operations and booster telemetry. This instruction defines the orga-
nizational structure, functions, and responsibilities of the Radio Frequency Environment Working Group
(RFEWG). The primary responsibility of the RFEWG is to function as an advisory body to the 45 SW
Commander on radio frequency environment concerns and issues of ER users and organizations.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision updates participating organizations, office symbols and references; adds requirement for
participating organizations to identify in writing the names and telephone numbers of their primary and
alternate representatives; adds Malabar Tracking Annex.

       2.2.4. Core and non-core organizations, who would like to propose agenda topics, will formally
       contact the chairperson before attending a meeting to provide an overview or summary description
       of a proposed agenda topic.

       dance sheets will be made available to these individuals.
   2.3. Responsibilities. The RFEWG will perform the following functions, tasks, or activities for the
   45 SW Commander:
       2.3.1. Serve as a formal body of expertise for resolving RF Environment (RFE) concerns or issues
       raised by ER users and organizations. This function or activity will include:
           2.3.1.1. Assess and resolve incompatibilities related to RFE criteria and RF energy sensitivity
           requirements in Program Requirements Documents (PRD).
           2.3.1.2. Identify operational constraints to users and RF emitters.
           2.3.1.3. Resolve RFE concerns that impact ER operations, existing policies and regulations,
           or which require special funding or support.
       2.3.2. Maintain, update, and publish the RFE baseline for the ER and define policies for control-
       ling the baseline. This task will include:
           2.3.2.1. Identify and classify emitters.
           2.3.2.2. Assess and monitor RFE configuration changes (addition and removal of emitters,
           etc.), that would change the baseline description.
       2.3.3. Develop criteria and coordinate procedures for controlling ER RFEs. This task will include:
           2.3.3.1. Specify computer controlled radar masks and transmitter power attenuation levels.
           2.3.3.2. Identify and characterize potential sources of and develop corresponding RFE mitiga-
           tion techniques.
       2.3.4. Identify and coordinate proposed RF emitters to 45 SW Radiation Protection Officer (45
       AMDS/SGPB) in accordance with 45 SWI 40-201, Radiation Protection Program.

3. Procedures. Users will formally submit informational descriptions of their RFE concerns or issues to
the chairperson. The chairperson will review and present the concerns or issues to the RFEWG. Users and
