                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Applicability. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield at Yokota AB must be
trained on local airfield driving procedures as outlined in this instruction or be escorted by a
vehicle driver possessing a valid AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, signed by 374
OSS/OSAM with a Yokota AB stamp from 374 OSS/OSAM certifying all testing procedures
have been accomplished.
1.2. Policy. The 374th Airlift Wing Commander’s (374 AW/CC) policy is to permit only the
minimum number of vehicles required on the airfield to sustain operations. The airfield is a
controlled area and entry into the area is approved through airfield operations. Only required
Government-Owned Vehicles (GOV), Official-Plated Vehicles (OV), and authorized Privately-
Owned Vehicles (POV) may operate on Yokota AB airfield in performance of normal
maintenance and daily support operations. Vehicle traffic greatly increases the potential for
security incidents, collisions, injury and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft. Positive
control of vehicles and operators is imperative. Vehicle operators shall comply with applicable
directives concerning airfield vehicular traffic.
1.3. Cell Phone Use. IAW 374 AWI 31-204 Yokota Air Base Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision
(PA) paragraph 4.3.28., vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of GOV or POVs
will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free
device. Text messaging/E-mailing while driving is also prohibited.
     1.3.1. The official form of communication while driving on the airfield will be via land
     mobile radio (LMR) only.
     1.3.2. Any vehicle operator observed talking on a cell phone while driving will have their
     AF Form 483 suspended for 30 days. A letter will be sent to the unit commander, who has
     the option of imposing further driving sanction.

                      VEHICLE OPERATIONS ON THE AIRFIELD

6.1. General. Personnel driving on the airfield and with a valid AF Form 483 will comply with
the procedures, directions and limitations described in this instruction, AFJMAN 24-306,
Chapter 25, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Chapter 6.
   6.1.1. Vehicles entering into restricted areas must have at least one person in the vehicle
   with a restricted area badge.
   6.1.2. Vehicle operators performing On-the-Job-Training (OJT) for airfield duties will not
   operate a vehicle within 50 feet of aircraft. This restriction does not apply to fire fighting
   vehicles or equipment, OJT operators towing aircraft, loading, unloading or aircraft-servicing
   vehicles. In all cases, drivers in OJT status must be qualified to operate the vehicle, and a
   qualified instructor must accompany them.
   6.1.3. Vehicle operations on the airfield will be conducted IAW AFJMAN 24-306, Chapter
   25, AFOSHSTD 91-100, Chapter 6, and Technical Order(TO) 00-25-172, Ground Servicing
   of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding, with the following exceptions: All vehicle
   operators will drive on the left side next to the taxiway centerline (same as the local driving
   conditions).
   6.1.4. Vehicles will not be driven diagonally across the parking ramp, but at 90-degree
   angles to the taxiway centerline from airfield entry point to a point adjacent to destination
   aircraft (except when required to deviate for restricted area boundaries, entry control points
   or aircraft operations).
       6.1.4.1. Due to single lane, narrow driving between some aircraft and the edge of the
       airfield restricted area, the following lanes are one-way traffic:
          6.1.4.1.1. Parking spots E8 – E10, D7 – D10, D11, D13, D15, D17, D19, D21, and
          D23 are one way only, south to north, on the narrow lane between the aircraft and the
          infield. All vehicle movement around the aircraft will be counter clockwise direction
          around those parking spots. Utilize the paved shoulder between these parking spots
          to the maximum extent possible.
          6.1.4.1.2. Parking spots D12, D14, D16, D18, D20, D22, and D24 are one way only,
          south to north on the narrow lane between the aircraft and the airfield service road.
          All vehicle movement in the vicinity of these parking spots (applicable for both left
          and right hand drive vehicles) will be in counter clockwise direction.
   6.1.5. Do not park vehicles or equipment on the airfield between the wingtip clearance line
   and taxiway centerline.
   6.1.6. Do not operate vehicles behind C-5 or B-747 type aircraft closer than 300 feet when
   engines are running at low power settings, and not closer than 800 feet when the engines are
   operating at high power settings. Note: Do not drive or traverse behind any aircraft
   performing engine testing runs.
   6.1.7. Do not use radio call signs similar to aircraft call signs used in the local area. Use of
   similar-sounding call signs causes confusion and can become a hazard to flight safety for
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       29


   aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome and ATC personnel monitoring airfield radios and
   ATC radios simultaneously.
   6.1.8. All vehicle movement around the aircraft, when within immediate vicinity to any
   aircraft, will be in a clockwise direction. This is applicable for both left and right hand drive
   vehicles. All vehicle movement within the 10 foot circle of safety around the aircraft will be
   with the driver’s side to the aircraft, with the exception of one way spots noted in paragraphs
   6.1.4.1.1 and 6.1.4.1.2.
   6.1.9. All equipment not currently used to service an aircraft must be placed in approved
   equipment airfield storage locations. See Attachment 8 for authorized storage locations.

   6.3.3. Taxiway End Sign: (See Attachment 10, Figure A10.12)
   6.3.4. FOD Check Point: Located on all airfield access roads and Centerline Road. These
   are painted on the pavement with white letters. All check points are located outside the
   entrances on the west side. All checkpoints are located within the gates on the east side.
   (See Attachment 10, Figure A10.13).
6.4. Airfield Lighting.
   6.4.1. Runway Lights: White lights located on the runway edges. These high-intensity
   lights run the length of the runway and identify the runway edge. (See Attachment 10,
   Figure A10.14)
   6.4.2. Taxiway Lights: Blue lights used to outline taxiways. (See Attachment 10, Figure
   A10.15)
   6.4.3. Taxiway Entrance/Exit Lights: Double blue lights used to identify entrances and exits.
   (See Attachment 10, Figure A10.16)
6.5. Obstacle Criteria.
   6.5.1. An obstacle is anything that poses a threat to aircraft movements, e.g., fire bottles,
   maintenance stands, vehicles, AGE, etc.
   6.5.2. When not directly supporting aircraft, obstacles must remain at least 1,000 feet from
   runway centerlines, 200 feet from taxiway centerlines, and varying distances from the edge
   of aprons in accordance with UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
   6.5.3. Equipment and vehicles not directly supporting aircraft must be parked or placed at
   the nose of the aircraft, with the driver’s side of vehicles closest to the aircraft.

   6.6.3. Contractor vehicles that possess an Annual or Temporary Airfield PMV pass in the
   performance of contracted duties.
   6.6.4. Gov Bicycles, Tricycles and Other Vehicles. Bicycles, tricycles and other vehicles
   owned/controlled by units are authorized on the airfield. Each GOV bicycle must have a
   metal plate affixed to the bicycle displaying the unit and office symbol. Units will assign
   control numbers to each bicycle and ensure it is displayed on the plate. GOV bicycles are
   authorized for official government business and will be ridden IAW the rules for vehicles on
   the airfield, meaning riders must possess a valid AF Form 483 stamped for Yokota AB.
   When authorized to operate on the airfield during the hours of darkness, they will be
   equipped with a suitable headlight (turned on) and reflective markings front and rear. When
   not in use on the aircraft movement area, bicycles will be laid onto the ground outside
   wingtip clearance lines and away from vehicle traffic areas. This will prevent the bicycle
   from being blown (wind, jet blast, etc.) into airplanes, equipment, or vehicle traffic.
   Exception: Medics on GOV bicycles will be permitted on the Command Run course to
   provide medical coverage for the duration of the run. While on the airfield, they must stay
   within the confines of the course and not cross into any Restricted Areas.
6.7. Airfield Vehicle Requirements.
   6.7.1. All airfield vehicles, including government-owned bicycles, golf carts, and utility
   trucks must meet the following requirements:
      6.7.1.1. All items inside the vehicles must be secured so as not to be blown out by wind
      or jet blast.
      6.7.1.2. Vehicles must remain at least 25 feet in front of and 200 feet behind all aircraft
      with engines running or about to start.
      6.7.1.3. For vehicles not equipped with speedometers, extra care must be used to ensure
      speed limits do not exceed 15 miles per hour (MPH)/24 kilometers per hour (KPH).
      6.7.1.4. Vehicles must be equipped with headlights and taillights when operating during
      periods of darkness and/or inclement weather. Vehicles must also have reflective
      material visible from 360 degrees.
      6.7.1.5. At a minimum, all vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following
      AFVA/decals and diagrams: Note: Decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of
      the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it
      can be flipped down for ready reference.
          6.7.1.5.1. AFVA 11-240. Note: The FAA Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual Aid Safety
          Placard, is the FAA equivalent to AFVA 11-240 and may be used by units located at
          shared-use airfields.
          6.7.1.5.2. AFVA 13-221 (optional if vehicle has an AFVA 11-240).

6.8. Speed Limits. No vehicle will be operated at a speed in excess of that deemed reasonable
and prudent for existing traffic and weather conditions. Under no circumstances is speeding
permitted during an exercise. Emergency vehicles will not automatically assume the right of
way, and the following speed limits will be observed:
   6.8.1. Special Purpose Vehicles—10 MPH/16 KPH maximum. Special purpose vehicles are
   classified as tugs, forklifts, refueling vehicles, K-loaders etc. Note: The speed limit is 5
   MPH/8 KPH within 25 feet (close proximity) of an aircraft.
   6.8.2. Airfield Service Road/Vehicle Parking Area—15 MPH/24 KPH maximum or as
   posted.
   6.8.3. Aircraft Parking Ramp—15 MPH/24 KPH maximum.

   6.8.5. Runway—24 - 37 MPH/40-60 KPH. If at any time the Control Tower informs the
   operator to expedite off the runway due to arriving/departing aircraft or other situation that
   requires the runway to be free of vehicles, the ground vehicle operator will utilize best
   judgment and depart the runway immediately at the nearest taxiway.
   6.8.6. Perimeter Road (McGuire/Walker) 24 - 37 MPH/40-60 KPH maximum or as posted.
   It is expressly forbidden for any vehicle to use the runway as a shortcut to any point on or off
   the airfield that is accessible by roads outside the airfield environment. Perimeter roads
   provide vehicle access from one area of the airfield to another. Even though the travel
   distance and time may be longer, ALWAYS use a perimeter road when it is available. This
   does not apply to emergency response vehicles responding to emergencies, or 374
   OSS/OSAM, 374 AW/SE conducting - airfield inspections and/or responding to airfield
   incidents (Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard [BASH], FOD, intrusions, coordinate closers, etc).
   Note: Do not enter or cross the runway unless you have direct two-way radio contact with
   and approval from the ATCT.
6.9. Aircraft, Equipment and Trailer Towing.
   6.9.1. Towing speed is 5 MPH/8 KPH for all aircraft and two or more maintenance stands.
   Towing speed for one maintenance stand is 10 MPH/17 KPH.
   6.9.2. The maximum towing speed for Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), such as
   compressors, ground power units , oxygen carts, and similar equipment is 15 MPH/24 KPH
   (see AFOSHSTD 91-100, paragraph 8.3.4. for additional information on AGE).
   6.9.3. Do not tow more than two units of any type in tandem.
   6.9.4. Do not use ropes, chains, cables or other flexible means of towing ground servicing
   equipment.
   6.9.5. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
   completes hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE towing vehicle by
   hand to align the pintle and hook. Drivers must shut off the vehicle, set the parking brake
   and place the vehicle in park or reverse if the AGE equipment is not to be towed immediately
   following hook-up.
   6.9.6. Safety or cotter pins will be used to secure pintle hooks and trailer hitches.
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                      33


   6.9.7. Follow-me vehicles may be operated in excess of 15 MPH/24 KPH only to
   accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft and when safety is not
   compromised. Tugs will not be used as follow-me vehicles at any time.
6.10. Airfield Access Points. All normal entrances to the airfield are accessed through auto
gates. Access points for the west side of the airfield are located near buildings 97, 400, 605, and
906. Access points for the east side of the airfield are located near the WRM yard and building
1585.
6.11. Foreign Object Debris. Pavement distresses, failure to secure items, vehicle parts and
blowing debris account for the majority of FOD on the airfield. Negligence in picking up FOD
can result in disastrous and expensive incidents. Everyone is responsible to prevent damage to
aircraft; therefore, everyone involved in airfield operations is responsible to pick up foreign
material from the airfield surface. Aircraft maintainers must follow established FOD prevention
procedures while performing maintenance. Vehicle operators must to the maximum extent
possible avoid driving on unpaved/unimproved surfaces and adhere to specific responsibilities in
the FOD control program which are listed below:
   6.11.1. Conduct a thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn
   parts. Ensure tires and undercarriage are free of rocks and debris. Physically inspect each
   tire and the vehicle undercarriage prior to entering the airfield, then roll the vehicle forward
   (roll-over check) so the areas of the tires originally in contact with the road are now visible,
   and recheck all tires for foreign objects before proceeding. All vehicles operating on the
   airfield shall be equipped with a flashlight to properly check tires and undercarriage for FOD
   during hours of darkness.
   6.11.2. Properly secure and store all equipment, materials, and property to ensure objects do
   not jar loose or fall out of the vehicle.
   6.11.3. Remove FOD from the airfield whenever possible. When FOD is sighted, but you
   are unable to pick it up, or when debris is spread out over a large area, notify AM Ops on the
   ramp net or at extension 225-7006. Provide the location and nature of the FOD. All
   sweeping operations on the airfield are coordinated through AM Ops.
   6.11.4. Vehicle operators will do FOD checks prior to entering the airfield from an unpaved
   surface. FOD checks will be accomplished when entering or crossing any taxiway, ramp or
   runway from an access road/unpaved surface or when exiting a construction area. This does
   not apply to the access roads supporting the Aircraft Arresting Systems.
   6.11.5. See AFI 21-101, Chapter 14, and AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 20, for additional
   information.
6.12. Taxiways/Taxiing Aircraft. All airfield vehicles will fully stop before they enter or cross
a taxiway. Before proceeding the operator will determine visually that the way is clear.
   6.12.1. Ground vehicle operators will not drive on the taxiway centerline or shoulders unless
   specifically checking the pavement condition or checking for FOD. Normally the only
   vehicles that drive on the centerline are 374 OSS/OSAM vehicles, follow-me vehicles and
   the airfield sweeper.
   6.12.2. Ground vehicle operators will drive on the left-hand side of the taxiway in reference
   to the vehicle’s direction of travel.
34                                                             374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012


  6.12.3. Except for follow-me vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or driven into
  the path of taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and its
  follow-me guide. Vehicles will not be driven between an aircraft with engines running and
  the marshaller in front of it.
  6.12.4. During hours of darkness, headlights of a vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft
  will be turned off immediately so the pilot’s night vision is not affected. The vehicle parking
  lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its position is known. Headlights will
  remain off until the aircraft is out of range and turned back on prior to putting the vehicle in
  motion. Vehicle operators with Daytime Running Lights (DRL)-equipped vehicles must
  know the operating procedures for their vehicles (consult the owner’s manual). The
  following procedures should work for most DRL-equipped vehicles: Stop the vehicle, shift
  transmission into park and apply the parking brake. If that does not turn off the lights, then
  turn the vehicle off and ensure parking lights or emergency flashers are on.
  6.12.5. All vehicle drivers who operate on the parking ramp/apron and taxiways will give
  way to taxiing and towed aircraft. A minimum wingtip clearance of 25 feet is required. The
  responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with ground vehicle operators. Vehicle operators
  encountering an aircraft in front or behind will move behind the wingtip clearance lines, exit
  the taxiway by the shortest route or, if necessary, reverse course to quickly move out of the
  way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle is driven off prepared surfaces to ensure
  adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft. All vehicles that re-enter from an unprepared
  surface must complete a FOD check.
  6.12.6. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and:
     6.12.6.1. Will not cross a taxiway or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that is
     within 200 feet or until the aircraft has passed by at least 200 feet.
     6.12.6.2. Will remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with its rotors in
     motion.
     6.12.6.3. Will yield the right-of-way to emergency response vehicles with rotating
     lights/flashers in motion.
     6.12.6.4. Will yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already operating on a taxiway they
     wish to enter or cross.
  6.12.7. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
  means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. As a minimum, the ground vehicle
  operator will:
     6.12.7.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers ON if the malfunction
     occurs during the hours of darkness.
     6.12.7.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
     “ALL PARTIES BREAK, BREAK-THIS IS (callsign) WITH AN EMERGENCY FOR
     AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT, TOWER AND MAINTENANCE CONTROL.” State the
     nature of the problem and report your position on the airfield.
     6.12.7.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (374 SFS, 374 CES, 374th Logistics
     Readiness Squadron, etc.) should make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                   35


       off the airfield especially if the vehicle is located on the parking aprons, taxiways or
       runway.
       6.12.7.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio stay with the vehicle and
       continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft in the vicinity.
6.13. Operating In/Crossing the CMA. The CMA is protected by Visual Flight Rule (VFR),
CMA, and Instrument (INST) Hold Lines. See paragraph 6.2.4. for more information on INST
Hold Lines. VFR hold lines are located at: West side (holding short of Runway 18/36)-taxiways
A-E; East side (holding short of Runway 18/36) taxiways A-E. See Attachment 8. CMA hold
lines are located at: East side (holding short of taxiway Foxtrot)-taxiways C-E, G, H and K. See
Attachment 8. All aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians MUST stop at the solid lines which are
located on the taxiway side (before you enter the CMA). Only vehicles/pedestrians possessing
direct two-way radio contact with the Control Tower are permitted in the CMA. Ground vehicle
operators/pedestrians must FIRST get permission from the Control Tower prior to entering or
crossing the CMA. Access to the CMA is not granted if a person is identified as being color
blind. All vehicles/pedestrians operating in the CMA must have a call sign approved by the
DAFM. Yokota Air Base has two separate controlled movement areas. All aircraft, vehicles and
pedestrians must get permission to enter each CMA separately. See Attachment 8:

Note 1: This list contains only those ground vehicle operators who have mission essential
requirements to drive on the airfield within the CMA and communicate with Control Tower
on a regular basis. It does not include operators who occasionally communicate with
Control Tower.
Note 2: The base perimeter road travels through the CMA at both ends of the runway
(Overruns). The overruns are protected by traffic signals, controlled by the Control Tower.
Vehicles must never stop between the overrun traffic signals. 374 SFS patrols pulling over
traffic offenders must insure all vehicles are not stopped between the overrun traffic signals.
Disabled vehicles between the overrun traffic signals must be reported to 374 OSS/OSAM at
225-7006 as soon as possible (ASAP) since airfield advisories must be activated.
Note 3: Do not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when authorizing
vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check or other airfield
operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, for additional information.

    6.13.1. In the event of an emergency recall, all pedestrians and vehicles shall exit the CMA
    ASAP. Emergency recall notification will normally occur with radio instructions or light gun
    signals if radios are inoperable. If radio contact is lost or suspected lost while operating in
    the CMA, operators will monitor the Control Tower for light gun signals while immediately
    exiting the CMA. Unless previously authorized by the Control Tower, do not cross another
    movement area to exit. For example, if you are on taxiway Foxtrot do not enter the runway
    to exit. If you are on the runway, do not cross taxiway Foxtrot to exit. In the event these
    methods are inoperative, Control Tower will flash the airfield lights on and off to alert
    personnel of the immediate need to clear the area (this method does not replace the
    requirement for operators to monitor radios at all times). All vehicle operators/pedestrians
    must exit the runway immediately. Contact ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the
    runway and include any pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If
    not able to communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication
    such as a cellular phone (when available). Report incident to AM immediately. If radio
    failure is known or suspected, an escort official from AM Ops will survey the area for all
    vehicles and escort them out of the CMA. Remain with your vehicle out of the CMA until
    retrieved.
    6.13.2. To enter or cross the CMA the following procedures will be followed:
         6.13.2.1. All vehicles stop and hold short at the runway hold line. Contact the Control
         Tower and receive permission to cross/enter the CMA. Upon receiving instructions,
         repeat the Control Tower’s instructions verbatim before proceeding. See Chapter 7 for
         phraseology.
         6.13.2.2. If equipped, top-mounted rotating emergency lights/flashers must be in
         operation while in the CMA. Vehicles not equipped with top-mounted emergency lights
         may use warning flashers, dash or grill-mounted lighting. As a minimum the hazard
         lights must be turned on.
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                      37


       6.13.2.3. Personnel in the CMA must constantly monitor their two-way radio for
       instructions from the Control Tower. If instructed to exit, acknowledge Control Tower
       with your call sign and advise Control Tower when you are off of the runway or taxiway
       Foxtrot.
       6.13.2.4. When finished operating in the CMA, contact the Control Tower and report off.
       6.13.2.5. To permit visual observation by Control Tower personnel, all routing vehicle
       crossings will be at Charlie, Delta and Echo taxiways. Vehicle crossing the CMA must
       be kept to an absolute minimum.
Note 1: Personnel requiring access in the CMA who do not have two-way radio contact with the
Control Tower must be escorted. The escort must be authorized to drive on the airfield, be
familiar with CMA procedures and have direct two-way radio contact with and approval from
the Control Tower prior to entering the CMA.
Note 2: The Control Tower is the only authority that permits ground vehicle operations in the
CMA—permission may not be requested/granted from any other source. Three-way relayed
messages to the Control Tower are prohibited.
Note 3: Vehicles must not stop between the perimeter road lights at either end of the runway
without radio contact with, and approval, from the Control Tower. Vehicles operating on the
runway must yield to vehicles traveling across the overruns.
Note 4: Frequency Modulation net/Control Tower frequencies will be used for official airfield
use only. Commanders will ensure only those operations requiring access are permitted in the
CMA.
Note 5: Vehicles operating the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio mounted in
the vehicle to contact the ATCT. The handheld radio should only be used as a backup or when
communication is required outside the vehicle. Conduct a test of the radio before entering the
CMA.
6.14. Airfield Emergencies.
   6.14.1. Immediate response vehicles responding to an airfield emergency may exceed the 15
   MPH/24 KPH speed limit when they display a flashing beacon and when warranted by
   operational necessity. No vehicle will be operated at a speed in excess of that deemed
   reasonable and prudent for existing traffic, road and weather conditions.
   6.14.2. Ground vehicle operators will yield the righty-of-way to all emergency and fire/crash
   vehicles with emergency flashers/rotating lights in motion. Emergency response vehicles are
   Fire Department, Security Forces, Medical support/Ambulance and Airfield Management.
   6.14.3. Ground vehicles not in direct support of the emergency will remain clear of
   taxiways, the runway and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.
   6.14.4. During emergency conditions, the Control Tower will advise aircraft to hold their
   positions so they will not interfere with responding emergency vehicles. At the Control
   Tower’s discretion, aircraft may be taxied to a more suitable parking place or holding area
   that is clear of ground vehicles.
 38                                                             374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012


   6.14.5. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to standby in a designated area
   (e.g., ramp, taxiway, etc.) until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident/on-scene
   commander.
   6.14.6. All emergency response vehicles must have approval from the ATCT or authorized
   vehicle escort, to enter the CMA.
6.15. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
   6.15.1. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will have AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs
   and Markings, signal decal. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the
   driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be
   flipped down for ready reference.
       6.15.1.1. To order AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs and Markings, signal decals, Unit
       ADPMs can go the following website: https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/wms/Default.aspx.

       6.15.3.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross, ― Proceed, ―Go.
       6.15.3.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved.
       6.15.3.3. Flashing Red Light: ―Clear active taxiway/runway.
       6.15.3.4. Flashing White Light: ―Return to starting point.
       6.15.3.5. Red and Green Light: ―General warning. Exercise extreme caution. During
       alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to AM or their
       work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal of contractors
       will be at the discretion of AM. See Attachment 9 for ATCT light gun signals.
6.16. Vehicle Operations in the Vicinity of Aircraft. Do not drive vehicles within 10 feet of a
parked aircraft, except when the aircraft is being serviced, loaded or off-loaded. Then use
spotters to guide the vehicle’s approach to the aircraft. The area within 10 feet of an aircraft is
known as the circle of safety. Vehicle operations within the circle of safety must comply with
the following:
   6.16.1. The maximum speed for vehicles in the vicinity of an aircraft is 5 MPH/8 KPH.
   6.16.2. Vehicles will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet in front, 200
   feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading, unloading,
   servicing or towing. When it becomes necessary to drive under or back toward an aircraft for
   loading or servicing (such as C-130, C-17 or C-5), stop at least 10 feet from the aircraft and
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                      39


  verify overhead clearance with the guide, ensure chocks are pre-set in place, and proceed
  with caution. Once the chocks have been permanently set for the operations, do not remove
  them until the vehicle is at least 10 feet or more from the aircraft. All vehicles must operate
  under the direction of a guide.
  6.16.3. The brakes on all parked vehicles will be set. All parked vehicles will be chocked
  within the circle of safety.
  6.16.4. Vehicles are prohibited from driving or parking to the rear of aircraft unless required
  for maintenance. Vehicles needed for maintenance at the rear of the aircraft may be parked
  there provided the vehicles do not interfere with taxiing aircraft or engine runs on adjacent
  aircraft.
  6.16.5. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they do not interfere with the aircraft being
  towed or taxied. Ignition will be turned off, keys left in the ignition and the gear lever put in
  reverse for vehicles with manual transmissions and in the “park” position for vehicles with
  automatic transmissions. All vehicles parked and left unattended in the circle of safety will
  have brakes set and have wheel chocks placed in front of and behind one of the rear wheels.
  One chock will be placed between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. The
  only vehicles exempt from these requirements are emergency vehicles responding to an
  emergency and K-loaders/forklifts when supporting aircraft. Unattended vehicles outside the
  circle of safety must have the ignition off, keys in the ignition and vehicle placed in park
  (automatic) or reverse (manual).
     6.16.5.1. Park so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be
     toward any part of the aircraft.
     6.16.5.2. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will be braked or, if not
     equipped with brakes, chocked. All ground support equipment will be stored in marked
     AGE yards when not in use. Note: Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield
     and Heliport Planning and Design, defines equipment in use as support equipment in
     place not more than three hours before aircraft arrival or three hours after aircraft
     departure.
     6.16.5.3. When aircraft engines are operating or about to be started, no vehicle will be
     parked or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft (300
     feet to the rear of C-5 and B-747). Vehicles parked at the side of an aircraft will be
     located clear of the wingtips, clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
     6.16.5.4. NEVER drive a vehicle under any part of an aircraft, especially the wings.
     6.16.5.5. Do not drive a vehicle or tow equipment within 10 feet of an aircraft wingtip.
     Do not drive or tow equipment between the wingtips of parked aircraft unless a minimum
     of 10 feet clearance can be maintained on each side of the vehicle.
     6.16.5.6. Do not park closer than 30 feet to any building exit or hangar door unless
     specifically authorized by the Fire Department or 374 AW/SE. This area must be kept
     clear for aircraft towing operations and a minimum 25 feet wing-tip clearance must be
     maintained. Note: Vehicles (maintenance, contractors, mowers etc.) operating near
     obstacles on the airfield such as taxiway/runway guidance signs, INST landing system
     equipment, approach lights etc., will use extreme caution and in the case of backing up
 40                                                              374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012


       towards these obstructions, use a spotter to avoid damage to the vehicle and costly
       equipment.
6.17. Passengers and Cargo in Vehicles.
   6.17.1. Personnel will not ride on any part of a vehicle not intended for carrying passengers
   nor will they ride in or upon trailers.
   6.17.2. Passengers will remain seated while the vehicle is in motion and will keep their arms
   and legs within the vehicle body.
   6.17.3. Passengers will use available seat belts at all times while the vehicle is in motion.
   6.17.4. Passengers will not ride in the doorways or sit on the engine cover of metro vans
   (step vans). Rear door nets will be in place while passengers are transported when the doors
   are open.
   6.17.5. Side doors on passenger vans will be closed, or side door nets will be in place, while
   the vehicle is in motion.
   6.17.6. Passengers are prohibited from riding on towed equipment.
   6.17.7. Passengers will not mount or dismount vehicles while the vehicle is in motion.
   6.17.8. Cargo will be secured using ropes, chains or chocks to prevent injury or damage
   caused by falling or sliding. Cargo extended beyond the body of the vehicle will have a red
   flag attached during daylight hours or a red warning reflector/light during hours of darkness.
6.18. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   6.18.1. Flashing lights or parking lights will be used at night when vehicles (occupied or
   empty) are temporarily parked on any part of the aircraft parking ramp. This does not apply
   if a vehicle is parked in a designated area.
   6.18.2. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive-loaded vehicles will not
   be operated unless directed by the 374 AW/CC.
   6.18.3. When visibility is less than 100 feet, airfield vehicles (except emergency and alert
   vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield. Flashing/hazard lights will be used on all
   vehicles temporarily parked on the aircraft parking apron during periods of reduced visibility.
   6.18.4. When visibility is less than 50 feet, it is recommended that a walking guide equipped
   with a flashing or luminescent wand be used during emergency movement of alert vehicles.
   6.18.5. Vehicle operators will exercise caution to ensure headlights do not point toward
   taxiing aircraft or towing operations so aircraft/tow vehicle operators are not blinded.
   6.18.6. INST Hold Lines. The INST Holding positions consist of two solid yellow parallel
   stripes with double vertical stripes spaced 2 feet apart (which resemble a ladder) and INST
   Hold Line “ILS” signs. The designation for the INST Holding Position “INST” is painted on
   the runway side of the line, to be read facing the runway. To protect the INST Landing
   System critical areas, all aircraft and vehicles must remain behind this line during low
   weather operations (when reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or visibility is less than 2
   statute miles). Prior approval via two-way radio must be established prior to proceeding
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       41


   beyond this line. INST Hold Lines are located on taxiway Foxtrot near taxiway Alpha, and
   on the West Parallel near taxiway Alpha. See Attachment 8.
   6.18.7. During Snow & Ice Operations all vehicles operating on the airfield must give
   priority to snow removal equipment.
       6.18.7.1. All snow removal activities/requests on the airfield must be coordinated
       through 374 OSS/OSAM.
6.19. Pedestrian Movement.
   6.19.1. At a minimum, pedestrians on the airfield must adhere to the following procedures:
   6.19.2. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the flying
   mission.
   6.19.3. Walk facing oncoming traffic.
   6.19.4. Do not sit or recline on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with normal ground
   vehicle and aircraft operations.
   6.19.5. Do not enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from the ATCT.
6.20. Red Carpet. All personnel will avoid driving over the red carpet painted on the
distinguished visitor parking ramp (in front of building 703).
6.21. Lateral Distance Requirements.
   6.21.1. Mobile obstacles will not be placed within 1000 feet of the runway centerline, 200
   feet on either side of the taxiway centerline. Additionally on the aircraft parking apron all
   equipment and vehicles must be inside the wing tip clearance lines (see Attachment 10,
   Figure A10.7) to allow clearance for taxiing aircrafts.
6.22. Control Tower Blind Spots. Control Tower does not have any blind spots.
6.23. Traffic Control Devices/Lights.
   6.23.1. Perimeter roads cross the south overrun 300 feet from the threshold and the north
   overrun 600 feet from the threshold. Both perimeter roads are controlled by stop lights and
   warning bells operated by ATCT personnel.
       6.23.1.1. Vehicles and pedestrians must stop at all stop lights when activated. (See
       Attachment 10.)

6.28. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). (See Attachments 1 and 8) An 800 foot wide by
200 foot long area centered on the runway centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to
protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling
is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4 statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000
feet.).
6.29. Disabled Vehicles.
   6.29.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground vehicle
   operator will:
       6.29.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
       6.29.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “ALL PARTIES BREAK, BREAK-THIS IS (call sign) WITH AN EMERGENCY FOR
       AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT, TOWER ANDMAINTENANCE OPERATIONS CENTER.”
       State the nature of the problem and report your position on the airfield.
       6.29.1.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g., security forces, civil engineer,
       transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off of the
       airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runway.
       6.29.1.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and
       continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
   6.29.2. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify ATCT and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of the
   disabled vehicle from the CMA.
       6.29.2.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in
       the CMA.
       6.29.2.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
       safest way possible.
6.30. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations.
   6.30.1. General. Any personnel required to conduct night vision goggle training on the
   airfield must contact 374 OSS/OSAM. 374 OSS/OSAM does not perform NVD training for
   the base populace. All night vision goggle training will be conducted on the east side and
   must be de-conflicted with aircraft parking and hazardous cargo operations. Vehicles
   operating with lights-out during periods of reduced airfield lighting must use hazard warning
   flashers or mount an IR strobe on the vehicle’s roof so the control tower and aircrew can
   observe the vehicle on the airfield. Vehicles routes shall be designated. Nonparticipating
   vehicles will not mix with participating NVD vehicles on any controlled movement area. All
   vehicle operations will be in compliance with AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 18.
Note 1: Vehicles must still maintain two-way radio communications with the control tower
while operating within the CMA.
Note 2: Vehicle operations should be kept to a minimum during periods of reduced airfield
lighting configurations.
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                   43


   6.30.2. Speed Limits. Note: Per AFJMAN 24-306, vehicle speeds during blackout
   operations will be limited to 10 MPH/16 KPH.
   6.30.3. Driver/Assistant Driver Responsibilities. The driver should focus the goggles for
   distance vision. This may make INST reading difficult. The assistant driver (mandatory) can
   compensate for this by alternating between distance and close-up viewing, advising the
   driver of the status of warning lights, speedometer, fuel gauge and other INST readings. The
   assistant driver may need to sit directly behind the driver to gain a better view of the INST
   panel. The assistant driver must use a slow scanning pattern and tell the driver of any
   obstacles inside or outside his field of view.
   6.30.4. Accident Reporting. All accidents should be reported through the unit VCO. If a
   vehicle is disabled on the airfield, notify 374 OSS/OSAM at 225-7006 or on the ramp net.
   6.30.5. Licensing Procedures. See paragraph 6.1. of this instruction for initial issue of the
   airfield driver’s license. Only NVD qualified personnel can train/sign off the AF Form 483
   for NVD driving. NVD instructors should annotate “NVD qualified” on the AF Form 483.
   6.30.6. Annual Refresher Training. NVD instructors will conduct annual practical refresher
   training and annotate on the AF Form 483.
   6.30.7. NVD Instructor Qualification Requirements. Must have a current airfield driver’s
   license and a current NVD license.
   6.30.8. Vehicles operating with lights-out during periods of reduced airfield lighting must
   use hazard warning flashers or mount an Infrared (IR) strobe on the vehicle’s roof so the
   ATCT and aircrew can observe the vehicle on the airfield. Note: Vehicles must still
   maintain two-way radio communications with the ATCT while operating on the CMA.
   6.30.9. Vehicle routes shall be designated. Non-participating vehicles will not mix with
   participating NVD vehicles on any CMA. Note: Vehicle operations should be kept to a
   minimum during periods of reduced airfield lighting configurations.
6.31. Vehicle Escorts/Convoy.
   6.31.1. The escort is responsible for ensuring all vehicles and personnel being escorted have
   exited the airfield at the completion of their duties.
   6.31.2. Escorts operating within the CMA must state to Control Tower their call sign plus
   the number of vehicles/people they’re escorting.
      6.31.2.1. The escort is responsible for ensuring all vehicles and personnel being escorted
      have exited out of the CMA before reporting off to Control Tower. The escort must stay
      with all vehicles/personnel while in the CMA. Note: Number of vehicles being escorted
      must not exceed four per escort.

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   7.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what the controller wants
   them to do.
   7.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
7.2. Radio Techniques.
   7.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   7.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   7.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the microphone
   button, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   7.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   7.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   stuck mike, and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   7.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   7.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
7.3. Phraseology.
   7.3.1. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time they proceed
   onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must advise the
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                      45


    controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are.
    Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground control and other
    persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft
    and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
    transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
        7.3.1.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 7.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “YOKOTA TOWER AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, YOKOTA TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “YOKOTA TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO CROSS
                                      RUNWAY 18 AT TAXIWAY ECHO WEST.
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS RUNWAY 18 AT TAXIWAY ECHO. WEST
                                      or “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 18.”

    7.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
    correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
    do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
    communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.
    Note: Do not move your until entire radio transmission is completed with ATCT.

Table 7.2. Sample Read back Instructions
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS APPROVED TO CROSS RUNWAY 18
                                      AT TAXIWAY ECHO WILL REPORT WHEN OFF.” or
Note: Airfield 1 visually scans the
runway prior to entry, and then       “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING SHORT AT TAXIWAY ECHO.”
proceeds across the runway.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “YOKOTA TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING COMPLETE, OFF
                                      RUNWAY 18 AT TAXIWAY ECHO EAST.”

ATCT:                                 ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.

    7.3.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
    read back to the ATCT.
    7.3.4. The words "clear" or ―clearance must not be used in communication with ATCT.
    Exception: Vehicle operators may reply―Loud and Clear in response to an ATCT request
    for radio transmission quality or clarity.

Table 7.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED VIA TAXIWAY CHARLIE, HOLD
                                      SHORT OF RUNWAY 18.” or “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED VIA
                                      CHARLIE, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 18.”


VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “AIRFIELD THREE, ROGER.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD THREE, READ BACK HOLD INSTRUCTIONS.”
 46                                                                        374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012


VEHICLE OPERATOR:                         “AIRFIELD THREE, PROCEEDING VIA CHARLIE, WILL HOLD
                                          SHORT OF RUNWAY 18.”

7.4. Common Use Phrases.

Table 7.4. Common Use Phrases

Control Tower (ATCT) approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the ATCT).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific ATCT
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
errors. Refer to AFI 91-223, paragraph 1.3.1.8., for reportable HATR reporting procedures and
paragraph 1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.
Expedite—Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an
imminent situation.

Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system,
component, tire, munitions, or support equipment caused by a foreign object(s) which may or
may not degrade the required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned
items.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs)—Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Ground Vehicle Traffic Lane—A defined and marked lane on the flightline used for the
movement of vehicle traffic.
Hold or Hold Short—Used by ATC to indicate you must stay where you are currently located
or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)—For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AWI.
Negative—No, or permission not granted, or that is not correct.
Out—The conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—My transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012                                                                       53


Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
Read Back—Repeat my message back to me.
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines will indicate the
boundaries.
Roger—I understand and have received all of your transmission.
Runway—A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again—Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission was
not understood or received.
Stand By—To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway—A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit—For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
 54                                                           374AWI13-213 13 APRIL 2012


Wake Turbulence—A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Without Delay—With a sense of urgency, proceed with approved instructions in a rapid
manner.
Words Twice—Communication is difficult. Please say every phrase twice.
Wilco—I have received your message, understand it, and will comply with it.
