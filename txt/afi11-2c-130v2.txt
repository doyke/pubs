         1.9.3.1.3. (Pilots/Navigators Only) Mission – Formation. Units with a baseline
         formation airdrop Mission evaluation will annotate the AF Form 8 as MSN with no
         restrictions.
         1.9.3.1.4. (Flight Engineers/Loadmasters Only) Mission – Units with an airdrop
         mission (single ship or formation) will annotate the AF Form 8 as MSN with no
         restrictions.
         1.9.3.1.5. Any crewmember that maintains a qualification level below these baselines
         will have restrictions listed on their “MSN” AF Form 8. For example,
         “RESTRICTIONS: Will not perform airdrop/formation operations.”
         1.9.3.1.6. See Chapter 6 for LC-130 Mission evaluations.
     1.9.3.2. For units/aircrew with an airdrop requirement, mission evaluations for all crew
     positions should include an actual airdrop load, if possible. For units/aircrew with a NVG
     requirement, MSN evaluations for all crew positions should be at night using NVGs if
     scheduling permits.
  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the C-130,
  crewmembers will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and
  evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on
  their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. Crewmembers may use their initial
  instructor evaluation to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation provided all
  evaluation requirements for the periodic evaluation are met. Refer to the specific aircrew
  chapter for requirements.
  1.9.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use AFI 11-202V2 and the following:
  Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures and systems knowledge
  for all QUAL and MSN evaluations. See specific crew position chapters of this AFI for EPE
  requirements.
     1.9.5.1. Group Standardization and Evaluation office (OG/OGV) will develop and
     periodically review a list of EPE program requirements (topics, special interest, etc.).
     OG/OGV will also develop an EPE guide for each crew position detailing the evaluation
 8                                                                 AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014


        areas and conduct of the EPE. EPEs shall emphasize emergency procedures and systems
        knowledge. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s graduated
        training (e.g. initial, line, instructor, evaluator) or as specified in AFI 11-202V2,
        MAJCOM and unit supplements. Examiners may use one continuous scenario throughout
        the EPE or use different scenarios as required to ensure appropriate areas are evaluated.
        1.9.5.2. Simulated emergencies will not be evaluated during critical phases of flight (low
        level flight and airdrop). This does not preclude simulated emergencies being performed
        in the traffic pattern. If available, conduct an EPE in a simulator, WST or Aircrew
        Training Device (ATD). If not available, the EPE will be verbally evaluated.
        1.9.5.3. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
        examinee must be able to recite, perform or write all Boldface items from memory.
        1.9.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
        supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
        Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
        Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
        successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
        202V2.
     1.9.6. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8,
     Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
1.10. Grading System. (T-1) See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5, Grading System, and the
following.
     1.10.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the general
     and specific evaluation sections of this instruction.
     1.10.2. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated or evaluated in an WST/ATD. These areas are marked by “Verbally Evaluated If
     Not Observed” in the appropriate chapter and an “ * ” on the AF IMT 3862. Flight examiners
     will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight or in a WST/ATD before
     resorting to this provision. Record all verbally evaluated areas in the mission description (e.g.
     Area 42. NVG Usage/Limitations was verbally evaluated.)
     1.10.3. If an alternate method is used to complete the evaluation, document in the Additional
     Comments portion of the AF Form 8. Use of this provision must be approved by the
     examinee’s commander. The commander’s signature on the AF Form 8 acknowledges this
     provision has been approved. Some examples where this would apply: evaluating loading
     using the Fuselage Trainer (FuT), verbally evaluating an area that is not marked with an “*”
     etc.
     1.10.4. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
     also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title and shading of
     Q- block on the AF IMT 3862.
     1.10.5. Crew Resource Management (CRM) / Threat and Error Management (TEM). If
     CRM is downgraded during the evaluation, the evaluator will also complete an AF IMT 4031
AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014                                                                      9


   (or AMC equivalent), CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation. The completed IMT will be
   forwarded to OG/OGV, for inclusion in SEB trends and to the AMC CRM/TEM Program
   Manager (HQ AMC/A3TO).
1.11. Conduct of Evaluations. (T-1)
   1.11.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
   of the evaluation and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
   the examinee in each graded area/sub area.
       1.11.1.1. Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel who write their performance
       reports, they have primarily trained or recommended for upgrade.
   1.11.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any seat
   or position that best enables the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s performance.
   Simulator/ATS contractors will not be in the seat during evaluations in the WST/ATD.
   1.11.3. Evaluators will note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and
   performance criteria during the evaluation. They will compare the examinee’s performance
   with the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each
   area.
       1.11.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
       1.11.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2 and
       this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level
       on the AF Form 8. The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.
       During the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
       deviations, area/sub area grades assigned and any additional training required.
       1.11.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
       additional training requirements. Required additional training will not be accomplished
       on the same flight. EXCEPTION: Required additional training on the same flight is
       allowed when unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities (e.g.
       thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings, etc.) exist. This option requires flight
       examiner discretion and judicious application. When used, the examinee must be
       informed when the additional training begins and ends.
   1.11.4. The WST/ATD may be used to accomplish additional training and re-checks. Areas
   for additional training and rechecks should be limited to those areas/sub areas that can be
   realistically accomplished in a WST/ATD.
   1.11.5. Rechecks should be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
   administered the original evaluation.
   1.11.6. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations in
   the aircraft, but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
1.12. Use of AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. (T-1) Units may develop their own
overprint AF IMT 3862 using the examples in Attachments 2-6. Copy each title, area number
and text (in the order illustrated) and shading to the appropriate blocks. Units may add special
interest items and/or local evaluation requirements. All items on the AF IMT 3862 are expected
 10                                                          AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014


to be evaluated unless they are not part of the unit’s baseline or otherwise noted. Use the
worksheet to ensure all required areas are evaluated. Record positive and negative trend
information and/or aircrew member’s performance using the “T” column if desired (this
information is necessary when transcribing the flight information into a MAJCOM approved
module). The AF IMT 3862 or draft copy of the AF Form 8, signed by the flight examiner, will
serve as the temporary evaluation certificate. File the AF IMT 3862 or draft copy of the AF Form
8 in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation
as a temporary record of the evaluation results. Maintain the temporary record until the
completed AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then dispose of properly.
1.13. Aircrew Testing. (T-1) See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 6
and the following.
   1.13.1. Open-Book Exam. An open-book exam is a requisite for the QUAL and MSN
   evaluations. The open book QUAL exam will consist of a minimum of 60 questions. The
   open book MSN exam will consist of a minimum of 40 questions, at least 25% of which will
   come from tactical doctrine documents related to C-130 combat operations (Air Force
   Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP)). If a combined exam is created for
   combination evaluations (QUAL/MSN), it will have the appropriate number of questions for
   each portion (i.e. the QUAL/MSN open book will have at least 100 questions).
   1.13.2. Closed-Book Exam. A closed-book exam is a requisite for all QUAL or combined
   QUAL/MSN evaluations. The exam will consist of a minimum of 20 questions from the
   Master Question File (MQF). The closed book exam will contain mission/tactical questions
   for crew members that are MSN qualified. Complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with
   the closed-book exam.
   1.13.3. Instructor Open-Book Exam.
       1.13.3.1. For initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluations, a different/separate open-book
       exam will be administered (in addition to the open-book exam if the INIT INSTR
       evaluation will count as a full-periodic evaluation). The INIT INSTR open-book exam
       will have a minimum of 20 questions and may be derived from AFMAN 36-2236,
       Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, AFI 11-2C-130V1, V2 and V3 (including
       MAJCOM supplements) and flight instructor related sources. Questions should include
       scenario-driven instructor questions.
       1.13.3.2. Subsequent (periodic) and re-qualification (RQ) INSTR evaluations. A portion
       of the open-book exam will include instructor questions. A separate (unique) INSTR
       open-book exam is required if instructor questions are not included with the open-book
       exam.
1.14. Typical C-130 Evaluation Profile(s). (T-1) The unit (OG/CC or OG/OGV) will
determine the evaluation profiles suitable for aircrew evaluations based on units’ mission
baseline requirements and document profiles in local guidance (unit supplement, operating
instruction or process guide). All items on the AF IMT 3862 are expected to be evaluated unless
they are not part of the unit’s baseline or otherwise noted.
1.15. Multiple C-130 Model Certification. Accomplish difference training IAW
AFI112C130V1, C-130 Aircrew Training. A periodic evaluation may be accomplished in any C-
AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014                                                                     11


130 aircraft model in which the individual is certified. Attempt to accomplish requisite testing in
the same aircraft model in which the flight evaluation is flown or expected to be flown.
1.16. Senior Officer Requirements. (T-1) Senior Officers meeting the criteria outlined in
AFI11202V1, Aircrew Training, may complete a C-130 Senior Officer qualification evaluation.
Requisites include open and closed book examinations, instrument examination, Boldface and
EPE. See AFI 11202V1, AFI 11-2C-130V1, and Chapter 2/3.
 12                                                              AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014


                                            Chapter 2

                                    PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for instrument/qualification, mission and instructor evaluations.
   2.1.1. Combined evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL/MSN) are the desired method of
   evaluation. The combined evaluation allows greater flexibility, allows the evaluator to see the
   full spectrum of the pilot’s capabilities and it reduces the number of overall evaluations each
   unit must accomplish. Events that are accomplished during one portion of the evaluation are
   not required to be evaluated again (e.g. if a non-precision approach is flown during the SKE
   recovery, it does not have to be re-accomplished during the instrument phase of the
   evaluation).
   2.1.2. Under no circumstances will a flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow below one
   engine-out Vmca or exceed aircraft limitations specified in the flight manual, regardless of
   tolerances listed for specific areas. (T-1)
   2.1.3. If the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for performance of a
   maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lower limits of
   that range. (T1)
   2.1.4. Evaluator pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew
   members.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). (T-1) C-
130 instrument evaluations will be accomplished concurrently with qualification evaluations.
Include all areas (unless otherwise noted) under GENERAL, INSTRUMENT and
QUALIFICATION. Conduct the evaluation in-flight or in a WST (Level C certification or
better).
   2.2.1. Accomplish a minimum of one precision and one non-precision approach. Instrument/
   Qualification evaluations should include approaches to airfields other than home station or
   deployed locations.
   2.2.2. Flight Pilot.
       2.2.2.1. From the left or right seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated
       on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. Designate crew position as FP on the AF
       Form 8.
       2.2.2.2. Flight Pilots do not require a separate INIT INSTM/QUAL evaluation when
       transitioning to aircraft commander. The skill set is identical for both positions. If an
       INSTM/QUAL evaluation is administered in conjunction with the INIT MSN evaluation
       leading to aircraft commander certification, document the INSTM/QUAL and INIT MSN
       on separate blocks in the flight phase section of the AF Form 8 and designate crew
       position as MP on the AF Form 8.
   2.2.3. Aircraft Commander.
AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014                                                                       13


       2.2.3.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
       evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. Designate crew position as MP on the AF Form
       8.
   2.2.4. Instructor Pilot.
       2.2.4.1. From the left or right seat evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated
       on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. Designate crew position as IP on the AF
       Form 8. See 2.5 for further guidance.
   2.2.5. Pilot Senior Officer. From the left seat evaluate appropriate areas in GENERAL,
   INSTRUMENT and QUALIFICATION. See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, Senior
   Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements and AFI 11-2C-130V1, C-130 Aircrew
   Training, Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements for additional information. A
   qualified C130 Instructor pilot or above will be in the other seat.
       2.2.5.1. For Senior Officer Course A/B, this evaluation consists of a variety of
       instrument approaches and VFR patterns. This evaluation will consist of a minimum of
       one precision and one non-precision approach and one 50% and one 100% flap landing.
       No-flap and simulated engine-out approach, go-around and landings are not required.
       This evaluation is normally completed in the aircraft. Annotate AF Form 8 as a
       INSTM/QUAL evaluation with expiration date, crew position is “FP” and include a
       restriction on the AF Form 8, “Fly only under direct supervision of a qualified C-130
       instructor pilot.”
       2.2.5.2. For Senior Officer Course C1, annotate AF Form 8 as unrestricted QUAL with
       expiration date, crew position is “FP”.
       2.2.5.3. For Senior Officer Course C2, annotate AF Form 8 as unrestricted QUAL/MSN
       (AL) with expiration date, crew position is “MP”.
2.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) Mission evaluations
will fall into one of three categories: Formation Airdrop, Single-ship Airdrop, Airland only.
   2.3.1. All Profiles.
       2.3.1.1. The max-effort portion will consist of a tactical/max-effort takeoff and
       tactical/max-effort landing and should be accomplished at the end of the tactical
       approach. Landings will be performed on an actual landing zone if available. If not
       available, a larger runway with landing zone markings (IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and
       Landing Zone Operations) and clearly identifiable touchdown zone may be used. One go-
       around is permitted, provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone. As a
       minimum, thoroughly verbally evaluate Flight Pilots on pilot-not-flying duties during
       tactical/max-effort procedures.
       2.3.1.2. Units and/or aircrew with a combat mission evaluation requirement (regardless
       of the type of mission being flown) will be evaluated on Area 36 (Defensive
       Systems/Tactics) and Area 37 (Threat Avoidance).
   2.3.2. Formation Airdrop. A visual low-level route or SKE/AWADS route to an airdrop
   and recovery must be flown to complete the evaluation. Alternate the type of
   route/airdrop/recovery flown on subsequent periodic MSN evaluations at a minimum. Unit
   policy may be more restrictive requiring both types be flown. Regardless, failure to
14                                                            AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014


  accomplish the proper events will result in loss of MSN qualification for affected individuals.
  The evaluator and examinee will ensure the correct evaluation profile prior to flight. All
  General and Mission Areas (except Area 56) are required evaluation items unless otherwise
  specified in Attachment 3. Conduct the evaluation in-flight or in a WST (Level C
  certification or better).
     2.3.2.1. Visual Route. A visual tactical arrival will be flown and will consist of a high or
     low altitude tactical arrival. The low altitude tactical arrival may be made at the end of
     the penetration approach.
     2.3.2.2. IMC Route. SKE/AWADS evaluations must be planned and briefed as a 2-ship
     (minimum) but may be flown single-ship (at the discretion of the evaluator).
  2.3.3. Single-Ship Airdrop. The airdrop profile will (as a minimum) consist of a visual low-
  level route or an IFR route flown to an airdrop. Units may require both types to be flown.
  General Area 1-11 and Mission Areas 36-49 are required evaluation items unless otherwise
  specified in Attachment 3. Conduct the evaluation in-flight or in a WST (Level C
  certification or better).
     2.3.3.1. Visual Route. A visual tactical arrival will be flown and will consist of a high or
     low altitude tactical arrival. The low altitude tactical arrival may be made at the end of
     the penetration approach.
  2.3.4. Airland Only. Airland Mission Pilots that maintain max-effort qualification will fly
  an IFR or VFR route (minimum of 20 minutes long and greater than MEA, MOCA, OROCA,
  or ORTCA AGL) to a TOA at an airfield or landing zone (LZ). The arrival will consist of a
  tactical arrival followed by a max-effort landing. General Areas 1-11 and Mission Areas 36-
  45 and 56 are required evaluation items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 3.
  Conduct the evaluation in-flight or in a WST (Level C certification or better).
  2.3.5. Flight Pilot.
     2.3.5.1. From the right seat evaluate all applicable Mission areas in this chapter as
     illustrated on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. The MSN evaluation will focus
     on pilot monitoring duties. Pilot flying duties may be evaluated on Areas 36-37, Areas
     44-45 and Areas 51-53. Designate as FP with restrictions as needed on the AF Form 8.
     For Formation Airdrop profiles, the evaluation may be flown in the lead (preferred) or
     wing position.
     2.3.5.2. All pilots not previously certified as an aircraft commander in a C-130 will
     receive an Initial Mission evaluation (INIT MSN) prior to aircraft commander
     certification. Conduct the INIT MSN evaluation IAW para 2.3.7. and designate crew
     position as MP on the AF Form 8. Note: An Operational Mission Checkout will be
     administered as part of the Pilot Checkout Program. See AFI 11-2C-130V1 for further
     guidance.
  2.3.6. Aircraft Commander.
     2.3.6.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
     evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. Designate crew position as MP on the AF Form
     8.
     2.3.6.2. Formation Profiles.
AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014                                                                       15


           2.3.6.2.1. Non-Lead. The route will be flown in the wing position or element lead
           position without followers.
           2.3.6.2.2. Element Lead. Accomplish the route in the element lead (preferred) or
           flight lead position.
           2.3.6.2.3. Flight Lead. Accomplish the route in the flight lead (preferred) or element
           lead position. The flight lead pilot should also participate in the mission commander
           duties.
   2.3.7. Instructor Pilot. From the left or right seat evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as
   illustrated on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 3. Designate crew position as IP on
   the AF Form 8. See 2.5 for further guidance.
   2.3.8. Pilots that do not meet unit baseline mission requirement (such as, Basic Mission
   Capable (BMC) crewmembers) will note appropriate restrictions the AF Form 8 (i.e.
   Airdrop, Formation, SKE/AWADS, etc.). See Chapter 1 for further baseline guidance.
2.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). (T-1) Flight examiners
will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and
provide timely, effective corrective action. Instructor pilots should be able to brief, observe,
assess and debrief the student’s overall performance. The evaluator will state which instructional
abilities were evaluated in the comments section of the AF Form 8. List a minimum of two areas
instructed by the examinee. If the instructor taught throughout the entire mission and there were
numerous areas in which instructional ability was demonstrated, one general comment will
suffice. Conduct initial or requalification instructor evaluations with a qualified pilot occupying
the other seat. For the initial instructor evaluation the examinee will occupy the right seat. On
recurring or RQ evaluations the instructor examinee may occupy either seat.
   2.4.1. During periodic QUAL evaluations, instructors will initiate a simulated aircraft
   malfunction requiring a simulated engine shutdown, simulated engine-out approach and go-
   around. Instructors will be evaluated on their ability to ensure safe simulated engine-out
   operations.
   2.4.2. If airdrop mission qualified, all INIT and RQ instructor evaluations require the
   examinee to instruct a SKE or visual low-level route and airdrop.
   2.4.3. All instructor areas/sub areas are required instructor evaluation items.
2.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). (T-1)
   2.5.1. The EPE should cover a cross section of aircraft systems emergencies such as bleed
   air, fuel, oil, electrical, engines, avionics, hydraulics, self-contained navigation system
   (SCNS) and propellers. Examinees should be able to demonstrate an understanding of
   aircraft systems beyond the actual steps required for an emergency procedure. A WST may
   be used to conduct the EPE. Include the following items on EPEs:
       2.5.1.1. All Boldface procedures.
       2.5.1.2. Take-off and Landing Data (TOLD) definitions, take-off procedures and

                               NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission and instructor evaluations.
3.2. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) On a Category
I or II route of no less than 1.5 hours, the examinee must demonstrate proficiency in navigation
procedures. All General and Qualification areas/sub areas are required qualification evaluation
items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 4. In addition, navigators will take the open-
book written instrument examination IAW AFMAN 11-210. This will be documented on the
ground phase portion of the AF Form 8.
   3.2.1. Simulator Evaluations. Navigators may accomplish initial or periodic qualification
   evaluations or the qualification portion of a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation in an
   Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), Weapon System Trainer (WST) or Satellite Navigation
   Station (SNS).
       3.2.1.1. Basic Qualified Navigators (i.e. FN) must accomplish, at a minimum, every
       other QUAL evaluation in the aircraft.
   3.2.2. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). The ARA is considered part of a navigator’s basic
   qualification. It will, however, be evaluated on both the qualification and mission evaluation
   (only one required if doing a combination evaluation). State that an ARA was evaluated in
   the comments section of the AF Form 8. A navigator graded U in the ARA area may not fly
   unsupervised on any flight until successful re-accomplishment. The ARA may not be
   verbally evaluated.
   3.2.3. Grid Navigation. After initial Grid certification, evaluate Grid procedures on all
   periodic qualification evaluations. State, “Grid procedures were evaluated,” in the comments
   section of the AF Form 8. At the discretion of the flight examiner, a navigator graded U in
   the Grid area may continue to fly unsupervised on non-Grid missions.
   3.2.4. Navigator Senior Officer. Evaluate appropriate areas in GENERAL and
   QUALIFICATION. This evaluation can be completed in the OFT, WST, SNS or the aircraft.
   See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, Senior Officer Qualification and Performance
   Requirements and AFI 11-2C-130V1, C-130 Aircrew Training, Senior Officer Qualification
   Training Requirements for additional information.
       3.2.4.1. For Senior Officer Course A/B, annotate AF Form 8 as a QUAL evaluation with
       expiration date, crew position is “FN” and include a restriction in the comment section,
       “Fly only under direct supervision of a qualified C-130 instructor navigator.”
       3.2.4.2. For Senior Officer Course C1, annotate AF Form 8 as unrestricted QUAL with
       expiration date, crew position is “FN”.
       3.2.4.3. For Senior Officer Course C2, annotate AF Form 8 as unrestricted QUAL/MSN
       (AL) with expiration date, crew position is “MN”.
3.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) Mission evaluations
will fall into one of three categories: formation airdrop, single-ship airdrop or airland.
36                                                           AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014


  3.3.1. Formation Airdrop. The airdrop profile will (as a minimum) consist of a visual low-
  level route or a SKE/AWADS route flown to an airdrop and a TOT. A TOT must be
  accomplished during flight and will not be verbally debriefed. Type of route flown will be
  alternated on recurring mission evaluations, i.e. if a visual route is flown this time then an
  AWADS/SKE route must be flown next time. The navigator will be unqualified in the C-130
  mission if he/she goes for greater than two evaluation cycles without accomplishing both of
  these events. The evaluator and examinee will ensure the correct profile to be evaluated prior
  to flight. Units may require both types to be flown. All General and Mission areas/sub areas
  are required evaluation items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 4. Formation
  Airdrop mission evaluations will not be accomplished in the WST simulator due to airdrop
  scoring limitations.
     3.3.1.1. Non-Lead Navigator. Visual route: Accomplish an unfamiliar visual tactical
     low-level route in the lead position or single ship. Formal school student evaluations may
     consider any low-level route unfamiliar. The SKE route will be accomplish in the wing
     position.
     3.3.1.2. Element Lead Navigator. Visual route: Accomplish an unfamiliar visual tactical
     low-level route in the lead position or single ship. Formal school student evaluations may
     consider any low-level route unfamiliar. Accomplish the SKE/AWADS route in
     SKE/AWADS element lead position.
     3.3.1.3. Formation Lead Navigator. The lead navigator should participate in the mission
     commander duties. Visual route: Accomplish an unfamiliar visual tactical low-level route
     in the lead position or single ship. SKE/AWADS route: Accomplish the SKE/AWADS
     route in SKE/AWADS lead or SKE/AWADS element lead position. The SKE/AWADS
     portion must be planned and briefed as a 2-ship (minimum) but may be flown single ship
     (at the discretion of the evaluator).
     3.3.1.4. An unfamiliar route is defined as a route not flown by the examinee in the
     previous six months. Run-in should be at least 15 degrees different from normal run-in
     heading. Visual routes should be NVG routes.
  3.3.2. Single-Ship Airdrop. The airdrop profile will (as a minimum) consist of a visual low-
  level route or an IFR route flown to an airdrop and a Time Over Target (TOT). A TOT must
  be accomplished during flight and will not be verbally debriefed. Units may require both
  types to be flown. Visual routes will be planned IAW paragraph 3.3.1.3 All General and
  Mission areas/sub areas except Areas 35 and 45 are required evaluation items unless
  otherwise specified in Attachment 4. Single-ship Airdrop mission evaluations will not be
  accomplished in the WST simulator due to airdrop scoring limitations.
  3.3.3. Airland. The airland profile will consist of an IFR or VFR route (minimum of 20
  minutes long and greater than MEA, MOCA, OROCA, or ORTCA) to a tactical approach
  and landing with controlled TOA landing time. All General and Mission areas/sub areas
  except Areas 35, 36, 41, 42 and 45 are required evaluation items unless otherwise specified
  in Attachment 4. Airland mission evaluations may be accomplished in the WST simulator.
  3.3.4. Combined QUAL/MSN Evaluation. The QUAL/MSN evaluation is not mandatory
  for mission qualified navigators, but may be used to reduce the number of evaluations given
  during a 17-month cycle, while focusing on the most essential areas of the navigation
AFI11-2C-130V2 25 JULY 2014                                                                       37


   process. The QUAL/MSN evaluation will consist of an airland planning portion (to include
   applicable open/closed book tests/IRC/EPE/Boldface requisites) and the mission planning
   followed by the flight evaluation as defined above. An ARA will be flown. The overwater
   planning will be completed prior to the mission flight evaluation. The evaluator will present
   an overwater planning scenario based on a realistic operational mission scenario that will
   drive the airland mission planning. Evaluators will examine airland mission planning to
   include all applicable navigation procedures (route selection, flight in formation, publication
   review, flight plan, chart preparation, weather consideration, preflight fuel planning, equal
   time point computation, coast in/out procedures, deviation checks, aircraft position fixes, log
   work, dead reckoning, fuel management, departure and arrival).
       3.3.4.1. The low-level mission planning will be completed prior to the mission
       evaluation. The flying phase of the mission will remain as currently defined.
       3.3.4.2. During the airland/mission planning phases and flight debrief, the evaluator may
       ask the examinee to demonstrate navigation procedures pertaining to airland and/or
       mission planning.
3.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) Flight examiners
will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and
provide timely, effective corrective action. State that instructional abilities were evaluated in the
comments section of the AF Form 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee. If
the instructor taught throughout the entire mission and there were numerous areas in which
instructional ability was demonstrated, one general comment will suffice.
   3.4.1. If mission qualified, all initial and re-qualification instructor evaluations require the
   examinee to instruct a mission sortie as defined above in paragraphs 3.3.1, 3.3.2 or 3.3.3.
   3.4.2. All instructor areas/sub areas are required instructor evaluation items on all flight
   evaluations.

                              LOADMASTER EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission and instructor evaluations.
   5.1.1. Evaluator Loadmasters shall not conduct QUAL and/or MSN evaluations while
   serving as a primary aircrew member. (T-1)
5.2. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) For
qualification evaluations, the aircraft must be pre-flighted and loaded with a palletized or
vehicular load, a mission flown and then offloaded to complete the evaluation. If a qualification
evaluation is combined with a mission evaluation, an airdrop platform/CDS can be used for the
qualification evaluation load/offload requirement. If a load is not available for an evaluation,
palletized, airdrop platform or vehicular cargo will be static loaded and offloaded upon
completion of the flight portion. All General and Qualification areas/sub areas are required
qualification evaluation items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 6.
5.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1)
   5.3.1. Mission Airdrop Evaluation. At a minimum, an airdrop mission evaluation must
   consist of a single CDS container or single heavy equipment platform. Do not conduct two
   separate mission evaluations on the same flight with only one airdrop load aboard. An
   airdrop sortie and evaluation may be credited if an unplanned no-drop is called after
   completion of the Slowdown Checklist provided the no-drop was not due to loadmaster error.
   All General and Mission areas/sub areas are required mission evaluation items unless
   otherwise specified in Attachment 6. Document initial personnel restriction when actual
   personnel is not completed during initial mission training on AF Form 8. Use the following
   statement when actual personnel cannot be performed during initial mission training:
       5.3.1.1. RESTRICTIONS:
           5.3.1.1.1. SUPERVISED STATUS for personnel airdrop until an actual static line
           personnel airdrop is accomplished. Final certification will be accomplished under the
           supervision of a loadmaster instructor or flight examiner.
           5.3.1.1.2. Actual personnel airdrop accomplished on __________.
   5.3.2. Mission Airland Evaluation. At a minimum, all General and Mission areas/sub
   areas are required mission evaluation items other than Areas 32, 33, 34 unless otherwise
   specified in Attachment 6. Minimum requirement for an airland mission evaluation will
   include onload/offload procedures and mission checklists other than airdrop.
5.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). (T-1) Flight examiners
will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and
provide timely, effective corrective action. All instructor areas/sub areas are required instructor
evaluation items. State that instructional abilities were evaluated in the comments section of the
AF Form 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee. If the instructor taught
throughout the entire mission and there were numerous areas in which instructional ability was
demonstrated, one general comment will suffice.
