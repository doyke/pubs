                                           Chapter 2

                                LOGISTICS MOVEMENTS

2.1. General. This section outlines procedures and responsibilities for peacetime and
emergency logistics movement of nuclear cargo and implements DoDI 4540.05, DoD
Transportation of US Nuclear Weapons, TO 11N-45-51, Transportation of Nuclear Materiel,
and AFI 13-526v1, Prime Nuclear Airlift Force Operations. Commanders may deviate from
these requirements during emergencies, but must maintain US custody of nuclear weapons and
components.
   2.1.1. The preferred method of movement for nuclear weapons containing conventional high
   explosives is by SGT. The Secretary of the Air Force or Commander of the unified/specified
   command will approve the movement by air of nuclear weapons that contain conventional
   high explosives (AFI 91-115, Safety Rules for Nuclear Logistics Transport by the Prime
   Nuclear Airlift Force).
   2.1.2. Use nuclear-certified vehicles, support equipment and approved procedures during all
   logistics movements. (T-0). Equipment and test items that do not require certification are
   specified in the appropriate technical order.
   2.1.3. Non-mission essential personnel are not permitted on missions. (T-1).
   2.1.4. Safety and security of nuclear weapons movements are paramount. During peacetime
   movement planning, safety and security must be given higher priority than operational
   requirements in determining transportation modes and routes. (T-0).
   2.1.5. It is not necessary to take precautions to avoid satellite coverage during logistic
   movements.
   2.1.6. Use only qualified PNAF aircrews for movements of nuclear weapons or warheads.
   (T-0).
   2.1.7. Use DoD motor vehicles for off base logistics movement of nuclear weapons when the
   head of a DoD component or a unified or specified command determines vehicle use to be
   safer or more practical than using US military aircraft. (T-0). The determination must be in
   writing and the authority to make this determination cannot be delegated. In such cases,
   maintain US military custody at all times. (T-0).
   2.1.8. Unclassified items do not require special airlift and need not be included in the NOSS.
   However, do not separate mixed loads of classified and unclassified special test items and
   test equipment. (T-1). Mixed loads must be moved using a security level and procedures
   commensurate with requirements of the classified cargo. (T-1).
   2.1.9. Emergency movement may be implemented if:
      2.1.9.1. Authorized either by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) or by the commander of a
      unified or specified command, or their specifically designated representatives.
      2.1.9.2. The security and or safety of nuclear weapons or components are endangered.
      2.1.9.3. It is the only alternative to destruction or loss of the weapons or cargo.
 22                                                        AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


2.2. Specific Responsibilities for Transporting, Shipping, and Receiving Nuclear Cargo.
   2.2.1. AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division Responsibilities.
      2.2.1.1. SAAM Support.
          2.2.1.1.1. Consolidate nuclear-related items on SAAMs when possible. Coordinate
          opportune cargo request with 618 AOC/XOOON, as required. (T-2).
          2.2.1.1.2. Send SAAM requests as soon as possible to provide 618 AOC/XOOON
          maximum advantage when planning missions. OCONUS SAAM requests should be
          submitted NLT 60 days prior to the required delivery date, CONUS SAAM requests
          should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the required delivery date. Identify airlift
          requirements, including tentative on-load and off-load locations, availability dates,
          and required delivery dates. Keep changes to SAAMs to a minimum; however,
          submit significant changes as they occur. Changes must be mission-essential with
          appropriate justification from the using command agency. (T-1).
          2.2.1.1.3. When required, request a MTO from DTRA to release or transfer nuclear
          cargo. (T-0).
          2.2.1.1.4. Include hazardous cargo information in the SAAM request for nuclear-
          related cargo not listed in TO 11N-45-51A, Transportation of Nuclear Weapons

AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 23


         2.2.1.4.1. Shipments of non-nuclear or non-radiological assemblies/components that
         require Type II security will be accomplished using transportation other than PNAF
         assets provided proper security is maintained (i.e., ANG C-130 aircraft with armed
         aircrew). These shipments may be requested via TRANSCOM SAAM. Shipments of
         components not requiring special security may be accomplished through commercial
         means.
  2.2.2. MAJCOMs Responsibilities. MAJCOMS will:
     2.2.2.1. Promptly review and ensure units can support actions identified in the NOSS,
     NNSA transportation requests and SAAM set-up messages.
     2.2.2.2. Ensure shortfall or conflicts are reported to AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics
     Division as early as possible so corrective actions can be initiated.
  2.2.3. Units will:
     2.2.3.1. Ensure all persons involved with logistics movement know their specific
     responsibilities, including those relative to the safety and security of the nuclear cargo
     and what to do in case of an enroute emergency such as accident, incident, or attempted
     hijacking. Drivers and escorts must have all available information on road conditions,
     weather and emergency procedures. (T-3).
         2.2.3.1.1. Coordinate all logistics (i.e., SAAM, SGT, DOE Aviation, etc.) forecasted
         movements with wing or host nation agencies to ensure senior leadership has
         visibility and full wing support for the movement. At a minimum, this will include
         Airfield Management, Safety, Fire Department, OSI, LRS and Security Forces. This
         action is necessary to prevent last minute cancellations and avoid conflict with the
         wing calendar of events. (T-3).
             2.2.3.1.1.1. Munitions Support (MUNSS) units will notify host nation agencies
             within 1 duty day of notification of forecasted movements and keep agencies
             informed as movement dates change or become more specific (i.e., notification
             required for both NOSS and AMC Setup message receipt). (T-3).
         2.2.3.1.2. For AMC SAAM missions, the MASO will send a copy of the current
         Certification of Personnel to Receipt for Classified Property letter in their SAAM
         acknowledgement messages. If changes to the letter are required after initial
         acknowledgment, the revised letter must be distributed through the same channels as
         the acknowledgment message. Subsequent minor changes to the setup messages for
         that mission not affecting the content of the letter will not require resubmission for
         each acknowledgement. Include the parent MAJCOM functional office on all setup
         message acknowledgements. (T-1).
     2.2.3.2. Develop a written plan addressing logistics support according to AFJI 11-204,
     Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materiel. OCONUS units must
     develop and coordinate plan IAW host-nation support agreements. (T-1).
     2.2.3.3. Organizations requiring logistic movement of TYPE 3A/B/C trainers or Joint
     Test Assemblies (JTAs) must forward a request through the MAJCOM to the AFNWC
     Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division. TYPE 3E trainers may be moved in CONUS by
     any available means. (T-1).
24                                                       AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     2.2.3.4. Ensure proper equipment and facilities are available to support the logistics
     movement. (T-3).
     2.2.3.5. When SAAM aircrews/OST couriers request vehicles in setup messages, provide
     a U-Drive GOV. If a U-Drive vehicle is not available, provide local transportation
     to/from lodging using base taxi service. (T-3).
     2.2.3.6. To maximize planning effectiveness and minimize exposure time during mission
     execution, shipper/receiver and security briefings will be provided to the PNAF unit NLT
     4 duty days prior to mission departure from home station. Additionally, the PNAF
     courier and security briefings will be provided to the shipper/receiver and security
     representatives NLT 2 duty days prior to mission departure from home station. Briefings
     during execution will only cover new information and paper-briefing copies will be
     signed by the member receiving the information to indicate acknowledgement of subjects
     covered. (T-3).

                                           Chapter 3

 GENERAL NUCLEAR WEAPON AND COMPONENT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

3.1. General Principles of Accounting. This chapter describes the basic principles upon which
nuclear weapons, nuclear components and NOCM accounting procedures in this Instruction are
based.
3.2. Establishing, Changing, and Deleting a Stock Record Account Number
(SRAN). Every base account (to include tenant units) is identified by a unique SRAN. To
establish, change or delete a SRAN, refer to AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD Activity
Address Code (DoDAAC).
3.3. Accounts and Accountable Officers. A single individual is appointed as the MASO for
each SRAN, and must meet certain minimum requirements such as grade, AFSC, security
clearance, training, experience, PRP certification. (T-1). If a different individual is appointed
for each account (nuclear, conventional, or NWRM), then that individual is responsible for all
items accounted for under the SRAN and type of account for which they are the accountable
officer; they are not held responsible for items on the other individual’s account.
   3.3.1. MASO Requirements for Nuclear Accounts. Must be a 21M Munitions and Missile
   Maintenance Officer or a permanent civil servant (GS-11 equivalent or above) physically
   assigned to the munitions organization. He or she must possess appropriate security
   clearance, be PRP certified (Critical), and be a US citizen. In order to have a working
   knowledge of nuclear weapons accountability procedures, he or she must complete the
   Nuclear Maintenance Officers Course (NMOC), the Nuclear Accountability Course (NAC),
   and be qualified on all 21M3N MASO requirements in the 21MX CFETP and have one year
   of Nuclear Munitions experience (assigned to nuclear munitions unit) prior to performing
   MASO duties. (T-1).
   3.3.2. MASO Requirements for Nuclear Accounts without WR Weapons. Must be a 21M
   Munitions and Missile Maintenance Officer, a senior NCO in AFSC 2WXXX, or a
   permanent civil servant (GS-9 equivalent or above) physically assigned to the munitions
   organization. He or she must possess appropriate security clearance and be a US citizen. He
   or she must complete NMOC (21M and GS only), the NAC, and be qualified on all 21M3N
   MASO requirements in the 21MX CFETP prior to performing MASO duties. (T-1). This is
   not applicable to NWRM.
   3.3.3. NCOIC Requirements for Nuclear Accounts. The individual supervising the NARS
   section must be a 2W271. (T-1). In order to have a working knowledge of nuclear weapons
   accountability procedures, he or she must complete the NAC within 6 months of assignment.
   (T-2). Current NCOICs have 180 days from the date of this rewrite to attend the NAC.
   CONUS personnel with an assignment to USAFE who have not attended the NAC and will
   be assigned to NARS should receive enroute training.
3.4. Control of Accountable Systems. The MASO is responsible for the accuracy of
accountable records (manual or automated) generated within his/her area of responsibility;
therefore, only authorized individuals maintain and post transactions on behalf of the
accountable officer. (T-1). The accountable officer is also responsible for identifying and
initiating corrective action for inaccurate accountable transactions upon discovery.
 26                                                         AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


3.5. Control of Auditable and Accountable Documents.
   3.5.1. Auditable documents are identified in paragraph 4.4.1 Accountable documents are
   identified in paragraph 4.4.2 of this Instruction.
   3.5.2. Each accountable document is assigned a distinct number to identify it. Accountable
   documents are numbered consecutively using document control registers or control logs, in a
   manner that permits easy identification of lost or missing documents. Auditable documents
   need not be logged or numbered, but for audit purposes, require to be filed so that they can be
   easily retrieved and establish an audit trail. The MASO is responsible for ensuring the
   accuracy of document registers and control logs, and ensuring all documents are maintained
   on file, as required. (T-1).
   3.5.3. Signatures are only those of authorized individuals. All signatures must be original
   (faxed copies of originals, digitally scanned copies, or carbon copies are acceptable) and will
   be written in ink (black or blue-black). For automated systems using password controlled
   User-Ids, equivalent electronic signatures are acceptable. If an automated document has a
   signature block that is not electronically populated, the document must be printed and signed.
   The MASO must ensure accountable documentation is legible, accurate and auditable. For
   hard copy discrepancies that cannot be corrected, the MASO or designated personnel must
   line through and initial next to the discrepancy. For discrepancies affecting the stock record
   account, the MASO must provide a detailed explanation of each discrepancy by
   memorandum of record. For minor errors and typos, a memorandum is not required. An
   LRS signature is not required when using a commercial carrier but the carrier's receipt must
   be retained with accountable documents (e.g., staple the commercial receipt to the unsigned
   DD Form 1348-1A). (T-1).
      3.5.3.1. Accountable documents filed in document control will be signed and dated, and
      reviewed for accuracy by authorized individuals prior to filing. (T-1). Auditable
      documents do not need to be QC’d. The MASO must implement the following:
          3.5.3.1.1. QC all accountable documents and NUREPs prior to transmission. (T-1).
          3.5.3.1.2. Use a QC guide for each accountable document prior to filing. (T-2).
          Checklists must be prepared to address requirements outlined in TO 11N-45-51, 11N-
          100-1, 11N-100-2, 11N-100-4, 11N-100-3150 and this Instruction. (T-1).
          3.5.3.1.3. QC reviewer will not be the person processing accountable document. (T-
          1).
   3.5.4. The MASO controls all original documents and files them in the account’s document
   control files. (T-1). Access to document control files is limited to individuals appointed
   IAW paragraph 1.4.5.32 (T-1). If an original document is lost or destroyed, the MASO
   obtains a copy of the original document (e.g., suspense copy), reviews it to ensure accuracy
   and certifies its accuracy with a statement of certification and their signature. (T-1). This
   certified true copy is then controlled in the same manner as an original document. (T-1).
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   27


.6. Consumption and Custody Accounting. Issued items are accounted for using either
consumption or custody accounting procedures.
   3.6.1. Consumption items are typically low cost, non-reparable and non-sensitive items (e.g.,
   small hardware, gaskets, nuts, bolts, screws, washers, grease) that are considered expendable.
   These items are considered "consumed" and are dropped from accountable records when
   issued to maintenance personnel.
   3.6.2. Custody items that are reparable (e.g., containers, bolsters, and all DOE Spares Repair
   Listing (DSRL) items) must be continually accounted for until returned to the vendor, or
   properly disposed of IAW authorized disposition instructions and pertinent disposal
   directives. The appropriate commander designates a custodian, who is responsible for the
   items that have been issued to their duty section until they are either turned-in or expended
   (in the case of test items expended during SFT or other Operational Test and Evaluation
   (OT&E)). The custodian keeps records showing items in his or her custody. These records
   include a spare SE custody listing from the last time the items were inventoried, and copies
   of any documents affecting items in his or her custody that document transactions occurring
   since the last validation. Items are maintained on the accountable officer’s records and
   posted to stock records as “In-Use” balances. (T-1).
       3.6.2.1. Units will maintain a minimum of one serviceable bolster or container and an
       appropriate number of serviceable caster sets for each assigned WR weapon, as
       applicable (USAFE units only). (T-2). Additionally, units are authorized suitable
       bolsters/containers to transport assigned Type 3 trainers.
       3.6.2.2. All DOE SE will be accounted for on either an FE or FK account. (T-1). If on
       FK account and not already authorized by paragraph 3.6.2.1 of this Instruction,
       complete an AF Form 1996 for each DOE SE part number. (T-2).
3.7. Stock Records and Control of Stock Records. Account stock records reflect current and
historical balances of items on the account. Balances change because of transactions posted to
the account. The MASO is responsible for the accuracy of all stock record balances.
   3.7.1. Base and Military Spares are accounted for by part number but may also be accounted
   for by National Stock Number (NSN). A complete set of stock records consists of a separate
   stock record for each part number or NSN for which transactions have been posted. The
   stock record either is automated or is a manual card for items not accounted for as part of an
   automated system.
3.8. Inventories. Periodic inventories ensure account balances and item configurations are
accurately reflected on the account. Verification by an independent inventory-verifying officer
is required by DoD regulations for TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items. Any time a new MASO
is appointed, a 100% inventory ensures all accountable items are present prior to the new MASO
assuming custodial responsibility for the items. Periodic spot-check inventories help ensure
accuracy of account records between 100% inventories. HAF, MAJCOM, AFNWC Nuclear
Weapons Logistics Division, or the MASO may direct special inventories to ensure specific
items are present and properly accounted for on account records.
 28                                                          AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


3.9. Audit Trails and Audits.
   3.9.1. Audit trail. While a specific audit trail for each transaction varies by transaction type,
   there are general requirements that constitute an adequate audit trail. The audit trail begins
   with letters of authorization. These letters, signed by appropriate approving officials, IAW
   governing directives, provide the authorization for individuals to request and or receipt for
   property, report accountable transactions to the MASO, and maintain account records on
   behalf of the MASO. The audit trail continues with documents reporting accountable
   transactions to the MASO and source documents (e.g. receipt, shipping, issue, and turn-in
   documents, inventory adjustment vouchers and SCVs) supporting the transactions
   themselves. These documents are controlled using document registers or control logs and
   numbered sequentially so that any missing documents are easily recognized. The audit trail
   includes proper preparation of these documents using approved procedures and signatures
   (when required) of approved individuals. Account stock records then tie the supporting
   documents to changes in account balances reflected on individual lines of the stock records.
   The audit trail continues with periodic inventories that demonstrate the accuracy of account
   balances compared to physical identification and counts of property. The audit trail also
   includes Certificates of Transfer of Accountability that contain beginning and ending
   transaction document numbers showing an unbroken chain between MASOs over time.
   3.9.2. Periodic audits provide an independent assessment of account records to ensure proper
   accountability is maintained, an accurate audit trail exists and proper accounting procedures
   are being followed. Audits are performed either by an outside agency or by a verifying/audit
   officer appointed on orders to perform the audit. The audit consists of reviewing a
   representative sample of accountable records to determine if approved accounting procedures
   are being followed and to assess the accuracy of accountable records and completeness of the
   audit trail. If inaccuracies or irregularities are discovered, the sample is increased to
   determine the extent of the inaccuracy or irregularity. A 100% audit may be performed if the
   auditor deems it necessary, or when directed by local authorities or higher headquarters. In
   cases where serious inaccuracies or irregularities exist, or where an adequate audit trail does
   not exist, the audit may result in a requirement for a 100% inventory to reestablish
   accountability. In general, an audit provides assurance that:
      3.9.2.1. The MASO has been duly appointed; and meets qualifications required by
      pertinent directives.
      3.9.2.2. A review of Certificates of Transfer of Accountability indicates an unbroken
      chain of accountability between MASOs.
      3.9.2.3. Proper periodic inventories are being conducted as required and that stock
      records reflect accurate balances as of the latest 100% inventory.
      3.9.2.4. Personnel properly authorized to maintain the account are posting transactions to
      account records as transactions occur and that personnel are knowledgeable of required
      procedures.
      3.9.2.5. Required reports are submitted in accordance with directive timelines.
      3.9.2.6. Transactions posted to accountable records are adequately supported by source
      documents that are properly prepared IAW appropriate directives, and that only properly
      supported transactions are posted to account records.
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  29


     3.9.2.7. A review of document registers, document control logs and documents on file
     indicate that all original (or properly certified copies of original) accountable documents
     are on file.
     3.9.2.8. Personnel who receive property are authorized to do so IAW appropriate
     directives.
     3.9.2.9. An adequate audit trail exists indicating approved accounting procedures are
     followed.
 30                                                        AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014

          4.4.2.4.4. Inventory Adjustment Vouchers (supporting documents               listed in
          paragraph 6.8.1 are auditable).
          4.4.2.4.5. AF Form 504, Weapons Custody Transfer Document.
          4.4.2.4.6. Certificates of Transfer of Accountability.
4.5. Document Control. The MASO is responsible for all transactions processed by the NARS
personnel. The following procedures apply:
   4.5.1. Use a centralized document control system. Maintain two document registers, one for
   on-base transactions (issues, turn-ins and SCVs) and the other for off-base transactions
   (requisitions, receipts and shipments). Maintain these registers in DIAMONDS automated
   formats, where possible. Use AF Form 36, Supply Document Register, if DIAMONDS is
   not available. Ensure only authorized NARS account personnel make entries on these
   registers. (T-1).
      4.5.1.1. Base document numbers are formatted with a two-digit year and a four-digit
      document serial number, assigned sequentially by fiscal year (e.g., 05-0001, 05-0002,
      beginning 1 Oct 05. NOTE: Leading zeroes must be included for DIAMONDS to sort
      the document numbers correctly).
      4.5.1.2. Off-base documents are assigned using the SRAN, Julian date and sequential
      document number for the calendar year.
          4.5.1.2.1. When an item requisitioned by the unit is received, use the requisition
          number assigned from the Off-Base register at the time the requisition was made to
          account for the receipt. (T-2).
          4.5.1.2.2. For items that are received without being requisitioned (i.e., force-shipped
          items, including weapons and components), assign a base document number from the
          Off-Base register using the next sequence number for the Julian date the item is
          received. (T-2). Annotate this number on the face of the document (where
          applicable), and cross-reference the shipper’s document number in the Off-Base
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   33


           register by entering the shipper's document number in the remarks column of the
           register. (T-2).
4.6. Stock Control. MASOs must ensure appropriate stock levels are maintained. (T-1). Stock
levels for the following type items are determined as indicated.
   4.6.1. DOE Major Assemblies, Components, Retrofit Kits and Test Items. Established
   levels do not exist for these items. They are force shipped to units based on stockpile
   allocations (see AFI 21-204, Chapter 2), LLC replacement schedules, retrofit orders (RO),
   test plans and operational orders. Units are authorized to maintain levels sent to them.
   4.6.2. WR Containers and Bolsters. Units are authorized to maintain base spares
   container/bolster for each WR and Type trainer. All others will be approved via USAL.
   4.6.3. Military Spares. In the event units wish to maintain stock levels for military spares,
   forward requests (AF Form 1996) to the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division for
   approval. (T-1).
   4.6.4. Base Spares. Base Spare stock levels are authorized by approval of the USAL. The
   USAL shows DOE part number, noun, reorder point and maximum quantity authorized.
   Report quantities that exceed the maximum authorized as excess IAW procedures in
   paragraph 4.7 of this Instruction. (T-1). For determining quantities authorized on hand, a
   higher number suffix of a part number may be counted against the level of a lower suffix part
   number, as long as the basic part number is the same.
       4.6.4.1. USAL development, coordination, annual USAL inventory and approval
       procedures are located in TO 11N-100-1, Supply Management of Nuclear Weapons
       Materiel. Units will reconcile their USAL against the BMSS NLT 30 days after final
       levels are approved. (T-1).
4.7. Excess Item Reporting and Disposition of Assets. Request disposition of serviceable
items in excess of authorized level or unserviceable items for which no disposition instructions
have been provided or for which disposition is unclear. (T-1). AFNWC/NCL will
receive/document all disposition requests in Nuclear Munitions Command and Control (NMC2).
(T-2).
   4.7.1. Excess Serviceable Base Spares. Report these items IAW TO 11N-100-1. (T-0).
   KCP furnishes disposition for these items. If disposition is not received within 30 days, send
   a follow-up request. (T-2). For items returned to KCP, ensure the Material Return
   Authorization (MRA) number provided with disposition instructions is clearly marked as
   shown in the address. (T-2). If no MRA number is provided, contact KCP Program
   Management personnel for further guidance. (T-2).
   4.7.2. Excess Serviceable Military Spares. Report these items IAW TO 11N-100-1. (T-0).
   The AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division furnishes disposition for these items. If
   disposition is not received within 30 days, send a follow-up request. (T-2). For items
   returned to KCP, an MRA number should be provided with the disposition instructions. If no
   MRA number is provided, coordinate with the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division
   to obtain the MRA number, and ensure the MRA number is clearly marked as shown in the
   address. (T-2).

   4.7.3. Unserviceable Reparable Items. The DSRL provides disposition for reparable Base
   Spares, Military Spares and DOE SE. Return these items to the facility indicated on the
   DSRL for repair. For items returned to KCP, refer to TO 11N-100-1. (T-0).
   4.7.4. Unserviceable Consumable Items. Except for UR exhibits, dispose of these items
   IAW applicable technical data. (T-0). MASO/NARS will retain UR exhibits (unserviceable
   condition) on accountable record until receipt of UR disposition. (T-1). Items will be
   disposed of IAW UR disposition instructions. (T-0). If local disposition is authorized, a
   consumption issue will be processed to Maintenance for action. (T-1). Reference the UR
   number on all accountable documents (shipment, consumption issue, etc.). (T-1).
   4.7.5. Excess Limited Life Component, Group-X Kits and Retrofit Kits. Request the
   disposition of these items from the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division, as
   applicable. If disposition is not received within 30 days, send follow-up. (T-2).
   4.7.6. USAL items with expired service or shelf life will reflect an unserviceable condition.
   (T-1). If items can be used for training, retain on record until training can be conducted. (T-
   1). If items cannot be used for training, retain on record until local disposition can be
   conducted. (T-1). Expired USAL items will be consumption issued to Maintenance for
   either local disposal or training use. (T-1).
4.8. Requisitions.
   4.8.1. Unless directed to do so by MAJCOM, UR or the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons
   Logistics Division, do not requisition the following items (T-2):
       4.8.1.1. DOE Major Assemblies, LLC Kits, Group X Kits, and Test Items.
       4.8.1.2. Retrofit Kits (unless specifically directed by the ROs).

       4.8.1.7. Replacement parts that are the subject of UR.
   4.8.2. Requisition Base Spares and Military Spares IAW TO 11N-100-1. (T-0). In addition,
   the following procedures apply:
       4.8.2.1. If the requisition is made because of an issue request from maintenance that
       cannot be filled from existing stock, prepare AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-in Document, or
       locally developed form, for suspense purposes only. (T-3). Keep this document with the
       suspense copy of the requisition until receipt and issue of the item, then discard the AF
       Form 2005 or locally developed form. (T-3).
       4.8.2.2. Assign a requisition number from the Off-Base register for each part number
       ordered and post requisitions to the register at the time requisitions are placed. (T-2).
       AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division will order Base and Military Spare parts
       authorized because of a UR and force ship them to the unit. When contacted by AFNWC
       Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division personnel, provide the next off-base document
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    35


       number and post requisition to the register. (T-2). The UR response will reflect follow-
       on maintenance actions to include the associated requisition number.
       4.8.2.3. If items are not received or a backorder is not established within 5 days for
       CONUS and 15 days for OCONUS, follow-up with KCP Program Management
       personnel to determine status and estimated delivery date. (T-2). If an established
       delivery date is unacceptable to meet mission requirements, coordinate with the AFNWC
       Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division to determine the best alternative course of action.
       (T-2).
       4.8.2.4. If items are not received by the estimated delivery date for backordered items,
       continue to follow-up (at least every 30 days) until items are delivered or a new estimated
       delivery date is established. (T-2). MS/BS items ordered through KCP/BMSS will be
       tracked by AFNWC/NCL.                 (T-3).      Units will contact AFNWC/NCL
       (AFNWCNCL.Workflow@Kirtland.af.mil) for any follow-up actions for items
       ordered through KCP. (T-3). Notify AFNWC/NCL, and Parent MAJCOM by electronic
       means when items are not received by the 120-day point, or sooner if item is mission
       critical. Provide requisition number, local follow-up actions, and requisition remarks.
       (T-3).

4.12. Custodian Accounting Procedures. Instructions in this paragraph apply to individuals
designated as Reparable Item Custodians or alternates.
   4.12.1. General Instructions. Individuals, granted custody of government property, have an
   inherent responsibility for protecting and accounting for that property. They must provide
   reasonable protection for the property consistent with mission requirements, and maintain
   adequate records reflecting the status of property in their custody. (T-1). They must
   maintain the property in a serviceable condition to the greatest extent possible and turn-in
   property that cannot be repaired for proper disposition by the accountable officer. (T-1).
   They must periodically inventory property in their custody to ensure its continued
   accountability (see paragraph 6.6), and they must immediately report any lost or destroyed
   property to their commander and the accountable officer for appropriate action (see
   paragraph 6.8.). (T-1).
   4.12.2. The MASO establishes custody sub-accounts for each duty section for which a
   custodian is appointed. The office symbol is entered in DIAMONDS “storage area” field for
   items issued to each custodian. DIAMONDS will use the actual location for the Storage
   Location (i.e., structure 5 or bin 3/row 15/column 15).
   4.12.3. The designated custodian for each sub-account and the MASO must maintain
   duplicate records to account for property issued on custody to the sub-account. (T-1). These
   records include, but are not limited to, the following:
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  41


       4.12.3.1. Designation of Custodian.
       4.12.3.2. Designation of Personnel Authorized to Request/Receive Controlled Materiel.
       4.12.3.3. Designation of Primary/Alternate Custodian for Reparable Items.
       4.12.3.4. A Spare SE Custody Listing, signed by the custodian, showing on hand
       balances of property in their sub-account upon assuming custodian duties or the date of
       the last custody inventory (whichever is latest).
       4.12.3.5. Sub-Account Custodian records (e.g., copies of issue and turn-in documents
       [DD Forms 1150] and SCVs) since the last SIR.
4.13. Accounting for Retrofit Kits. Retrofit kits are normally force shipped to units based on
quantities of items that the unit possesses requiring the retrofit.
   4.13.1. Issue retrofit kits to maintenance using consumption or custody procedures, as
   applicable, based on whether the retrofit requires return of removed items to the vendor. (T-
   2). Each week issue only a sufficient number of kits required to accomplish work scheduled
   for that week. (T-3).
   4.13.2. Issue "Training" retrofit kits using consumption and custody procedures, as
   applicable. (T-3).
   4.13.3. Issue Extended-Level attrition and tool kits, as needed, using custody procedures.
   (T-2).

4.14. Stock Change Vouchers (SCV). Use SCVs to document LLC exchanges, component
removal and installation, part number changes, condition code changes of spares and support
equipment, and color code changes for TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items. (T-0).
   4.14.1. Accounting for LLC and component removals and installations:
       4.14.1.1. A single document number may be assigned for all removals or installations of
       a given part number posted in a single DIAMONDS session. If a different part number is
       installed than was removed use a separate SCV for each part number. (T-2).
       4.14.1.2. Use Section I of the SCV to record the part number, serial numbers of removed
       and installed items, and beginning and ending account balances for the part number. (T-
       1). (The balances will be from either warehouse or In-Use columns on stock records
       depending on custody status.)
       4.14.1.3. Record the document number assigned to the SCV in the “Base Document
       Number” block. (T-2).
       4.14.1.4. The MASO or NARS authorized individual enters their printed name and
       signature in the “Signature” block and the date signed in the “Date” block. (T-2).
       4.14.1.5. Post the transaction to DIAMONDS stock records, as applicable. (T-2).
       Removals and installations are posted on separate lines. For removals and installation of
       the same part numbered item, balances on the SCV reflect the beginning balance before
       either transaction is posted and the ending balance after both the removal and installation
       are posted.
   4.14.2. Accounting for Weapon Color Code and Spare Condition Code Changes. Account
   for items only upon initially being turned red for the first red reason of any category or upon
   being turned yellow after eliminating all red reasons of all categories (this includes spares
   and support equipment). (T-2).
       4.14.2.1. A single document number may be assigned for all changes of a given part
       number posted in a single DIAMONDS session. (T-2).
       4.14.2.2. Use Section II of the SCV to record the part number, "from" and "to" color
       codes and condition codes (i.e., serviceable/unserviceable), serial number(s) of affected
       items (if applicable), and beginning and ending account balances for each part number.
       (T-2). (The balances will be from either warehouse or In-Use columns on stock records
       depending on custody status.)
       4.14.2.3. Record the document number assigned to the SCV in the “Base Document
       Number” block. (T-2).
       4.14.2.4. The MASO or other authorized individual enters their printed name and

                                         Chapter 5

 STORAGE OF COMPONENTS, SPARES, AND SEALED WARHEAD CONTAINERS.

5.1. Spares Storage.
   5.1.1. NARS Warehouse. The MASO establishes a secure area (NARS warehouse) for
   storage of spares that are on account and not in the custody of maintenance personnel. When
   storing classified components, the NARS warehouse will meet the minimum requirement for
   bulk storage IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. (T-1).
      5.1.1.1. The local storage plan must specify the building(s) and room(s) used for the
      NARS warehouse and applicable security precautions used to ensure limited access to
      items stored in the warehouse. (T-3). In addition, the plan must clearly define the
      meaning of location designations used on accountable records. (T-3).
      5.1.1.2. Do not commingle Base Spare (BS) and Military Spare (MS) items in storage.
      (T-1). Conspicuously mark storage bins "Base Spare Assets Only" and "Military Spare
      Assets Only" to indicate type of spares authorized for storage within bin rows. (T-3).
      Excess spares will be segregated from other stock and identified as “excess.” Serviceable
      and unserviceable items will be segregated within the warehouse. (T-3).
          5.1.1.2.1. To avoid co-mingling stock, and possibly using unapproved parts on WR
          end items, USAL items must be physically segregated (i.e., separate and clearly
          marked bin, area of the room) from non-USAL and USAL excess items, such as Air
          Force bench stock or other operating stock. (T-2).
          5.1.1.2.2. Prepare bin labels or serviceability tags for each non-reparable USAL item
          part number stored within the maintenance activity. (T-3). As a minimum, include
          bin number or location, part number, nomenclature, minimum (suggested re-order)
          quantity, and maximum quantity on the label or tag. (T-3).
          5.1.1.2.3. NARS personnel will perform “walkthrough” checks of bins and storage
          locations to determine if items need to be replenished. (T-3). NARS personnel then
          requisition required items through Base and Military Spares Server (BMSS). (T-3).
          Frequency of walkthrough will be determined locally and included in local plans. (T-
          3).
          5.1.1.2.4. Prior to placing any item on the USAL, packaged items (including
          desiccated items) will be opened, inspected by a qualified technician and repackaged
          IAW technical guidance. (T-3). Additionally, USAL items will be inspected any
          time doubt exists to their serviceability. (T-3).
      5.1.1.3. Use DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag – Materiel, DD Form 1575, Suspended
      Tag – Materiel, DD Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag Materiel, to identify
      stored property. (T-1). Mark condition tags with standard entries IAW AFI 23-101 and
      the designation BS or MS. (T-1). National stock numbers are not required. Include the
      precautionary phrase from the stock list and the statement “Item contains training
      category Source and Special (SS) nuclear materiel” on applicable items. (T-2). For all
      classified components, in the condition tags remarks section, stamp or print
      “CLASSIFIED ITEM.” (T-2).
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   45


      5.1.1.4. For Group X kits and shelf life items, establish local controls ensuring items are
      stored so those oldest assets are issued first. (T-3). Ensure compliance with shelf life
      restrictions identified in specific item TOs. (T-3).
   5.1.2. Storage of Assets Issued on Custody Accounts to Maintenance Activities. When
   NARS issues items to maintenance personnel on a custody basis, the designated shop
   custodian must ensure items not in use are properly stored to preclude loss or damage. (T-3).
   5.1.3. Storage of Nuclear Components within Maintenance Activities.
      5.1.3.1. Store nuclear components in approved containers under appropriate security.
      (T-0).
      5.1.3.2. H1616/H1700 containers may be stored in WS3s containing WR weapons.
      H1616/H1700 containers may be pre-positioned within the maintenance facility as long
      as the criteria in DoD S-5210.41M and AFMAN 31-108, Nuclear Weapons Security
      Manuals, are met.
          5.1.3.2.1. Within 72 hours of H1616/H1700 receipt, ensure Department of
          Transportation (DOT) expiration dates are entered into NMC2. (T-3).
5.2. Seal Program. AF/A4/7 designates service approved warhead container seals IAW TO
11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports.
   5.2.1. To preclude opening warhead containers without view ports, to verify contents during
   inventories, other than SEV, units may elect to seal containerized warheads in storage. If
   units choose to seal containerized warheads, the provisions in paragraph 5.2, TO 11N-100-
   3150, and procedures listed below apply.
   5.2.2. Management of the Seal Program. The MASO has cradle-to-grave responsibility of
   the Seal Program. The MASO will develop local guidance to supplement the procedures in
   this chapter to aid in managing and maintaining integrity of the program. (T-3). This
   guidance will include; seal accountability, issuing and tracking; seal installation/removal
   procedures; seal inspection and inventory procedures/intervals; verifying/audit officer
   training; and workcenter responsibilities. (T-3).
      5.2.2.1. The MASO will establish local procedures for the following: requisition, receipt,
      destruction and control of seals. (T-3). Seals may be issued to applicable workcenter as
      long as local procedures address control of seals. (T-3). The MASO will maintain an
      accountable system to identify warhead serial number and associated seal serial
      number(s) installed on the container. (T-3.) The MASO must ensure duplicate serial
      numbered seals are not issued and/or installed on containers. (T-3).
      5.2.2.2. An AF Form 1764, or locally devised worksheet will be utilized to update the
      APSR (see Figure 5.1) (T-3). The Maintenance technician and verifier will fill out this
      form and return to the MASO. (T-3). In turn, the MASO will utilize this worksheet to
      update the controlled electronic accountable system. (T-3).
      5.2.2.3. The worksheet will contain, but not limited to, the following information (T-3):
          5.2.2.3.1. Nomenclature/Serial number
          5.2.2.3.2. Seal serial number
 46                                                          AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014

   5.2.3. Seal Installation Procedures.
      5.2.3.1. Prior to closing warhead container, two weapon system JQS qualified
      individuals (one member must be TC certified) will verify the permanently etched,
      engraved or stamped warhead serial number with the non-permanent serial number on the
      warhead and the warhead serial number painted on the exterior of the container. (T-1).
      Fill in the Seal Program Worksheet as required. (T-2).
      5.2.3.2. After closing container, install seal as snugly as possible in such a manner that
      prevents opening container without removing or damaging installed seal. (T-2). Do not
      cut excess wire rope. (T-3). In addition, if container can facilitate, install second seal (as
      close as possible to 180 degrees opposite from the first seal) in the same manner as the
      first. (T-3). Fill in the Seal Program Worksheet as required. (T-3).
   5.2.4. Seal Removal Procedures.
      5.2.4.1. Remove by cutting through wire rope; retain seal(s) for further destruction by the
      MASO or designated representative. (T-3). Fill in the Seal Program Worksheet as
      required. (T-3).
      5.2.4.2. After opening container, verify warhead serial number and the warhead serial
      number painted on the exterior of the container. (T-2). Fill in the Seal Program
      Worksheet as required. (T-3).
      5.2.4.3. MASO or designated representative will destroy seal(s) by cutting wire rope
      flush with locking device at all ends and smashing the locking device. (T-3).

6.1. General. TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items are inventoried using procedures in TO 11N-
100-3150 and this AFI. Investigate out-of-balance conditions found during any inventory to
determine their causes. (T-2). Resolve losses and document findings using the procedures in
paragraph 6.8. (T-1).
6.2. Inventory Requirements.
   6.2.1. Change of MASO. Each time a new MASO is assigned, gaining and losing MASO’s
   will conduct a 100% inventory of the account. (T-1).
   6.2.2. Change of Custodian. Each time a new Reparable Item custodian is assigned the
   gaining custodian must conduct a 100% inventory of items issued to their sub-account. (T-
   2). Report any unresolved discrepancies to the MASO and the appropriate commander to
   initiate a Report of Survey (or other appropriate action) prior to signing the Spare SE
   Custody listing and assuming responsibility for the account. (T-2).
   6.2.3. Monthly 10% Spot Check Inventories. NARS monitors conduct spot check
   inventories (except SIR months) IAW paragraph 6.6 (T-3).
   6.2.4. Semi-annual inventory. Inventory TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items semi-annually.
   (T-0). Procedures in TO 11N-100-3150 apply along with procedures in this AFI. The SIR
   procedure creates an independent inventory that reports the status, location and configuration
   of the national nuclear weapon stockpile by serial number and quantity for each location.
   Prepare and submit as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0). Forward waiver request to
   change the SIR date to the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division through the
   applicable MAJCOM. (T-2).
       6.2.4.1. Inventory the following items in conjunction with the SIR:
           6.2.4.1.1. Base and Military Spares. (T-1).
           6.2.4.1.2. DOE owned equipment items. (T-1).
6.3. Semi-annual Inventory Procedures. Once initiated, the semi-annual inventory takes
precedence over all maintenance activities. (T-3). Situations may arise during the inventory that
dictates the need for reportable maintenance. Final approval/disapproval for mission essential
maintenance rests with the applicable Group commander. The MASO is the inventory officer
for the semi-annual inventory. In the event the MASO is unavoidably absent (e.g., emergency
leave), the MASO appointing authority appoints an alternate inventory officer in writing. The
replacement officer must meet the minimum requirements for a MASO. (T-3).
   6.3.1. Before the semiannual inventory required in TO 11N-100-3150, the inventory officer
   (MASO) briefs the verifying officer concerning his or her inventory responsibilities and all
   aspects of the inventory. (T-2).
   6.3.2. Immediately before or during the semiannual inventory of items in TO 11N-100-3150,
   maintenance personnel take an inventory to ensure availability of pullout cables and other
   accessory items required for operational flexibility. (T-2). These items are identified in the
48                                                         AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


  inspection section of applicable technical publications. Cables and accessories are stored or
  attached to certain bombs in a package commonly referred to as a saddlebag. If an accessory
  item is missing, consider the bomb operational unless it cannot be used to support the current
  mission. (T-3). Thoroughly research shortages to locate missing items and determine the
  cause of shortages. (T-3). Establish controls to prevent recurrence and report loss IAW
  paragraph 6.8.9.1 of this Instruction. (T-2). Promptly submit requisitions for replacement
  items to KCP. (T-2). The MASO ensures saddlebags are retained and all items are
  inventoried for applicable weapons. (T-3). He or she also ensures a letter certifying the
  inventory is retained until the next saddlebag inventory certification is received. (T-3).
  Submission of the SIR report certifies that this inventory has been accomplished. There is no
  additional requirement for reporting or recording the inventory of pullout cables and other
  accessory items. NOTE: Saddlebags with enclosed contents may be removed from weapons,
  inventoried and placed inside sealed container(s) (e.g., banded wooden crate) for long-term
  storage. Subsequent inventories will consist of verifying container content label and seal
  integrity.
  6.3.3. The SIR requires a visual inventory of each TO 11N-100-3150 reportable item
  (including any trainers containing DOE SS nuclear materiel) by serial number. Prepare and
  submit as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0). Vandenberg is required to accomplish a SIR
  when OMAs or other reportable items are assigned. (T-2). When no reportable items are
  assigned, Vandenberg will send a negative reply to the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics
  Division and DTRA addresses in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-2).
     6.3.3.1. H1616/H1700 shipping containers need not be opened for inventory purposes,
     obtain component serial number(s) from the exterior tag.
     6.3.3.2. Warhead containers that are not sealed must be opened to verify contents using
     guidelines in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0).
     6.3.3.3. Items stored in containers previously opened, inspected, and sealed by the
     accountable organization do not require reopening during semiannual inventories
     provided information obtained from the exterior of the container and the seal/serial
     number list maintained by the MASO match.
         6.3.3.3.1. Any irresolvable discrepancy between the information on the exterior of
         the container and the seal/serial number listing requires opening the container for
         verification of contents. Containerized components do not require opening for
         inventory verification unless information marked on the exterior tag cannot be
         resolved against accountable records.
         6.3.3.3.2. When performing inventories, or as directed by TO 11N-100-3150,
         perform the following seal inspection procedures:
             6.3.3.3.2.1. Visually inspect wire rope and locking device for signs of tampering.
             If tampering is detected, immediately notify MASO. (T-0)
             6.3.3.3.2.2. Firmly grasp seal and give a firm tug to ensure seal is firmly
             installed, if seal contains a wire rope ensure it is fully inserted and the locking
             device is properly functioning. If seal can be removed, notify MASO. (T-0)
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 49


             6.3.3.3.2.3. If tampering is detected or the seal can be removed, notify MASO.
             (T-0).
             6.3.3.3.2.4. During the inventory, if the container was sealed IAW procedures in
             Chapter 5 and TO 11N-100-3150, record the warhead serial number stenciled on
             the container and the seal number(s) on the blind inventory worksheet. During
             inventory reconciliation, compare the serial number of the containerized warheads
             and associated seals recorded on the blind inventory worksheet against the
             MASO’s accountable documents. (T-1).
             6.3.3.3.2.5. In the event the seal/warhead serial number does not match
             accountable records or seals are not installed, the container must be opened to
             physically verify warhead serial number. (T-0).
             6.3.3.3.2.6. If the etched, engraved or stamped permanent serial number cannot
             be verified without removing the warhead from the container, but a stenciled
             serial number is visible, compare this serial number with accountable records. (T-
             0). If no markings are visible, the item must be removed from the container to
             verify serial number. (T-0).
  6.3.4. SIR Record Verification. After the blind inventory is complete, and prior to trans-
  mission of the SIR message, verify serial numbers on the following documents (T-1):
     6.3.4.1. Blind inventory worksheets. Blind inventory sheets will be prepared in a blank
     spreadsheet format (i.e., no known balances or quantities), assign blind count-sheet page
     numbers (1 of 8, etc.). (T-1). Blind inventory sheets used during the SIR must be signed
     by both the inventory and verifying officer. (T-1).
     6.3.4.2. Inventory count cards.
     6.3.4.3. Printed copy of the SIR message.
     6.3.4.4. Location Inventory Listing (LIL) (as currently annotated by the NARS section).
     6.3.4.5. Balances on Stock Records.
  6.3.5. Conduct SIR inventories as of the last day of the inventory month. (T-0). Prepare and
  submit the SIR and an Inventory Verification Certificate as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150.
  (T-0)
  6.3.6. Validate all reports for errors and submit corrections as needed. (T-0). Both
  inventory and verifying officer will review and sign the SIR message prior to transmission.
  (T-0).
  6.3.7. SIR Reconciliation. After the SIR is transmitted, DTRA/ONL reconciles each unit’s
  SIR report against the DIAMONDS database. If SIR errors exist, DTRA notifies the
  AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division who, in turn, notifies the applicable
  MAJCOM as required. The unit resolves the discrepancy and submits a corrected report
  IAW TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0). If no errors exist, or once any errors have been corrected,
  DTRA transmits a SIR reconciliation message. This message confirms to the unit and the
  applicable MAJCOM that the unit’s records agree with the DIAMONDS database as of the
  SIR date.
 50                                                          AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014

6.9. Audits of Accounts. The term "audited" as it applies to these procedures denotes a formal
quantitative audit of a specific account (i.e. SRAN) for verifying its records (see paragraph 3.9
for a general discussion of audits and audit trails).
   6.9.1. Types of audits.
       6.9.1.1. Semi-annual audit of account (normally accomplished in conjunction with the
       SIR). Personnel designated on orders by the commander, perform this audit in
       conjunction with each semi-annual inventory. The audit ensures all TO 11N-100-3150
       reportable nuclear weapons and components are accounted for, properly controlled, and
       signed for, when required, during the weapon custody transfer process, and provides a
       reasonable assurance that the accountable officer is following proper accounting
       procedures. The audit encompasses all accountable records listed in paragraph 4.4
       Conduct the audit IAW below procedures.
       6.9.1.2. Special audits. In addition to the semi-annual audit of account, the Air Force
       Audit Agency, higher headquarters, or a government agency, such as the Government
       Accounting Office, may direct a special audit. For special audits, the agency directing
       the audit determines its scope.
   6.9.2. Appointing the audit officer. The wing commander will designate an audit/verifying
   officer in writing. (T-1). Make the appointment on special orders issued by the
   commander’s order issuing authority. (T-1). Specify on the orders that the appointment is
   made on behalf of the MAJCOM commander IAW this AFI. (T-1). A disinterested
   individual will not be designated as audit officer for two consecutive SIRs. (T-1).
   6.9.3. Briefing the audit officer. The MASO briefs the audit officer, who conducts the audit
   IAW procedures in this AFI, using as a guide the checklist in Table 6.5 (T-1). Prior to the
   start of the audit, NARS personnel review the checklist with the audit officer, provide
   examples of documents to illustrate items shown in the checklist and answer any questions
   the audit officer may have concerning the requirements of the audit. (T-1). NOTE: For
   procedures below, a representative sample is considered at least 20% of documents created
   since the last audit. If discrepancies are discovered, the audit officer should increase the
   sample size to determine if any errors are widespread or systemic in nature. The audit officer
   should make recommendations for corrective action in the audit report.
   6.9.4. Performing the audit. The audit officer must        (T-0, applies through paragraph
   6.9.4.7):
       6.9.4.1. Review the previous audit report. During the audit, place special emphasis on
       ensuring that all previously noted discrepancies were corrected.
       6.9.4.2. MAR review will be conducted IAW Table 6.2 NOTE: A MAR log is not
       required because it does not contain a unique identification number.
       6.9.4.3. Review a representative sample of MARs and associated NUREPs created since
       the last audit. Ensure all actions reported to the MASO that require NUREP reporting
       have been reported accurately and within prescribed timeframes. NOTE: If the unit
       discovered, or was notified of, NUREP reporting errors, these errors should not be
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     57


     considered as errors existing on the account at the time of the audit, provided correction
     NUREP reports were submitted within required timeframes.
     6.9.4.4. Review both document registers and inventory all documents created since the
     last audit to ensure all documents are on file. For forced receipts, ensure the shipper’s
     document number is cross-referenced in the “Remarks” column of the register. Ensure
     all documents on file are either original documents or MASO-certified true copies of
     original documents.
     6.9.4.5. Review 100% of all shipping, receipt, issue and turn-in documents for TO 11N-
     100-3150 reportable items created since the last audit. Verify the weapons serial number
     against the receiving data record and custody issue documents. Ensure documents were
     properly prepared, only authorized personnel signed for the items on the documents, and
     that balance changes were properly posted to stock records. Ensure associated weapon
     container and bolster part numbers and quantities are shown on weapon receipt and
     shipping documents and that the document number for the end item is used to post
     balance changes to container and bolster stock records.
     6.9.4.6. Review a representative sample of all other documents shown in either On Base
     or Off Base document registers. Ensure documents were properly prepared, processed
     and posted to stock records.
     6.9.4.7. Review 100% of the custody transfer documents maintained by the MASO. For
     all weapon/warhead movements since the last audit, ensure the control numbers on the
     custody transfer documents are sequentially logged in on the custody transfer document
     control registers. Ensure that only authorized personnel receipt for weapons/warheads
     using the procedures in Chapter 7 of this AFI.
  6.9.5. Audit Documentation.
     6.9.5.1. Upon completion, prepare a "Certificate of Audit" using the format in Figure 6.1
     (T-1).
     6.9.5.2. Attach to the certificate a copy of the completed checklist in Table 6.2 (T-1).
     6.9.5.3. Distribute a copy of the certificate of audit to the appointing authority, MASO
     and the applicable MAJCOM. Maintain the original IAW records management. (T-1).
     6.9.5.4. Maintain and dispose of audit documentation along with SIR documentation.
     (T-1).
     6.9.5.5. All transactions (spares or NUREP reportable components) are included in the
     DIAMONDS-generated AF Form 36, Supply Document Register (Manual). Therefore,
     include all document numbers covering the SIR period on the certificate of audit. (T-1).
     It may be necessary to identify to the audit officer which AF Form 36 entries are
     applicable to NUREP reportable assets.

      These letters will be used to ensure deployed personnel are authorized to receive custody
      of nuclear weapons during operational movements. The MASO will ensure munitions
      control and the security forces have current copies of these letters. (T-3).
 62                                                         AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


   7.1.3. Continuous US custody of nuclear weapons is mandatory until receipt of a valid
   nuclear control order that permits transferring US nuclear weapons to non-US delivery
   forces.
   7.1.4. Appropriate base controlling agencies will use a standardized matrix (manual flow
   plan) to track nuclear weapon/warhead status and locations during all movements and
   loading/mating operations. (T-2).
7.2. Custody Transfer Procedures. If a custody transfer is necessary during an operational
movement, the individual relinquishing custody of nuclear weapons and nuclear warheads will
ensure the individual receiving custody is an authorized recipient prior to custody transfer. (T-
0). Individuals gaining custody will conduct visual serial number(s) against the source document
(i.e., AF Form 504) except when not required in the situation specific procedures. (T-1).
   7.2.1. The custodian may temporarily depart the exclusion area; however, if the custodian

     7.5.1.1. The MASO verifies the RS configuration using the nuclear weapons
     configuration record and prepares two copies of the AF Form 504 (copy 1 is original,
     copy 2 is suspense) based on mission tasking, completes the “Transferred From” block 6,
     columns A through E on the forms, and gives the forms to the gaining MUNS custodian
     responsible for subsequently transferring custody. (T-1). The MASO establishes a
     control number for the document by annotating the control register using an AF Form
     3126, General Purpose Form. (T-1). MASO annotates the control number in block 1 and
     RS serial number in block 4 of the AF Form 504. (T-1). In the event the current AF
     Form 504 becomes lost or illegible, the MASO will verify information and use copy 2 as
     the current AF Form 504. (T-1).
     7.5.1.2. The MUNS custodian performs a visual verification to ensure the information on
     the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of the RS being transferred. (T-2). The
     MUNS custodian completes the first “Transferred To” block 6, columns A through E on
     the forms. (T-2).
     7.5.1.3. The transfer/transport custodian and MUNS custodian perform a visual
     verification to ensure the information on the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of
     the RS. (T-2). The transfer/transport custodian completes the next “Transferred To”
     block 6, columns A through E on both AF Forms 504 (copies 1 and 2). (T-2). The
     transfer/transport custodian provides copy 2 (suspense) to the MUNS custodian. (T-2).
     The MUNS custodian provides the suspense copy to the MASO. (T-2). The
     transfer/transport team transports the RS to the applicable LF.
     7.5.1.4. Prior to lowering RS onto the missile, the transfer/transport custodian and mate
     TC will perform a visual verification to ensure the information on the AF Form 504
     matches the serial number of the RS. (T-2). The mate TC completes the next
     “Transferred To” block 6, columns A through E on the form. (T-2).
     7.5.1.5. Upon completion of RS mate, the mate TC will contact the MCC and enter the
     Missile Combat Crew Commander (MCCC) or Deputy Missile Combat Crew
     Commander (DMCCC) name, position, organization, time/date, and location on the AF
     Form 504. (T-2).
     7.5.1.6. The mate TC returns the completed original AF Form 504 (copy 1) to the
     Missile Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC). (T-2).

                                         Chapter 8

                NUCLEAR WEAPONS ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTS

8.1. Nuclear Weapons Accountability Reports.
   8.1.1. Maintenance Activity Reports (MARs). Prepare MAR using DIAMONDS to report
   changes in status of weapons, components and reportable Other Major Assemblies (OMAs)
   to the MASO. (T-0). The MASO will ensure accurate and timely reporting to higher
   headquarters and JCS as required.
   8.1.2. Ensure all changes listed in the Transaction Code tables of TO 11N-100-3150 that
   occur are reported to NARS via the MAR IAW TO 11N-3150-8-1. (T-0).
   8.1.3. The following actions must be reported (T-0):
      8.1.3.1. Changes to the first character of the charge code require an MTO.
      8.1.3.2. For weapons selected for SLT or SFT, change the charge code as directed by the
      SLT or SFT warning order or upon receipt of warning order message.
      8.1.3.3. For weapons requiring shipment to DOE facilities for repair, change the last
      character of the charge code when UR disposition is received directing return to DOE.
      8.1.3.4. For weapons selected for modification, change the last character of the charge
      code when directed by the RO, or when directed by message. Change the charge code
      back to the original charge code as the RO is accomplished on each weapon.
      8.1.3.5. Make other charge code changes as directed by the AFNWC Nuclear Weapons
      Logistics Division in the monthly NOSS. (T-2).
   8.1.4. Other actions that could require reporting and affect other accountable records the
   MASO maintains include:
      8.1.4.1. Build-up/tear-down configuration of weapons to/from RS or pylon/ launchers.
      (T-2).
      8.1.4.2. Association or disassociation of a weapon or OMA item to a shipping container
      or bolster when being prepared for storage. (T-2).
      8.1.4.3. Application of a seal to a containerized weapon or OMA in order to preclude
      opening the container during semi-annual inventory. (T-2).
      8.1.4.4. Removal or installation of non-LLC components, where the action affects
      accountability of the item(s). (T-2). Examples include such items as tail sections or gas
      generators that are accountable, but not WSR or QSR reportable items. These items must
      be picked up or dropped from the account, when there is a removal or installation; or
      when a different part number item is installed from the one that was removed. (T-2).
      Since the MASO must account for these items, maintenance must report actions
      involving them to the MASO. (T-2).
      8.1.4.5. Condition Code changes for Non-TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items issued on
      custody account. (T-2).
 78                                                          AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


       8.1.4.6. Association and unassociation of H-Gear. (T-2).
       8.1.4.7. Other actions as required by local instructions. (T-3).
   8.1.5. If the verification inspection of containerized weapons cannot be accomplished on the
   day of receipt, take the following actions pending completion of a verification inspection:
       8.1.5.1. Prepare the MAR for receipt and add the statement "Interim report pending
       verification inspection" in the “Maintenance Remarks” section.
       8.1.5.2. MASO will hold the DD Form 1348-1A and DD Form 1911 in suspense until
       verification inspection is completed.
       8.1.5.3. Once verification inspection is complete, MASO will verify all associated
       documentation for accuracy and process all forms held in suspense.
8.2. Weapon Status Report (WSR). Prepare WSRs using DIAMONDS. (T-0). Prepare and
submit as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0). WSRs form the basis for summary reporting for
the Joint Staff, DTRA, Air Force, the National Military Command System, POTUS and SecDef.
DTRA requests corrections to WSRs received with errors through the AFNWC Nuclear
Weapons Logistics Division. Corrections are due 1200 next day following notification to the
unit. AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division will discuss the type of error and the
corrective action with the applicable MAJCOM and reporting activity, as they occur to preclude
further errors. Recommendations for changes to the stockpile database or processing methods
are made when discrepancies are noted.
8.3. Container Asset Report (CAR). Unless otherwise directed by the AFNWC Nuclear
Weapons Logistics Division, prepare and submit CAR using DIAMONDS as outlined in TO
11N-100-4, Custody, Accountability and Control of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Materiel,
Chapter 7. (T-2). Continue reporting during MINIMIZE. (T-2). Submit report semi-annually
as of the SIR effective date. (T-2).
8.4. Quality Assurance Service Test (QAST) Status Report (QSR). Prepare and submit the
QSR using DIAMONDS as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150. (T-0). The purpose of this report is
to ensure accurate accountability between DoD and DOE of SS nuclear materiel. Requirements
for inventory and reconciliation of SS materiel between DoD and DOE are covered in TO 11N-
100-4. The QSR report is similar in format to the WSR. Corrections are due 1200 next day. (T-
2).
   8.4.1. Reporting changes for OMAs to the MASO. Maintenance personnel report status
   changes for OMAs to the MASO using procedures in paragraph 8.1. above. (T-2). The
   MASO reports status changes to DTRA via a QSR. (T-2).
       8.4.1.1. Units expending OMAs pending recovery will notify AFNWC/NCL once QSR
       is submitted. (T-2).
   8.4.2. Items that require OMA reporting. Reporting requirements apply to OMAs that
   contain SS materiel. Reporting is by end item type (using a modified weapon code), and
   serial number.
       8.4.2.1. If a reporting activity can verify the item either does or does not contain
       reportable quantities of SS materiel, they report the item as such using the appropriate
       letter in the fourth position of the OMA code (see TO 11N-100-3150). (T-2). This
AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     79


       verification is accomplished by reviewing the DOE/NRC Form 741 delivered to the
       service when the item is originally delivered. The DOE/NRC Form 741 indicates which
       SS materiel items are contained within the OMA. (T-2).
       8.4.2.2. Once an item is verified and properly entered into the DTRA database, presence
       or lack of SS materiel need not be verified again.
8.5. Unsatisfactory Report (UR). Prepare UR using DIAMONDS. (T-0). Prepare and submit
as outlined in TO 11N-5-1. (T-0). A UR is the only reporting mechanism to report
unsatisfactory conditions or deficiencies relating to DOE-designed items, associated software
and/or Joint Nuclear Weapons System Publications.
8.6. Weapons Information Report (WIR). Prepare WIR using DIAMONDS. (T-0). Prepare
and submit as outlined in TO 11N-35-50. (T-0). A WIR is the reporting of Record of Assembly
(ROA) information on specified "S" materiel to Sandia National Laboratories, Engineering Data
Management Department. "S" materiel is defined as Major Assembly items or product entities
which Department of Energy - Sandia National Laboratories have control. This information is
needed to maintain records of component association in support of stockpile studies. Changes in
association of any "S" materiel or changes of any serial or manufacturing-numbered weapon
components associated with "S" materiel must be reported.
8.7. Location Inventory Listing (LIL). The DLIL contains unit stockpile information
extracted from the DIAMONDS database at DTRA. DTRA/CSNOO prepares the DLIL monthly
and publishes it on the “Support Center” site DB screen. The purpose of this report is to provide
a product for the monthly reconciliation of unit records and stockpile information contained in
DIAMONDS. It also provides the unit a tool for scheduling and managing maintenance
activities.
   8.7.1. Maintaining the LIL. NARS personnel will maintain a WLIL. (T-2). In order to
   ensure the ability to reconcile the SLIL each month, NARS personnel must post changes to
   the WLIL as they are reported. (T-2). The WLIL may be hard copy or electronic. At a
   minimum, NARS personnel must annotate weapon shipment and receipts and changes to
   weapon codes, charge codes, alpha alt codes, unassociated LLCs, installed LLC serial
   numbers, component codes, component and weapon due dates, IH or OH status and OUICs.
   (T-2).
   8.7.2. Monthly Reconciliation. Within five duty days of receipt, NARS personnel reconcile
   the new DLIL against the SLIL. (T-2).
       8.7.2.1. Transactions reported after the effective date of the DLIL, but before its receipt,
       are carried forward. (T-2).
       8.7.2.2. If discrepancies are found, NARS personnel will validate against accountable
       documents. (T-2). Report to the MAJCOM any discrepancies that cannot be reconciled
       locally. The MAJCOM then assists the unit through coordination with AFNWC/NCL to
       resolve the discrepancy.
       8.7.2.3. Load and verify LLC kit pack dates, internal LLC serial numbers for weapons
       received since last reconciliation into the DIAMONDS database. Validate due dates
       during next LIL reconciliation. (T-2).
80                                                         AFI21-203 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     8.7.2.4. Load unassociated known, notional due dates for serviceable components
     received since the last reconciliation into the DIAMONDS database. Validate due dates
     during next LIL reconciliation. (T-2).
     8.7.2.5. Once reconciliation is complete, NARS personnel will document completion.
     (T-2).
  8.7.3. Local distribution of the WLIL. NARS personnel may distribute the WLIL (paper or
  electronic) to other duty sections as required. If other sections utilize the WLIL, it is their
  responsibility to reconcile their copy against the copy maintained by NARS personnel. If the
  LIL is maintained in other sections, it must be maintained and updated in the same manner as
  the copy maintained by NARS personnel. (T-3).
  8.7.4. SIR LIL Reconciliation. As a part of the SIR, NARS personnel will verify the
  accuracy of the SLIL or WLIL (with changes posted) against information contained on the
  completed blind inventory worksheets. (T-2). At a minimum, ensure all weapon information
  (e.g., serial number, weapon code, ALT code) and unassociated component serial numbers
  are accurate as compared to information recorded on the blind inventory worksheets. (T-2).

Terms
Accountability—The obligation imposed by law or lawful order or instruction on an officer or
other person for keeping accurate, reliable and auditable record of property, documents, or funds.
The person having this obligation may or may not have actual possession of the property,
documents or funds. Accountability is concerned primarily with records, while responsibility is
concerned primarily with custody, care and safekeeping.
Active Files—Documentation retained and filed within the current fiscal or calendar year.
Assembly—An accounting term for nuclear weapons/warheads configured for integration onto
delivery vehicles. Examples include ICBM warhead with forward and aft sections mated
(referred to as RV), W80s mated to missiles and gravity weapons.
Associate—1. An accounting term for nuclear weapons/warheads configured onto an
intermediate delivery device. Examples include RVs mated to RS and air launched
missiles/gravity weapons mated to pylons/launchers. This accounting term does not apply to
gravity weapons at tactical units. 2. A term applicable to nuclear weapons and components
reflecting direct relationship with shipping and storage containers and/or handling units.
Base Spares—Parts and components authorized in spare parts list (SPL) published by Sandia
National Laboratories (SNL), funded for, procured, and owned by DOE and furnished to the
DoD for use in maintaining and repairing WR nuclear weapons and DOE-owned equipment
supplied to DoD with the WR weapon. Parts remain the property of DOE regardless of custody.
Blind Inventory Worksheet—A locally developed worksheet used to record item identification
(part number, mark, mod, ALT, serial number) location, quantity, and configuration of items
