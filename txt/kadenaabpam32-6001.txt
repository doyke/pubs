Section A—HOUSING SERVICES

1. Initial Inspections: Upon assignment to military family housing (FH), a joint inspection is
conducted with the resident and the housing inspector. The purpose of this inspection is to brief
you on your responsibilities while living in FH and to document any existing discrepancies
pertaining to the unit, furniture and/or appliances. It is imperative you document any pre-
existing damages, so you are not held liable when terminating your FH.
2. Maintenance, Repairs and Lockouts: Housing Maintenance Service Call, located in
Building 1473 on Kadena AB, is your point of contact for all home service requests for
maintenance or appliance repairs. You may contact them at:
Service Call: 634-HOME (634-4663)
Service Call is staffed 24-hours a day




   2.1. When you place a service call, a housing maintenance specialist will provide you with a
   job order number. Please write this job order number down for future reference. You will
   receive a follow up call to schedule an appointment to complete the task. If craftsmen are
   sent to your unit for repairs and the problem occurred due to negligence, the occupant may be
   charged the cost of the repairs.
       2.1.1. There are two categories of services: emergency and routine. The category
       determines when the service will be accomplished.
       2.1.2. Emergency service calls are work requirements which receive immediate
       attention. Maintenance will respond or fix the problem within 24 hours. Routine service
       calls will be responded to within 20-30 working days. Examples of emergency requests
       are:
             2.1.2.1. Problems which could cause loss of life or major property damage.
             2.1.2.2. Serious damage affecting health, safety or security.

     make repairs yourself, please contact Service Call for assistance. See paragraph 5.
     2.3. We highly recommend occupants leave a key to their unit at our 24-hour service call
     section. Service call will maintain spare keys for housing units when provided by the
     occupant when first assigned. Occupants may borrow the spare key to let themselves back
     into their quarters. In the event of a lockout, only the occupant, with a valid ID, the
     member’s First Sergeant or a member authorized by a power of attorney will be issued a key.
     No keys will be issued to dependents under 18 years of age. If lock replacement is
     necessary, the occupant may be charged.
3. Recycling and Refuse Collection: Each housing area has a different refuse and recycling
pick-up day. During your initial inspection, you will be given the current schedule for your area.

   during duty hours or 090-6860-2203 after duty hours.
10. Leave or Extended Temporary Duty (TDY): If you plan to be absent from your quarters
for five days or more, a designee 18 years of age or older under Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) status will need to be appointed to maintain your quarters. In extended absences, please
also make arrangements with someone to manage your yard care. Please take a copy of the
Absence from Unit letter (obtainable from the housing office) to the housing office, housing
service call and the designee. This letter will include the name, address and phone number of the
person you have designated to oversee the normal day-to-day responsibilities and well being of
your quarters (a power of attorney is also recommended). This will provide a point of contact for
any emergencies that might occur during your absence.
11. Liability for damage to family housing, equipment and furnishings: Residents of FH are
liable for loss or damage to government property, including the FH unit, when damage is caused
by abuse or negligence of the sponsor, dependents or the sponsors’ guests. Damage to
government property beyond reasonable wear and tear is the residents’ responsibility.
Reasonable wear and tear is defined as wear and tear which results from normal everyday living.
While the maximum liability is limited to one-month basic pay in cases of simple negligence,
sponsors are liable for the full amount of damages or loss in cases of gross negligence.
   11.1. Insurance: It is highly recommended occupants consider purchasing commercial
   insurance to protect personal belongings in case of a major loss. A common policy for this
   coverage would be a renter’s policy, which would cover your personal property as well as
   personal liability for government property. Information about the replacement value of your

   quarters and government property can be obtained from a housing assistant. Direct more
   specific questions to your insurance company or your service legal office.
12. Energy Conservation: Family Housing supports the implementation of the President’s
Executive Order (EO) 13423 which mandates federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 3
percent annually through the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, for a total energy intensity reduction
of 30 percent relative to the FY03 baseline. Executive Order 13514 also mandates federal
facilities reduce water consumption by 2 percent annually through the end of FY20, for a total
water consumption reduction of 26 percent relative to the FY07 baseline. During your stay in
Family Housing, we may implement programs to help achieve these goals, and these programs
will balance energy reduction while attempting to sustain quality of life for all Family Housing
residents’ assistance
   12.1. Electricity: Please do not leave outside lights on during daylight hours. During the
   holiday season, decorative outside lighting should not be left on throughout the night; turn
   off at 10 pm. The only exception to this rule is during the actual holiday, where the lights
   can be left on 24 hours. Holiday lights are only authorized beginning on Thanksgiving Day
   through 3 January. Housing citations will be issued for noncompliance.
   12.2. Water: Family housing residents use roughly 60% of the total water consumed on
   Kadena AB. Okinawa's water supply is heavily dependent on rainfall. Your conservation of
   water is requested. Watering lawns is prohibited.

   12.3. Heating and Air Conditioning: The recommended temperature settings for heating and
   air conditioning by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
   Engineers (ASHRAE) are as follows: Heating 20°C (68°F) and air conditioning 24°C
   (76°F) The heating and cooling activation/deactivation criteria are based on the 18th Wing
   Energy and Water Conservation Policy.
       12.3.1. Heating Season: Beginning in December, heat may be activated when the
       outdoor 7-day average high temperature is below 65°F (18°C). Once Heat activation
       begins, it will remain ON for a minimum of 30 days. Beginning in January, heat may be
       deactivated when the outdoor 7-day average high temperature is above 65°F (18°C).
       Once heat is deactivated it will remain OFF for a minimum of 7 days.
       12.3.2. Air Conditioning Season: Beginning in December, A/C may be deactivated
       when the outdoor 7-day average high temperature is below 73°F (23°C). Once A/C is
       deactivated it will remain OFF for a minimum of 7 days. No earlier than April, A/C may
       be activated when the outdoor 7-day average high temperature is above 73°F (23°C).
       Note: Special A/C criteria for FH Tower Residents: After heat deactivation, housing
       maintenance personnel will monitor the indoor top floor temperature of all FH towers
       daily. The indoor top floor temperature is used in the A/C activation criteria.
13. Environmental Protection: For additional information on the proper disposal of specific
waste products/items, contact 718th Civil Engineer Squadron/Environmental Management (718
CES/CEAN) at 634-2600, Building 3621, Kadena AB.
   13.1. Vehicle Parts: Disposal of engine oils, engine coolants, car grease, car batteries, and
   tires can be done at the Auto Hobby Shop or AAFES garage. Do not pour these items into
   plumbing, drainage systems, or on the ground. Improper disposal of these items is
   considered illegal dumping.
   13.2. Green Waste: Burning of leaves or refuse is prohibited in all housing areas. Green
   wastes may be taken to the Kadena Recycling Center. Mulch is available for resident’s use
   at the recycling center.
   13.3. Recycling: Recycling is a mandatory program in FH. Recyclables should be
   segregated, placed in clear or semitransparent plastic bags and placed on the curb by 0800 on
   the recycling pick up day. Occupants will be briefed on pick up days at their initial
   inspection. For more information, see the attached Recycling Flyer (Attachment 6) or
   contact:
   Kadena Recycle Center                                634-2833

  13.4. Hazardous Household Items: If you are unsure how to properly dispose of an item,
  contact Natural Resources Management at 634-2600.
     13.4.1. Eagle Hardware Exchange Program: Any item purchased on member’s account
     and returned is available FREE of charge for reissue. To drop off a household chemical,
     the item must be in its original container, in good condition, have a legible English label
     and contain enough products to be reusable. Take the items to any Eagle Hardware
     location. Please DO NOT drop items off after business hours. To pick up items,
     please ask Eagle Hardware personnel for assistance. They will show you the items
     currently in inventory. You must have a valid DoD identification card to pick up
     products. Return all unused portions back to the program monitor.
     13.4.2. Prescription Drugs: Unused medicine or prescription drugs should be rendered
     unusable (ex: pills should be crushed) and disposed of as refuse.
     13.4.3. Non-Hazardous Items: The following materials can be safely disposed of with
     your regular household trash. Place the materials in a plastic bag with sawdust, kitty
     litter, rags or shredded newspapers before putting into your trash can:
     Aerosol Cans (empty)              Nail Polish                     Bug Sprays
     Floor Care Products               Furniture Polish                Fertilizer
     Art Supplies                      Moth Balls                      Shoe Polish
     Car Wax (with solvent)            Fiberglass Epoxy                Oven Cleaner (lye based)
     Varnish                           Metal Polish (with
                                       solvents)

     13.4.4. Batteries: Drop off locations for common household batteries (AA, A, C, and D)
     are available at Eagle Hardware and select Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)
     locations. This helps minimize the number of hazardous materials entering our landfills.
     13.4.5. Cooking Oil: Cooking oil drop-off locations are located at the Camp Foster,
     Camp Courtney and Camp Kinser Eaglette Hardware stores or the Kadena Recycling
     Center. Cooking oil may also be disposed of as refuse, but must be soaked into
     commercially available solidifiers, kitty litter, rags or newspaper and double bagged.
     Please do not drop items off after business hours.
  13.5. Bulk Refuse: Housing areas have different bulk refuse/trash pick-up dates. During
  your initial inspection, you will be given the schedule for your area. Bulk refuse/items must
  be on the curbside before 0800 on your scheduled day. Chibana and O’Donnell Gardens
  Housing Areas have designated bulk refuse/trash drop off locations. To help maintain a
  professional appearance in the housing areas, do not leave bulk refuse/items on the curbside
  at anytime other than the specified timeframe. If the bulk refuse pickup date does not
  coincide with your final inspection when terminating government quarters, other
  arrangements must be made for trash disposal. Therefore, please plan accordingly. Contact
  your area Housing Inspectors (see section 8, page 8 for phone numbers) if you need addition
  information on bulk refuse disposal.
     13.5.1. Large appliances, such as refrigerators or air conditioners, will not be picked up
     by the contractor. For further assistance call 634-7288 /7316/0707.
KADENAABPAM32-6001 7 MARCH 2011                                                              13


   13.6. Radon: Kadena Air Base has been conducting radon surveys of FH units on Okinawa
   since 1996. Surveys are still being conducted. Your unit may have an installed radon
   measuring device. These devices look like small black disc, typically mounted onto the wall
   inside the unit. Do not disturb these devices, as they will be collected at a later date. For
   more information, contact 718th Civil Engineering Asset Management Flight (718
   CES/CEANQ) at 634-5434.
   13.7. Asbestos and Lead Based Paint: Asbestos and lead base paint may be located in
   certain types of FH units. Submitting an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request,
   (See section F, Self-Help) prior to conducting Self-Help projects can help prevent exposure
   to these substances. For more information, please see the attached flyer or contact 18
   AMDS/SGPB at 634-4752.
   13.8. Cultural Resources: There are many cultural assets located within the military
   installations on Okinawa. There are three main types of cultural assets. Shrines (ugwanju)
   are places of worship or prayer. Tombs are considered to be the permanent home of
   ancestor’s spirits. Caves served as shelters for civilians during and at the conclusion of
   WWII. These areas should not be disturbed. For more information, contact 718 CES/CEAN
   at 634-2600.
   13.9. Poisonous Plants: Some plants commonly found in FH areas can be poisonous to
   humans and animals. Examples include the Sago Palm, Elephant Ears, and Oleander (see
   Attachment 4).
14. Mold and Mildew Control: Mold is prevalent in this environment. Due to the subtropical
climate of Okinawa, moisture and humidity are high while temperatures are just right for mold
growth. This contributes to a higher incidence of mold and mildew concerns than may be
experienced in other climates. A higher degree of maintenance is required to control its growth;
it is the occupants’ responsibility to maintain the unit mold free. Additional handy household
cleaning tips can be found under Attachment 1 and Attachment 3.
   14.1. Air conditioning and heating unit filters are government furnished. Filters are
   available through Eagle Hardware. Filters should be inspected, changed or cleaned once
   each month. Please check the drain pan for debris accumulation and keep the drainpipe
   clear. Regular maintenance of your filters will help prevent the build-up of mold and mildew
   and sustain the efficiency of your A/C and heating equipment. If craftsmen are sent out to
   repair your unit and it is found that lack of maintenance by the occupant is the cause of the
   problem (dirty filters or drain pans), occupants may be charged for the service call. Also
   please do not store items against the air conditioning unit, as this may cause malfunction in
   your unit, too.
   14.2. Use exhaust fans only while cooking or using the bathroom. Continually running
   exhaust fans removes cool dry air from your house and replaces it with warm moist air from
   outside, causing mold and mildew. Leave the window open while showering. Clothes dryers
   are essentially large exhaust fans which also remove cool dry air from your house and
   replace it with warm moist air from outside. When operating your dryer, open a window
   close to the dryer and where possible, close the laundry room door. This action isolates the
   laundry room from the rest of the house and will ensure your home stays more comfortable
   when operating your dryer.
 14                                                KADENAABPAM32-6001 7 MARCH 2011


   14.3. If you see mold starting to grow, clean the affected area with a solution of bleach and
   water. Several treatments may be required before the spores are killed.
15. Housing Ticket Program: A ticket program has been established for all family housing.
Ticket infractions include, but are not limited to, yard maintenance, improper trash disposal,
improper bulk trash disposal, lack of recycling (see Attachment 6 for recyclable items), pet
control, etc. Yard tickets have been approved by all service commands on Okinawa. A copy of
the current policy is provided at the move-in inspection.
16. Exterior Appearance Standards: All occupants assigned to               FH will receive a map
outlining the exterior responsibility of their assigned unit. Inspectors   will conduct weekly area
inspections to ensure appearance standards are met. The following          standards pertain to area
appearance              and            are            provided              as           guidelines.

16.1. Grounds Care: Watering lawns is prohibited, with the exception of newly seeded areas,
plants and flowers.
       16.1.1. Lawn Mowing: All lawns will be mowed, edged and have the shrubbery
       trimmed. If a housing unit sits on a street, the residents are responsible for maintaining
       and policing the area out to the middle of the street including the curbside and gutter. If
       the sidewalk and gutters are within 80 feet of the perimeter, this falls under your area of
       responsibility as well. The standard is for the grass to be no more than 3-inches tall.
       Mowing the lawn should be accomplished as necessary to maintain a neat appearance.
       Occupants should refer to the map given to them on the move-in inspection that clearly
       outlined the boundaries of responsibility. Lawn care equipment is available for use from
       Eagle Hardware or may be rented at Outdoor Recreation.
       16.1.2. Edging and Trimming: Edge and trim the sidewalk, driveway, curbside, and
       patios as well as the grass around the foundation, doorsteps, fence and garbage area.
       Remove grass in the cracks and crevices of the sidewalk, curbside, and in your assigned
       parking space and assigned visitors space.
       16.1.3. Trees/Bushes: Bushes in the back yard should not exceed 6 feet in height. All
       bushes which block the view of traffic or cause a safety hazard need to be maintained at a
       3-foot level. All bushes in the front yard should be maintained at a 3-foot level. Any
       hedge or bush next to a building must be trimmed to maintain at least 4-inches between
       the bush and wall. If tree limbs are overhanging the housing unit, power lines or pose a
       safety concern, please request trimming on AF Form 332. Yard clippings and leaves
       should be raked and properly disposed of as Green Waste.
       16.1.4. Flowers and Plants: With an approved AF Form 332, flowerbeds can be planted
       around the house or patio area. Flowerbeds are occupants’ responsibility to maintain, to
       include weeding. The planting of banana trees, ginger plants, poisonous plants, and
       vegetable gardens are prohibited in family housing.
       16.1.5. Parking Stalls: Sweep or hose down your parking stall, remove weeds and
       debris.
       16.1.6. Steep Inclines: Contact the housing facility section in your area for guidance if
       you cannot safely maintain your lawn or it has a sloped area larger than 240 square feet
       with a 30% grade.

    16.1.7. Patios: Neatly maintain front and back patios. Pressure-wash when necessary to
    prevent mold/residue builds up on the exterior of the unit. Secure large items in the event
    of a typhoon.
    16.1.8. Fences: Edge both sides of the perimeter of the fence and inspect for loose wire
    and sharp edges. Only chain link fences are authorized. No lattice fencing or bamboo is
    authorized.
    16.1.9. Heavy Picnic Tables, Lawn Furniture, Chairs, & Barbecue Grills: Occupants
    living on the second floor of multiplex units may place these items on their assigned front
    yard. Occupants living in multiplex units that have a three-sided enclosed patio may
    place these items on the front patio area. Occupants of other type units must place items
    on the back patio.
    16.1.10. Swing Sets: A free standing swing set is authorized in back yard areas only. If
    digging is required, an AF Form 332 must be submitted first. Rope, chain link, or tire
    swings, or hammocks are tied to any foundation of housing to include trees are not
    permitted in FH.
    16.1.11. Trampolines: Must have all safety devices attached, netting, and padding. The
    occupant will be asked to immediately remove any trampoline without safety devices,

alternate routes of escape. Establishing and practicing your escape plan as a family activity can
save the lives of your loved ones. The fire department should be made aware of handicapped
family members. Establish a meeting point a minimum of 50 feet from the unit.
21. Smoke Detector: Each housing unit is equipped with a smoke detector. An inspection of
the smoke detector will be performed during the change of occupancy. To help ensure your
safety and that of your family, please test to see the detector remain operable at least once per
month. Testing is simple: Push the button on the detector and hold for 10 seconds; the alarm
will sound and then shut-off (automatically) very shortly thereafter. Should your detector
become faulty, please contact 634-HOME. Please note these are not battery-operated smoke
detectors; they are wired directly into the unit's electrical system. Some smoke detectors have a
backup battery system which will beep when batteries need replacing. If beeping occurs, replace
the battery immediately. To ensure maximum effectiveness, please change the batteries out
semi-annually.
22. Fire Extinguisher: Residents should perform a visual inspection of their fire extinguishers

anything that produces its own grease) and a fire occurs, cover the burning pan with a lid, wet
towel, or cookie sheet. Turn off the appliance and call 911 or 098-970-9904. Never use water
on a grease fire! DO NOT attempt to move the pan! Use the fire extinguisher if fire continues
after shutting off appliance. Keep fire extinguisher in visible/accessible location and inspect
monthly.

53. Shopping Carts: Shopping carts are stored in the first floor stairway of each tower for use
by building residents. Shopping cars are to be used only for groceries. Please return
immediately after use. Do not leave carts in your apartment, hallway, or elevator. For the
benefit of your fellow occupants, please do not use them to haul your trash or things of that
nature.

Section H—TERMINATION OF FH

54. Notification: Please notify your housing office as soon as you know you are moving out.
55. Pre-Termination Inspection: Can be scheduled without orders. This inspection is
designed to assist you in preparing for the termination of your quarters. During this inspection, a
housing inspector will identify normal maintenance to be accomplished by our maintenance
department and any damages beyond fair wear and tear for which you may be held responsible.
The housing inspector will give you a cleaning checklist and will discuss your individual
cleaning needs and responsibilities for clearing FH. Any questions or concerns should be
addressed during your pre-inspection.
   55.1. Government Cleaning: Military residents are authorized government cleaning if they
   are vacating due to permanent change station (PCS), retirement or government-directed
   moves. These moves require minimum cleaning standards to be met by the resident to clear
   the quarters.
   55.2. Non-Government Cleaning: Residents terminating on base quarters, due to change in
   rank, increase in/maturation of dependents, Early Return of Dependents (ERD), and civilians
   must clean their quarters to the same standards as the government contract cleaning to pass
   their final inspection.
   55.3. The responsibility for final clearance of the housing unit rests solely with the resident/
   sponsor. Note: If you need a substitute to stand in for you at the final inspection, please
   notify the housing office in advance, and they will provide guidance. A power of attorney
   will be required.
56. Final Inspection: The final inspection ensures residents meet the standards of cleanliness
required to clear the quarters, and identifies any additional maintenance needs. If your unit does
not meet inspection standards, we will re-inspect your quarters on the same day, if possible. In
the case of a second failure, the government will clean the unit and the resident/sponsor will be
charged for the cleaning. If a re-inspection is not possible, the occupant will not be cleared from
housing, and the occupant is responsible for rescheduling the inspection with a substitute. A
power of attorney will be required.
57. Scheduling Final Inspection: If PCSing, please bring your PCS orders, Traffic
Management Office (TMO) pack out sheet, and flight information (itinerary, port call, etc.) to
your area housing office and schedule the inspection with a counselor. If you are moving off
base please bring a copy of your ―Itemized List of Expenses.‖

                          HANDY HOUSEHOLD CLEANING TIPS

1. Polishing Fixtures: If bathtub or sink fixtures become dull due to the build-up of soap film,
soak a cloth in vinegar and wrap it around the faucet or handle. Leave the cloth on for a few
minutes then remove it; polish the fixtures to a shine.

2. Removing Tub Decals: Use hot vinegar to remove stubborn, sticky no-slip decals from the
bathtub. Vinegar can also be used to remove stick-on hooks from painted walls or the
refrigerator. Saturate a cloth or sponge with vinegar and squeeze the liquid behind the hook so
that it comes in contact with the adhesive, gently pry off and clean the remaining residue with the
vinegar soaked cloth.

3. Preventing Clogged Drains: Grease and food particles should be wiped away before dishes
are rinsed. Fatty liquids left over from cooking should be allowed to cool. Once solidified, fat
can easily be lifted off and discarded in the trash rather than rinsed down the drain. A screen or
strainer should protect all drains where hair is washed. Never put rice or other dehydrated food
products in the drain.

4. Bathroom Tile: A solution of one-half cup bleach to one-half gallon of water will remove
residue or film from tile.

5. Dishwasher: Keep your dishwasher odor free by adding two teaspoons of baking soda to its
regular cycle at least twice a week.

6. Floors: To strip wax from floors, use a solution of ammonia and water. Use a scraper,
single-edged razor, and/or scouring pad to remove build-up. Rinse the floor with vinegar and
water to remove cleanser residue. Scouring pads also work well to remove scuff marks and
stains. Use ready shine wax to eliminate the need for buffing.

7. Walls and Ceilings: To remove marks or stains from walls or ceilings, soak the affected area
for a few seconds with warm, soapy water and wipe with a damp cloth or scouring pad.
Adhesive from hooks or tape can be removed by using a single-edged razor blade and then
follow procedure for removing marks from walls. Toothpaste or rubbing alcohol can be used to
remove crayon marks from walls.

8. Mold and Mildew: To help prevent mold and mildew, always run the AC during the cooling
season. Make sure all windows are closed when AC is on. When showering, leave the bathroom
open for 10 minutes to clear steam from the room. A solution of 1/4 cup of bleach and 1 gallon
of water will remove mold from most surfaces. Check, clean, or replace AC filters at least once
a month. Use exhaust fans only while cooking or using the bathroom, do not let them run
continually. Clean the dryer lint screen after each use. Periodically check dryer exhaust hose for
kinks or holes. See Attachment 3 for more information.

9. Windows: Use a small paintbrush, toothbrush, or knife to clean in the corners of tracks or
windowsills. Use newspaper to dry windows; this eliminates smears and smudges on the panes.
Do not clean tinted windows with ammonia products. Instead, use a soft cotton cloth and soapy
water. To clean blinds, soak in bathtub, and clean with a soft brush.

10. Stove: Oven cleaner and scouring pads work well for cleaning oven racks. For hard to
remove areas, use a single-edge razor blade. Soak oven parts in ammonia and water over night
or place in a large plastic bag with ammonia and water and bake in the sun. Table salt will clean
up most messy oven spills. Let the oven cool, wet the spill area, sprinkle with salt, and let it
work for a minute. Scrape away the stain, and then wash the area clean. Note: Ovens and
broiler units should be cleaned regularly as well as the top burners to prevent grease buildup
from becoming a fire hazard.

11. Porcelain: Use a pumice stone to remove water/calcium deposits from bathtubs, sinks, and
toilets.

12. Cabinets/Counters: A solution of bleach and water works well to remove stains from
counters, cabinets, doors, etc.

13. Adhesive: If shelf paper leaves drawers/shelves sticky, spray area with ammonia based
cleaner. Work over the area with your fingers and then wipe off.

14. Parking Lots/Driveways: Use dirt, sawdust, or kitty litter to soak up surface oil and grease;
sweep-up and dispose of the material.

                           YARD MAINTENANCE STANDARD

Generally, the area of responsibility as illustrated on your map, is defined as 80-ft from the
exterior wall of the individual's housing unit or half the distance to your next door unit. If
a housing unit sits on a street, the residents are responsible for maintaining and policing
the area out to the middle of the street including the gutter. Flowers and shrubs may be
planted, but they must be kept neat and clean of weeds, grass and dead leaves. Remove all
vines and dead leaves from exterior walls. Kadena housing residents are requested not to
leave bagged lawn clippings on the curb for the trash contractor. All grass clippings and
branches must be taken to the "Green Waste Disposal" which is located behind the new
Karing Kennels. For questions, contact 718th Civil Engineer Environmental Flight,
634-0448. Tree trimmings including stumps and tree limbs must be tied in bundles no
larger than six feet in length.

                                       MOLD HANDOUT

The health and safety of our residents is a top concern for the 18th Wing. Our priority is to
provide a safe environment and to address the needs of residents who may have medical
problems associated with mold. We are committed to providing you the best care by
investigating and evaluating potential hazards that mold poses to your health and ensuring
cleanup methods are effective. Solving mold problems must be done on a case-by-case basis
because each person has a unique reaction and tolerance level for mold spores. Our team of base
agencies will work to ensure your mold concerns are put to rest.

All of us are familiar with molds: we’ve scrubbed them from our bathroom tiles or found them
on clothes put in storage. For most of us, they are only an unsightly nuisance. However, some
people develop mold allergies, or have pre-existing medical conditions aggravated by mold
spores. We have developed procedures for assessing your exposure to mold and treating you if
you have any adverse reactions. If mold is present, 718 Civil Engineer Squadron has standard
methods for removing the mold and cleaning affected areas. All these procedures were
developed using numerous medical references, technical reports, and standard commercial
practices that discuss the health effects of mold exposure, how to control mold and minimize its
growth, and ways to clean it up.

I never had problems with mold before. Why is mold a problem here?
Mold is always present in the environment. Due to the subtropical climate of Okinawa, moisture
and humidity are high while temperatures are just right for mold growth. This contributes to a
higher incidence of mold and mold concerns than may be experienced in other climates. As
such, a higher degree of maintenance is required to control its growth.

Molds live in nature in the soil, on plants, and on dead or decaying matter. Molds play a key role
in the breakdown of leaves, wood, and other plant debris. Without molds, our environment
would be overwhelmed with large amounts of dead plant matter. To reproduce, molds produce
tiny spores, just as plants produce seeds. When their spores land on a damp spot and conditions
are favorable, they begin to consume organic material in their immediate vicinity, digesting
whatever they are growing on in order to survive.

What does mold look like and where should I look?
Identifying the presence of mold early is critical. Often, it will appear as fuzz or dust on
surfaces. Even hard surfaces, such as dressers, appliances, and shelves can develop molds. Be
sure to inspect vertical surfaces (walls, sides of dressers, etc.) as they tend to be overlooked when
cleaning for molds. Musty odors may be an indication of mold, and should be followed by
thorough visual inspection and confirmation. Too often, mold is left unattended, and it
flourishes and spreads before anything is done to remove it.

What should I do if I think mold is causing me to be ill?
We understand your concerns and take them seriously. As with any potential medical condition,
if symptoms exist, call a physician or your primary care manager. They can help determine
whether the illness may be caused by mold. If the physician/primary care manager feels mold

may be the problem, he or she will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering and 718 Civil
Engineer Squadron to investigate and mitigate as appropriate who will investigate the source of
your exposure.

How do I prevent it from growing?
Since mold is always present in the environment, it is not possible to totally eliminate it;
however it is possible to control it. Prevention is the easiest way to control mold. Routine
cleaning will eliminate mold and keep it from spreading to other areas. There are three basic
keys to controlling mold: conduct maintenance and cleaning before mold becomes a problem,
fix any sources of water leaks and dry out damaged areas, and lower the humidity inside your
home. Here are some ways to solve moisture problems before they become mold problems:
     1. Fix leaks as soon as possible
     2. Watch for condensation and wet spots
     3. Clean and dry wet or damp spots within 48 hours
     4. Maintain indoor air humidity below 60%, ideally 30-50%
     5. Ensure heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) condensation tubes are
       unobstructed & flowing properly into the drip pan. Clean drip pan by monthly pouring 1
       cup of bleach.
     6. Replace or maintain the HVAC Filter once a month
     7. Vent dryers, bathroom exhaust, and other moisture-generating sources to the outside
     8. Perform regular building and HVAC inspections and maintenance
     9. Purchase a dehumidifier to reduce moisture in the air
     10. Use Dry-z-Air pellets to help remove excess moisture from the air – can be picked up at
       your nearest Eagle Hardware Store
Educational pamphlets and periodic Shogun articles will help ensure you are aware of prevention
and maintenance responsibilities. You should know how to identify mold early and who to call
if significant problems are found.

What do I do if I have mold in my house?
Okinawa’s warm, humid environment is ideal for mold growth. Regardless of health indications,
you must take steps to prevent mold growth in your house, and once found, take aggressive
actions to eliminate it. As soon as you see mold growing on hard surfaces or fabrics, they must
be thoroughly cleaned. Use a damp cloth to wipe surfaces to routinely remove mold. You can
clean small areas of mold growth using a variety of commercial products. Be sure to read the
labels carefully and test a small inconspicuous area before applying the cleaners – some may
damage finishes or fabrics. A bleach solution (one part bleach: ten parts water) can also be used
for more difficult areas. CAUTION: Never mix household cleaners, especially bleach. Be
sure to use protective gloves that extend mid-arm and ventilate the area in which you are using
the cleaners. Unfortunately, not all materials are cleanable once mold gets a foothold. Only
trained maintenance personnel should tackle large moldy areas and inaccessible parts of your
cooling systems’ equipment. Contact Housing Maintenance for assistance in this case
(634-HOME). Bioenvironmental Engineering (634-4752) is also available to assist in
recommendations for control of mold.

         SMART AND EASY WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE

Awareness and personal integrity are key values when it comes to energy and water
conservation. Individual efforts combined together with the efforts of others strengthens our
ability to increase funding to other needed projects, which contribute to improving the quality of
life and keep us from more stringent limitations of water and energy use such as rationing of
water, heating, and A/C.

1. ―Turn Stuff OFF‖ (TSO) anything that consumes electricity and also produces heat. TSO is
the smart, easy way to improve the comfort of your home. Turn off appliances, televisions,
lighting, air conditioning, fans, computers, and other electronics when not in use.

2. Avoid eye strain and improve the comfort of your home by using task lighting instead of
overhead room lights.

3. Replacing existing standard light-bulbs with Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL) improves
your quality of life and make your home cooler because the ―skin temperature of an operational
standard light-bulb is about 450 oF while CFLs are about 115 oF; the light output from CFLs is
more closely aligned to natural sunlight than ordinary light-bulbs; and CFLs last about 7-10
times longer than ordinary light-bulbs so they save you time as well.

4. Installing Motion/Occupancy Detectors indoors and out makes your home safer and more
secure (Don’t use CFLs with Motion/Occupancy Detectors or dimmers).

5. Using air circulation fans year round is a smart and easy way to improve your comfort and
reduce mildew formation within your home. Ceiling fans should blow down in summer and
push air up in winter. Air circulation reduces moisture on surfaces and discourages mildew
formation. Keep fan blades clean because dirty fan blades severely restricts air circulation.
Even a small amount of dust build-up on fan blades can significantly reduce air flow.

6. Setting your thermostat in accordance with installation policy will reduce mildew formation
during the summer and discourages dry-flaky skin formation in winter.

7. A smart easy way to make your home cooler is to avoid doing cooking and laundry chores
during the hottest times of the day (1200 to 1600).

8. Keep your home cooler year round. When doing laundry, open a window in the laundry room
and close the laundry room door because your clothes dryer is a huge fan that sucks all the cold
air out of your home. An alternative solution would be opening the window nearest to your
dryer while drying clothes because this will make rest of your home more comfortable during the
cooling/heating season.

9. Improve household productivity: Consolidating laundry and drying consecutive loads helps
clothes dry faster because, the dryer is already heated up from the previous load so more heat is
used to dry the clothes.

10. Become a BBQ Super hero and keep the heat outside where it belongs!

11. Wash or replace air conditioning filters every 30 days to get more A/C and improve your
indoor air quality.

12. ENERGY STAR appliances and electronic equipment last longer, perform better and
produce less heat than standard equipment. ENERGY STAR ratings are given to refrigerators,
dishwashers, washing machines, lighting fixtures, ceiling fans, telephones, televisions, DVD and
VCR players, audio equipment, computers, etc. Product listings and energy savings calculators

13. Use cookware with flat bottom and sized for your stove’s burner element. When possible,
cover cookware and use the steam inside to cook food quicker. Turn down heat when food
reaches proper cooking temperature and use the lowest possible heat to maintain temperature.
Turn surface unit or oven off a few minutes before cooking is completed, allowing retained heat
to finish the cooking. Use pressure cookers, toaster ovens, microwaves, or crock pots instead of
large ovens when possible. Also limit opening the oven while cooking or baking to make your
home more comfortable and speed up cooking times.

14. Cleaning your refrigerator coil least twice a year will make the refrigerator more efficient
and make your home more comfortable. Special brushes are sold to reach the coils that are
located either at the bottom or in the rear of the refrigerator. Also, inspect the door seals for
proper closure; if cracked or torn, they should be replaced. Empty and clean the drain pan
periodically to prevent mildew build-up and to keep your home smelling fresh.

15. Additional tips to keep your home cooler and improve quality of life:

a. Use a power strip to conveniently turn off computers (after properly logging off), camera and
cellular phone chargers; all of these items use standby power when not in use that makes your
home hotter.

b. Keep the heat outside, seal doorways and windows to prevent infiltration.

c. Washing clothes in cold water makes more hot water available for showers.

d. Taking warm showers instead of baths makes more hot water available for other family
members and wingmen. Hot-steamy showers promote mildew growth and remove essential skin
oils which can cause premature aging of skin.

e. Turn off the water while brushing your teeth or shaving. An open faucet wastes at least 2
gallons of water every minute.

f. Heat and humidity are added to your home every time you wash dishes or clothes. You will
be more comfortable and there will be less humidity within the home if you wash only full loads
in your washing machine and dishwasher.

g. Keep the heat out. TSO the heated drying feature on your dishwasher because it puts more
heat in your home; your home will be more comfortable (cooler) if you air dry dishes.

h. Don’t use the toilet as a wastebasket or ashtray. The toilet is the biggest water user in the
home, taking up to 5 gallons of water with every flush. Also, use a broom instead of a water
hose to clean off sidewalks, driveways, patios, and parking areas.
