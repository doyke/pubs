                          DESIGNATION OF FACILITY MANAGER

1.1. Appoint Letter. Each organization’s commander will submit a letter to the Base Civil
Engineer (BCE) with a copy sent to the Real Property Officer (934 MSG/CERR) to appoint a
primary and alternate facility manager(s) when changes occur (Attachment 6). The appointment
should be submitted at least ten days prior to the effective date. The people appointed must have
at least 18 months retainability to perform facility manager duties. The appointment letter must
contain the individual’s name, the building they will be the facility manager for, their office
symbol, duty phone number, and home phone number (or cell phone number). Reference: 934
AWI 32-1004, Real Property Facility Manager.
1.1.1. The information on this appointment letter will not be used for any purpose unrelated to
assigned duties. The Security Forces Squadron and Command Post may use the list compiled to
contact the primary or alternate facility manager for emergencies during non-duty hours.
1.2. The Facility Manager Duties.
     1.2.1. Ensure alternate facility managers are in compliance with applicable instructions and
     other directives. The primary and alternate facility managers should work as a team to
     ensure the facility is managed effectively and efficiently. Ensure 934 AWVA 32-9001 is
     posted in the building (bulletin board).
     1.2.2. Write and coordinate each AF Form 332 submitted by the organization and forward,
     when applicable, to the organization’s commander for signature.
     1.2.3. Conduct monthly inspections of the facility and its installed heating and air
     conditioning equipment, windows, doors, lights and plumbing, to determine the condition of
     the property. Inspect all interior areas such as closets, stairwells, entrances, hallways, and
     office areas for neatness and cleanliness. Inspect exterior areas such as lawns, trees, shrub,
     parking lots, and designated smoking areas for safety, cleanliness, and neatness.
     1.2.4. Brief users of the facility on their collective responsibility for care, custody, and
     protection of the property. Brief occupants of proper work request reporting procedures
     (Attachment 7).
     1.2.5. Ensure that facility users do not alter, move or remove walls, outlets, switches,
     heating, lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing and related fixtures, or other real
     property installed equipment.
     1.2.6. Ensure space is used as approved by the Base Facilities Utilization Board (FUB).
     Report all vacant spaces to the Real Property Officer (934 MSG/CERR). Where possible,
     turn off or minimize the use of lighting, heating and cooling for areas not occupied.
     1.2.7. Ensure replacement of burned out light bulbs installed at a height of eight feet and
     under (inclusive) and are accessible using a six-foot ladder. The Base Operating Support
     (BOS) will replace light bulbs over eight feet high. Purchase of the lamps is the responsibility
     of 934 MSG/ CE. Before initiating a service call for light bulbs over ten feet long there must
     be at least 25% of the total number of light bulbs out of service, or a direct impact to the
934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011                                                                    7


   mission creating a job stoppage or safety hazard. Dispose of light bulbs in accordance with
   regulations as briefed during the annual training.
   1.2.8. Inspect the facility upon the initial appointment as facility manager.
   1.2.9. Maintain an accurate and current work order logbook to include written and verbal
   requests (Attachment 4).
   1.2.10. Maintain accurate accountability of all keys issued to personnel assigned within that
   facility.
   1.2.11. Ensure thermostats throughout the assigned facilities are constantly set to maintain a
   comfortable environment. Do not adjust Energy Management Controlled Systems (EMCS).
   Make sure doors and windows are closed when heating or air conditioning is in use.
   1.2.12. Turn off exterior and interior lights, equipment, etc., when not in use.
   1.2.13. Use as-built floor plans during facility inspections. Ensure all renovations are noted
   as such on the as-built floor plans.            Contact 934 MSG/CEC for floor plans.
   SUGGESTION: Keep a current floor plan in your facility manager’s continuity binder.
1.3. The appointment as a primary/alternate facility manager is a significant responsibility
which will consume a substantial portion of a person's time. The facility manager must be
prepared to assist the occupants with issues concerning the facility (Attachment 8). Also, the
facility manager must be available to BOS and CE (Civil Engineering) personnel for access to
facilities, questions about service calls, and Real Property inventories. Organize your time well
and keep your records current.
1.4. Facility managers should learn the locations of circuit panels, thermostats, fire pull
stations and extinguishers, and water shut off valves in their assigned facilities. It would be
a good idea to indicate on a map these areas and brief them to occupants.
1.5. Facility managers may perform minor repairs such as tightening loose screws,
changing light bulbs, replacing toilet seats, unclogging toilets/sinks, fixing leaky faucets,
etc. You should invest in a small tool kit which would contain screwdrivers, wrenches, duct
tape, a plunger, etc.

     AF FORM 332, BASE CIVIL ENGINEER WORK REQUEST PROCEDURES

5.1. Explanation:
   5.1.1. The AF Form 332 is used to request modifications, alterations or new work to
   assigned real property. This form is also used to request all self-help work and work done as
   a result of facility abuse. This form is used for non-emergency/urgent requests. An
   emergency should be called in through Customer Service at 713-1918.
   5.1.2. The facility manager will prepare an original and three copies of AF Form 332
   (Attachments 2 and 3). The facility manager should maintain the one copy for their files and
   submit the original and the other copies with their request to the BOS Customer Service
   Office in Building 745. Complete the request according to the instructions on the reverse
   side of the form. The facility manager should print their name/rank in blocks 11/12 and sign
   in block 13 as the requester. However, the organization commander must have their
   name/rank in block 11/12 and signature in block 13 for major project work requests (i.e., new
   installed equipment, minor construction, major repair, etc.). An AF Form 332 requesting
   routine maintenance or repair does not require the organization's commander's signature.
   5.1.3. The description of requested work should be supported where possible by sketches,
   plans, diagram photographs, specification drawings, and any other data that will provide a
   clear, complete description of the location and scope of the work being requested. Minor
   construction requests must have as a minimum a sketch or drawing. Copies of building
   plans may be obtained from the Geographic Information System Specialist (934 MSG/CEC).
   5.1.4. Justification must be complete, factual, and indicate the impact on the mission if the
   work is not accomplished. The statement of work must be clear and concise, and cite
   governing directive (if applicable) to be fully understood by reviewing and approving
   authorities. Coordination with agencies other than BOS Customer Service is the
   responsibility of the organization submitting the request.
   5.1.5. Written requests correcting a safety/fire deficiency must have an attached copy of the
   written Safety or Fire Discrepancy Report from Base Safety and/or the Fire Inspector.
5.2. Coordination.
   5.2.1. Requests will require coordination if submitted for the following reasons:
      5.2.1.1. To correct a hazard identified during a safety, fire or health inspection, and if a
      risk assessment code (RAC) was assigned.
      5.2.1.2. To correct an existing safety, fire or health hazard.
      5.2.1.3. Any construction, repair, or major modification of a facility.
      5.2.1.4. Any construction, repair, or renovation of a facility within (located anywhere
      around or on the flight line) the airfield.
      5.2.1.5. Any construction or renovation of a facility that requires, or may require, an
      airfield waiver.

       5.2.1.6. Alert Security Forces of existing or potential security deficiency and/or facility
       abuse trend.
       5.2.1.7. Coordinating Agencies: Coordination may be requested through the agencies
       listed below before CE accepts the work request (block number 14 on the AF Form 332):
          5.2.1.7.1. Fire Inspector,
          5.2.1.7.2. Safety,
          5.2.1.7.3. Environmental Engineering,
          5.2.1.7.4. Security Forces,
          5.2.1.7.5. Airfield Manager,
          5.2.1.7.6. Bioenvironmental Engineering.
   5.2.2. If you have any questions contact the CE Industrial Engineering Technician (934
   MSG/ CERI).
5.3. Risk Assessment Code (RAC).
   5.3.1. RAC 1 (CE Priority I, Mission). Direct support of the overall base or tenant unit
   mission. If the work is not done the operational effectiveness will be reduced.
   5.3.2. RAC 2 and 3 (CE Priority II, Safeguard Life and Property). Need to provide security
   to areas that could be compromised; to eliminate health, fire, or safety hazards; to protect
   valuable property or equipment.
   5.3.3. RAC 4 (CE Priority III, Support). Supports the mission or prevents the breakdown of
   essential operating or housekeeping functions.
   5.3.4. RAC 5 (CE Priority IV, Necessary). This does not qualify for a higher priority.
5.4. Base Safety or Bioenvironmental only assigns RACs. A requester may not establish a
RAC. The Assistant Chief of Fire Protection establishes a Fire Safety Deficiency Code (FSDC),
equivalent to RAC codes.
5.5. Refer to 934 AWI 32-1001, Request for Accomplishment of Work.
5.6. Fill out AF Form 103, BCE Work Clearance Request, whenever work is required to
correct a problem (Attachment 5).

         AF FORM 322, WORK ORDER REQUEST REVIEW BOARD (WORB)

6.1. The AF Form 332 WORB meets once every week. This panel determines the validity and
urgency of each written work request. After thorough consideration of each request the panel
will approve or disapprove the work and decide the method of accomplishment. If disapproved a
copy of the AF Form 332 and a status letter will be returned to the facility manager who
requested the work.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    CUSTOMER SERVICE

7.1. The customer service desk is the focal point for all incoming work requests both
written and verbal. The identification and reporting of all work requirements is the
responsibility of the facility manager. The BOS and BCE will plan, program, schedule and
accomplish work requirements in a timely manner.
7.2. Service Call Function. The BOS maintains a 24-hour, 7-day a week capability to respond
to emergency conditions. For all situations it is wise for the facility manager to investigate the
matter before calling Customer Service. Most facility managers are capable of handling minor
issues. For example, changing light bulbs, unstop drains and toilets, tightening loose screws and
door handles. Contact the Customer Service Section at 713-1918 during normal duty hours
(0700-1545). For after duty hours (emergencies only) contact the Security Forces Desk Sergeant
at 713-1102 so they can initiate the After-Hours Emergency Contact List. If you are not sure the
problem is an emergency call anyway to be safe.
7.3. Emergency. An emergency is detrimental to your unit's mission and if not corrected
immediately you can expect a considerable reduction in operational effectiveness. A condition is
considered an emergency when the security of a classified area is compromised, there is a threat
of injury or loss of life, or a risk of fire or risk of severe facility damage. An emergency
includes, but is not limited to, the failure of a complete utility system (loss of all building
electrical or water); failure of "critical" heating, electrical, and air conditioning systems (see
section 8.8) or failure of the plumbing systems (bad water leak, break, or stopped up drainage) to
the entire facility. The service call function will accept a call from anyone that has knowledge of
an existing emergency. Emergency service calls will receive immediate response. The problem
will either be repaired by the craftsmen or a temporary fix will be made to eliminate the
threat/cause of the emergency situation. Comfort climate control, air conditioning, is not
considered an emergency. NOTE: If the situation is apparently dangerous, (i.e., smell of
smoke, gas, fumes, sparks and/or fire) the person that first notices the problem must call 911 or
612/713-1911 from a cell phone. Do not call Customer Service.
7.4. Other Than Emergency Situations.
   7.4.1. The Customer Service Section also accepts routine and urgent service calls during
   normal duty hours. The primary and alternate facility managers are the only persons
   authorized to call in or submit these work requests. The Customer Service Section will
   determine whether your request, depending on the type of service, may be verbal or needs to
   be submitted on an AF Form 332. The Customer Service Section will determine whether
   calls such as these are routine or urgent. Urgent calls will receive a fast response from the
   BOS shops. The shops have five business days to address urgent calls. The problem will
   either be repaired or made safe until a permanent fix can be accomplished. Routine calls are
   non-threatening.
   7.4.2. Shop superintendents set priorities for urgent and routine calls. Shops will not stop
   working an urgent/routine request to work another of similar type or priority. Requests are
   normally prioritized by the seriousness of problem and/or date received. The oldest requests
   are normally accomplished first. Some service calls may require material support which can
934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011                                                                        15


   also delay the work being accomplished at the time desired. The work will be completed as
   soon as materials are on-hand and man-hours permit.
   7.4.3. The BOS will not work on items that are not classified as real property. This may
   include, but is not limited to, any type of specialty shop equipment, safes, furniture, vehicles,
   communication equipment, window air conditioners not purchased and installed by BOS,
   generator equipment not authorized by CE, portable buildings not considered real property,
   portable trailers, and contractor owned equipment. The BOS will provide a courtesy call to
   ensure proper utilities are supplied to authorized equipment, but will not troubleshoot
   problems on the actual unit. NOTE: Whenever you phone in or submit a work request
   always obtain a work request number. Record this number in your log to help monitor
   requirements and follow-ups. Always keep a copy of the AF Form 332 before giving the
   work request to the Customer Service Desk. For a call in requests always get a work request
   number while on the phone or have the Customer Service representative call you back. The
   normal call back is less than 24 hours.
7.5. Recurring Work Program (RWP). Recurring work consists of preventive maintenance
for which the scope and level of effort is known without an earlier visit to the job site each time
the work is scheduled. It includes all recurring work needed to prevent the breakdown of critical
facilities, equipment, and utilities. It also includes recurring requirements such as pavement
sweeping/plowing, grass cutting, entomology services, heating and air conditioning service, etc.
The RWP encompasses all work of a recurring nature except utility operations and contract
services.
7.6. Maintenance and Repair. Maintenance is the day-to-day work required to preserve real
property facilities and prevent premature failure of facility systems. Repair is the work required
to restore a facility or its systems to an economical support function.
7.7. Minor Construction.
   7.7.1. Work is considered minor construction when adding new capabilities to the facility or
   a subsystem. FOR EXAMPLE: Adding square footage, installing restrooms, running
   additional electrical service, installing new equipment, and major remodeling to change the
   function.
   7.7.2. When construction requests are submitted, the requesting Organization Commander
   must be the requester using blocks 10 through 13 on the AF Form 332. All requirements
   should be listed in as much detail as possible and include drawings or clearly defined
   sketches to show proposed plans or alterations. Include any photos, policies, operating
   instructions or literature that will help justify the request. A good justification is a key factor
   when approving and setting priorities for a work request.
7.8. Critical Facilities with Crucial Space and/or Equipment Needs. Listed below are
facilities and generators that have a direct impact on the base mission or have a large asset value
potential. They will receive priority during and after normal duty hours. They will receive
immediate response during and after normal duty hours.

7.9. Comfort Heating and Air Conditioning Seasonal Operations. Heating and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems are turned on/off depending on the season. Heating is turned off
and "moth balled" during the late spring, and operation checks are performed on air conditioning
systems to prepare for the summer. This process is repeated during late fall to prepare the
heating system for winter, while the air conditioning system is "moth balled". Systems are
activated once they are considered operationally ready; usually before outside temperatures
and/or humidity turn critical. The weather may change for a few days which will cause some
people to feel that the HVAC system should be turned from heat to air condition or visa versa.
The systems will not be switched to accommodate those few days of unseasonably warm/cool
weather. If you experience a problem with your HVAC system, first check the thermostat and
vents to make sure they are opened. If your system is computer controlled reference paragraph
13.2. The shops respond to service calls as they are received, with critical facilities receiving
higher priorities. Comfort climate control is not considered an emergency.

                                          SELF-HELP

8.1. Self-help is defined as any work where the requester has chosen the option to furnish
manpower to accomplish the requirement. Self-help work does not count against the In-house
Work Order Allocation System, unless the BOS shop support is required. This type of work will
not be given mission essential status. Self-help is an excellent way to accomplish needed
projects that would normally receive a low priority. Self-help work can be accomplished on an
AF Form 332.
8.2. The facility manager or Commander must submit all AF Forms 332. The requester
must attach a copy of the as-built floor plans for requests that involve modifications to the
current lay out of the facility. The floor plan must show the self-help changes to the facility such
as: removing/addition of walls, doors, and windows, because these modifications may affect the
operation of HVAC, electrical, fire protection, and/or plumbing systems. You can find the self-

                                        PROJECTS

9.1. This process begins with an AF Form 332 as well. The request will be assigned a work
request number at the Customer Service Section. Once it is approved as a project the package
will be forwarded to the Engineering and Construction Branch (934 MSG/CEC). The request
number will be assigned a project number. The requester will be notified in writing. All
inquires should be made to the Engineering Branch thereafter. The scope of the work requested
determines how it will be accomplished. Factors such as man-hours and materials required plus
the description of the work are key factors in this process. Projects are programmed for
accomplishment according to necessity of work (mission) and funding availability. Projects by
service contract, which can be funded using local funds, have an estimated 3–24 months time-
frame for accomplishment. Projects by contract subject to Higher Headquarters funding have a
one to five-year time-frame for accomplishment. Direct any questions you may have to the
Engineering and Construction Branch Chief (934 MSG/CEC).

                              FACILITY UNDER WARRANTY

10.1. Any problems within that year associated with the project are the responsibility of
the contractor. For any problem that requires immediate attention the facility manager should
notify the Customer Service Section at 713-1918. Any minor blemish or non-threatening issue
should be documented in writing (photos help). The occupants cannot make any physical
alteration to the structure of the facility or its utilities until the warranty expires and has CE
approval. The BOS cannot make any repairs to the facility that will void the warranty. All
problems/service calls within the one year time of warranty should be well documented.

                        REAL PROPERTY SPACE MANAGEMENT

11.1. The Real Estate Management Office in CE is accountable for all “space” at the 934th
Airlift Wing. Space is classified by the constructed function of the facility, (i.e., administrative,
shop, storage, hangar, etc.) and the using organization. All requests for additional space and
changes of existing space, as well as notification of intent to vacate, must be reported to the
BCE. Prior to vacating a facility the using organization must remove all of its property and clean
the facility before it can be reassigned. All assigned keys must be returned to 934 BOS/CEO. A
good practice is to have floor plans of the facility and outline which units occupy which areas in
the building. Since the number of open work orders a squadron can have in the system is based
on the number of square feet the squadron occupies; it benefits the user to have all occupied
space on record.
11.2. Building Inventories. The Real Property Officer (934 MSG/CERR) is required to
inventory all real property to include installed equipment; and verify building floor plans and
using organizations every five years. The facility manager will be notified prior to an inventory
inspection.
11.3. Availability of Building Data. The Real Property Officer has extensive information on
934th Airlift Wing facilities. If you need information such as size, cost or historical data to
complete surveys or performance appraisals contact the Real Property Officer at 713-1907.
934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011                                                                     21

                                   SERVICE CONTRACTS

12.1. Grounds Maintenance. The Roads and Grounds Shop (934 BOS/LGRV) is responsible
for cutting the grass, removing clippings, trimming small bushes and shrubs around base
facilities, and removing weeds. This work is done on a scheduled basis for each area/facility on
base. Refer any questions or concerns to the BOS Manager (934 BOS/MS).
12.2. Refuse Collection. A contractor is responsible for emptying dumpsters on a regular
schedule. All materials must be inside the dumpster. The contractor will not pick up materials
left outside the dumpster. Keep dumpster lids and doors closed at all times. Bring scrap metal to
the Recycling Center, Building 733. Do not put pallets, furniture, construction debris, or any
bulky materials in base dumpsters. Recyclable materials may not be placed in refuse dumpsters
per 934 AWI 32-7003, Solid Waste Management. Hazardous materials (including paint) may
never be placed inside dumpsters. If you have questions about disposing of hazardous materials,
call the Environmental Engineer Flight Chief (934 MSG/CEV). For regular refuse questions call
the Solid Waste/Recycling Program Manager (934 MSG/CEV).
   12.2.1. Recycling Services. The refuse contractor is responsible for emptying the cardboard
   and paper dumpsters located throughout the Base.
12.3. Custodial Services. A contractor is responsible for general custodial cleaning services in
most facilities. For details on the standards and schedule for your facility contact the Quality
Assurance Engineer (QAE). Although the QAE (934 MSG/CEC) is ultimately responsible for
ensuring standards are met, the facility manager’s input is vital. If the contractor is not meeting
the standards, contact the QAE.
12.4. Pest Management Services. Insect and rodent control services are provided by a
commercial contractor. For all requests call the Environmental Engineer Branch (934
MSG/CEV). Building occupants are required to control minor interior pest problems by
practicing proper sanitation and good housekeeping. Interior pest problems will be handled as
routine service calls.

                                 ENERGY CONSERVATION

13.1. Energy Conservation. Commanders and facility managers are ultimately responsible for
energy management within their assigned facilities. Reducing the amount of energy used by a
facility saves valuable tax dollars and resources. The facility manager’s role in energy
management includes, but is not limited to:
   13.1.1. Implementing energy saving programs, policies, and practices within their assigned
   facilities.
   13.1.2. Ensuring the thermostats are set at correct temperatures for the season.
   13.1.3. Ensuring all windows and doors are closed when heat or air conditioning are in use.
   13.1.4. Turning off lights that are not in use.
   13.1.5. Ensuring exterior lights are off during daylight hours.
   13.1.6. Turning off non-essential equipment during long periods of non-use.
   13.1.7. Checking the plumbing fixtures for leaks and problems.
   13.1.8. Watch for energy misuse and ways to save resources.
   13.1.9. AFCESA has a Building Manager Conservation Handbook (ETL 98-4) that can be
   downloaded from the Internet at http://www.afcesa.af.mil/Publications/ETLs/etl98-4.pdf .
13.2. Energy Management Control Systems. Some facilities have computerized electronic
climate controls that are monitored and controlled by CE. If you have a problem with heating or
the air conditioning within your facility contact the Service Call Section at 713-1918. If you
need your HVAC schedule modified notify the Engineering Flight Chief (934 MSG/CEC).
934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011                                                                    23

                           ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

14.1. Certain items are not to be disposed of in dumpsters. Unused chemical based items
must be turned in to the Hazardous Material Pharmacy (934 BOS/LGR). Waste chemicals are
turned in to the Civil Engineer Environmental Flight (934 MSG/CEV). Equipment and furniture
must be turned in to the Defense Reutilization Office (DMRO), call Base Supply for assistance.
14.2. Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM). Facility managers should be aware of ACM in
their assigned facilities. The Facility Manager can obtain an inventory list of locations where
each bulk sample was collected from the Civil Engineer Environmental Flight. Keep this
information inside your facility manager's continuity folder. Asbestos is only hazardous when
the fibers are released into the air. This is known as friable asbestos. Fibers must be inhaled or
ingested to become a problem. Never handle or disturb ACM. The area must be inspected at
least annually to ensure there is no damage to the ACM. Report any damage immediately;
submit a coordinated AF Form 332 to the Customer Service Section. Contact the 934 MSG/CEV
immediately if the ACM has been disturbed.
14.3. Hazardous Materials (HazMat).
   14.3.1. You should have knowledge of hazardous materials that may be presently in use or
   stored within the perimeters of your facility. Do not rinse spilled chemicals down drains or
   sewers. If there is a spill of any chemical that may be harmful or dangerous enough to cause
   a potential disaster, call 911 or 612/713-1911 from a cell phone, for fire response and the
   Environmental Flight.
   14.3.2. Practice good housekeeping and abide by all environmental laws, procedures,
   policies, and operating instruction while transporting, storing, and using hazardous materials.
14.4. Universal Waste (UW).
   14.4.1. Universal Waste (UW) is certain hazardous wastes that are called ―universal‖ wastes
   because almost every business generates them at some point. Universal wastes include used
   ―lamps‖ (i.e., light bulbs, such as fluorescent, high intensity discharge, neon, mercury vapor,
   high pressure sodium, and metal halide); used batteries (dry cell and lead-acid); and mercury-
   containing equipment (such as thermostats, barometers, manometers, gauges and switches).
   All types of UW have specific storage and labeling requirements, and must be shipped off
   base within one year of becoming waste.
   14.4.2. Containers for UW lamps/bulbs, batteries, and mercury-containing equipment are
   provided at the recycling center, Building 733, for the safe and secure accumulation of UW.
   Coordinate with the Environmental Flight (934 MSG/CEV) if any UW items will be
   accumulated at other facilities.
14.5. Recycling Program.
   14.5.1. All building personnel are responsible for their own waste reduction. Facility
   managers play a key role in making the process work. Recyclable materials may not be
   disposed of as refuse per AWI 32-7003. Most facilities have recycling bins/containers for
   paper and aluminum cans. The refuse/recycling containers should be emptied weekly.
24                                                         934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011


  14.5.2. Recycling Center. The recycling center, Building 733, is located north of the Civil
  Engineer Building, Building 744. Materials accepted for recycling include: scrap metal;
  waste electronics and appliances; used toner cartridges; and Universal Wastes (lamps/bulbs,
  batteries, and mercury-containing equipment). Contact the Solid Waste/Recycling Program
  Manager (934 MSG/CEV) to schedule a drop-off.
  14.5.3. Cardboard. There are many cardboard recycling bins located throughout the base.
  Cardboard needs to be free of packing materials such as Styrofoam and plastic wrap (normal
  packing tape at seams is okay). Boxes must be broken down.
  14.5.4. Scrap Metal. Many types of scrap metal are accepted at the Recycling Center. The
  scrap metal bin is for metal only. Items that contain other materials, such as a wooden table
  top, should not be placed in the scrap metal bin unless they have been disassembled and have
  non-metal components removed. Contact the Solid Waste/Recycling Program Manager (934
  MSG/CEV) to schedule a drop-off.
  14.5.5. Pallets and Other Wood. Unpainted/untreated/unstained wood, except pallets, can be
  placed in the wood dumpster at Building 744. Wooden pallets may be collected on the north
  side of Building 720. Do not put any metal in the woodbin. For any questions you may have
  contact the Solid Waste/Recycling Program Manager.

                           NATURAL DISASTER PREPARATION

15.1. There are many checklists on base that will be used before and after a
disaster. Those checklists will be executed by various organizations on Base. Here is a brief list
of tasks that will help you, as the facility manager, prepare your facility in the event of a natural
disaster.
15.2. Before a Disaster.
   15.2.1. Keep facility manager’s kit in well order and readily available; know what is in there
   and ensure everything is in good working order. Civil Engineering will provide you with
   your initial kit.
   15.2.2. Ensure the facility’s emergency back-up power is operable (if available).
   15.2.3. Police the areas around the facility and secure loose objects.
   15.2.4. Close and lock unneeded entrances.
   15.2.5. Secure and protect valuable equipment/material.
15.3. After a Disaster.
   15.3.1. Begin cleaning the building and surrounding areas.
   15.3.2. Secure broken windows and doors.
   15.3.3. Remove as much water from carpets as possible. Use a wet vacuum if available.

                                            Chapter 16

                                     SHELTER PROGRAM

16.1. There are three types of sheltering that could potentially occur on the base. They are
the Severe Weather Sheltering, Shelter-In-Place (covers hazardous materials or chemical,
biological, or radiological and nuclear (CBRN)) and Active Shooter Sheltering.
   16.1.1. Facility managers need to ―personalize‖ the sheltering checklists according to their
   facility. The sample checklist is located in the 934 AW Sheltering Program Guide created by
   the Emergency Management Program Office (934 MSG/CEX). Reference AFI 10-2501.
16.2. Severe Weather Sheltering.
   16.2.1. Severe weather in our area typically consists of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall,
   lightning, strong winds, hail, flash flooding, and tornadoes.
       16.2.1.1. For tornadoes employees will need to seek shelter inside a facility at the inner
       most portion of the facility on the lowest floor. The checklist will guide you through the
       steps needed.
16.3. Shelter-In-Place Sheltering.
   16.3.1. Sheltering-in-place is used if a migrating toxic vapor cloud could quickly overtake
   unprotected or evacuating citizens, or evacuation would create problems that would outweigh
   its usefulness. The amount of protection from a sheltering-in-place can vary depending
   mainly on how air tight the building is and the length of time the building is exposed to a
   hazardous plume.
   16.3.2. Shelter-In-Place Kit.
       16.3.2.1. Each manned facility needs to have a shelter-in-place kit. The Emergency
       Management Program Office (934 MSG/CEX) will provide each facility manager with
       the kit.
          16.3.2.1.1. The shelter-in-place kit contains, as a minimum, the following items.
              16.3.2.1.1.1. A storage bag for all items in the kit.
              16.3.2.1.1.2. A plastic sheet (pre-cut to all doors, vents and windows in the
              shelter area).
              16.3.2.1.1.3. Two duct tape rolls.
              16.3.2.1.1.4. A set of scissors.
              16.3.2.1.1.5. A flashlight with extra batteries.
              16.3.2.1.1.6. A notebook.
              16.3.2.1.1.7. Pens.
              16.3.2.1.1.8. Chemical lights.
              16.3.2.1.1.9. A 550 paracord, approximately 100 feet.
              16.3.2.1.1.10. A trash bag.

          16.3.2.1.2. The facility manager is responsible for replacing the batteries and the
          chemical lights. These items are to be replaced every three years. The units will be
          paying for these items with their unit funds.
          16.3.2.1.3. It is the facility manager decision if additional materials are kept in the
          bag.
16.4. Active Shooter Sheltering.
   16.4.1. An active shooter is an individual(s) actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill
   people in a confined and populated area, typically through the use of firearms.
   16.4.2. When an active shooter is in your vicinity quickly determine the most reasonable
   way to protect your own life. Fellow employees and visitors are likely to follow the lead of
   others.
   16.4.3. Evacuate.
       16.4.3.1. Have an escape route and plan in mind.
       16.4.3.2. Leave your belongings in mind.
       16.4.3.3. Keep your hands visible.
   16.4.4. Hide Out.
       16.4.4.1. Hide in an area out of the active shooter’s view.
       16.4.4.2. Block entry to your hiding place and lock the doors.
   16.4.5. Take Action.
       16.4.5.1. As a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger.
       16.4.5.2. Attempt to incapacitate the active shooter.
       16.4.5.3. Act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter.

                               FACILITY ALARM SYSTEMS

18.1. Fire Alarms.
   18.1.1. As per NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code, recurring fire alarm
   maintenance is mandatory. Audible devices (i.e., bells, sirens, and horns) will be tested by
   the Assistant Chief for Fire Prevention or their designated representative.
   18.1.2. Smoke detectors with audible devices may be found in Lodging and other such
   facilities. Occupants are required to test these detectors on a monthly basis. This can be
   accomplished by pushing the switch located on the face or the side of the smoke detector. A
   good test will be indicated when the detector sounds off. Detectors without switches do not

                                     FACILITY ABUSE

19.1. Management of facility abuse is a continuing item of interest throughout the Air
Force. The facility manager, Organization Commander, Base Civil Engineer, and Wing
Commander play an integral part in identifying, investigating and resolving any possible
instances of facility abuse. Facility abuse is defined as any damage or loss, which is due to
misconduct, or lack of safeguarding real property facilities and systems.
19.2. When the facility manager finds damage to a facility or installed equipment possibly
caused by abuse, they will report the incident to the Organization Commander for
investigation.
19.3. A Report of Survey will be initiated in accordance with current Air Force operating
procedures.
19.4. Repairs will not be made by the BOS (unless otherwise directed) until the damage is
investigated, fault is determined, and restitution is determined.
19.5. The Customer Service Section will maintain a suspense file in all abuse cases and
follow-up will be established to ensure the earliest closing of the case. The file will include
all information pertaining photos and diagrams, security police reports, and witness statements.

                                    BUILDING SECURITY

20.1. It is the facility managers' responsibility to ensure the facility is secured. Establish
procedures for all personnel to follow for securing their areas. Make sure all doors and windows
are in working condition and are able to be closed and locked properly. Establish a daily
checklist for securing your facility at the end of the duty day. Advise all personnel to lock their
offices, if necessary, especially ones that contain classified information and high valuable
equipment. Security Forces conduct regular security checks on base facilities. If a facility is
found unsecured, Security Forces will notify the facility manager to have them secure the facility
and an incident report will be forwarded to the unit commander.

                               LOCK AND KEY PROCEDURES

21.1. Key Control. The facility manager is responsible for safeguarding, controlling, and
issuing all basic entry and master keys for their facilities. The facility manager is not responsible
for keys that control specialized areas in a facility (i.e., special equipment, sensitive documents,
personnel tool kits, and furniture). The facility manager will establish a key control system and
have a key control log to document all actions involving keys for the facility.
   21.1.1. Out-processing personnel must turn in their keys.
   21.1.2. Keys are requested on an AF Form 332 submitted through the Customer Service
   Section; do not call the locksmith directly for key lock services. Facility managers are the
   only people authorized to make key requests. The locksmith will not duplicate keys to
   furniture, padlocks, specialized equipment and vehicles (anything not considered real
   property).
   21.1.3. Damage or loss of keys due to theft, misuse, or negligence must be documented on
   an AF Form 332. For repeated loss and replacement of keys, the individual’s Division Chief
   or Commander will be notified.
   21.1.4. Lodging residents are issued key cards by lodging personnel.
   21.1.5. When an organization vacates a facility or an assigned area within a facility, all keys
   must be accounted for and returned to CE.
21.2. Interior Electronic Locks. It is the responsibility of the facility manager to reprogram
electronic locks inside their facility. All internal electronic locks are the responsibility of the
facility manager and are not considered Real Property. Exterior building locks are considered
Real Property and are the responsibility of the BOS.
21.3. Security Safe Repair and Combination Changes. CE maintains real property installed
equipment only. Safes are not considered real property. It is the responsibility of each
organization to maintain its individual safes. The BOS has a GSA approved repair technician/
inspector for safes.

                                    DIGGING PERMITS

22.1. Local procedures are defined in 934 AWI 32-1002, BASE EXCAVATION
PERMIT. All excavation work inside and outside of any facility requires a properly completed
AF Form 103. This includes driving stakes and grounding rods. There is no minimum depth to
waive digging without a permit. Use of this form is mandatory to prevent accidents, loss of life,
property, and unscheduled utility outages. Contact or submit an AF Form 103 with the CE
Resources Officer (934 MSG/CER). Requesters must ensure that the work has been approved
for completion and the area has been clearly ―white lined‖ before requesting a permit. Work site
location (prints/ drawings) must be provided. Only work that will begin within ten days should
be submitted. Permits are only valid for ten days after approval. After ten days a new permit
must be processed or the expired one revalidated. Emergency requests will be processed by the
using agency requiring the work. Contractor required permits will be processed by the
respective CE representative. The contractor will maintain a copy of the permit on the job site.
The contractor must maintain all utility markings made by on-base and off-base agencies.

MEMORANDUM FOR FACILITY OCCUPANTS

FROM: 934 YOUR SQUADRON

SUBJECT: Facility Occupant Briefing

1. You and I, as a facility occupant and a facility manager, are responsible for the care, custody,
safeguarding, and protection from damage and loss of this facility and all real property and
installed equipment herein. In order for us to more effectively perform these caretaking duties
guidelines are needed.

2. I, as the facility manager, am the focal point for facility problems. Please coordinate all job
order requests through me so I can forward the requests to the BOS Customer Service Desk.
Unless an emergency, the BOS will not accept job order requests from anyone other than the
facility manager. With the reduced manpower, one focal point for maintenance request helps
them to better schedule maintenance work in facilities. Job order requests NOT made by me will
needlessly delay your request. As defined in 934 AWI 32-1001, Request for Accomplishment of
Work, below is the targeted BOS response times:

   a. Emergency: Failures of deficiencies which constitute an immediate danger or health
hazard to occupants, or which threaten damage to property. Target response is within 30
minutes.

   b. Urgent: Failures or deficiencies which do not immediately endanger the occupants or
threaten damage to property, but would soon inconvenience and affect the health and well-being
of facility occupants. Target is initial response within 24 hours and completion within 5-15
working days after receipt of materials.

    c. Routine: Work which does not meet criteria of emergency or urgent work. Target is
initial response within five days and completion within 30-60 working days after receipt of
materials.

3. BOS does not repair furniture, fix personal appliances, move furniture or build items
otherwise available through supply channels. For painting operations we are responsible for
removing personal items from ceilings, walls and floors. Additionally,

   a. Key Control: I maintain a log for the accountability of all keys to the facility. All keys
will be requested by me as the facility manager.

   b. Housekeeping Practices: Any deficiencies noted or service deviations required in service
contracts (refuse collection and custodial) should be reported to me. I will then report them to
934AWH 32-1004 27 JULY 2011                                                                    47


the BCE Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE). Again, under BCE’s PWS, the QAE cannot
accept notification/requests from anyone other than the facility manager.

   c. Fire and Safety Hazards: Immediately report to me any condition, act or procedure that
could result in a mishap causing injury to personnel or damage to property.

   d. Conservation of Utilities: Please ensure that the thermostat settings match the settings
indicated in the Base Energy Plan. Make sure equipment is turned off when not in use. Let me
know as soon as possible of any loss of integrity of facility systems; e.g., broken windows, leaky
faucets, steam leaks, burned out lights, and stopped up commodes or floor drains.

   e. Space Utilization: Please report to me any change in currently authorized space so that a
written request may be made to BCE for approval by the Facilities Board.

    f. Facility Security: Please make sure that doors and windows are secured when the facility
is unoccupied.

3.   If you have any questions please contact me at _________.                  In my absence,
______________________ is the alternate facility manager.
