Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management,
implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality. The instruction
provides details of the Air Force Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management Program
and explains how to assess, attain, and sustain compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA); other
federal, state, and local environmental regulations; Final Governing Standards (FGS) or the
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD); applicable international
agreements; and related Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force directives. Guidance on
indoor air quality is not addressed in this instruction; see AFI 48-145, Occupational and
Environmental Health Program, for the Bioenvironmental Engineer’s role in performing Health
Risk Assessments in facilities which may have poor indoor air quality. For DoD components at
installations outside the U.S., its territories and possessions (e.g. overseas), implement the
applicable portions of this AFI in accordance with (IAW) international agreements and the
applicable FGS or OEBGD. See AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, for additional
environmental guidance for overseas installations. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance and
procedures outlined in this instruction apply to all Air Force installations within the U.S., its
territories, and in foreign countries. Additionally, this AFI applies to the Air Force Reserves, the

                                            Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. It is Air Force policy to promote environmental stewardship in all activities to
ensure uninterrupted access to the air, land, and water assets needed to conduct the Air Force
mission. By focusing on the warfighter’s operational requirements while following the
regulatory strictures for sustaining resources and protecting human health, the Air Quality
Compliance and Resource Management Program (Air Quality Program) will sustain, restore, and
modernize natural infrastructure assets.
1.2. Mission. The mission of the Air Quality Program is to:
“Maintain mission support while effectively managing, sustaining and continually enhancing air
quality natural infrastructure resources through regulatory compliance, regulatory risk
minimization, professional competency, and pursuing emission reduction.”
1.3. Objective. The Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management Program identifies
essential Air Force requirements and actions to manage Air Force air resource assets in order to
maximize their military value and optimize their economic, ecologic, and community value,
while attaining and maintaining compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA; Title 42, United
States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 7401 et seq.) in addition to all applicable state and local air quality
regulations, or for overseas installations, the host-nation FGS, or OEBGD (per DoD 4715.5-G)
where no FGS exist, or any relevant obligations under a binding international agreement.
1.4. Concept. This instruction establishes a framework for all Commands to use in complying
with air quality requirements and AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality. All references to
Commands in this AFI include the Air National Guard Readiness Center and other agencies that
Headquarters, U.S. Air Force designates as “Major Command equivalent.” As needed,
Commands will provide administrative and technical support to ensure installations comply with
Air Force policies and regulatory requirements.
1.5. Environment,      Safety,     and     Occupational      Health   Management      System
(ESOHMS). Consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13423, Strengthening Federal
Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, DoDI 4715.17, Environmental
Management System, and AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, Air Force installations are
directed to have an EMS to sustain, restore, and modernize natural and built infrastructure to
support mission capability, as part of a larger undertaking toward an Air Force ESOHMS. All
Air Force installations and facilities will comply with E.O. 13423 and Air Force ESOHMS
guidance. The Air Quality Program, as a part of the overall ESOHMS, seeks to appropriately
plan, implement and operate, check, and review, as necessary, the management of air resources
to ensure mission completion. This AFI is organized to align with that cycle of continual
improvement in progressive chapters for Planning, Implementation and Operation, Checking and
Corrective Action, and Management Review (chapters 3 through 6).

   emission reductions (see Section 3.7, Utilizing Air Emission Reduction Credits in Planning
   and Attachment 3 for additional information). (T-1)
   3.2.2. Further information on the pollution prevention environmental management hierarchy,
   requirements and guidelines are outlined in the Pollution Prevention section of AFI 32-7001.
3.3. Emissions Control Technology (applicable to all installations under the regulatory
oversight of the EPA). Installations will perform value engineering for each project requiring
specification or installation of equipment for control of regulated air pollutants to ensure that the
proposed control technology meets air quality compliance requirements, does not create an
unacceptable health or safety risk, and is cost effective to the extent allowed by law. (T-0)
3.3.1. New major sources located in areas designated as attaining NAAQS require
utilization of Best Available Control Technology (BACT). Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) Standards are technology-based air emission standards established to
reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs); the standards for smaller (area) sources are
called Generally Available Control Technology (GACT). Lowest Achievable Emission Rate
(LAER) is required on new or modified major sources in nonattainment areas. Reasonably
Available Control Technology (RACT) is required for existing sources in nonattainment areas,
and in most cases, is less stringent than New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) or BACT.
3.4. Conformity Rule Planning (applicable to all installations under the regulatory
oversight of the EPA). Conformity Rules (40 CFR Part 93, Subpart B, and any applicable
state/tribal regulations promulgated per 40 CFR § 51.851) apply only to federal actions in
nonattainment and maintenance areas. Installations will ensure all Conformity Rule planning is
accomplished IAW the current Air Force Air Quality EIAP Guide maintained by AFCEC/CZ,
and meets the requirements of the CAA, Section 176(c)(1) and 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart A, for
federal highway and transit actions, or 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart B, for all other actions. (T-0)
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     17


   3.4.1. Before implementing any federal action in an air quality nonattainment or
   maintenance area, the installation or other proponent (with assistance from AFCEC/CZ,
   ANG, and AFRC) shall complete a General Conformity applicability analysis per 40 CFR §§
   93.153(b) and (c), and a General Conformity determination per 40 CFR § 93.154 (if
   applicable), to ensure the action does not interfere with a state’s plan to attain and maintain
   the NAAQSs (known as State Implementation Plans or SIPs). IAW CAA, Section 176(c),
   any action that negatively affects the implementation or goals of the SIP is not allowed to
   proceed. All EIAP documents must address applicable conformity requirements and the
   status of compliance. Conformity applicability analyses and determinations are developed in
   parallel with EIAP documents, but are separate and distinct requirements and should be
   documented separately. To increase the utility of a conformity determination in performing
   the EIAP, the conformity determination should be completed prior to the completion of the
   EIAP so as to allow incorporation of the information from the conformity determination into
   the EIAP decision process. (T-0)
   3.4.2. As an initial part of the planning process, the proponent (with assistance from the
   AFCEC/CZ, ANG, and AFRC) shall perform a General Conformity Applicability Analysis
   using the Air Conformity Applicability Model (ACAM) or other A4C approved automated
   air quality impact assessment tool . If ACAM (or other approved tool) determines General
   Conformity is applicable, a conformity determination must be performed and approved
   before the EIAP process is completed. (T-0)
       3.4.2.1. Proponents shall prepare required conformity documents in coordination with
       the installation and AFCEC/CZs.           AFCEC/CZ will transmit draft conformity
       determinations to HQ USAF/A4C for higher HQ coordination and SAF/IEE approval,
       prior to release for public review. (T-0)
   3.4.2.2. Currently, SAF/IEE is the lowest level of signature authority designated for a
   General Conformity determination.
3.5. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) Planning (applicable to all
installations under the regulatory oversight of the EPA). NEPA requires the responsible
federal official to consult with and obtain the comments of any federal agency that has
jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact. Proponents/
installations/MAJCOMs will ensure all NEPA/EIAP planning is accomplished IAW 32 CFR Part
989 and 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508, the most current Air Force Air Quality EIAP Guide issued by
AFCEC/CZ, and must meet the requirements of the CAA Section 176(c), 32 CFR Part 989, and
40 CFR Parts 1500-1508. (T-0)
   3.5.1. EIAP Air Quality Planning. Before implementing any federal action (regardless of the
   air quality attainment status) the proponent (with assistance from the AFCEC/CZ ) shall
   complete an Air Quality Impacts Analysis (AQIA) that must analyze and disclose all of the
   ambient air impacts and any permit requirements involving any attainment criteria pollutant
   emissions, HAP emissions, and emissions of any other regulated pollutants under the CAA,
   such as ozone depleting substances (ODS), that will result from the proposed action. The
   AQIA must include an initial screening of the net change in emissions using the ACAM (or
   other approved tool). (T-0)
   3.5.2. Conformity Rules: According to 32 CFR § 989.30, all EIAP documents must address
   the CAA Conformity Rule requirements. Proponents must ensure a General Conformity
 18                                                          AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014


   applicability analysis and a General Conformity determination (if applicable), is completed
   prior to the completion of the EIAP in order to allow incorporation of the information into
   the EIAP and allow for the agency and public review. Where required, conformity
   determinations must be completed simultaneously with EIAP decision documents, otherwise
   the action will be delayed. (T-0)
3.6. Preconstruction New Source Review (NSR) (applicable to all installations under the
regulatory oversight of the EPA). In the early planning phase for any construction (i.e.,
construction, renovation, or major equipment addition/modification) project, the proponent of a
proposed construction project shall consult with the Installation/Base Civil Engineer -
Environmental Element on any NSR requirements. The Installation/Base Civil Engineer -
Environmental Element shall evaluate the proposed project based on the PTE IAW the
applicable local, state, and/or federal rules that make up the appropriate nonattainment NSR or
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the regulations contained in 40
CFR §51.165, §51.166, §52.21, §52.24, and/or 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S. (T-0)
   3.6.1. There are three types of permits that can be issued under NSR for either new or
   modified sources:
       3.6.1.1. Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Permits apply to new major
       sources or major modifications at existing sources in areas designated attainment or
       unclassifiable for a particular NAAQS (See local, state, and/or federal program rules
       promulgated under 40 CFR §§ 51.166 and/or 52.21). For specific source categories a new
       major source has a PTE of 100 tons per year or more, otherwise the threshold is set at 250
       tons per year. Thresholds for modifications at existing major sources vary according to
       the regulated pollutant. For example, the significance threshold for Ozone depleting
       substances (ODSs) at existing major sources is zero, while the significance threshold for
       Nitrous Oxides (NOx) is 40 tons/year. Application of BACT is required to control
       emissions.
       3.6.1.2. Nonattainment NSR Permits apply to new major sources or major modifications
       to existing sources in areas designated nonattainment or maintenance for the NAAQS as
       well as in attainment areas within an Ozone Transport Region (See local, state, and/or
       federal program rules promulgated under 40 CFR §§ 51.165 and 52.24 and/or 40 CFR
       Part 51, Appendix S). Thresholds for new major sources and major modifications vary
       from 10 tons/year to 100 tons/year, depending on the area’s classification or severity of
       nonattainment. Application of the LAER technology is required to control emissions.
       3.6.1.3. Minor NSR Permits apply to stationary sources that do not require PSD or
       Nonattainment NSR permits. They may contain enforceable conditions that limit
       emissions or operating conditions in order to create “synthetic minor” sources that are not
       subject to PSD or nonattainment NSR requirements.
   3.6.2. IAW 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I, owners of any new major stationary sources of air
   pollution or owners making any major modifications to existing major stationary sources are
   required to obtain a permit before commencing construction. (T-0)
3.7. Utilizing Air Emission Reduction Credits in Planning (applicable to all installations
under the regulatory oversight of the EPA). The Installation/Base Civil Engineer -
Environmental Element, with assistance from AFCEC/CZ, will pursue EPA and/or the state
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  19


economic incentive programs (EIPs) to control/reduce air emissions to acquire Emission
Reduction Credits (ERCs) whenever possible. All ERCs obtained shall be reported to
AFCEC/CZ for tracking. More detailed information on Air Force generation, use and
disposition of ERCs is provided in Attachment 2. (T-0)
3.8. Planning for Military-Unique Sources (applicable to all installations, including
overseas). Where military-unique sources exist, obtain the most recent information on EPA,
DoD, and Air Force policy and guidelines regarding air resource management strategies for these
sources. Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental Elemental will report any new
military-unique sources they encounter to AFCEC/CZ for evaluation and specific guidance. (T-
1)
3.9. Risk Management Planning (applicable to all installations under the regulatory
oversight of the EPA). Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental Element will develop
a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for stationary sources that have more than a threshold quantity
of regulated hazardous or extremely hazardous substance under 40 C.F.R. Part 68 or applicable
state law. All stationary sources are subject to a “general duty” to plan for, prevent, and
minimize the consequences of any accidental releases of extremely hazardous chemicals under §
112(r)(1) of the CAA. (T-0)
3.10. Episode Planning (applicable to all installations, including overseas). Where required
under 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart H, Prevention of Air Pollution Emergency Episodes, the
Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental Element must develop and implement a
contingency plan for air pollution emergency episodes which identifies all actions that can
reasonably be taken without compromising essential services and mission responsibilities. (T-0)
3.11. Emergency Planning (applicable to all installations, including overseas). Follow AFI
10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, for
emergency planning and response to major accidents; natural disasters; terrorist use of weapons
of mass destruction; and nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional warfare.

                                           Chapter 4

                         IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

4.1. General Program Guidelines. In order to assure uninterrupted mission accomplishment at
an installation, an Air Quality Program governing the operation of all stationary and mobile
sources of air pollution must be developed and implemented at all Air Force installations to
assess, attain, and maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local air quality
regulations and permits. Implementation and operation activities will be carried out by
Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental Element with direct operational oversight by
the AFCEC. At a minimum, the program will include establishing robust recordkeeping,
reporting, and monitoring processes; maintaining and actively using emissions inventories; and
identification and documentation of trivial, de minimis, and otherwise insignificant or exempt
sources.
4.2. Air Emissions Inventory (AEI). The Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental
Element must prepare and periodically update an AEI, using APIMS, of all installation stationary
sources (stationary source AEI) and Air Force owned or operated mobile sources (mobile source
AEI) IAW the current Air Force air emissions inventory guidance and applicable state or local
requirements promulgated per 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart A, Air Emissions Reporting
Requirements. (T-0)
   4.2.1. Comprehensive AEIs (i.e., includes both permitted and non-permitted sources) will be
   performed at the frequency as required by federal, state and local regulations. Overseas
   installations shall conduct AEIs IAW Foreign Governing Standards and/or Host Nation
   agreements. At a minimum, APIMS must be annually reviewed/validated as current (i.e.,
   sources and consumption data is representative of the current base conditions) and be
   updated (i.e., a comprehensive review of all sources and their consumption data) at least
   every three years (five years for overseas and remotely located facilities) to accurately reflect
   current emissions.
   4.2.2. Stationary source AEIs shall include all criteria pollutants, HAPs, and GHGs and
   reflect the installation’s current actual and PTE emissions. Annual regulatory emissions
   reports, a subset of the comprehensive AEI, will be provided to federal, state and local
   (including Metropolitan Planning Organization or other regional) regulatory agencies as
   required. Mandatory pollutant emissions reporting will be provided to AFCEC/CZ as part of
   the annual data call. GHG reporting mandated by Executive Order (E.O.) 13514, Federal
   Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, will be accomplished at
   the HAF level.
   4.2.3. GHG reporting mandated by Title 40 CFR Part 98, Mandatory Reporting of
   Greenhouse Gases, shall be accomplished by the affected installations and other installations
   within 10% of the GHG reporting threshold. Installation AEI data stored in APIMS are
   available for use as needed by AFCEC and higher headquarters.
4.3. Title V and State Operating Permits (applicable to all installations under the
regulatory oversight of the EPA, state, or local air pollution control authorities). Facilities
formally designated as a major source must obtain a Title V Operating Permit. (T-0)
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    21


   4.3.1. Each time a facility’s PTE is reestablished, the Installation/Base Civil Engineer -
   Environmental Element must make a major source determination by comparing the facility’s
   PTE against the applicable criteria pollutant and/or HAP major source thresholds under 40
   CFR Part 70 and 40 CFR 71. (T-0)
   4.3.2. If the determination concludes the facility’s PTE is equal to or greater than the
   applicable criteria pollutant and/or HAP thresholds. the Installation/Base Civil Engineer -
   Environmental Element shall consult with AFCEC/CZ (or ANG and AFRC for Guard and
   Reserve units respectively) for review and validation of the determination. Unless the
   permitting authority takes specific exception, the PTE and determination must have been
   performed IAW the PTE guidance within the current Air Force air emissions guidance and
   the EPA guidance memorandum, Major Source Determinations for Military Installations
   under the Air Toxics, New Source Review, and Title V Operating Permit Programs of the
   Clean Air Act, John Seitz, 2 August 96. (T-0)
   4.3.3. If an installation can bring itself under major source emission thresholds by accepting
   self-imposed federally enforceable limits on PTE without negatively impacting the mission,
   the installation will consider the pros and cons of applying for a synthetic minor permit
   instead of a Title V operating permit. Facilities must ensure that inventories are current in
   order to maintain non-Title V permit status. 40 CFR § 70.5(a)(1)(i) (or 40 CFR §
   71.5(a)(1)(i) requires installations, that become subject to Title V permits, to file an
   application within one year of becoming a Title V source. States are authorized to establish a
   shorter time period for this requirement. (T-0)
   4.3.4. Installations shall forward any major source or synthetic minor determination to
   AFCEC/CZ for final review/validation (Guard and Reserve units will forward through the
   ANG and AFRC respectively). Upon final validation by AFCEC/CZ, installations (with
   AFCEC/CZ assistance), or the ANG and AFRC for Guard and Reserve units respectively, are
   responsible for obtaining the appropriate permits. (T-1)
4.4. Mobile Sources (applicable to all installations, including overseas). The Base Civil
Engineer - Environmental Element, in concert with the installation vehicle maintenance shop
(A4L Logistics Readiness) shall ensure that motorized Air Force vehicles and portable
equipment are operated, refueled, and maintained IAW all applicable federal, state and local
requirements. (T-0)
   4.4.1. Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) (applicable to all installations located in
   areas where an EPA SIP approved I/M program is in effect). Installations must ensure that
   all Air Force fleet vehicles and privately owned vehicles (POVs) operated on the installation
   comply with non-discriminatory motor vehicle I/M programs that apply under §118 of the
   CAA.
       4.4.1.1. Installation Commanders must ensure, if CAA §118 is applicable to their
       installation, that employee owned vehicles are in compliance with the installation I/M
       Program requirements. Under the installation I/M Program, Federal employees operating
       POVs on the installation will be required (regardless of where the employee’s vehicle is
       registered) to self-certify (using the Employee-Certification And Reporting System,
       ECARS) their compliance status with the local area I/M requirements.
22                                                          AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014


     4.4.1.2. For all Air Force facilities located in an area with an applicable vehicle I/M
     program, commanders are required by 42 U.S.C. § 7418(d) to ensure that employees
     provide proof of compliance with the local (or an equivalent) I/M program for vehicles
     that the employees operate on the affected facility.
     4.4.1.3. All employees assigned to the affected facility for more than 60 days shall
     certify compliance (and periodically recertify compliance) by digitally signing the Air
     Force Form 4434, available in the ECARS module of APIMS. The Air Force Form 4434
     shall be maintained on the ECARS server while the employee is assigned to the
     installation, or for the duration of the registration period, whichever is shorter. Hard copy
     Air Force Form 4434 may be used in lieu of the electronic ECARS in situations where
     government employees are not identified in the Air Force Personnel System, such as non-
     Air Force employees on an Air Force hosted installation (e.g., DCMA employees).
     4.4.1.4. All employee vehicle operators shall maintain documentation of compliance
     with the applicable I/M program requirements while operating their vehicle on the
     affected facility, and supply such documentation as required by the facility.
     4.4.1.5. When an Air Force facility is located in an area that becomes subject to an
     applicable I/M program, the Installation Commander shall adopt a program which
     complies with that program. Generally, the base program should be adopted within 90
     days of the effective date of the applicable I/M program.
  4.4.2. Clean Fuel and Vapor Recovery (wherever applicable). Employees operating Air
  Force vehicles and equipment in areas subject to EPA or California clean, reformulated,
  oxygenated or ultra-low sulfur fuel requirements, and Stage II vapor recovery programs,
  must ensure that compliant fuels and equipment are used during vehicle refueling operations,
  and that fuel pumps are labeled IAW the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 80.570. (T-0)
  4.4.3. E. O. 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation
  Management (applicable to all installations, including overseas). Installations should ensure
  use of sustainable environmental, energy and transportation practices that will assist the Air
  Force in meeting the federal goals of E.O. 13423 through the implementation or expansion of
  initiatives such as carpooling, use of public transportation, trip reduction techniques, and
  wider use of alternative fuels in fleet vehicles. AFCEC and VEMSO (for vehicle fleet
  management and transportation procedures/techniques) will assist installations provide
  centralized oversight, methodology, and reporting on progress towards E.O. goals. (T-1)
  4.4.4. E. O. 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic
  Performance (applicable to all installations, including overseas). Installations should take
  measures to reduce mobile source emissions as a means of achieving GHG goals established
  by the Air Force Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP) goals under EO 13514.
  Such measures may include: reducing vehicle fleet petroleum use by 30% through fiscal year
  2020, increasing the use of alternative fuels, reducing employee business travel, and reducing
  employee commuting by teleworking. For vehicle fleet management and transportation,
  VEMSO is the responsible agency to measure, report, manage, and reduce GHG emissions
  toward agency defined targets. (T-2)

                        CHECKING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

5.1. General Program Guidelines (applicable to all installations, including overseas). The
effectiveness of the Air Quality Program is measured by the latest metrics established by the
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations & Environment) and presented by HQ
USAF/A4C.
5.2. Environment Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP). Use the
ECAMP as a tool for assessing and monitoring Air Force compliance, and identifying and
prioritizing recommended corrective actions as necessary. Installations will conduct compliance
and EMS conformance assessments, and track preventative/corrective actions IAW AFI 90-201,
AFI 32-7001, and other AFCEC/CZ guidance.
5.3. Data Management. The Air Force-approved information system for air quality is APIMS,
which provides a standardized, integrated tool and methodology to track, manage, and report all
data related to the Air Quality Program. The Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental
Element will ensure the air quality compliance and resource management data are accurately
maintained in APIMS in a timely manner. (T-1)
5.4. Payment of Fines and Penalties (applicable only to installations under the regulatory
oversight of the EPA). Except for in a handful of jurisdictions where payment of state or local
punitive CAA penalties is required as a matter of law, the authority to pay such penalties
involves a policy decision that has not been delegated below the SAF/IEE level. The installation
SJA, after coordinating with MAJCOM (or ANG and AFRC in the case of Guard and Reserve
installations) and appropriate Regional Counsel, and gaining authority from AFLOA/JACE and
SAF/IEE as applicable, will authorize installation personnel to commence any negotiations with
state or local regulators concerning a CAA enforcement action or other CAA compliance matter.
The installation SJA will remain informed or involved in all significant aspects of the
negotiations and will continue to coordinate with MAJCOM and appropriate Regional Counsel.
Settlement of EAs or local cases and/or payment of fines or penalties, will follow the process
IAW AFI 32-7047, Environmental Compliance, Release, and Inspections Reporting.
5.5. Training and Education. Based on Air Force-wide tracking and trend analysis,
AFCEC/CZ shall develop air quality compliance and resource management education and
training to include pursuing non-traditional classroom education and training methodologies
(e.g., correspondence and webinar training) to reduce cost. At a minimum the following specific
critical air quality topics must be developed and maintained (T-1):
   5.5.1. AEI and PTE training, to include the use of APIMS and estimating procedures for

                                 MANAGEMENT REVIEW

6.1. Regulatory Agency Noncompliance Actions. AFCEC/CZ and the Installation/Base Civil
Engineer - Environmental Element will review management action plans that ensure outstanding
OEAs are resolved within the required time frames. Additionally, AFCEC/CZ working with the
base environmental function will review the response to regulatory agency inspection findings to
ensure process owners take timely corrective actions and to ensure reporting timelines.
6.2. Automated Civil Engineer System - Program Management (ACES-PM). Installations
and AFCEC/CZ use the ACES-PM or other HQ USAF/A4C approved system to plan, program,
and budget requirements for air quality compliance and resource management. (T-1) It is the Air
Force’s preference to pursue/program a feasible pollution prevention solution in order to meet a
compliance requirement (ref: AFI 32-7001).
6.3. Environment, Safety and Occupational Health Councils (applicable to AFCEC/CZ
and all installations, including overseas). Installation Environment, Safety, and Occupational
Health Councils (ESOHCs) are the appropriate forum for coordinating Air Quality Program
corrective actions that require cross-functional review, deliberation, and approval. ESOHCs also
conduct management reviews IAW AFI 32-7001 to ensure environmental goals and permit
conditions are being met, to include air planning goals, air permits, emission source
recordkeeping procedures and compliance self-assessment findings.. The ESOHC also ensures
program goals are appropriate and produce actions to fully support current and future mission
requirements with adequate air assets. See AFI 90-801, Environment, Safety, and Occupational

                                RECORDS MANAGEMENT

7.1. Records Management. APIMS, the Air Force-approved Information System, provides a
standardized, integrated tool and methodology for tracking, managing, and reporting air quality
data. The Installation/Base Civil Engineer - Environmental Element will ensure the following:
   7.1.1. Air quality compliance and resource management data are accurately maintained in
   APIMS in a timely manner, including data related to the installation air emission inventory,
   operating permits, and other pertinent air resource management information to ensure full
   mission support through effective management of natural infrastructure assets. (T-1)
   7.1.2. The ECARS automated system shall be used to document compliance with vehicle
   I/M requirements under §118 of the CAA. ECARS is a module of the APIMS (as described
   in paragraph 4.4.1.3). The ECARS system sends email certification instructions and
   reminders to employees, collects the minimum personal information required to document
   employee compliance on Air Force Form 4434 IAW the Privacy Act Statement (notice
   issued by EPA on 1 Oct 2001 at 66 Fed. Reg. 49955), prepares automated reports on
   employee compliance, and archives the digitally signed employee certification forms on a
   secure server.
   7.1.3. All General Conformity Applicability Analysis (as described in paragraph 3.4.2) shall
   be performed using the ACAM (or other HQ USAF/A4C approved automated air quality
   impact assessment tool) and the resulting reports and data files shall be maintained in the
   approved environmental information system.

Terms
Air Conformity Applicability Model (ACAM)—An Air Force modeling program for
performing General Conformity Applicability Analysis (as described in paragraph 2.4.2) for all
federal actions in an air quality nonattainment or maintenance area with the potential for impact
(positive or negative).
Air Pollutant—Any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical,
chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material, special nuclear material and
byproduct material) substances or matter which emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.
Such term includes any precursors to the formation of any air pollutant, to the extent the
Administrator has identified such precursor or precursors for the particular purpose for which the
term “air pollutant” is used.
Air Program Information Management System (APIMS)—The Air Force information system
for air quality permit management, air emission inventory, vehicle inspection & maintenance
certification, and air emission reporting.
Air Quality Standards—As prescribed by regulations, the level of pollutants that may not be
exceeded during a specific time in a defined area.
Attainment Area—An area considered to have air quality as good as or better than the NAAQS
as defined in the CAA. An area may be an attainment area for one pollutant and a nonattainment
area for others.
Conformity—Conformity is the multi-step process used to determine and document whether a
proposed federal action meets the requirements of the General Conformity rule. There are two
main components to the overall process: an applicability analysis to determine whether a
conformity determination is required and, if it is, a Conformity determination to determine
whether the action conforms to the SIP.
Criteria Pollutant—Air pollutants for which NAAQS have been established. Criteria pollutants
include nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3),
particulate matter (PM-10 & PM2.5) and lead (Pb).
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The environmental impact analysis process
provides procedures for environmental impact analysis both within the United States and abroad.
EIAP deals primarily with environmental impact analysis under the authority of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The EIAP procedures are essential to achieve and
maintain compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations
for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA. To comply with NEPA and complete
the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and the EIAP Regulations must be used together.
Enforcement Actions, Spills, and Inspections (EASI)— An Air Force-wide data collection and
reporting system that houses the reporting modules for EAs, Spills (SIRIS), and Inspections.
Emission—An emission is any release into the atmosphere of an air pollutant as defined in the
CAA Amendments of 1990 Section 302 (g). Emissions can be released from boilers, generators,
motor vehicles and air fleet, degreasing operations, woodworking and welding, depainting and
surface coating operations, etc.
Emissions Inventory—A detailed listing, by source and type, of the quantity of air pollutants
emitted into the atmosphere.
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  33


Emission Reduction Credit (ERC)—Emission reduction credits are a novel form of property
for emissions trading purposes. ERCs only exist when created IAW a system to establish, bank,
and trade the ERCs under a state or local (including MPO or other regional) implementation
plan.
Employee-Vehicle Certification and Reporting System (ECARS)—An automated system, a
module of the APIMS, used by § 118 of the CAA affected facilities to document compliance
with requirements under § 118 of the CAA.
Enforcement Action—Actions taken by regulators to obtain compliance with environmental
laws, rules, regulations, or agreements and/or obtain penalties for violations.
Government-owned, contractor operated (GOCO)—A facility that is owned by the
Government and operated under contract by a non-government, private firm.
Hazardous Air Pollutants—Those substances listed by EPA or states that have been identified
as serious threats to human health or the environment.
Installation Commander—The host unit commander who discharges the duties directed by
United States statutes or Air Force directives.
Maintenance Area—Any geographic region of the United States designated as attainment
subject to the requirement to develop a maintenance plan under Section 175A of the CAA, as
amended.
Major Stationary Source & Major Emitting Facility—Except as otherwise expressly
provided, both terms mean sources that emit 100 tons per year or more of any air pollutant. The
exceptions are:
1) 250 tons per year of any regulated pollutant from any source in an attainment area other
than one of the twenty—eight listed sources in 42 U.S.C. Section 7479;
2) 50 tons per year/ 25 tons per year/ 10 tons per year of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) or
NOx in serious, severe, and extreme O3 nonattainment areas, respectively;
3) Five (5) tons per year of VOCs or NOx in moderate O3 nonattainment areas if state opted out
of the 15% reduction provision of 42 U.S.C. Section 7511a(b)(1);
4) 50 tons per year of VOCs for any source within an Ozone Transport Region (OTR) per 42
U.S.C. Section 7511c(b)(2), except such sources in severe or extreme nonattainment areas within
the OTR;
5) 50 tons per year of CO in serious CO nonattainment areas;
6) 70 tons per year of PM whose aerodynamic diameter is less than or equal to 10 microns
(PM10) in nonattainment areas; or
7) 10 tons per year of any single HAP or 25 tons per year of all HAPs in the aggregate.
Mobile Source—Any non-stationary source of air pollution, such as cars, trucks, buses, planes,
trains, motorcycles, and gasoline-powered lawn mowers. Mobile sources are typically classified
as being either “on-road” or “non-road” in nature. Examples of on-road sources include cars,
trucks, and buses; while examples of non-road sources include construction equipment, aircraft,
aircraft ground support equipment, and other tactical equipment used in combat or combat
support operations.

Monitoring—Periodic or continuous surveillance or testing to determine the level of compliance
with statutory requirements and/or pollutant levels in various media or in humans, animals, and
other living things.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)—Standards established by the EPA for
six criteria air pollutants that are commonly found in ambient air throughout the country. Two
types of NAAQS have been established. Primary standards set limits to protect public health,
while secondary standards set limits to protect public welfare. Areas with good air quality are
referred to as being in “attainment” with the NAAQS, while areas with poor air quality are
referred to as being “nonattainment” with the NAAQS.
New Source—Any stationary source that is built or modified after publication of final or
proposed regulations that prescribe a standard of performance intended to apply to that type of
emission source.
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)—Uniform national air emission standards
established by EPA that limit the amount of pollution allowed from new or existing sources that
have been modified. NSPS are found in 40 C.F.R. Part 60.
Nonattainment Area—Geographic area with measured air quality that does not meet one or
more of the NAAQS for the criteria pollutants designated through the CAA.
Personal Property—Any property including military equipment, but excluding real property,
consumable items, component parts of a higher assembly, or items that lose their individual
identity through use.
Potential to Emit (PTE)—The maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air
pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the
capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and
restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or
processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the EPA.
Precursors of a Criteria Pollutant—Precursors are those pollutants that contribute to the
formation of a criteria pollutant. For O3, precursors are NOx (unless an area is exempted from
NOx requirements under the CAA, Section 182(f)), and VOCs; and for PM10, precursors are
those pollutants described in the applicable nonattainment area SIP as significant contributors to
PM10 levels. For PM2.5, the scientifically recognized precursors are ammonia, SO2, NOx, and
VOCs per EPA’s proposed implementation rule at 70 Federal Register 65983 (November 1,
2005). As of this writing it is uncertain which, if any, of these will actually be regulated as
precursors for purposes of NSR, General Conformity, or other SIP rules.
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)—The EPA program in which federal and/or
state permits restrict emissions for new or modified sources in places where air quality is already
better than required to meet the NAAQS.
Responsible Official—The installation commander for purposes of signing Title V Operating
Permit applications, amendments, supplements, or corrections and for certifying Title V
Operating Permit deviation reports, monitoring reports, compliance certifications, or any other
document that requires certification by a “Responsible Official” under the applicable regulations.
The responsibility to certify the federal agency Responsible Official may not be delegated.
Section 70.2 of the Title V Operating Permit regulations (40 CFR Part 70) defines a Responsible
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       35


Official as follows: “For a municipality, State, Federal, or other public agency: either a principal
executive officer or ranking elected official. For the purposes of this part, a principal executive
of a Federal agency includes the chief executive officer having responsibility for the overall
operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., a Regional Administrator of EPA).”
Risk Management—The process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory
responses to risk and selecting among them. The selection process requires consideration of
impact to human health and the environment, legal, economic, military and social factors.
Risk Management Plan (RMP)—A plan that documents the actions a facility that stores,
transports or uses regulated hazardous substances at levels exceeding established thresholds will
take to prevent and mitigate their accidental release, and reduce the severity of releases that do
occur. RMP requirements are found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.
Sovereign Immunity—The legal principal that the federal government cannot be subjected to
state penalties or judgments of state courts except where Congress has expressly waived such
immunity in the CAA or other statute.
State Implementation Plans (SIPs)—SIPs are state plans for the establishment, regulation, and
enforcement of air pollution standards. SIPs approved by the EPA are federally enforceable.
Stationary Source—A fixed, non-moving producer of pollution, such as power plants and other
facilities using industrial combustion processes, paint spray booths, fuel storage tanks, and
solvent cleaning facilities.
Synthetic Minor—A facility or stationary source that has voluntarily limited its PTE by means
of a federally enforceable order, rule, or permit condition to ensure its emissions do not exceed
major source thresholds.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)—Any organic compound that participates in
atmospheric photochemical reactions, except for those designated by EPA as having negligible
photochemical reactivity.

                           AIR EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS

A2.1. Air Emission Reduction Credits. The CAA allows the EPA and the states to develop
economic incentive programs to control and reduce air emissions. Such programs allow sources
to “generate”, “buy”, “sell”, “bank”, or “trade” emissions reduction credits (ERCs). ERCs are
authorized and created by appropriate state or local authorities, and will vary from location to
location pursuant to applicable EPA rules. ERC programs need to be approved by EPA in a
State Implementation Plan (SIP) to become effective. Credits earned by any source that
permanently reduces emissions beyond its reduction requirements can be traded to another
source that could use such credits, in lieu of on-site reductions, to meet its reduction obligations.
ERCs may also be banked for future use as offsets for nonattainment area NSR or General
Conformity determinations. ERCs are treated as federal personal property and disposed of
according to the appropriate federal property disposal regulations. Flying operations shall not be
reduced for the sole purpose of obtaining ERCs; however, installations should ensure that
emissions from aircraft flying operations are accounted for in comprehensive emissions
inventories and memorialized in any applicable SIP emissions budget for the installation.
A2.2. Emission Reduction Credit Identification. ERCs can be created as a result of
operational changes or installation closure. They can be obtained by removing pollutant-emitting
equipment from service or reducing emissions from equipment, if the applicable air quality
district allows. Planning for ERC utilization should include a determination of the applicable
requirements for generation as soon as possible to avoid inadvertent loss of ERCs due to missed
requirements. For example, some local rules require submission of an application for ERCs
along with supporting documentation prior to any shutdown of the emissions source while other
local rules require submission of the application within 90 days of permanent shutdown. In
addition, some states may have laws that expressly apply to various aspects of ERC generation
and disposition involving military base closures and realignments, such as the Cannella Bill in
California, AB 3204 (1994), codified at Health and Safety Code Section 40709.7.
A2.3. Emission Reduction Credit Inventory and Classification. Within one year, or as early
as possible, prior to the departure of the active mission from a currently announced installation
closure or realignment (immediately at installations where the active mission has departed or
equipment emitting air emissions are discontinued, or within six months of an installation closure
announcement for future closures), the base environmental function will complete an inventory
of all existing/potential sources of ERCs and associated emissions, and have a legal review
prepared summarizing the applicable air quality district regulations on ERCs. Copies of the
applicable ERC regulation will be included when facility ERCs are identified and any limitations
on the disposition of the ERCs will be noted in the legal review. Such limitations may include
prohibitions on the use of ERCs at closing facilities and if there are any restrictions on the
leasing of ERCs. Forward the inventory, legal review, and appropriate regulations governing the
use of these ERCs to the appropriate AFCEC Regulatory/Legislative Support Branch. The ERCs
will be initially classified as “related personal property ERCs”, “operational needs requirement
ERCs”, or “personal property ERCs” on the inventory. AFCEC/CZ will circulate the inventory
to other MAJCOMs and installations in the same air quality district that will identify ERCs they
might need. AFCEC/CZ will then validate the list and forward it with comments back to the
appropriate MAJCOM and AFCEC/CZ. AFCEC/CZ, in concert with the appropriate MAJCOM,
AFI32-7040 4 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     37


will review/validate the ERCs/categories, coordinate with HQ USAF/A4C, and submit to
SAF/IEE for final approval.
A2.4. Emission Reduction Credit Application. The CAA allows sources in nonattainment
areas with EPA-approved ERC programs to “trade” ERCs. Installations must follow regulatory
agency procedures to apply for and obtain ERCs if interested in obtaining ERCs and if they have
adequate funds for the associated fees. Installation realignment and closure funds may be used to
conduct the emission reduction credit inventory and to pay for application fees for installations
slated for closure. MAJCOMs must submit their requirements to the AFCEC Installations
Directorate (AFCEC/CI) IAW AFCEC programming procedures. MAJCOMs receiving ERCs
from closure installations will reimburse the installation realignment and closure account for its
proportionate share of the costs of the inventory and application fees. Reimbursement is not
required if the receiving installation is an installation realignment and closure site.
A2.5. Emission Reduction Credit Disposition. Once an air quality district issues ERCs, and
SAF/IEE has approved their use, ERCs can be disposed in the following manner.
   A2.5.1. “Operational needs requirement ERCs” can be banked for the requirements of the
   originating installation or can be transferred to another Air Force organization that would
   need to buy the credits.
   A2.5.2. “Related personal property ERCs” will be disposed of in the same manner as the real
   property on the inventory to which they are “related.”
   A2.5.3. “Personal property ERCs” will be screened with other DoD and other federal
   agencies. Thereafter, the installation will transfer any remaining ERCs as surplus property to
   the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal under GSA regulations.
A2.5.4. SAF/IEE will resolve any disputes over disposition of ERCs.
A2.6. Emission Reduction Credit Use. ERCs can only be used in the same air quality control
district/region in which they are generated, except where state or local laws and regulations
provide otherwise. For example, the Discrete Emission Reduction Credit (DERC) regulations in
Texas allow stationary and mobile DERCs generated within the state, with certain limitations, to
be used anywhere within the state. In addition, and under certain circumstances, DERCs created
outside the state may also be used within the state. In California, Section 40709.6 of the Health
and Safety Code permits the inter-basin transfer of emission offsets or ERCs from upwind to
downwind sources, even though they may be in different air quality control areas.
