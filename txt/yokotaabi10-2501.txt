       3.1.2. Document unit EM information program by using automated data processing
       system, unit implemented form, or MFR. Minimum information will include date,
       subject(s) discussed, and who attended or forum. Keep these records in the Unit EM
       continuity binder. The information must be available upon request and during the
       scheduled annual SAV provided by 374 CES/CEX.
       3.1.3. SAV Procedures.
           3.1.3.1. SAVs will be conducted annually and IAW with AFI 10-2501 to all
           subordinate units. Each unit will use the same checklist to conduct semi-annual self-
           inspection.
           3.1.3.2. SAVs calendar will be completed each calendar year after the release of the
           374 AW Exercise and Event Schedule. Schedule will be approved by 374 CES/CC
           and sent out to all squadron commanders and EM Representatives.
    3.2. Chemical-Biological Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE).
       3.2.1. Units will inspect their CWDE annually (with the exception of the mask which is
       monthly). Unit EM Representatives will ensure all military personnel and emergency
       essential civilians have proper sizes and quantities of CWDE and they clean and inspect
       their protective masks, as a minimum monthly IAW with TO. TOs can be requested
       from the 374 LRS/IPE section.
           3.2.1.1. All CWDE will be marked IAW wing guidance.
       3.2.2. Units that bulk store CWDE will document inspections using AFTO Form 152, a
       general-purpose form, or an automated data system. TOs will be maintained for each
       piece of chemical protective equipment stored at the unit.
       3.2.3. Units will store operational CWDE separate from training gear and in an
       environment that protects it from extreme heat and moisture. Unit EM Representatives
       will ensure expired bulk stored CWDE is removed from serviceable inventory for return
       to 374 LRS/IPE section.
       3.2.4. Units will maintain their CWDE according to applicable TOs.
    3.3. Unit EM Continuity Binder.
       3.3.1. Unit EM Representatives maintain the continuity binder (hard copy or electronic)
       with all materials required to administer the unit EM program and organize it in
       accordance with this instruction. Electronic copies of Air Force instructions, manuals,
       and pamphlets are available at the Air Force Electronics Publication site (http://www.e-

   Unit Control Centers (UCC)
   4.1. Disaster Response Force (DRF). The DRF includes the CAT, CP, EOC, ECC, IC, First
   Responders, Emergency Responders, UCCs, and specialized teams. The DRF is used to
   respond to all incidents, although the team’s configuration is incident-dependent. The
   AW/CC directs notification and activation of the DRF through CP controllers for all-hazard
   incidents. The DRF duties, as outlined in AFI 10-2501, include C2, contamination control,
   and shelter management.
      4.1.1. Crisis Action Team (CAT).
          4.1.1.1. The Yokota Crisis Action Team (CAT) provides the AW/CC a seamless,
          integrated, and effective command and control (C2) organization. Under the
          AW/CC’s authority, this organization executes command responsibilities during
          crises and contingencies which exceed that of normal day-to-day C2 structures and
          consists of retaining, to the maximum extent possible, the mission capabilities of
          Yokota Air Base. When activated, the CAT is capable of devoting its full time and
          attention to how crises affect mission execution and is charged with eliminating or
          alleviating detrimental mission impact. The ability to plan, direct, coordinate, and
          exercise C2 of all wing forces is inherent to CAT operations. 374 AW/XP manages
          the CAT program and its facilities on behalf of 374 AW/CC.
          4.1.1.2. The Yokota CAT consists of the AW/CC, AW/CV, Commander’s Senior
          Staff, CAT Director, CAT Staff, Group Representatives, and Advisory Support Staff.
          The primary CAT is located in Building 315 (Wing HQ), basement. The alternate is
          building 955 (LRS).
             4.1.1.2.1. Commander’s Senior Staff. The Commander’s Senior Staff consists of
             the Vice Commander and the Operations (OG), Maintenance (MXG), Mission
             Support (MSG), and Medical (MDG) Group Commanders. The 515th Air
             Mobility Operations Group (AMOG) Commander may join the Senior Staff, as
             required. The Senior Staff executes overall command and control to ensure the
             Wing’s mission and the installation’s support functions continue to the maximum
10                                                     YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013


           extent possible.
           4.1.1.2.2. CAT Director. The CAT Director manages CAT operations on behalf
           of the AW/CC and presents situational awareness and actionable information to
           the commander. The CAT Director establishes communications within the
           installation and with HHQ, filters/interprets HHQ directives, and ensures
           appropriate actions are taken. The Director implements CAT processes,
           checklists, and issues Yokota CAT Directives (YCDs) as necessary to execute the
           mission and respond to the crisis.
           4.1.1.2.3. CAT Staff. The CAT Staff consists of Executive, Administration,
           CSA, and Support personnel supporting the CAT Director in operating the CAT.
           4.1.1.2.4. Group Representatives. The Group Representatives are a key part of
           the CAT providing a direct link between the CAT and their respective Groups and
           UCCs. The OG, MXG, MSG, MDG, and Wing Staff Agency (WSA) provide
           Group Representatives to the CAT. A member from the 730 AMS may also join
           the CAT, as required.
           4.1.1.2.5. CAT Advisory Staff. The CAT Advisory Support Staff (full
           activation) consists of members from the Anti Terrorism Office (ATO), Staff
           Judge Advocate, Safety, Public Affairs, Weather, Intelligence, and the Installation
           Deployment Officer (IDO). While several of these positions will primarily be
           stationed at other locations, all will meet with the CAT for the initial activation.
        4.1.1.3. 374 AW Command Post. The CP is the primary agency authorized to
        communicate higher headquarters direction to operational organizations. CP is the
        only installation C2 function authorized to receive and process Emergency Action
        Messages (EAM) and prepare and transmit AF operational reports (AF OPREP-3).
        The CP provides C2 support to wing and tenant units to include relaying command
        direction, flight following, and operational reporting instructions.
           4.1.1.3.1. The CP is the essential C2 node of the CAT. The CP provides a
           communication link with higher headquarters and civilian agencies. The CP
           communicates directions, information, and recommended courses of action
           concerning the incident as the focal point for installation-wide warning and
           notification operations. When notification of a major accident or natural disaster
           is received, the CP activates the INWS, notifies all base organizations and notifies
           off-base agencies supported by the installation. When directed by the AW/CC the
           CP also activates the EOC, notifies senior leadership, and recalls the DRF. The
           CP also supports the incident by processing all Requests for Forces (RFF).
     4.1.2. Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
        4.1.2.1. An EOC is the focal point of support operations for the IC and those
        responders at the incident site. The EOC is the location where the coordination of
        information and resources in support of the incident takes place. The EOC is located
        in a permanent facility within the installation; however, the EOC may be a temporary
        facility used during large or complex incidents that require relocation from the
        primary location. The primary EOC location is building 530 (Main Fire Station),
YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013                                                             11


        room 104. The alternate EOC location is 315 (Wing HQ), basement. Both the
        primary and alternate EOC are managed by the R&EM Flight.
     4.1.3. EOC Director
        4.1.3.1. The EOC Director provides oversight for the AW/CC to support and control
        emergency or contingency incidents. The EOC Director can support multiple ICs
        simultaneously, while providing strategic senior officer-level C2 for sustained
        response and recovery operations. The EOC Director is responsible for directing the
        15 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). The EOC Director is the senior
        representative designated by the AW/CC. It is recommended that the EOC Director
        position be filled by one of the following: Mission Support Group (MSG)
        commander, Deputy MSG, Base Civil Engineer (BCE) or Deputy BCE. During a
        major incident, HAZMAT incident, or natural incident, the EOC Director must
        consider the initial response actions listed below.
        4.1.3.2. Convene the EOC. Upon activation of the EOC by the AW/CC, based on the
        magnitude of the incident, the EOC Director decides to recall the full EOC or tailor
        the recall to include only those staff members and ESFs required to handle the
        incident. When there is doubt, it is easier to recall the full EOC staff and
        subsequently dismiss those members not required.
        4.1.3.3. Situational Awareness. The EOC Director must establish and maintain an
        accurate and timely situational awareness to the AW/CC and CAT. As the EOC staff
        convenes, it is the EOC Director’s responsibility to ensure the entire staff is
        populating current incident information through the installation’s Common Operating
        Picture (COP).
        4.1.3.4. Coordinate information and resources supporting the incident. Once the
        EOC staff is operating, the EOC Director ensures the EOC staff is coordinating
        responsive information and resources the IC needs to respond to the incident.
        4.1.3.5. The EOC Director must keep the AW/CC fully informed on the incident
        response efforts throughout the operation.
        4.1.3.6. The EOC has several simultaneous requirements to communicate
        information and decisions. Communications may include checklists to activate
        required resources, provide direction to evacuate or take cover, and accomplish
        specific actions associated with emergency actions.
        4.1.3.7. Information flows from the individual and continues via the UCC to the
        EOC. The EOC also communicates with MAJCOM or area of responsibility through
        the AW/CC to report any critical shortages or incidents affecting the mission.
        Additionally, information flows from the EOC to the UCCs to keep them informed of
        any changes in the threat following major accidents or natural disasters.
        4.1.3.8. The EOC staff coordinates and consolidates all communication inputs and
        eliminates any duplicate or contradictory information. During responses, the EOC
        receives reports from several sources. EOC processing of these reports includes
        organizing the reports; developing messages; and status updates relative to their
        source.
12                                                      YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013


        4.1.3.9. Unit commanders activate their UCCs and initiate unit personnel
        accountability; however, the EOC Director determines which UCCs remain activated.
        UCCs serve as a communications conduit to each individual on the installation and
        provide a point of contact for resources requested from within the ESF construct.
        UCCs relay emergency information within the chain of command regarding major
        accidents and natural disasters. The UCCs also direct, monitor, report mitigation and
        preparedness activities, and maintain unit continuity for C2. UCCs are responsible
        for coordinating activities in preparation for, response to, and recovery from
        incidents. This includes gathering and disseminating information, accounting for
        personnel and resources, and performing initial damage assessment for their
        functional areas of responsibility.
        4.1.3.10. Determine specialized teams to activate. The IC can request any
        specialized team support needed for response operations. Upon request from the IC,
        the EOC will coordinate and activate the installation’s indigenous specialized teams.
        If the IC requires a specialized team not available locally, the request will go to the
        CAT. The CAT coordinates requests for external specialized teams required for
        response through the RFF process through their respective MAJCOM. Examples of
        external specialized teams include: Hammer Adaptive Communication Element
        (ACE), US Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, Nuclear
        Emergency Search Team (NEST), Army’s Tech Escort Unit (TEU), and Air Force
        Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT).
        4.1.3.11. At the installation level, specialized team duty should be a member's
        primary focus during emergency response operations, exercises, and training. Do not
        assign specialized team members with conflicting emergency operations duties.
        Appoint enough team members to conduct 24-hour operations. Department of the Air
        Force civilian personnel may be assigned to specialized teams.
        4.1.3.12. Only the AW/CC or designated representative should approve the release of
        a specialized team member for reasons other than permanent change of station,
        retirement, discharge, or medical disqualification. The replacement must be trained
        before releasing the incumbent.
        4.1.3.13. Provide initial situation briefings. Upon initial recall of the ESF, personnel
        will report to the EOC and receive a briefing regarding the following topics: (1)
        description of the incident or natural incident, (2) forces on-scene, (3), casualty
        estimate, (4), cordon size and location description, (5) protective measures being
        taken, and (6) tactical priorities.
     4.1.4. EOC Manager.
        4.1.4.1. The AW/CC appoints the Readiness and EM officer and/or Superintendent
        as the EOC Manager per AFI 10-2501. The EOC Manager works for the EOC
        Director by providing support and functional expertise for emergency C2 of military
        resources through the ESFs. The EOC Manager will stand up the EOC when
        directed. The EOC Manager will oversee EOC operations collect information about
        the incident, and provide updates to the EOC Director.
     4.1.5. Emergency Support Function (ESF).
YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013                                                                13


        4.1.5.1. ESFs as identified in AFI 10-2501, provide the structure for coordinating
        installation strategic interagency support during all phases of incident management
        for major accidents, natural disasters (to include natural outbreaks of disease such as
        pandemic influenza), CBRNE attacks, and terrorist use of CBRNE materials. The
        ESF structure includes mechanisms used to provide support to the installation and if
        required, to local, State and Federal agencies/governments. The type and scope of the
        event will determine the magnitude, and timing of the support provided by each ESF.
        4.1.5.2. At YAB there are 15 ESFs. YAB has 2 additional Office of Collateral
        Responsibility (OCR): OCR – MXG and OCR – OG. OCRs have the same training
        requirements as ESFs and are identified under ESFs on the quarterly report.
        4.1.5.3. The unit commander appoints ESF members as required IAW AFI 10-2501,
        Attachment 2. New ESF appointees to the EOC will take the Web-Based Training
        (WBT) Air Force Emergency Response Operations (AERO) Command and Control
        (C2) training online within 60 days of appointment and attend the Local AERO
        training class provided by 374 CES/CEX, available every first Monday of every
        month, within the same 60 days. ESF must also complete Unit Level Unit Command
        and Control (UL UC2) by scheduling with 374 AW/XPT office. Contact and other
        information will be annotated using the YAB Form 20 completed by the Unit EM
        Representative. The ESF must have the same authority to commit unit assets as the
        organizational commander or chief when the EOC is activated.
        4.1.5.4. Notify 374 CES/CEX if any of the following information changes: name,
        rank, phone number (duty and home), pager and cell phone numbers (if applicable).
        4.1.5.5. Assigned ESF/OCR members and supporting personnel will respond to the
        EOC when recalled within 30 minutes when on duty and 1 hour off duty. Members
        will respond with all checklists and specialized gear appropriate for the situation
        enabling members to fully support the mitigation of the incident. Units will maintain
        all required EOC response equipment in an easy to carry case, kit, or backpack.
        4.1.5.6. Required ESF/OCR equipment (unit funded):
           4.1.5.6.1. Backpack or briefcase.
           4.1.5.6.2. ESF functional/unit checklists.
           4.1.5.6.3. Numeric pager (issued by 374 CES/CEX).
           4.1.5.6.4. Line badge.
           4.1.5.6.5. SIPRNET and UL UC2 logon with password (must logon every 30
           days to keep account active).
     4.1.6. Incident Commander (IC).
        4.1.6.1. The individual responsible for all incident activities, including the
        development of strategies and tactics and the ordering and release of resources. The
        IC has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is
        responsible for the management of all incident operations at the incident site. The IC
        must be fully qualified to manage the response. The IC is equivalent to the on-scene
14                                                     YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013


        IC as defined in OSHA 1910.120(8), Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency
        Response.
  4.2. Common Operating Picture (COP)
     4.2.1. The following systems are used to standardize and facilitate communication and
     coordination between all users; all members of the DRF are required to have access to all
     systems. Below are recommendations for whether NIPR or SIPR will be used. For
     Emergency Management Exercises (EMEs), Natural Disasters, and peacetime responses
     NIPR side will used. For Phase I & Phase II exercises, and real world OPLAN taskings,
     SIPR will be used.
        4.2.1.1. Defense Connect Online (DCO). Dependent on the situation, either NIPR or
        SIPR DCO will be used.                   NIPR DCO link can be found
        https://connect.dco.dod.mil/yabeoc.       SIPR DCO link can be found
        https://connect.dco.dod.smil.mil/yabeoc. Both sides of DCO will be managed by
        the 374 CES/CEX as the ESF 5 and EOC Manager. EOC Manager and ESF 5 will
        update status boards within DCO to show all key operations. Rooms will only be
        opened during the activation of the EOC.
            4.2.1.1.1. DCO log in will be standard across the installation. Individual will
            enter role then rank and last name. For EOC members “ESF 5 (MSgt Smith), for
            UCC members                   “374 CES/UCC (SSgt Jones). Required training will
            be provided during the local AERO class.
            4.2.1.1.2. There are two DCO rooms for both NIPR and SIPR. One is used by
            the EOC and the other used by the CAT. There will be no other DCO rooms
            besides the ones listed above. Having multiple rooms circumvents the YAB C2
            architecture and causes duplication of efforts.
        4.2.1.2. Unit Level Unit Command and Control (UL/UC2). The Integrated
        Information Management System (IIMS) is a collaborative situational awareness tool
        which aids in the management of Conventional and Chemical, Biological,
        Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) events at fixed, expeditionary and incident
        response sites. IIMS includes detector/ warning networks, access to CBRN models,
        and information exchange with civil sector and coalition partner organizations. It
        addresses both conventional and CBRN incidents. It is replacing the Survival
        Recovery Center (SRC) Command. It improves decision making and battle
        management activities in the event of a conventional or CBRN incident. At YAB
        only the SIPR version is available.
            4.2.1.2.1. Contact 374 AW/XPT office for training and access to the system.
        4.2.1.3. Yokota Virtual Operations Center (VOC). Until a solution is fielded on the
        NIPR side, YAB has created a VOC with a template provided by the Air Force as an
        interim. VOC utilizes SharePoint and can be specifically designed for YAB’s needs.
        Link                      to                      YAB                         VOC
        https://yokota.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/Yokota_Virtual_EOC/default.aspx
        4.2.1.4. YAB will use the VOC in conjunction with Geobase via NIPR side.
        Geobase is located https://yogeows03/.

  4.6. Contamination Control Area Team (CCA).
     4.6.1. Purpose. These teams are responsible for chemical, biological, and radiological
     decontamination operations on YAB. If tasked personnel may be used for HAZMAT
     decontamination operations and will be provided just in time training.
     4.6.2. Prerequisites. Any rank. Individuals must not be on any physical profile and must
     be able to wear protective gear for extended periods of time. Members will be tasked
     through the installation READY program.
     4.6.3. Response. CCA teams are assigned to the Civil Engineer R&EM Flight as their
     primary duty during contingencies. The CBRN Control Center (CBRNCC) will direct
     these teams.
     4.6.4. Composition. CCA teams are pulled from the 31 personnel EMST team assigned
     by the READY Program.
     4.6.5. Checklists. Will be provided by the Civil Engineer Readiness & Emergency
     Management Flight.
     4.6.6. Supplemental Training. Members must obtain required training within 60 days of
     appointment to the team. Training must be tracked on the YAB Form 20.
  4.7. Recovery.
     4.7.1. The recovery phase begins when first responders have completed emergency
     response and lifesaving actions. The EOC, using the IEMP 10-2 and appropriate
     checklists, develops the installation recovery plan. The EOC Director, with approval
     from the AW/CC, is responsible for developing and overseeing recovery actions. The
     main goal of recovery is to re-establish installation mission and return to normal
     operations. There may be critical missions that must continue before or during the
     recovery phase. Installations must plan for those operations and develop procedures to
     remove or minimize the hazards in an area or at a facility in order to continue the critical
     mission.
     4.7.2. Recovery Operations Chief (ROC). Once the emergency is over and recovery
     starts, control of the site must be officially transferred from the IC to another individual
     or organization. This person is not referred to as an IC but called the Recovery
     Operations Chief. The ROC must be a subject matter expert in the hazards or activities
     within the incident site. If it is a HAZMAT incident, the organization or individual that
     assumes control of the site must be knowledgeable of the hazards and recovery
     procedures, such as initiating actions to contain the hazard, clean up the site, and restore
     the area to its pre-incident condition. The person in charge of that work should have an
     environmental engineering background and be familiar with HAZMAT clean-up
     requirements. If it is an aircraft incident, the ROC should be familiar with that aircraft or
 18                                                     YOKOTAABI10-2501 5 JUNE 2013


      be a member of the interim aircraft mishap investigation team. The EOC Director should
      select the individual that will be in charge of the site.
      4.7.3. Document Report Information. The EOC Director and EOC ESFs will maintain
      the necessary maps and status boards to show the key operations status in their areas of
      responsibility. In addition, they will maintain a permanent log of actions. This log of
      actions provides continuity between shift changes and assists in the preparation of daily
      situation reports (SITREP). Detailed documentation is also required for continuity during
      the event, and for identifying lessons learned, reviewing planning documents, and
      updating execution checklists after an event. The EOC or CAT assimilates airbase
      information and forwards essential elements to joint force, theater, and MAJCOM
      command centers. The process is reversed for downward information flow.
          4.7.3.1. Events logs detail unit and resource activity. These logs provide the basic
          reference from which to extract information for after-action reporting. An event log
          is initiated and maintained by each UCC, the EOC, CAT and the ECC. Logs are
          required to be submitted to 374 CES/CEX as well as courtesy copied to their
          respective commanders by 1900 daily and within 24 hrs of termination of incident.
          4.7.3.2. After-Action Reports. IAW AFI 10-2501, commanders must develop and
          submit installation-wide lessons learned reports to their respective Headquarters AF,
          MAJCOM, Field Operating Agency (FOA), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) for all
          emergency responses. After-action reports should include actions implemented and
          any lessons learned during actual incident response and exercises. AFI 10-204,
          Participation in Joint and National Exercises, provides guidance on reportable
          actions as well as preparing and submitting the report.
             4.7.3.2.1. After-action reports should include dissemination and notification
             successes and shortfalls, installation-wide response checklists, deficiencies,
             deficiency correction plans, required training, dates of implementation, any
             corrective action, follow-up actions, and lessons learned. After-action reports are
             also required by the Air Force After-Actions Reporting System (AFAARS) when
             AF elements participate in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Exercise
             Program, other joint exercises, AF exercises and real-world operations. AFAARS
             reporting is required on humanitarian operations, base closure, peacekeeping, and
             Noncombatant Evacuation Operations. Headquarters AF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, and
             DRUs must establish internal after-action reporting procedures to ensure
             AFAARS objectives are met, problems are solved, and results are disseminated.

  100, Airman’s Manual. Students missing any of the components will be sent back to their
  unit and a no-show letter sent to their commander.
     5.8.1. No-show letters will be generated on a weekly basis. The letters will be sent to the
     applicable unit commander or equivalent, and will include the total number of no-shows,
     student name, and reason, if turned away.
     5.8.2. Walk-ins will not be accepted.
  5.9. Cancellations.
     5.9.1. Classes are normally cancelled due to exercises, emergencies, or severe weather.
