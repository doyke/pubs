                PROGRAM PURPOSE, GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Program Purpose. The Grand Forks Air Force Base Confinement Facility (CF) provides quality
confinement and rehabilitation services for pre-trial and post-trial inmates serving a court-martial sen-
tence. The 319th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Confinement Staff ensures a secure, humane, and pro-
ductive environment for inmates and staff. The facility maintains a high level of discipline and provides
for the education, training, rehabilitation and welfare of confinees. Those not retained for further military
service have the opportunity to return to society as a responsible and productive citizen.

1.2. Program Guidelines. The confinement facility is based on a corrective rather than punitive basis, as
outlined in AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System. It requires positive programs to preserve and
strengthen an inmate’s dignity. Inmates receive sentences to confinement as punishment not for punish-
ment.

1.3. Program Responsibilities. The 319th Security Forces Squadron Commander (319 SFS/CC) ensures
the confinement program is operated in accordance with (IAW) established Department of Defense and
Air Force Instructions. The 319 SFS/CC appoints in writing a Confinement Officer and Noncommis-
sioned Officer (NCO) to manage the program. The Confinement NCO is responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the facility.
    1.3.1. Grand Forks Air Force Base CF is designated a Level 1 Facility. Level 1 facilities may house
    pre-trial detainees or post trial inmates (less than 1 year) and those awaiting transfer to Regional Cor-
    rectional Facilities.
    1.3.2. Treatment programs will be offered consistent with security requirements and available
    resources. The confinement staff utilizes treatment programs offered throughout the installation such
    as: Life Skills, 319th Medical Group (MDG) Clinic, 319th Services Squadron (SVS), Family Support
    Center, Education Center, etc.

            ORGANIZATION, STAFFING, AND CORRECTIONS STAFF TRAINING

2.1. Organization. The 319th SFS/CC assigns, in writing, a commissioned officer as the Confinement
Officer and a NCO as the Confinement NCO Incharge (NCOIC). This position may be an additional duty.
The Confinement NCOIC is operationally responsible to the confinement officer.

2.2. Staffing. The 319th SFS/CC determines staffing for their Level 1 facility. MAJCOMs establish staff-
ing requirements for Level 1 Facilities assigned to their command. Staffing requirements will be reviewed
at least semiannually and adjusted as required.
   2.2.1. Staff members must be E-4 or above and have a 5 skill level.
   2.2.2. Personnel other than security forces (SF) members may be used to supervise or escort inmates.
   The Confinement NCOIC will maintain a record of training on all non-security forces supervisors
   who are trained to supervise inmates.
       2.2.2.1. Persons with an Unfavorable Information File, civilian felony conviction, court-martial
       conviction, non-judicial punishment, criminal history or history of substance abuse will not be
       tasked to supervise inmates. Additionally, personnel currently under investigation for any of the
       above mentioned offenses will not supervise inmates.
       2.2.2.2. Personnel enrolled in the Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) will not supervise
       inmates.

2.3. Training. Confinement Officers will establish an in-house training program designed to ensure all
personnel assigned corrections duties are fully trained in custody, control, management and correctional
treatment of inmates.
   2.3.1. Training records will be maintained on all staff members. Confinement staff should complete
   or be scheduled to attend a service corrections course (or civilian equivalent) immediately upon duty
   assignment.
   2.3.2. Corrections training programs will be established IAW AFI 31-205.

                                                Chapter 3

                                PARENT UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Parent Units. The inmate’s parent unit is responsible for its confined personnel, regardless of loca-
tion, until the member is formally gained into the Air Force Corrections System (AFCS). This responsi-
bility includes, but is not limited to: providing escorts, assisting confined members’ families, visiting
confined members at least monthly, making telephonic contact when geographically separated and obtain-
ing transfer orders.

3.2. Administration. Inmates assigned to the Grand Forks Air Force Base CF are still assigned to their
respective parent unit. Parent units are responsible for completing the following administrative actions:
    3.2.1. The parent unit commander is responsible for updating the personnel data system of changes in
    duty status until the inmate is transferred to Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center, Security
    Forces Confinement (HQ AFSFC/SFC).
    3.2.2. The parent unit completes an AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, to update the inmate’s duty
    status code and processes the form through the local Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and Financial
    Services Office (FSO).
    3.2.3. The parent unit is responsible for submitting the proper documentation to FSO to place member
    on excess leave. Timely coordination with the confinement facility, unit commander and the FSO
    ensures prompt release from confinement and the member will no longer be entitled to receive pay
    and allowances.
    3.2.4. Upon the inmate’s confinement, parent unit will provide confinement staff documents relating
    to security clearance suspension or withdrawal for inclusion in the Corrections Treatment File (CTF).

3.3. In-processing/Out-processing. The parent unit’s first sergeant or designated representative (E-7 or
above) will be present during inprocessing and outprocessing of inmates.
    3.3.1. In-processing. The parent unit’s first sergeant or designated representative will meet the con-
    finement staff at Building 307 with all the inmates required items prior to the confinement staff
    assuming custody of the inmate.
       3.3.1.1. The parent unit will conduct a HANDS-ON check of all items required for confinement
       prior to the court-martial date. Do not rely solely on the individual to have everything in order; this
       is an extremely stressful time and packing is usually the last thing on his/her mind.
       3.3.1.2. The unit’s first sergeant or designated representative will be present during the item
       inventory portion of inprocessing. The unit will be responsible for providing or replacing missing
       or unserviceable items. The required items list will be forwarded by the confinement NCO to the
       unit’s first sergeants prior to the court-martial date.
       3.3.1.3. The inmate and parent unit are responsible for disposing of unauthorized personal prop-
       erty.
       3.3.1.4. The following items will not be accepted into the confinement facility: credit cards, driv-
       ers license, keys and key rings, trinkets and lucky charms, check books, line badges and any other
       items identified as contraband by the confinement staff.
GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                  7


   3.3.2. Outprocessing. The parent unit’s first sergeant or designated representative is required to be
   present at all inmate pre-release or pre-transfer meetings. Confinement staff will release inmates to
   parent unit commander, first sergeant or designated representative only.

3.4. Health and Comfort Items. Inmates are required to enter confinement with a 30-day supply of
health and comfort items. Inmates in pay status will purchase health and comfort items with the Prisoner
Deposit Fund (PDF). Inmates in non-pay status will be issued health and comfort items at limits estab-
lished by the facility.
   3.4.1. Health and comfort items for inmates in non-pay status are issued by parent units and may be
   procured using the parent unit’s O&M funds.
   3.4.2. The confinement facility maintains a small amount of health and comfort items. These are used
   for emergency issue only.

3.5. Inmate Escorts. The inmate’s parent unit commander provides escort and guard personnel when
required, consistent with custody grade and security requirements.
   3.5.1. Confinement staff provides initial escort for inprocessing appointments. The confinement staff
   will also escort inmates to all medical and life skills appointments.
   3.5.2. The parent unit will identify two NCO’s to provide escort duty for each inmate they have con-
   fined to the Confinement NCO within the first 2 days of confinement. The Confinement NCO will
   schedule and conduct training on escort procedures prior to anyone assuming escort duties. The Con-
   finement NCO will maintain a roster of all trained personnel. NOTE: Units may use previously
   trained personnel for these duties.
   3.5.3. Inmates are afforded access to most military services provided to non-inmates (i.e. Library,
   Military Personnel Flight, Family Support, Religious Service, Fitness Center, Transition Assistance
   Briefings etc.). Parent units are responsible for providing escorts for these types of appointments.
   NOTE: Inmates are forbidden to have access to banking, Army Air Forces Exchange Service
   (AAFES) and Outdoor recreation facilities and any personal property outside the facility. Escorts must
   contact the confinement staff for guidance if the use of a service is in question.

3.6. Parent Unit Visitation. Parent unit commanders or their appointees in the grade of E-7 or above
may visit inmates at anytime except during lights-out periods.
   3.6.1. Maximum custody inmate visits will take place in a secure area within the confinement facility.
   Visits with medium-in, medium-out, minimum and community custody inmates may take place out-
   side the facility, but only under supervision.
   3.6.2. The visitor will be required to assume custody of the inmate via DD Form 2708, Receipt of
   Inmate or Detained Person, if the visit is to exceed 15 minutes.

3.7. Religious Services. Inmates are afforded reasonable access to a chaplain and religious services.
Chaplains may make periodic visits to the confinement facility. Parent units must provide escorts for
church services. Inmates complete a DD Form 510, Request for Interview, that must be submitted by
each Thursday prior to the scheduled service.
   3.7.1. Inmates will not be released until 15 minutes prior to the service.

    3.7.2. Inmates will only attend services on-base.
    3.7.3. Inmate and escort will sit in the last pew. The inmate will be returned to the facility immedi-
    ately after the service is concluded. Inmates will not socialize with the public, friends or family mem-
    bers.

3.8. Physical Conditioning. Physical Conditioning is conducted on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
from 0945 to 1115. Conditioning should include stretching, cardiovascular and cool down activities (i.e.,
stretching, running, treadmill, stationary bicycle and stretching exercises as cool down). The standard
basic military training physical training criteria meet this requirement.
    3.8.1. Parent units are responsible for providing an escort. The escort must maintain control of the
    inmate at all times. At no time will the inmate be left unattended or escort duties delegated to other
    personnel. Inmates will not participate in group exercises, (i.e. group sports with non-inmates).
    3.8.2. Only trained parent unit escorts will be used for this detail. When trained escorts are not avail-
    able, the parent unit’s first sergeant will identify another person to be trained for escort duty. This must
    be coordinated at least three days prior to scheduled fitness needs.

3.9. Hospitalized Inmates. Inmates are provided the same hospital services as any military member.
Security for hospitalized inmates will be conducted as follows:
    3.9.1. Maximum Custody Inmates will be guarded by two personnel: one armed security forces mem-
    ber and one parent unit member. Guards will constantly monitor the inmate.
    3.9.2. Medium and Minimum Custody Inmates will be constantly monitored by parent unit members.
    The guard will be issued a SFs radio in case of attempted escape of the inmate.
    3.9.3. Inmates will not leave their room unless authorized and will be accompanied by their escort(s).

3.10. Recommended Assistance. Many inmates enter the confinement system with little or no planning
for the future. Supervisors and first sergeants should cover these recommended areas prior to the
court-martial dates. This greatly reduces stress incurred by inmates during their initial confinement time.
    3.10.1. Arrangements should be made to meet financial obligations. Powers of Attorney for spouse or
    family members aid in this process.
    3.10.2. Inmates are not allowed access to personal bank accounts and the confinement facility does
    not accept personal checks for PDF deposits.
    3.10.3. Ensure family members know visitation times and procedures, inmate gift procedures and
    inmate mailing address (found in the Inmate Visitor Pamphlet).

                                 INMATE ESCORT PROCEDURES

4.1. Local Area Escorts. The Confinement Officer ensures compliance with prescribed security require-
ments based on the custody grade and classification of the inmate.
   4.1.1. Escorts may be used as a vehicle driver while escorting on the installation only and if the
   inmate(s) meet the required custody grade.
   4.1.2. When conducting an escort off the installation the escort will not be used as the vehicle driver.
   4.1.3. Inmates will be released to their escort via DD Form 2708 to non-security forces personnel.
   Escorts will read and sign the escort responsibilities rules located on the DD Form 2708.
   4.1.4. Government Motor Vehicles (GMVs) will be used to transport inmates. Private Motor Vehicles
   (PMVs) will only be used as a last resort.
       4.1.4.1. Escorts and drivers will ensure the vehicle has been searched for contraband and weapons
       prior to and after each transport of inmates.
       4.1.4.2. Never place an inmate behind the driver of the vehicle. If the driver is also the escort, the
       inmate will sit in the front passenger seat.
       4.1.4.3. Escorts will ensure the inmates do not have access to unauthorized items, weapons or the
       escort’s personal property. Inmates will not be transported on motorcycles, mopeds or bicycles.

4.2. Custody Grades. Custody grades are determined by the confinement staff for safety and security
reasons. There are three types of custody grades used at the Grand Forks Confinement Facility: Maxi-
mum, Medium-In, and Medium-Out.
   4.2.1. Custody Grade Escort Ratios. Inmates are assigned custody grades while assigned to the facil-
   ity. The following guideline will be adhered to when escorting:
       4.2.1.1. When mixing custody grades for escort, the most restrictive escort procedures will be
       used according to classification.
       4.2.1.2. Escort maximum custody inmates with two personnel. One will be an armed security
       forces member. Use approved restraining devices, i.e. handcuffs, belly chain (strap) and leg irons.
       4.2.1.3. Personnel from the parent unit escort medium-in custody inmates using a ratio of one
       escort per inmate. The ratio is one per two inmates, when escorted by SF members. When inmates
       require restraint during movement, escorts must be trained on the use of restraint devices.
       4.2.1.4. Personnel from the parent unit escort medium-out custody inmates using a ratio of one
       escort per two inmates. The ratio is one per four inmates, when escorted by SF members.
   4.2.2. Parent units assign only officers and NCOs, equal to or higher in rank to the inmate, as escorts.
   This is not applicable to SF personnel responsible for local area inmate security or control. SF and
   parent units must be careful not to assign escort duty to any person who may sympathize with the
   inmate (i.e., a peer who previously worked with the inmate).
   4.2.3. The confinement staff briefs escorts on inmate security requirements prior to departing the CF.
   The greatest opportunity for an escape attempt exists while an inmate is away from the CF.

        4.2.3.1. Because of escape opportunities during an escort situation, escorts must receive training
        by the confinement staff. An assigned trainer should emphasize escort responsibilities to include:
            4.2.3.1.1. Safety and welfare of the inmate and the public.
            4.2.3.1.2. Requirements related to inmate custody grades and any special instructions such as
            controlling and administering prescribed medication.
            4.2.3.1.3. Detailed instructions for unplanned or emergency situations such as unexpected
            delays, escape or attempted escape, and medical emergencies.
            4.2.3.1.4. How and when to use restraining devices.

4.3. Transfers. SF members are responsible for escort duties during transfers.
     4.3.1. The parent unit is required to provide funding and arrange transportation for the escort and the
     inmate.
     4.3.2. The Confinement NCO will coordinate all transfer processes and escort arrangements with the
     parent unit.
     4.3.3. The Confinement NCO will contact the appropriate airlines and coordinate all security require-
     ments.
     4.3.4. The Confinement NCO will complete the transfer process IAW AFI 31-205 and gaining facility
     requirements. Transfers to local area facilities will be approved by the 319th Air Refueling Wing
     Commander (319 ARW/CC) through coordination with the 319 SFS/CC.

5.1. Inprocessing. The Confinement Officer ensures all confinement staff members are proficient in pro-
cessing new inmates, and are conducted IAW AFI 31-205, Air Force Corrections System.
   5.1.1. The Confinement NCO and one additional security force member will proceed to Building 307
   to assume custody of inmates upon notification from 319th Base Legal Office of a court-martial con-
   viction resulting in confinement. Custody of the inmate will be assumed via DD Form 2707, Confine-
   ment Order.
       5.1.1.1. The Confinement NCO will ensure he/she has received the DD Form 1359, Report or
       Result of Trial and DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning
       Inmate Status, prior to assuming custody. Additionally, he/she will ensure the parent unit’s repre-
       sentative is present with the inmate’s required items for confinement.
       5.1.1.2. After assuming custody, the inmate will not have contact, verbally or physically, with
       other personnel except for official business. The inmate will be moved to an isolated area (west
       stairwell) to be searched prior to transport. The parent unit’s representative will be instructed to
       proceed to Building 103 for further inprocessing procedures.
       5.1.1.3. An inventory of the inmate’s required items will be conducted upon arrival at the CF. Any
       items the inmate is not allowed to bring into the facility will be given to the parent unit’s represen-
       tative for disposal/storage. Any missing or unserviceable items will be acquired or replaced by the
       parent unit upon completion of the inventory.
       5.1.1.4. The Confinement NCO will utilize the inprocessing checklists to ensure all required
       actions are completed.
   5.1.2. Upon completion of in-processing, the inmate will be placed into administrative segregation.
   The inmate will remain there for up to 72 hours for observation.
       5.1.2.1. Inmates failing to adjust to confinement, prove to be a security concern, or are a suicide
       risk may remain past the 72 hour period. The confinement staff will follow guidance outlined in
       AFI 31-205, Air Force Corrections System, for these situations.
       5.1.2.2. Inmates in segregation will not receive visits (except from their attorney, chaplain, com-
       mander or designated representative (E-7 or above)). Additionally, inmates in segregation will not
       receive phone calls (except emergency calls from the Red Cross) or mail. Exceptions must be
       approved by the Confinement Officer or Confinement NCO.

5.2. Out-processing. Inmate release is a two-step process. It begins with a pre-release conference and
ends with an actual release.
   5.2.1. Prior to the pre-release conference, parent units should acquire professional assistance for the
   inmate through the Transition Assistance Program.
       5.2.1.1. The Confinement NCO, in the presence of the inmate’s squadron commander or desig-
       nated representative, conducts a pre-release conference with the inmate three calendar days before
       release.

        5.2.1.2. The conference should cover the process of release from confinement, benefits, duties,
        and military separation proceeding (if applicable).
     5.2.2. The 319th SFS/CC coordinates the release of inmates with the installation commander and the
     unit commander when inmates complete their sentences of confinement, or are approved by the
     United States Air Force Clemency and Parole Board for release on parole. NOTE: If release falls upon
     a holiday or a weekend, inmates may be released on the preceding duty day, per Air Force Joint
     Instruction, 31-215, Military Sentences to Confinement, paragraph 4(g).

5.3. Transfers. The same procedures are used for outprocessing from the CF during a transfer.
     5.3.1. Prior to transfer, the confinement staff conducts a pre-transfer conference with the inmate. The
     inmate, his/her commander or appointed representative, and Confinement Officer or Confinement
     NCO, attend the conference to explain the purpose of the transfer and resolve the disposition of prop-
     erty and funds. The Confinement Officer or Confinement NCO:
        5.3.1.1. Schedules the conference just prior to transfer. Ensures adequate time is provided for the
        inmate to accomplish any personal actions prior to transfer. The inmate will not be notified of the
        exact date and time for transfer.
        5.3.1.2. Advises the inmate of dependent travel and shipping entitlements:
            5.3.1.2.1. There is no entitlement for single and divorced members without dependents to ship

   vision and radio. Inmates can watch television, play games, exercise, listen to the radio, write letters,
   etc., during authorized free time unless otherwise specified by the Confinement Officer or NCO.
   Inmates will adhere to establish free time hours IAW Security Force Pamphlet (SFP) 31-225, Security
   Forces Confinement Rule Book.

8.7. Inmate Medical Services. Inmates receive the same medical and dental services as active duty per-
sonnel. Inmates will advise the controller if they require medical attention. The Confinement Officer or
NCO may request special medical examinations when warranted for safety and security concerns.
   8.7.1. Administration. Inmates receive a physical examination by medical personnel within 24 hours
   after entry into confinement or the next duty day for processing on weekends or holidays.
       8.7.1.1. Normally the inmate’s Primary Care Manager (PCM) will conduct the physical. If the
       inmate’s PCM is not available, any physician can complete the physical.
       8.7.1.2. This examination, at a minimum, includes a physical examination and a review of medi-
       cal records, to include those at the Life Skills Support Center and Family Advocacy Program. The

        medical officer tests for communicable diseases, to include HIV and Hepatitis B. The medical
        officer also conducts an inspection of all body cavities to prevent the introduction of contraband
        into the facility. Confinement staff will not document all results except HIV results in the CTF.
        NOTE: The medical staff documents HIV test results in the inmate’s medical records.
        8.7.1.3. Female inmates will also be administered a pregnancy test, with results annotated in the
        medical record.
        8.7.1.4. Inmates will be taken to a credentialed provider within the Behavioral Health Services
        Flight for an interview. The designated provider will screen the inmate’s medical records for con-
        sultation entries with the Alcohol & Drug Abuse Prevention & Treatment Program (ADAPT),
        Family Advocacy Program or Life Skills Support Center to determine if the inmate requires fol-
        low-up mental health support (i.e. for alcohol abuse), is a danger to self or others, or is likely to
        have difficulty adjusting to confinement.
        8.7.1.5. When temporarily transferred to another facility, transfer the inmate’s medical record
        with the inmate’s escort. When inmates return to their base of assignment, their medical records
        are to be returned with them. NOTE: The inmates’ records will be signed-out by the Confinement
        NCO for transfer to another facility.
        8.7.1.6. Medical staff members evaluate each inmate as soon as possible within 24 hours of enter-
        ing administrative or disciplinary segregation.
            8.7.1.6.1. Thereafter, medical personnel shall visit at least once every 72 hours to evaluate
            inmate’s health and the sanitary conditions.
            8.7.1.6.2. Segregated inmates under suicide watch (to protect them against self harm) will be
            evaluated by a medical officer who will determine if continued segregation is appropriate.
            This will be accomplished as soon as possible, and within 24 hours of segregation initiation.
            Additionally, a medical authority will review the appropriateness of continued suicide watch
            (as a minimum) every 24 hours after the initiation of the segregation to evaluate inmate’s
            health and sanitary conditions.
            8.7.1.6.3. These checks will be conducted by the 319th MDG, Independent Duty Medical
            Technician.
            8.7.1.6.4. The facility commander shall be notified of any unhealthy, unsafe or unsanitary
            condition for immediate corrective action. Confinement staff records the evaluations and cell
            checks on a DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Prisoner in Segregation.
            8.7.1.6.5. Temporarily house inmates within the area used for administrative segregation, if
            their emotional state, adjustment to confinement or mental/physical characteristics warrant
            such action. Normally, special quarters will be determined based upon the recommendations
            of professional medical support and treatment staff. A credentialed provider from the Behav-
            ioral Health Services Flight must interview the inmate at least every 30 days, when placed in
            special quarters for mental health reasons.
     8.7.2. Control of Medical Supplies and Medication. The Confinement Officer establishes local proce-
     dures for secure storage, issue, accountability and destruction of inmate medications.
        8.7.2.1. The confinement staff strictly controls medical supplies and medication, documents all
        medication issues and dispositions, and files completed records in the CTF.

     following provisions apply:
         8.7.2.3.1. The controller, flight sergeant or confinement staff will ensure correct amounts of
         medication are administered at correct times and will record the information on the inmate
         medication log. The inmate will sign the medication log upon taking medication. The person
         administering the medication will print his/her name and sign the log. The person issuing the
         medication will inspect the inmate’s mouth (when taken orally) to ensure the medication has
         been swallowed. Medication will be dispensed according to the time tables listed below:
            8.7.2.3.1.1. Medication prescribed for "every 12 hours" will be given after breakfast and
            dinner.

  Officer is responsible for custody and control matters.
     8.7.4.1. The Confinement Officer provides the hospital commander a brief history of the inmate’s
     conduct and custody grade.
     8.7.4.2. In cases where inmates will be admitted into a civilian hospital, the Confinement Officer
     or NCO will coordinate with hospital staff on security requirements and procedures.
     8.7.4.3. When an inmate is hospitalized, comply with the following procedures:
         8.7.4.3.1. Two personnel, one armed SF person and one parent-unit military member, will
         constantly guard maximum custody inmates. Guards will not lie down, sleep, read books or
         write letters. However, they may listen to commercial radios and watch television (TV) (if
         available) if it does not disturb other patients, including the inmate.
         8.7.4.3.2. Parent unit personnel will guard and constantly monitor minimum and medium cus-
         tody inmates. Guards will not lie down, sleep, read books or write letters. However, they may

        will ensure a SF member rides with the ambulance crew to provide escort duty.

8.8. Inmate Visitation/Telephone Use Procedures. Visitation is permitted on Sundays and holidays
from 1430 until 1630 hours. Exceptions must be approved by the Confinement Officer or NCO. The fol-
lowing provisions apply:
     8.8.1. Visitation during administrative segregation will only be permitted if inmates have satisfacto-
     rily completed their in-processing physical and the Confinement NCO has reviewed and approved the
     inmate's visitor list. Normally, inmates processed into the CF Monday through Thursday may receive
     visitors the first weekend. Those processed into the CF on Friday through Sunday will not be allowed
     visitors until the following weekend.
     8.8.2. Visitation is not permitted during disciplinary segregation. Official visits must be coordinated
     through the Confinement Officer/NCO.
     8.8.3. Personnel requesting to visit an inmate must contact the Confinement NCO no later than close
     of business each Thursday for visitation on the following Sunday. For holiday visitations, contact the

   8.8.8. Visitors providing authorized items to inmates will bring them directly to the Confinement
   NCO during normal duty hours: these items will not be given to inmates or any other SF flight person-
   nel.
   8.8.9. Visitors may briefly embrace inmates at the beginning and end of each visit. Hand holding is
   allowed during visits. Kissing is not authorized.
   8.8.10. Visitors will wear appropriate attire. Those who are wearing ragged or unkempt clothing or

   sive noise.
   8.8.12. Food and drinks are not normally permitted in the visitation room, but will be considered on
   holidays. Contact Confinement NCO or Confinement Officer for guidance.
   8.8.13. Tobacco products will not be used during the visit.
   8.8.14. SF personnel will inspect the visitation room for contraband before and after each visitation
   period and search inmate(s) before and after visits. Complete searches out of the visitor(s) sight.
   8.8.15. Unarmed SF personnel will constantly supervise visitations and will not be overbearing or
   obstructive.
   8.8.16. Visitor’s outer garments and hand-carried items will be left outside the visitation room and are
   not subject to search. Recommend visitors leave these types of items in their vehicles. If not possible
   (inclement weather, no vehicle, etc.), the controller will provide a room to store items during the visit.
   8.8.17. Agencies or groups must arrange visits through the Confinement Officer or NCO during nor-
   mal duty hours and will not be allowed visits without prior coordination.
   8.8.18. Inmates may refuse visits unless they are made by commanders/designees or first sergeants.
   8.8.19. Inmates can make one long distance, 20 minute, collect telephone call during visitation peri-
   ods. They will give the controller the number and name of person being called and wait for the con-
   troller to place the call. Inmates will pick up the extension in the cell area when told to do so by the
   controller. Telephone calls will be monitored unless they are to a chaplain or lawyer.
   8.8.20. Inmates will never be allowed personal or telephonic interviews with media representative(s).

8.9. Commander's Visits, Conferences and Privileged Communication Visits. Parent unit command-
ers or appointees (E-7 and above) are required to visit at least once every 30 days and may visit at any
time, except during “lights out.” Normally, inmates may visit with attorneys and chaplains at anytime and
will be provided a private visiting room if possible. These visits are not monitored; however, SF personnel
will standby at an adjacent location until the visit is terminated.

8.10. Inmate Administrative and Disciplinary Measures. While confined at Air Force confinement
facilities, all inmates are subject to disciplinary action for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice (UCMJ), relevant federal laws and institutional rules, even after discharge from the service. This
jurisdiction over an inmate continues even after departing an Air Force confinement facility (e.g., parole
or excess leave), as long as the inmate remains under the administrative control of the Air Force confine-
22                                                  GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002


ment program or the armed services. Misconduct is dealt with through trial by court-martial, charges
brought before a Discipline and Adjustment Board (D&A Board) and other management or administra-
tive actions. Actions taken as a result of a D&A Board do not preclude punishment under the UCMJ.
     8.10.1. All violations will be investigated by the Confinement Officer or NCO. Corrective actions,
     reports and punishment will be completed IAW guidelines in AFI 31-205.
     8.10.2. Personnel witnessing violations will immediately correct inmate misconduct and promptly
     brief the Confinement Officer or NCO.

8.11. Control of Inmate Mail. Inmates use normal mail to conduct non-emergency communications.
Outgoing mail should have no markings or return address on the envelope, which indicate the inmate’s
confinement status, past or present. The Confinement Officer ensures inmates are aware of what articles
they may receive through the mail and that inmates must notify all authorized correspondents of articles
they can and cannot receive.
     8.11.1. The confinement staff inspects incoming and outgoing mail to intercept contraband (e.g.,
     monies, valuables, stamps, etc.), to detect criminal activities and to control mail which violates postal
     regulations, contains obscenities or communicates threats.
     8.11.2. The confinement staff stores unauthorized items received in the mail with the inmate’s per-
     sonal property. They issue the inmate a receipt for such items.
     8.11.3. Privileged communications are exempt from rejection or censorship. The Confinement NCO
     will inspect the communication in the presence of the inmate-only if there is a reasonable basis to
     believe the mail contains contraband or for authenticity. Personnel considered privileged are outlined
     within AFI 31-205, paragraph 6.3.2.1.

8.12. Suicide Watch Inmates. Confinement Officers determine when it is necessary to place inmates on
suicide watch to prevent injury, maintain health or discipline standards. The Confinement Officer devel-
ops procedures to ensure the safety of suicidal inmates. The facility commander shall be notified of any
unhealthy, unsafe or unsanitary condition for immediate corrective action. Confinement staff records the
evaluations on a DD Form 509. Facility commanders or their designated representative shall conduct a
daily visit to all inmates in suicide watch.
     8.12.1. Suicide watch cells will not contain anything an inmate can use to self-inflict injury. Items to
     be considered for removal may include clothing, safety razors, removable or breakable hard plastics or
     metal objects (including bed parts) and glass. Suicide watch cells will have hard deck ceilings. NOTE:
     Items prohibited in the segregation cells are shoelaces, removable hard plastics or metal objects and
     glass.
     8.12.2. Confinement staff members or SF flight personnel conduct frequent (not to exceed 15 min-
     utes) randomly spaced cell checks. During daylight hours only, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
     coverage of suicide watch inmates is sufficient instead of 15-minute physical checks. Regardless of
     the manner used, confinement staff or controllers record the cell checks on a DD Form 509.
     8.12.3. Inmate checks will be conducted by personnel of the same gender.
     8.12.4. If same gender personnel are not available, the flight sergeant and one additional person will
     conduct the check. Ensure procedures outlined in paragraph 8.2.6. are utilized.
GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                    23


   8.12.5. Facility commanders or confinement staff will conduct a daily visit to all inmates in suicide
   watch.

8.13. Management of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Positive Inmates. Confinement Offic-
ers ensure a comprehensive education and training program is available for staff and inmates.
   8.13.1. Training. Include measures to protect against HIV transmission. Design the training to pre-
   clude rumors, correct misinformation, allay fears, and provide current factual information. Contact the
   Military Public Health office regularly to update information.
   8.13.2. Staff training topics should include:
      8.13.2.1. Apprehension and search.
      8.13.2.2. Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), first aid procedures and disposal of contami-
      nated materials.
      8.13.2.3. Evidence and property handling.
      8.13.2.4. Transporting inmates.
      8.13.2.5. Decontaminating cells and other spaces.
   8.13.3. Upon in-processing, inmate training topics should include:
      8.13.3.1. Risk factors.
      8.13.3.2. Procedures for potentially contaminated material (razors, sewing needles, bloodied
      clothing, etc.).
      8.13.3.3. First aid procedures.
   8.13.4. Custody and Control of HIV Positive Inmates. An inmate’s HIV positive status is not a con-
   sideration for transfer requirements unless deemed necessary by medical authorities.
      8.13.4.1. Confinement Officers do not separate HIV positive inmates from the general inmate
      population based solely on HIV status. Confinement Officers also consider the following when
      planning for HIV positive inmates:
          8.13.4.1.1. Medical authorities may require special handling of contaminated laundry and
          linen.
          8.13.4.1.2. Toilet and shower facilities are no different from those used by other inmates.
          8.13.4.1.3. Food service sanitation provisions are no different from those used by other
          inmates.
      8.13.4.2. Confinement Officers ensure the gaining unit is aware of the HIV positive status of the
      inmate.
   8.13.5. Assessment and Treatment of HIV Positive Inmates. Medical staff test all HIV negative
   inmates annually as scheduled by the Confinement NCO. The medical facility will determine
   post-exposure actions.
      8.13.5.1. The confinement staff provides escorts for inmates sent for testing or follow-up care.
24                                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002


        8.13.5.2. All incidents resulting in the possible transmission of an infectious disease (i.e., sexual
        contact, tattooing, intravenous drug use or body-fluid-to-body-fluid transfer) automatically
        require immediate HIV testing of participants unless all participants are HIV positive. If the con-
        finement staff finds one or more participants to be HIV positive or knew them to be HIV positive
        before the incident, medical staff immediately test all HIV negative inmates involved in an inci-
        dent.
        8.13.5.3. HIV test results are not for public dissemination.
            8.13.5.3.1. As a minimum, the medical facility shall notify the parent unit commander, 319th
            SFS/CC, and Confinement Officer or NCO of HIV positive test results. Only inform confine-
            ment staff members designated by the Confinement Officer as having a need to know which
            inmates are HIV positive.
            8.13.5.3.2. Confinement staff does not annotate HIV status in the CTF or other records unless
            the Confinement Officer, as advised by legal and medical authorities, directs the entry.
            8.13.5.3.3. Disclosure of an HIV status for official purposes should only be discussed with
            confinement, medical and dental personnel. Any voluntary statements made to that effect by
            an inmate are documented in their military records.
            8.13.5.3.4. The Confinement Officer may direct HIV testing of any inmate at any time consid-
            ered necessary, provided he/she is able to document the purpose of the testing and the neces-
            sity as a legitimate penalogical interest.
     8.13.6. Infection Control Methods. There are two aspects to this process: personal protections and
     decontamination processes.
        8.13.6.1. Personal Protection. Treat all inmates as though they may be infected. It is mandatory to
        use these basic precautions every time anyone anticipates having contact with blood, all body flu-
        ids, secretions and excretions.
            8.13.6.1.1. Always use protective equipment when handling any of the above mentioned sub-
            stances, i.e. gloves, face shields, biohazard approved containers, etc.
            8.13.6.1.2. Wash hands after any potential contact with body fluids or contaminated sub-
            stances, even if protective equipment is worn.
            8.13.6.1.3. Handle all sharp objects with caution. Use tongs, pliers, brooms and pans to handle
            sharp objects.
        8.13.6.2. Decontamination Procedures. This process protects everyone from possible exposure
        and is the confinement staff’s, escort’s and the inmate’s responsibility.
            8.13.6.2.1. Clean all equipment and surfaces as soon as possible after contact with potentially
            infectious materials. Use a solution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) diluted
            at 1 to 10 parts water for disinfection.
            8.13.6.2.2. Always use biohazard bags or containers for transporting contaminated materials
            to disposal location. NOTE: Transport all biohazard materials to the 319th MDG Clinic for
            proper disposal.
     8.13.7. When an accident happens do not panic. Immediately wash exposed skin with soap and water.
     Flush exposed mucous membranes with water. Then immediately report the incident to a supervisor.
GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                     25


8.14. Public Affairs. Access by the public to AFCS facilities should be limited to authorized tours and
visits. Care should be taken to avoid criticism, grounds of defamation, embarrassment and mental anguish
to inmates confined within the facility resulting from visit and tour policies.
   8.14.1. Videotaping and photographing of inmates will not be permitted except in support of medical
   documentation, for official identification purposes (i.e., criminal activities) or IAW AFI 35-101, Pub-
   lic Affairs Policies and Procedures. If videotaping or photography of inmates is authorized, each
   inmate must sign a consent statement.
   8.14.2. Photographing AFCS facilities is not permitted unless authorized by the confinement Officer
   or as an exception to policy when the stated purpose justifies such action. When photography is autho-
   rized, it will not include:
       8.14.2.1. Areas where detaining fences, restraining walls, bars, locks and other restraining devices
       are located.

       8.14.2.3. Scenes depicting inmates under custodial control.
       8.14.2.4. Use of restraining devices.
   8.14.3. All requests for media interviews (face-to-face, on camera or telephonic) with military
   inmates should be coordinated with Public Affairs and SF personnel. Media interviews must be con-
   ducted without compromising security procedures established by the confinement facility. Authorized
   written communication is subject to the provisions of AFI 31-205, paragraph 6.3.2.
   8.14.4. Written material prepared by inmates for publication must be submitted to the Confinement
   Officer or delegated representative for review prior to release. Additionally, such material is subject to
   national security and policy review by Public Affairs under the provisions of AFI 35-101.
   8.14.5. When possible, the confinement staff should videotape all actions involving use of force
   within the corrections environment. The tape could protect both the staff and the inmates should the
   need arise.

                                               Chapter 10

                                   USE OF FORCE PROCEDURES

10.1. General. Confinement staff members always use the minimum force necessary. In addition to the
requirements stated in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, other requirements
apply to confinement staff using force in confinement facilities.
   10.1.1. Do not use weapons when escorting or supervising medium or minimum custody inmates,
   unless the supervisor’s routine duties require a weapon; e.g., SFCC Controller or a SF patrol.
   10.1.2. Never carry a weapon (firearm, club and/or baton) or Ortho-Chlorobenzylidene Malonitrile
   (CS) gas or Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) pepper spray into the CF except in emergency situations as
   directed by the 319th SFS/CC.
   10.1.3. The 319th SFS/CC authorizes the use of MWDs to augment other inmate control procedures.
       10.1.3.1. Consider other methods of inmate control (i.e., CS gas or OC pepper spray) and MWD
       safety prior to authorizing the use of an MWD.
       10.1.3.2. When using MWD(s) for inmate control ensure the dog remains under total control of
       the handler.
       10.1.3.3. This does not prevent using MWDs for contraband control or as part of a team for a
       show of force during disorders.
   10.1.4. Use decisive action to quell riots or disturbances. Chemical irritants or high-pressure water
   may be used in extreme situations, but only under the order of the 319th SFS/CC or higher authority.
   Ensure only trained persons administer CS gas and an adequate supply of CS gas and gas masks are
   available.

10.2. Minimum Force. Examples of minimum force are:
   10.2.1. Unarmed Restraint Techniques. Unarmed restraint techniques are effective for self-defense,
   prevent escape, prevent an injury to persons, damage to property or to quell a disturbance. To control
   or move an unruly inmate, get help from confinement or other SF personnel to preclude the need to
   strike or inflict bodily injury on the inmate.
   10.2.2. Equipment and additional personnel. A show of force consists of demonstrating to inmates
   engaged in a riot or general disorder that equipment and personnel are available for use to quell such
   disorders.
       10.2.2.1. This force consists of sufficient personnel and equipment to apply the measures of force
       required by the situation.
       10.2.2.2. If the disturbance has not reached the state of overt violence and lives and the security of
       the facility are not in danger, the 319th SFS/CC or designee should consider making an attempt to
       reason with leaders of the riot or disturbance prior to further application of force.
       10.2.2.3. Steps to quell the disturbance may include:
30                                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002


            10.2.2.3.1. Informing leaders of the disturbance that forces, equipment and facilities are avail-
            able to re-establish control and continuing the riot or disorder would be futile. NOTE: This
            action is not the same as bargaining or making concessions.
            10.2.2.3.2. Issuing an order to personnel engaged in the disturbance to end their actions (this
            is more effective if the force is present).
            10.2.2.3.3. Immediately applying stronger measures of force to contain the situation when all
            attempts to reason have failed.
     10.2.3. Employing riot control formations. The 319th SFS/CC may direct using riot control teams and
     tactics when deemed necessary. In order to restore a disorder to normal and peaceful operations, SF
     personnel must be proficient in these tactics and formations.
     10.2.4. Firearms. 319th SFS/CC may approve using firearms only when all other means of restoring
     order have failed. ONLY THE GRAVEST AND MOST UNUSUAL SITUATION REQUIRES
     THE USE OF FIREARMS. The following rules apply for the safety of staff members and inmates:
        10.2.4.1. Armed escorts of maximum custody inmates should have a weapon most suited to the
        existing conditions. In selecting the type of weapon, consider the attitude and conduct of inmates,
        training of the supervisors, population density of the area, proximity of explosives or flammable
        materials, numbers of supervisors available and any other local pertinent factors.
        10.2.4.2. Hospitalized maximum custody inmates should be in a secure ward when available.
        When secure wards are not available, guards may carry handguns when the situation warrants.
        10.2.4.3. The use of a firearm must be in compliance with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force
        by Air Force Personnel.
GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                   31


                                               Chapter 11

                             INMATE WORK DETAIL PROCEDURES

11.1. Work Programs. Confinement Officers set up local inmate work programs that are consistent with
custody level and civilian employment potential. Inmates should perform duties or services, which con-
tribute to Air Force mission, as well as the inmate’s rehabilitation.
   11.1.1. Post-trial inmates will be assigned to tasks duty airmen may perform. When assigning work to
   inmates the confinement staff will consider the following:
       11.1.1.1. Pre-trial detainees must not be assigned work as disciplinary action. They will perform
       house-cleaning tasks with post-trial inmates in their cell, bay or dormitory. They may volunteer, in
       writing, for work assignments commensurate with their grade.
       11.1.1.2. Assign officer inmates to clean their assigned living quarters area, not including com-
       mon areas. Officer inmates may request, in writing, other work assignments. The installation
       319th SFS/CC approves requests.
       11.1.1.3. SFCC controller will ensure personnel escorting inmates for details complete a DD
       Form 2712, Inmate Work and Training Evaluation, at termination of the detail.

11.2. Duty Hours Details. During normal duty hours, inmates should work in a work outlet commensu-
rate with their custody grade. Assignments should focus on obtaining and learning a skill the inmate may
use upon discharge from the Air Force. NOTE: This does not preclude periodically assigning inmates to
details such as base litter patrol.
   11.2.1. Inmates with special skills (for example, mechanic, electrician, and carpenter) should receive
   work assignments to put their skill to productive use. Prohibit the following types of inmate employ-
   ment:
       11.2.1.1. Operating a vehicle.
       11.2.1.2. Handling classified material, medical or mental health records, personal or official mail,
       personal property, funds or sensitive files.
       11.2.1.3. Working with hazardous materials, such as access to drugs, narcotics, intoxicants, fire-
       arms or munitions.
       11.2.1.4. Providing personal services or working in an authoritative capacity over another individ-
       ual.
       11.2.1.5. Labor inherently more hazardous than required of active duty personnel, which violates
       civilian labor contracts, or under the supervision of a non-DOD foreign national.
       11.2.1.6. Food service, unless in a correction dining facility.
       11.2.1.7. Labor that permits close association with the opposite gender, unless closely supervised.
       11.2.1.8. Labor bringing financial gain to inmates or the confinement staff, may bring criticism to
       the United States military, or violate Air Force standards of conduct.
       11.2.1.9. Performing work details outside the facility on Sundays and federal holidays, unless the
       inmate(s) volunteer(s) in writing. Non-Christian inmates, who sincerely practice their religion,
32                                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002


        and non-religious individuals, will share in the Sunday and federal holiday exception, or will be
        reasonably accommodated when practical.

11.3. Non Duty Hours Details. Inmates will only conduct essential CF maintenance tasks on Sundays
and holidays and must volunteer in writing to perform other details.
     11.3.1. Inmates are normally employed during their assigned duty hours or at the direction of the
     Confinement NCO or Officer.
     11.3.2. Inmates may volunteer in writing to complete details after duty hours. Inmate(s) will complete
     the Inmate Voluntary Work Statement prior to starting after duty hours details.
GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002                                                                   33


                                              Chapter 12

                                       SUICIDE PREVENTION

12.1. Training. Confinement staff will receive training on suicide prevention. This training will include,
identification/screening, communication, intervention, reporting, follow-up and review.
   12.1.1. Confinement staff become first-line supervisors of inmates. They normally have daily contact
   with inmates and are in a position to readily identify inmates that exhibit suicidal intentions.
   12.1.2. Escorts are normally from an inmate’s parent unit and should know how to detect suicidal
   behavior and provide intervention.

12.2. Identification/Screening. Incarcerated persons are at higher suicide risk than the general popula-
tion. Inmate suicide rates can be as much as 10 times higher than the general population. The periods
immediately following an arrest or after a transfer from one institution to another appear to be most dan-
gerous.
   12.2.1. The confinement staff conducts an interview with inmates during in-processing to help with
   identifying inmates who may be contemplating suicide.
       12.2.1.1. In order to properly evaluate suicidal potential of the inmate, confinement staff needs to
       create a cooperative atmosphere during the initial interview.
       12.2.1.2. Confinement staff should not avoid asking direct questions about suicide. If the inmate
       appears uncomfortable talking about the subject, staff should contact Mental Health Providers
       (MHPs) for assistance.
       12.2.1.3. MHPs conduct an initial interview and records review for all inprocessed inmates within
       24 hours of confinement. MHPs will brief confinement staff on any issues that may affect the
       inmates’ confinement status. Additionally, confinement staff will brief MHPs on any issues that
       come to light during inprocessing.

12.3. Communication. Most people communicate warning signs of how they are reacting to or feeling
about events that are drawing them to suicide. These warning signs or invitations are the person’s way of
asking for help.
   12.3.1. Warning signs can come in the form of direct statements, physical signs, emotional reactions
   or behavioral cues.
   12.3.2. Confinement staff should always be on the look out for these signs.

12.4. Intervention. Confinement staff and escorts are responsible for the welfare of inmates. Be ready to
offer on-the-spot help to inmates possibly thinking of suicide.
   12.4.1. The first objective is to prevent the occurrence of self-injury or death. Intervene until the
   immediate danger or threat of suicide has passed or until additional assistance and resources can be
   accessed. During these crisis situations use the following steps to defuse the situation:
       12.4.1.1. Engage in conversation with the inmate. Try to explore the inmates’ situation from their
       point of view by encouraging the open expression of their concerns.
34                                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI31-205 1 SEPTEMBER 2002


        12.4.1.2. Seek professional assistance immediately. Contact medical, mental health, and law
        enforcement to assist.
        12.4.1.3. Be prepared to use physical restraint to prevent an inmate from harming themselves or
        others. NOTE: Never use lethal weapons to intimidate an inmate into compliance during a suicide
        situation. The inmate may try to use “suicide by cop” techniques.
        12.4.1.4. Inmates identified as a suicide risk will be housed IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction.

12.5. Reporting. Immediately notify the confinement staff any time there is a suicide threat, attempt,
incident or a concern that an inmate may be considering suicide.
     12.5.1. The confinement staff will provide guidance and action to take to escorts or SF Flight person-
     nel.
     12.5.2. The Confinement Officer or NCO will ensure all required notifications and reports are com-
     pleted IAW applicable instructions and checklists.

12.6. Follow-Up and Review. Confinement staff must continue to monitor inmates that pose a suicide
risk even after the initial crisis is over.
     12.6.1. Confinement staff needs to work hand-in-hand with MHPs to continue to ensure the safety
     and security of inmates and the facility
     12.6.2. After any incident, a review of actions taken, procedures and documentation should be con-
     ducted to identify any discrepancy and have them corrected.
