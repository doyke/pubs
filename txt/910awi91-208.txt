SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the initial publication of 910th Airlift Wing Instruction 91-208
 2                                                                910AWI 91-208 19 JULY 2011


1. General. Safety is paramount and is everyone’s responsibility. Observe safety practices
during all operations that involve the use of lasers. The two-person concept will be in force at all
times. Any concerns or questions on laser operation and safety should be directed to the Base
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) 910th Medical Squadron, Enviromental Health Office (910
MDS/SGPB). Safety Precautions for LAIRCM Aircraft.
2. Safety Precautions. The following safety precautions will be strictly adhered to:
     2.1. All personnel involved with the LAIRCM system operational check, working on or
     around the aircraft will be trained in Laser Radiation safety. The concept of restricted access
     to the aircraft to only personnel directly involved in the LAIRCM maintenance will be
     strictly enforced. Personnel will be trained in accordance with: AFI 91-202, The US Air
     Force Mishap Prevention Program, AFI 91-202, AFRC Sup 1, The US Air Force Mishap
     Prevention Program, 910 AWI 40-201, Radiation Safety, and AFOSH 48-139, Laser
     Radiation Protection Program.
        2.1.1. Vehicles, aircraft, and unauthorized personnel not directly involved with the
        LAIRCM system operational check will remain at least 200 feet from the aircraft under
        test. A safety zone will be cordoned off in accordance with the hazard zone drawing (see
        attachment 2). A safety zone radius of 43 meters (141 feet) will be established when one
        laser transmitter is in the field-of-view and 61 meters (200 feet) when two lasers
        transmitters are in the field-of-view prior to the start of the operational check. Open
        beam paths shall be clearly identified and shall not cross populated areas, traffic paths,
        unauthorized airspace, or enter into any other unauthorized space.
        2.1.2. During periods of laser maintenance activity, a minimum of two Laser Safety
        Observers will be in direct communication with other LAIRCM test personnel. A
        LAIRCM Team Supervisor will be stationed in the aircraft cockpit monitoring the
        LAIRCM systems controls ensuring that should any aircraft, vehicle, or other personnel
        enter the LAIRCM Nominal Hazard Safety Zone that the LAIRCM system will be placed
        to the ‘OFF” position. The Avionics personnel in the cockpit will be the LAIRCM team
        supervisor and will be in constant radio contact with the Maintenance Operation Control
        Center (MOCC)/ Flightline Expeditor. Personnel trained as Laser Safety Observers will
        be identified on an appointment letter signed by the 910th Maintenance Group
        Commander (910 MXG/CC). These individuals will have eye examinations scheduled
        by Occupational Health with the ophthalmologist or optometrist as required by 910 AWI
        40-201 paragraph 15.4, Medical Examinations.
        2.1.3. When lasers are being tested during the operational check, authorized personnel
        inside the hazard zone will wear ANSI Z136.1-2007 approved laser protective goggles
        issued by the Avionics Flight and clothing to cover as much of exposed skin as possible
        to include long sleeved shirt or outer garment.
        2.1.4. Personnel operating the equipment will take every precaution to prevent laser
        beams from extending in any runway, taxiway, movement area, or towards any person,
        vehicle, or building.
        2.1.5. Discontinue all operations when lightning is within 5 nautical miles or the wind
        speed exceeds 30 knots.
910AWI 91-208 19 JULY 2011                                                                      3


      2.1.6. Operational checks will not be conducted during periods of darkness unless
      authorized by 910 MXG/CC.
   2.2. Unexpected Conditions. Any unusual or unexpected occurrences that affect the safety
   of personnel and/or aircraft will be grounds for immediate suspension or termination of the
   operation. The operation will not continue until the condition is removed. The Team
   Supervisor will be the responsible individual to determine if the operation can be continued
   safely. The operation will not continue until the Team Supervisor gives his approval.
3. Aircraft Parking Locations.
   3.1. For the system operational check requiring laser maintenance operation, the primary
   testing location will be the Spot 1 on the YARS parking ramp, nose of the aircraft pointing in
   a South Easterly direction up the ramp as per attachment 2.There will not be any other
   aircraft on spots 1A, 1F, 2 and 3 to allow for the nominal hazard zone properly. The alternate
   testing location will be the upper aircraft parking ramp, on Spot 13 with no other aircraft on
   spots 11-15. The aircraft will also be turned with the nose of the aircraft in a south easterly
   direction as per Attachment 3. The alternate locations will only be used if the primary testing
   location is unavailable, not just for the ease of maintenance. The aircraft will be parked
   observing the nominal hazard zone as specified in paragraph 4.3.
   3.2. Aircraft towing and parking will be coordinated with the Airfield Manager to the
   approved Laser Maintenance testing spots by Maintenance Supervision. Avionics Flight
   Supervision will coordinate with the Maintenance Pro-Super, Maintenance Operations
   Control (MOC), Wing Safety Office, Bioenvironmental Health, and Security Forces to
   ensure the LAIRCM maintenance can be accomplished safely, efficiently, and in a timely
   manner, in compliance with all applicable references listed in this instruction.
4. System Operational Check. For the procedures to operational check the LAIRCM system,
refer to T.O. 1C-130H-2-99JG-10-6, section 1, for the specific step-by-step procedures.
   4.1. Maintenance Team. The team will consist of at least four team members. Two fully
   qualified Avionics technicians with the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) of 2A5X3C, one of
   which will be the LAIRCM Team Supervisor, and a minimum of two trained Laser Safety
   Observers.
   4.2. Safety Briefing. The LAIRCM Team Supervisor will conduct a safety briefing prior to
   the starting of the system operational check and be responsible for the entire task. No step
   within the task shall be performed until a specific request is made by the LAIRCM Team
   Supervisor. The safety briefing will contain as a minimum:
      4.2.1. Assigned tasks and responsibilities to all maintenance personnel involved in the
      task.
      4.2.2. A review of the LAIRCM Safety Summaries listed in the T.O. 1C-130H-2-99JG-
      10-6.

       4.2.5. Review of any supplemental technical data such as Interim Operational
       supplements or        Technical Assistance Requests (TARs) pertaining to the LAIRCM
       system and its operation.
       4.2.6. Emergency Procedures. The procedures will contain as a minimum:
           4.2.6.1. Evacuation route, distance, and location.
           4.2.6.2. Procedures in case of fire.
           4.2.6.3. Procedures for notification of the emergency. The LAIRCM Team
           Supervisor will notify MOCC by radio of the circumstances of the emergency.
    4.3. Nominal Hazard Zone (NHZ). The Nominal Hazard Zone for the C-130 configuration
    will be 200 feet to the forward and aft of the aircraft where both lasers are in the field of view
    and 141 feet to the left and right of the aircraft where only one laser is in the field of view,
    see attachment 2. The maintenance team will cordon off the Nominal Hazard Zone (NHZ)
    area as shown in Attachment 2 with a minimum of 8 safety cones, with 2 each at the front of
    the NHZ spaced evenly, 2 each at the each wing tip spaced evenly, and 2 each at the tail of
    the aircraft, spaced evenly, to secure the area of operation prior to start of the operational
    check. The safety cones will have a laser symbol/placard displayed. The team will remain
    vigilant throughout the operation to ensure unauthorized personnel, vehicles, or aircraft do
    not enter the marked off area during the operation. The safety cones will remain around the
    aircraft until the check is completed.
    4.4. Operational Check Notification. The LAIRCM Team Supervisor will notify the Flight
    Line Expediter, who will then notify MOCC of the start of the LAIRCM operational check.
    MOCC will then comply with the LAIRCM Maintenance Notification checklist. The
    Notification checklist will include the FAA Control Tower, Wing Safety, Security Forces,
    and Fire Department, informing them that a LAIRCM system operational check involving
    lasers will be conducted and to avoid movement into or near that location of the testing. The
    LAIRCM Team Supervisor will notify the Flight Line Expediter who will then relay that
    information to MOCC informing them when the operation on the aircraft is completed.
    MOCC will then inform offices on the LAIRCM checklist when the operation is complete.
