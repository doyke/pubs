1. Overview.
   1.1. The 916 ARW Commander's Coin Recognition Program provides an informal means to
   recognize individuals and small groups for one-time contributions of superior performance or
   personal effort.
   1.2. The Coin Recognition Program recognizes superior performance directly contributing to
   mission accomplishment in a manner not covered by any other 916 ARW awards program.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   2.1. The Wing Commander will approve all coin recipients.
2                                                         916ARWI36-2805 17 AUGUST 2009


    2.2. The 916 ARW/CCE will maintain control of Wing recognition coins and secure, track
    and document the presentation of Wing coins.
       2.2.1. The coins used in this award program must be purchased with appropriated funds
       in accordance with AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
       2.2.2. Coin inventory will be tracked by spreadsheet to include:
           2.2.2.1. Name and rank/civilian grade of presenter and recipient.
           2.2.2.2. Recipient organization.
           2.2.2.3. Date and purpose of award.
3. Eligible Recipients.
    3.1. Any military member or appropriated fund employee assigned to Seymour Johnson Air
    Force Base, North Carolina. Commanders may approve, on a limited basis, the award of a
    recognition coin to an individual assigned outside their unit/installation providing they meet
    the criteria in paragraph 1 and have made a significant contribution to the mission of their
    unit; however, coins purchased with appropriated funds may not be given to non-appropriate
    fund employees. In addition, they may not be used as tokens of appreciation for government
    officials, foreign officials or non-Federal personnel in recognition of general support or
    improved community relations. Coins for these types of officials, however, may be
    purchased with official representation funds for situations covered by AFI 65-603, Official
    Representation Funds - Guidance and Procedures, para. 4.
4. Criteria.
    4.1. The criteria to receive a Commander's Recognition Coin are broad; however,
    Commanders should limit awards to those who have gone above and beyond the normal call
    of duty. This program is established to recognize superior performance and recognition coins
    cannot, under any circumstances, be used as mementos.
