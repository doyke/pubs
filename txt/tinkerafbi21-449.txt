6                                                     TINKERAFBI21-449 11 MARCH 2009


    9.7.2. 76 PMXG: Prior to testing the engine, remove all protective covers and check the
    engine visually for any foreign objects. Examine air intake for damage or cracked inlet
    guide vanes, compressor blades, and stator vanes. Check bell mouth for serviceability,
    loose/missing hardware, damaged/delaminating screen and compressor inlet for nuts,
    bolts, wire, tools, and other foreign objects. Use bright lights and other inspection tools as
    necessary. Check bell mouth and proper mounting condition and make a visual check of
    the engine and test cell for foreign objects. Prior to initial start and after any rework of the
    engine, sweep and wash down the test cell with an approved cleaning solution. Rinse the
    test cell by directing the water in such a manner to ensure all dirt, sludge, etc. is washed
    to the drain. Sweep excess water into the drain. After wash down, make an extensive
    visual inspection of the engine, test stand, and cell area to ensure no foreign objects are
    present.
    9.7.3. 76 PMXG: After completion of engine test, install protective coverings on all
    tubes, lines, connectors, and openings. Engines will not be transported to or from test
    without protective covers installed on all openings. Each workstation will perform an
    inspection for FO before sending the completed engine or component part to the next
    station. When an engine or component part is received, it will be inspected for FO prior
    to installation, assembly, test, or shipment.
    9.7.4. 76 PMXG: All engines will be inspected during work scope for FOD. Engines
    received for reasons other than FOD (i.e. vibration, overtemp, etc.) where significant
    FOD is found, must be reported. The description of damage, cause, if known and
    approximate cost of damage will be provided to 76 PMXG/QI and Group FOD Program
    Manager. These procedures will be used when damage is confined to the engine or to
    integral engine components such as engine mounted accessory gearboxes and plumbing.
    9.7.5. 76 PMXG: Cleanliness of aisles is a must. Therefore, all supervisors will take
    responsibility for cleaning and maintaining all aisles adjacent to or running through their
    production shop. If two shops share an aisle, both will be responsible from their shop to
    the center of the shared aisle. Supervisors may assign a monitor to ensure the aisle(s) are
    maintained and clean at all times.
    9.7.6. 76 PMXG: Due to safety and FOD concerns in 76 PMXG industrial areas, the
    following clarification is provided. While in an industrial work center/shop (inside the
    yellow lines and other designated production areas), 76 PMXG personnel will not be
    permitted to wear jewelry. This policy will help reduce the risk of injury by mitigating
    the risks incurred by wearing jewelry in an industrial area. Types of jewelry that shall be
    controlled in the industrial work/shop areas include (but are not limited to) rings,
    watches, bracelets, earrings and necklaces. Placing tape over rings or wearing gloves on
    the hand with a ring does not provide protection or eliminate the requirement to remove
    finger rings. Where appropriate, managers, supervisors, or local safety staff may add to
    these restrictions to include location or shop unique requirements. The exception to this
    rule will be medical identification jewelry when worn in accordance with 76 MXWOI
    91-31, Para 5.4.2. Personal items will not be worn hanging from a belt. This includes, but
    is not limited to keys, pocket watches, chains, and metal insignias/badges. This policy
    extends to all visitors, engineers, administrative and support personnel that enter the
    industrial work/shop areas.

   9.8. 76 MXSG: Industrial Services shop stock items, hardware, left over direct and indirect
   material and/or project and work order residue will be controlled IAW AFMCI 21-127 upon
   task completion and/or end of shift.
10. FOD Walks.
   10.1. 76 AMXG supervisors are responsible for their respective areas. FOD walks may be
   postponed due to inclement weather, but they will not be cancelled. Scheduled FOD walks
   that land on holidays will be accomplished the following work day. Additional FOD walks
   will be scheduled as needed. FOD walks will be conducted IAW 76 AMXG OI 21-37. PPE
   (safety glasses, ear plugs) are only required if walking through a parking spot with an aircraft
   undergoing maintenance or when engine run operations are being conducted during FOD
   walks.
   10.2. 76 CMXG and 76 PMXG supervisors are responsible for their respective high potential
   FO areas. FOD walk/sweeps will be conducted on the last day of each work week.
   10.3. 76 AMXG: Personnel will take the following actions prior to any aircraft taxi
   operation:
      10.3.1. 76 AMXG: Functional Check Flight (FCF) Launched Aircraft: FOD sweeps by
      the ramp sweeper or MAD VAC and or FOD Boss will be accomplished 50 feet forward
      of engines on parking spot and flightline taxi lane prior to launch and recovery of any 10
      FLTS aircraft. A complete and thorough FOD walk of the FCF aircraft parking spot and
      flightline taxi lane will be accomplished prior to launch and recovery of any 10 FLTS
      aircraft.
      10.3.2. 76 AMXG: Depot Arrivals: A FOD walk will be accomplished on the proposed
      parking spot and taxi lanes for any arrival or departure aircraft. Special care will be given to
      B-1B parking and taxi routes.
      10.3.3. 76 AMXG: B1-B aircraft engine runs and taxi will be preceded by FOD walks
      and running the FOD Boss as outlined in the FOD BOSS Procedures for ALC B1-B
      Aircraft Taxi and Launch Memorandum of Understanding (MOA) and TAFBI 13-201,
      Flight and Ground Operations, Para, 5.16. Any damaged pavement in or near aircraft
      parking ramps and taxi ways should be reported immediately to the Wing and or Group
      FOD Focal Points.
   10.4. 76 MXW: Personnel will inspect for and remove ALL foreign material from engine
   inlet areas and within a 50-foot radius of engines prior to operation (or greater if required by
   Mission, Design, Series (MDS) specific T.O.) and any engine intake/inlet maintenance.
   10.5. Aircraft parking ramps, taxi ways, and adjacent areas should remain FO free at all
   times. It is the responsibility of all maintenance personnel working in these areas to pick up
   and dispose of all FO on a daily basis.
11. Hardware Control/Caps, Plugs, Covers.
   11.1. In the event hardware is known to be unaccounted for in defined high potential FOD
   areas, a search will be accomplished IAW AFI 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1, Chapter 10,
   Para, 10.12.4. If the hardware is not found within one hour, an AFMC IMT 310 Lost/Found
   Item Report will be initiated.
8                                                      TINKERAFBI21-449 11 MARCH 2009


    11.2. Groups are encouraged to incorporate Total Component Management (TCM) or kitting
    whenever practical.
    11.3. Caps, plugs, and covers that are fitted to the component or equipment are the item of
    choice. If these items are not available, other items such as plastic/cloth bags held on by zip
    ties, rubber bands, or tape may be used unless it is not safe for use or a specific covering is
    required by tech data. If plastic bags are used, they may fill with fluid; bags will be
    monitored and replaced if fluid accumulation occurs. NOTE: Never stuff an item such as a
    rag or paper towel in an opening.
       11.3.1. 76 SMXG: IAW AFI 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1, the use of plugs and caps for
       FOD prevention will apply to all 76 MXW maintenance areas except:
           11.3.1.1. Research, development, or testing laboratories environments (i.e. Software,
           Precision Measurement, Environmental) due to the controlled environmental
           conditions which exist and the absence of maintenance action which generate residue.
           11.3.1.2. This does not alleviate these areas from using protective plugs and caps
           when specific repair, maintenance, or testing is accomplished on any equipment or
           requirements IAW T.O. 00-20-14, Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program. In
           addition, all stored assets and unmated connectors on units that contain circuitry
           susceptible to Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) damage shall be protected IAW T.O
           00-25-234 General Shop Practice Requirements for Repair, Maintenance and Test of
           Electrical Equipment.
           11.3.1.3. Do not use caps on energized (in use) equipment.
           11.3.1.4. ESD caps are conductive (Ref: TO 00-25-234, ESD Protective Equipment
           Table 7-3, Item Number 143-187) which poses a safety concern to personnel and
           equipment. Do not use any other type of cap which may restrict cooling air flow and
           may cause equipment to overheat which may result in damage to equipment (Ref:
           AFMCI 21-101, 14.41.2.1.3.).
           11.3.1.5. Utilize caps where feasible.
