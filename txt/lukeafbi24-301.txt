SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revision
includes changing the title from Pick Up and Delivery Procedures to Documented Cargo
Operations. Prescribes Luke AFB Form 331, Delivery/Shipment Reject Discrepancy Report.


SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION, OVERVIEW, AND RESPONSIBILITIES
1.1. INTRODUCTION - Documented Cargo Operations delivers assets to organizations on
Luke AFB. The primary method to track the distribution of cargo is through the use of the
 2                                                          LUKEAFBI24-301 11 APRIL 2011


Standard Asset Tracking System (SATS), an automated system. The alternate method is by
paper documents such as the DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document.

1.2. OVERVIEW – Assets to be delivered to base customers are moved to staging locations by
56 LRS personnel from Receiving, Central Storage, Aircraft Parts Store, Flight Service Center,
and Hazardous Materials Pharmacy (HAZMART). Documented Cargo personnel distribute the
staged assets to authorized base customers.

1.3. RESPONSIBILITIES
     1.3.1. The Vehicle Operations Element is responsible for Documented Cargo operations at
     Luke AFB. To accomplish this, a sub-motor pool staffed by Vehicle Operations personnel is
     located and dispatched from the supply warehouse, Building 945. The Vehicle Operations
     Control Center Chief Dispatcher is the NCOIC and delegates daily supervision of
     Documented Cargo to a Vehicle Operations NCO assigned to the sub-motor pool.
     1.3.2. The Receiving, Central Storage, Aircraft Parts Store, Flight Service Center, and
     HAZMART staging assets for delivery will:
        1.3.2.1. Ensure labels/documents (SATS labels, DD Forms 1348-1A, serviceability tags,
        etc.) are properly affixed to assets. Adequate delivery information (e.g., SATS ―Ship To‖
        address) must be included on labels/documents. Attachments should not compromise
        asset packaging (e.g., stapling factory envelopes, ESD pouches, etc.).
        1.3.2.2. Ensure assets are properly packaged to prevent spillage, loss and/or damage.
        1.3.2.3. Move assets to the proper staging locations. See Attachment 2.
        1.3.2.4. Cargo rejected for delivery or shipment, for any reason, is the responsibility of
        the originating activity (e.g., Receiving, Central Storage, Aircraft Parts Store, Flight
        Service Center, and HAZMART). The asset is physically returned by Documented
        Cargo to a staging location of the originating activity during resolution of delivery
        discrepancies. The asset is moved in SATS under a SATS User ID of the originating
        activity. See Attachment 3.
        1.3.2.5. The activities staging assets for delivery (Receiving, Central Storage, Aircraft
        Parts Store, Flight Service Center, and HAZMART) will ensure delivery information
        discrepancies are resolved promptly. The Materiel Management Flight is the overall
        OPR for all delivery document issues. Documented Cargo will use a discrepancy report
        to document the reason(s) why an asset couldn't be delivered or shipped. The report will
        be attached to asset and/or paperwork for the originating activity to correct; see Luke
        AFB Form 331, Delivery/Shipment Reject Discrepancy Report. Once discrepancies are
        resolved, the activity who originally staged the asset will forward the completed
        discrepancy report to Documented Cargo who, in turn, will forward to the Vehicle
        Operations Control Center. These reports will also be used to facilitate analysis of
        common causes preventing delivery of cargo resulting in assets being returned to the
        Deployment and Distribution Flight (IAW AFI 24-301, Section. 2D, paragraph 2.27.).
        1.3.3. The 56 LRS Customer Service will provide Documented Cargo with current
        copies of the Classified Receipt Listing. The M24 listing is available through the Air
LUKEAFBI24-301 11 APRIL 2011                                                              3


      Force Portal and if there are changes made, Customer service will notify Documented
      Cargo to download a new copy.
SECTION 2 NORMAL HANDLING PROCEDURES:
   2.1. The 56 LRS, Materiel Management Flight, and Central Storage will transfer all Issues
   to Documented Cargo for delivery on the next available scheduled sweep. Customers can
   arrange for pickup by calling Central Storage at x6119.
   2.2. The 56 LRS, Documented Cargo will:
      2.2.1. Deliver assets to on-base customers using scheduled sweep times of Monday –

      2.2.5. Movement of Outbound Cargo (Shipments)
          2.2.5.1. Outbound cargo is moved from staging locations at the supply warehouse,
          Building 945, to Outbound Freight, Building 948, moving priority assets (MICAPs,
          etc.) first.
          2.2.5.2. Priority outbound cargo will continue to be delivered to Outbound Freight
          throughout the day until 1000 for classified assets, 1400 for 777 (non-MICAP
          priority) assets, and 1530 for MICAPs (unclassified) assets.

       OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS HEALTH HAZARD (HAZMAT) ASSETS

A5.1. HAZMAT assets delivered by Documented Cargo staff to Luke AFB customers will
always be in the category of ―Non-reportable Quantities‖ as defined in CFR 49. Delivery of
HAZMAT assets requires Documented Cargo staff to ensure that special care be taken to prevent
injury to personnel and damage to government property or the environment.
A5.2. Documented Cargo staff will ensure that HAZMAT assets are either moved in SATS to
their personal delivery locations by scanning with the Hand-Held Terminal (HHT) or signed for
in Block 22, ―Received By‖ on the DD Form 1348-1A ―Issue Release/Receipt Document‖.
A5.3. Documented Cargo staff will ensure that the appropriate ―Spill Containment Kit‖
accompanies them before picking up HAZMAT assets.
A5.4. HAZMAT assets will be secured (properly orientated, e.g. ―UP‖ arrows, etc.) in delivery
vehicles to prevent spillage.
A5.5. Spill Response and Containment (IAW 56 FW OPLAN 705, Annex C, Appendix 1).
   A5.5.1. Upon discovery of a spill of HAZMAT, Documented Cargo staff will immediately
   contact the Vehicle Operations Control Center (VOCC) Chief Dispatcher.
   A5.5.2. The VOCC Chief Dispatcher will act as the immediate On-Scene Commander
   (OSC) until relieved by Fire Personnel.
   A5.5.3. The VOCC Chief Dispatcher will refer to the Spill Response Guide contained in the
   delivery vehicle Route Book to determine the proper spill response.

                OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS, PILFERABLE ASSETS

A6.1. Pilferable materiel includes items that are vulnerable to theft because of their ready
resale potential or sensitive items. Assets staged for delivery are secured in the padlocked
―Pilferable Holding Cage‖ in the supply warehouse.
A6.2. Central Storage controls access to the ―Pilferable Holding Cage‖. To access pilferable
assets, Documented Cargo delivery staff must sign out ―Key #2‖ in Central Storage’s Key Issue
Log. Once the pilferable assets are removed, return the key and annotate the Key Issue Log.
A6.3. Documented Cargo delivery staff will ensure special care and attention is given while
handling these assets to ensure they are safeguarded.

   OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS, ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) ASSETS

A7.1. ESD packaged assets will be marked with labels cautioning special handling
requirements (see figure below).




A7.2. The Documented Cargo supervisor should be notified immediately if at any time the seal
is compromised (torn, punctured, stapled, etc). The NCOIC of Central Storage should then be
notified to have the asset re-inspected and have the packaged re-sealed.
A7.3. ESD items will be delivered in a sealed package.
A7.4. Documented Cargo delivery staff will have customers sign for delivery of ESD packaged
assets before permitting customers to open them. If customers require inspection before taking
custody, customers will be advised that the package cannot be delivered. Documented Cargo
delivery staff will return the un-opened ESD packaged asset to the supply warehouse. Delivery
customers may inspect the asset at the ESD workstation in the supply warehouse.
