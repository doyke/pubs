         ENERGY EFFICIENCY CRITERIA AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

2.1. Federal Requirements for Energy Efficiency:

2.1.1. Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT). This Act established conservation and energy efficiency
requirements for government and consumers. For Federal agencies, EPACT requires a 20 percent
reduction in per-square-foot energy consumption by 2000, compared to a 1985 baseline. EPACT
authorizes DOE to issue rules and guidance on Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) for
Federal agencies. It requires Federal agencies to train and utilize energy managers, and it directs the
Office of Management and Budget to issue guidelines for accurate assessment of energy consumption by
Federal buildings.

2.1.2. Executive Order (EO) 12902, Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation at Federal Facilities,
dated March 8, 1994. Note: EO 12902 has been revoked by EO 13123 as discussed in paragraph 2.1.3,
but is still discussed here for historical completeness. For Federal agencies, this EO requires a 30 percent
reduction in per gross square foot energy consumption by 2005 compared to 1985 to the extent that
these measures are cost effective. It also requires a 20 percent energy efficiency increase in industrial
facilities by 2005 compared to 1990 to the extent that these measures are cost effective. Finally, the EO
requires the procurement of products in the top 25 percent of their class in energy efficiency where cost-
effective and where they meet the agency’s performance requirements. The following is an excerpt of
Section 507, Procurement of Energy Efficient Products by Federal Agencies:

       “(a) “Best Practice” Technologies. Agencies shall purchase energy efficient products in
       accordance with the guidelines issued by OMB, in consultation with the Defense
       Logistics Agency (DLA), DOE, and GSA, under Section 161 of the Energy Policy Act
       of 1992. The guidelines shall include listings of energy efficient products and practices
       used in the Federal Government. At a minimum, OMB shall update the listing annually.
       DLA, DOE, and GSA shall update the portions of the listings for which they have
       responsibility as new products become available and conditions change.

         (1) Each Agency shall purchase products listed as energy-efficient in the guidelines
         whenever practicable, and whenever they meet the Agency’s specific performance
         requirements and are cost-effective. Each Agency shall institute mechanisms to set
         targets and measure progress.

         (2) To further encourage a market for highly-energy-efficient products, each agency
         shall increase, to the extent practicable and cost-effective, purchase of products that are
         in the upper 25 percent of energy efficiency for all similar products, or products that
         are at least 10 percent more efficient than the minimum level that meets Federal
         standards. This requirement shall apply wherever such information is available, either
         through Federal or industry approved testing and rating procedures.

         (3) GSA and DLA, in consultation with DOE, other agencies, States, and industry and
         other nongovernment organizations, shall provide all agencies with information on

                                                     6
         specific products that meet the energy efficient criteria of this section.      Product
         information should be made available in both printed and electronic formats.”

2.1.3. EO 13123, Greening the Government Through Efficient Energy Management, dated June 3,
1999. This 1999 EO is the latest document governing energy efficiency and continues to confirm that
energy efficient products must be considered and applied wherever they are life-cycle cost-effective. EO
13123 also revokes EO 12902. EO 13123 requires, through life-cycle cost-effective measures, that each
agency reduce energy consumption per gross square foot of its facilities by 30 percent by 2005 and 35
percent by 2010 relative to 1985. The following is an excerpt of Section 403(b), ENERGY STAR® and
Other Energy Efficient Products:

       “(1) Agencies shall select, where life-cycle cost effective, ENERGY STAR® and other
       energy efficient products when acquiring energy-using products. For product groups
       where ENERGY STAR® labels are not yet available, agencies shall select products that
       are in the upper 25 percent of energy efficiency as designated by FEMP. The
       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE shall expedite the process of
       designating products as ENERGY STAR® and will merge their current efficiency rating
       procedures.

         (2) GSA and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), with assistance from EPA and
         DOE, shall create clear catalogue listings that designate these products in both print
         and electronic formats. In addition, GSA and DLA shall undertake pilot projects from
         selected energy-using products to show a “second price tag”, which means an
         accounting of the operating and purchase costs of the item, in both printed and
         electronic catalogues and assess the impact of providing this information on Federal
         purchasing decisions.

         (3) Agencies shall incorporate energy efficient criteria consistent with ENERGY
         STAR® and other FEMP-designated energy efficiency levels into all guide
         specifications and project specifications developed for new construction and
         renovation, as well as into product specification language developed for Basic Ordering
         Agreements, Blanket Purchasing Agreements, Government Wide Acquisition
         Contracts, and all other purchasing procedures.”

2.1.4. 10 CFR Part 435, Energy Conservation Voluntary Performance Standards for New Buildings:
Mandatory for Federal Buildings. This regulation establishes performance standards to be used in the
design of new Federal commercial and multifamily high rise buildings. Some of the guidelines are
relevant to retrofits. Article 435.106 specifies minimum acceptable full load motor efficiencies for single
speed polyphase motors that are expected to operate more than 500 hours per year.

2.1.5. 10 CFR Part 436, Federal Energy Management and Planning Programs. This regulation
establishes procedures for determining the life-cycle cost effectiveness of energy conservation measures,
and for prioritizing energy conservation measures in retrofits of existing Federal buildings.

2.1.6. 48 CFR Part 23.704, Federal Contracting Preference Programs for Environmentally Preferable
and Energy Efficient Products and Services. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require that
agencies implement cost-effective contracting preference programs favoring the acquisition of

                                                    7
environmentally preferable and energy efficient products and services. With regard to obtaining energy
efficient products, the criteria include a requirement that procured products are in the upper 25 percent of
energy efficiency for all similar products, or products must be at least 10 percent more efficient than the
minimum level that meets Federal standards (Executive Order 12902, Section 507).

2.2. Guidance for Energy Efficiency Analysis:

2.2.1. Electric motor systems that operate continuously or for many hours a year consume electricity that
costs many times the price of the motor. This makes less efficient motors excellent targets for
replacement. If the driven load operates at less than full load for a majority of the time, installing ASDs
will reduce energy consumption and save operating costs.

2.2.2. Fan motors in air handlers can account for 20 percent or more of energy usage in a commercial-
type building. Energy costs of air distribution systems can be significantly decreased by converting
constant volume systems to variable air volume (VAV) systems or by increasing the efficiency of existing
VAV systems.

2.2.3. Good candidates for VAV conversion are constant volume systems with dual ducts or terminal
reheat that use backward-inclined or airfoil fans. On existing VAV systems, convert airflow control from
inlet vanes or outlet dampers to ASD control. Figure 2.1 shows the relative power consumption using
outlet dampers, inlet vanes, or ASD control.

2.2.4. In many cases, energy savings can be realized simply by replacing older motors with newer energy
efficient motors. But, further savings can often be obtained by evaluating the system needs and making
an additional minor design change. For example, an exhaust system might be oversized. By using a
smaller fan (and motor), a savings of 30 percent to 50 percent might be possible. By installing an ASD, a
savings of 50 percent to over 80 percent might be possible. Energy efficiency improvement should be
considered at the system level, not just the component (motor) level.

2.2.5. Chapter 3 provides specific guidance regarding energy savings analyses for motor upgrades and
installations. Chapter 4 provides guidance for energy savings analyses for the application of ASDs.

3.1. Energy Efficient Motor Design:

3.1.1. Introduction:

3.1.1.1. As part of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, motors have several losses:
electrical losses, iron (core) losses, mechanical (friction and windage) losses, and stray losses dependent
on design and manufacturing. Energy efficient motors reduce energy losses through improved design,
better materials, and improved manufacturing techniques. With proper installation, energy efficient
motors can run cooler and consequently have higher effective service factors, longer bearing and
insulation life, and less vibration. Energy efficient motors tend to last longer and can require less
maintenance. By running cooler, bearing grease lasts longer, lengthening the required time between
re-greasing. Lower operating temperatures also equate to longer lasting insulation; insulation life usually
doubles for each 18 °F (10 °C) reduction in operating temperature.

3.1.1.2. Energy efficient motors are manufactured using the same frame as a standard T-frame motor,
but have the following differences:

3.1.1.2.1. Higher quality and thinner steel laminations in the stator.

3.1.1.2.2. More copper in the windings.

3.1.1.2.3. Optimized air gap between the rotor and stator.

3.1.1.2.4. Reduced fan losses.

3.1.1.2.5. Closer matching tolerances.

3.1.1.3. An energy efficient motor produces the same shaft output power (horsepower), but uses less
input power (kW) than a standard efficiency motor. Energy efficient motors must have nominal full load
efficiencies that meet or exceed the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) performance
standards.

3.1.1.4. There are several opportunities for selecting an energy efficient motor for a particular
installation, including when purchasing a motor for a new application, or considering rewinding of a failed
motor, or evaluating the retrofit of an operable but inefficient motor to save energy. Energy efficient
motors should be considered for the following applications:

3.1.1.4.1. For all new installations.

3.1.1.4.2. When major modifications are made to existing facilities or processes.

3.1.1.4.3. For all new purchases of equipment packages that contain electric motors, such as air
conditioners, compressors, and filtration systems.

3.1.1.4.4. When purchasing spares or replacing failed motors.

3.1.1.4.5. In place of rewinding standard efficiency motors.

3.1.1.4.6. To replace grossly oversized and under loaded motors.

3.1.1.4.7. When an energy analysis indicates sufficient savings for an application.

3.1.2. NEMA Motor Standards:

3.1.2.1. NEMA MG 1, Motors and Generators, establishes standards for the construction and
performance of motors. This document is the principal reference for motor design, construction and
performance.

3.1.2.2. NEMA has assigned Design classifications that establish operating specifications for different
motor types. The Design letter indicates the motor’s torque characteristics and is an important motor
selection consideration. Most induction motors are Design B, with Design A being the second most
common type. Table 3.1 lists the key characteristics of NEMA Design B, C, and D motors. The Design
A motor is a variation of the Design B motor and has a higher starting current and starting torque.

                 Design D Applications: Very high inertia and loaded
                 starts. Considerable variation in load speed.

3.1.2.3. NEMA released specifications for a Design E motor in the October 1994 update to NEMA
MG 1. The letter “E” was assigned because it is the next design to be standardized following the Design
D motor, not because “E” stands for “efficiency”. Nonetheless, the Design E specification has minimum
efficiency values as one of its design requirements, specified in MG 1, Table 12-11. The Design E
efficiency requirements are more stringent than for other motors designated as energy efficient. The
Design E motor was specified to satisfy international standards developed by the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). IEC has a standard that is slightly less restrictive on torque and
starting current than the Design B motor. This IEC standard allows designs to be optimized for higher
efficiency. Design E motors can be used instead of Design A and B motors, with the following
considerations:

3.1.2.3.1. For most moderate to high usage applications appropriate for a Design A or B motor, the
Design E motor should usually be a better choice in terms of energy efficiency. But, there are slight
performance differences between the designs. Design E locked rotor torque requirements are different
from Design B. They are required to be somewhat higher than Design B levels for many motors under 20
horsepower and some motors over 200 horsepower, but are allowed to be lower for most motors from
20 horsepower to 200 horsepower. This means that a Design E replacement motor for an existing
Design B motor should be evaluated carefully to ensure that it has sufficient torque to start when
connected to its load.

3.1.2.3.2. Except for very small motors (under 3 horsepower), Design E motors are allowed to have
considerably higher locked rotor (starting) current than Design B motors. (Note that Design A motors
still have no upper limit whatsoever for their locked rotor current.) In the first ten milliseconds of
starting, any motor’s current can exceed the nominal locked rotor current. This momentary current spike
is called “inrush” current and is likely to be highest of all in Design E motors. High inrush current can
cause false trips by instantaneous trip units. As part of a Design E motor installation, the electrical
protection should be reviewed to confirm that the motor will be able to start and accelerate to its full-load

                                                     11
speed without tripping the associated electrical protection. In some cases, it might be necessary to
replace the motor starter as part of the motor replacement.

3.1.2.3.3. Although the NEMA standard allows the same slip (up to 5 percent) for Designs A, B, and E
motors, the range of actual slip of Design E motors is likely to be lower than for Designs A and B. This
lower slip should be factored into savings calculations in retrofit situations for variable torque (such as
pump and fan) applications.

3.1.3. Motor Efficiency Overview:

3.1.3.1. A standard motor is designed to ensure that its temperature rise requirements are satisfied in a
cost-effective manner, with motor efficiency being a secondary consideration. To be considered energy
efficient, a motor must meet performance criteria published by NEMA. An energy efficient motor has a
nominal full-load efficiency rating that meets or exceeds the efficiency specified in NEMA MG1,
Table 12-10. Manufacturers also sell motors with efficiencies significantly higher than the NEMA
standard and use many terms to describe their most efficient motors, including adjectives such as high,
super, premium, and extra, but there is no NEMA standard for any terminology other than energy
efficient. These additional terms can create confusion when comparing motors. For this reason, always
consult the nominal efficiency rating and the minimum efficiency rating. The nominal efficiency rating is
the average efficiency of many motors of duplicate design. Even within a group of duplicate design
motors, there is some variation in actual efficiencies due to variations in motor materials and
manufacturing. For this reason, minimum efficiency ratings are also important and can be used as the
basis for the manufacturer’s guarantee. The minimum efficiency rating is sometimes referred to as the
guaranteed minimum efficiency.

3.1.3.2. Motor efficiency is the ratio of the mechanical power output to the electrical power input:

                       Output   Input − Losses       Output
        Efficiency =          =                =
                       Input         Input       Output + Losses

3.1.3.3. Design changes and improved materials have reduced motor losses, making energy efficient
motors more efficient than standard motors. Motor efficiency varies with several factors. Table 3.2
summarizes the factors that have the most effect on motor efficiency.

3.1.3.4. Motor efficiency is identified on the motor nameplate by nominal efficiency, which represents the
average efficiency of a large population of motors of the same design, and it is measured in accordance
with NEMA MG 1, and IEEE 112, IEEE Standard Test Procedure for Polyphase Induction Motors and
Generators, Test Method B. Table 3.3 provides the NEMA minimum required nominal efficiency for
energy efficient motors as a function of horsepower rating. EPACT also specifies these values for motor
sizes up to 200 horsepower. General purpose motors designated as energy efficient should not be
available with a nominal efficiency less than listed in Table 3.3.

3.1.3.5. Motor manufacturers readily produce motors with nominal efficiency values better than required
by NEMA and EPACT, and motor purchases should preferentially take advantage of the higher available
efficiencies. Tables 3.4 and 3.5 provide the minimum recommended nominal full load motor efficiencies
for open and enclosed designs, respectively. The values listed are for general purpose, single speed,
polyphase induction motors. Some applications require definite purpose, special purpose, special frame,
or special mounted polyphase induction motors; a motor meeting the recommended efficiency level is
usually available for these applications also. The minimum recommended nominal full load motor
efficiencies are readily achievable by motor manufacturers and these minimum values were obtained from
Buying Energy Efficient Products, published by the Federal Energy Management Program. Tables 3.4
and 3.5 also provide the best available motor efficiencies for reference.

3.1.3.6. Tables 3.4 and 3.5 can be used to determine if it is cost-effective to pay a premium for a higher
efficiency motor. Determine the difference in energy usage cost for the various available motor
efficiencies; this difference represents the potential cost-effectiveness of selecting a higher efficiency
model, provided that the two motors have the same full load operating speed.

       EXAMPLE: Assume a 50 horsepower, 1,800 rpm TEFC motor is available with the
       EPACT minimum required 93.0 percent efficiency and assume that the motor will
       operate full time (8,760 hours per year) and fully loaded to its nameplate rating.
       Determine if it is cost effective to purchase a motor at the Table 3.5 recommended
       efficiency level of ≥94.5 percent rather than at the EPACT minimum level. Assume the
       following:

           Price of 93.0 percent efficiency motor: $1,700
           Price of 94.5 percent efficiency motor: $2,200
           Average electricity cost: $0.06/kWh

       For this example, the annual electricity usage and cost is given by:

                                                        kW

        Annual Energy Use (93% efficient ) =

                                                     0.93
                     Annual Energy Cost = 351,342 kWh × $0.06 / kWh = $21,080

                      Annual Energy Cost = 345,765 kWh × $0.06 / kWh = $20 ,746

       The value of the annual energy savings provided by the higher efficiency motor is given
       by:

        Annual Savings = $21,080 − $20,746 = $334 /year

       The 94.5 percent efficiency motor costs approximately $500 more than the 93.0 percent
       efficiency motor. The payback time for the purchase of the higher efficiency motor is
       given by:

                      $500
        Payback =             = 1.5 years
                    $334/year

3.1.3.7. Table 3.6 provides a summary of the above calculations and provides an equivalent example for
a smaller 5 horsepower motor. The motor cost-effectiveness analysis is sensitive to the number of
operating hours per year and the motor load factor. As the motor usage declines, the total energy used
similarly declines, which reduces the potential cost savings differential. Paragraphs 3.2 through 3.2.10
discuss motor energy efficiency analyses in more detail.

3.2. Motor Energy Efficiency Analysis:

3.2.1. The examples provided in Table 3.6 assume that the evaluated motors are fully loaded and operate
continuously. Motors rarely operate at their full load point and often do not operate 100 percent of the
time. Field tests of motors at various industrial plants indicate that, on the average, they operate at
60 percent of their rated load. Motors driving supply or return air fans in heating, ventilation and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems often operate at 70 percent to 75 percent of rated load. Also, many
motors are more efficient at 50 percent load than they are at full load.

3.2.2. The following information is required to complete an accurate assessment of energy savings for a
particular energy efficient motor:

3.2.2.1. Load on the motor.

3.2.2.2. Operating efficiency of the motor at that load point.

3.2.2.3. Full load speed of the motor to be replaced.

3.2.2.4. Full load speed of the replacement motor.

3.2.2.5. Number of operating hours per year.

3.2.2.6. Electricity cost.

3.2.3. With the above information, the payback time can be calculated for motor alternatives. The
following example illustrates the analysis process.

                                                     19
       EXAMPLE: Compare the energy savings with a new energy efficient motor to the cost
       of a standard efficiency motor. The following information is provided for this example:

           A 20 horsepower motor is needed.
           Load factor (LF) is 75 percent.
           The motor is operated approximately 6,000 hours per year.
           The standard efficiency motor costs $850 and has an efficiency of 89 percent.
           The energy efficient motor costs $1,050 and has an efficiency of 93 percent.
           Local average electricity cost is $0.06/kWh.

       The annual energy use is calculated below for each motor type:

                                              kW
                              20 hp × 0.746       × 6000 hr × 0.75 LF

                                              hp
                                                                      = 72 ,194 kWh/year
                                                 0.93

3.2.4. Table 3.7 summarizes the results of the two motor types presented in the above example. Notice
that the energy savings is several times the cost of the motor over the expected service life. And, the
higher initial motor cost has paid for itself in just over one year.

3.2.5. If energy savings are the sole reason for motor replacement, the new motor should have a
nameplate full load speed equal to or slightly less than the motor being replaced, if possible. If such an
energy efficient motor is not available, select the motor with the lowest full load speed (but same
synchronous speed) that also provides the recommended minimum efficiency, or better. Energy efficient
motors tend to operate at a speed slightly higher than standard efficiency motors; this higher speed
increases the power consumption and can reduce the predicted energy savings if the cost savings are

                                                   20
evaluated on the basis of efficiency alone. For example, variable air volume loads experience a power
increase with the cube of the speed. Suppose the new energy efficient motor has a speed of 1,770 rpm
and the old standard efficiency motor has a speed of 1,750 rpm. As shown below, the increase in power
solely due to the speed increase is about 3.5 percent, which can substantially reduce the projected energy
savings even though the new motor is energy efficient. Referring to the example shown in Table 3.7, a
3.5 percent increase in energy use with the higher efficiency motor would reduce the projected savings
from $195/year to $43/year and the payback time would be extended to over 4 years.

3.2.6. As a general rule, motors that are undersized and overloaded have a reduced life expectancy with
a greater probability of unanticipated downtime. Motors that are oversized and thus lightly loaded have
an extended expected operating life, but can suffer both efficiency and power factor reduction penalties.
Consider downsizing motors that are less than 40 percent to 50 percent loaded. But, downsizing should
not be performed without an evaluation if the motor load factor exceeds 50 percent; there might be other
design reasons for an oversized motor.

3.2.7. An inventory should be developed of all motors in each facility, beginning with the largest and
those with the longest run times. This inventory enables informed choices about replacement, either
before or after motor failure. Refer to Attachment 2 for guidance regarding the type of information
needed for an inventory.

3.2.8. Field testing motors prior to failure can allow replacement motors to be properly sized to match
the actual driven load. Motors that are significant energy users should head the inventory list. Motors
that operate for extended periods of time and larger motors should also be on the list. Conversely,
smaller motors that run intermittently should be placed toward the end of the list. Depending upon the
size of the facility, it may be appropriate to list only motors that exceed minimum size and operating
duration criteria. Each facility should establish appropriate thresholds. Selection criteria include:

3.2.8.1. 3-phase, NEMA Design B motors.

3.2.8.2. 10 to 600 horsepower.

3.2.8.3. At least 2,000 hours per year of operation.

3.2.8.4. Constant load (not intermittent, cyclic, or fluctuating).

3.2.8.5. Older and/or rewound standard efficiency motors.

3.2.8.6. Easy access.

3.2.8.7. A readable nameplate.

3.2.9. The objective is to sort through all the motors and rank order the list using size and annual
operating time as the principal criteria. Once a short list of motors has been made, individual data
collection can take place.
                                                       21
3.2.10. A motor energy analysis requires that information from the motor nameplate be obtained. A
motor nameplate usually contains both descriptive and performance based data, such as full load
efficiency, power factor, amperage, and operating speed. This information can be used to determine both
the load imposed upon the motor by its driven equipment and the motor efficiency at its load point.
Depending upon the motor age and manufacturer practices, not all of the desired information appears on
every motor nameplate. It is not unusual for power factor and efficiency to be missing. When data is not
available on the nameplate, contact the manufacturer for the missing information. The motor purchase
date and its rewind history should also be recorded. The coupling type should be identified and the motor
load (device being driven) described. Annual operating hours should be estimated by considering motor
use on various shifts during work days, weekends, and holidays.

3.3. Motor Design Criteria:

3.3.1. Refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181, for minimum design requirements. The guidance provided in this
chapter supplements AFMAN(I) 32-1181.

3.3.2. Motors must be properly selected according to expected service conditions. Usual service
conditions, as defined in NEMA MG 1, include:

3.3.2.1. Exposure to an ambient temperature between 32 °F (0 °C) and 104 °F (40 °C).

3.3.2.2. Installation in areas or enclosures that do not seriously interfere with the ventilation of the
machine.

3.3.2.3. Operation within a tolerance of ± 10 percent of rated voltage.

3.3.2.4. Altitude not above 3,300 feet (1,006 meters). Table 3.8 provides the standard motor derating
for operation above 3,300 feet (1,006 meters).

3.3.2.5. Operation within a tolerance of ± 5 percent of rated frequency.

3.3.2.6. Operation with a voltage unbalance of one percent or less. Paragraphs 5.3 through 5.3.7 discuss
the effect of voltage and phase unbalance on motor operation.

3.3.3. Operation under unusual service conditions can result in greater than expected efficiency losses
and the consumption of additional energy. Both standard and energy efficient motors can have their
efficiency and useful life reduced by abnormal service conditions.

3.3.4. Motors can lower the average power factor of the electrical system, which can result in penalty
charges from the local utility. Refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181 if power factor correction is to be
considered.

3.3.5. The service factor is the percentage of extra demand that can be placed on a motor for short
periods without damaging it. Service factors range from 1.00 (no overload capability) to 1.25
(25 percent overload capability), with higher service factors available. Select motors with a minimum
1.15 service factor and design for operation at 85 percent of the rated motor load, unless the motor has
special design requirements. Note that a service factor greater than 1.0 is not intended to allow
continuous overloading of a motor; it is intended to provide short-term capability for
higher-than-expected loading.

3.3.6. Voltage at the motor terminals should be as close to the nameplate value as possible. Although
motors are rated to operate within 10 percent of nameplate voltage, motor efficiency decreases as applied
voltage decreases. When operating at less than 95 percent of nameplate voltage, motors lose 2 percent to
3 percent of rated efficiency. Also, operation at lower-than-rated voltage causes a higher temperature
rise, which reduces insulation life.

3.3.7. Some motors have special voltage considerations or are designed for dual voltage ratings.
Evaluate these motors carefully to ensure that design requirements are satisfied.

3.3.7.1. Dual Voltage Ratings. Some motors are supplied with dual voltage ratings. For example, a
voltage rating of 230/460 indicates that the motor can be used in either 230 volt or 460 volt applications.
If connected to a 460 volt source, the motor can operate within a balanced voltage of 460 volts ± 10
percent. If connected to a 230 volt source, the motor can operate within a balanced voltage of 230 volts
± 10 percent.

3.3.7.2. Wide-Range Voltage Ratings. If the motor nameplate shows a hyphen between two numbers,
such as 208 – 230, the motor can operate properly for any voltage within this range including a +10
percent allowance on the high end and a -10 percent allowance on the low end. For example, the
utilization voltage range for a motor rated at 208 – 230 volts is 188 to 253 volts if the 3-phase voltage
supply is balanced.

3.3.7.3. 230 Volt Motors on 208 Volt Systems. Do not use 230 volt motors on 208 volt systems
because the utilization voltage will commonly be below the -10 percent tolerance on the voltage rating for
which the motor is designed (a 230 volt motor is intended for use on a nominal 240 volt system).

3.4. Reduced Voltage Starting:

3.4.1. Full voltage starting is the least expensive and most efficient method of starting small motors.
However, reduced voltage starting can be needed for large motors and for some small motor applications,
primarily because the voltage drop caused by full voltage starting can interfere with other electrical
equipment. An induction motor appears similar to a short circuit when it is started, drawing up to six

                                                    23
times rated full load current, or more, for several seconds. Reduced voltage starting reduces the large
current drawn during motor starting.

3.4.2. When a motor is first started, it is at rest. The current drawn during starting is high because the
motor has no counter electromagnetic force (EMF) when first started. As the motor comes up to speed,
counter EMF is developed in proportion to the speed, thereby causing the current to decrease (see Figure
3.4). Notice that the motor starting current tends to remain very high as a function of full load current
until the motor is almost at full speed. Paragraphs 5.1 through 5.1.7 discuss other effects that can cause
even higher transient current during motor starting.

3.4.3. Internal motor heating is a function of the current. High motor starting current tends to cause a
high heating rate during starting. Some motors have limits established on the number of consecutive
starts that can be performed within a given time period because of the potential to cause insulation
damage by overheating.

3.4.4. Reduced voltage starting reduces the motor starting current, which can improve electrical system
operation. The reduced voltage drop helps avoid equipment operation problems and flicker can be
reduced to acceptable levels. The following types of reduced voltage starting are commonly used:

3.4.4.1. Primary resistor starting.

3.4.4.2. Autotransformer starting.

3.4.4.3. Part-winding starting.

3.4.4.4. Wye-delta starting.

3.4.4.5. Solid-state starting.


                                                              24
3.4.4.6. ASD starting.

3.4.5. Refer to Attachment 3 for additional information regarding reduced voltage starting methods.
Attachment 3 describes each method and explains the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
ASDs are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. Because of the differences in electrical systems’ design and
motor applications, no single approach to reduced voltage starting is always preferred. Each application
should be evaluated to determine the optimal design method. Manufacturers readily provide all of the
reduced voltage starters described in Attachment 3.

3.5. Retrofit Design Criteria:

3.5.1. Some studies have concluded that most motors are significantly oversized. When a motor has a
higher horsepower rating than is required by the load it is driving, the motor operates at part load. Motor
efficiency drops rapidly when operation falls below 50 percent of full load capacity (see Figure 3.3).
Also, power factor declines below 75 percent of full load, which means that lightly loaded motors can
contribute to increased utility power factor charges. Oversized, under-loaded motors should be replaced
with smaller energy efficient motors in most instances. A motor replacement analysis should be
conducted for motors operating below 40 percent of their full load rating. Whenever a different size
motor is installed in place of an existing motor, the electrical protection design must be evaluated to
ensure that NEC electrical protection requirements continue to be satisfied; refer to Chapter 5 for
guidance.

3.5.2. In retrofit designs, obtain an energy efficient motor with a speed closely matched to the speed of
the existing motor. Induction motors have an operating speed that is slightly lower than their theoretical,
or synchronous speed. For example, an 1,800 rpm motor might operate under full load at about 1,750
rpm. Energy efficient motors tend to operate at a slightly higher full load speed than standard motors
(usually by about 5 to 10 rpm for 1,800 rpm motors). Centrifugal loads, like most pumps, fans, and
compressors, will be affected by this higher speed; slightly more fluid or air will be delivered and energy
consumption will increase by the cube of the speed increase (see paragraph 3.2.5 for an example).

3.5.3. Ensure that the selected replacement motor is appropriate for the application. For example, a
NEMA Design B motor should not be selected to replace a NEMA Design C motor in a high torque
application. In high-torque applications, NEMA Design A or Design B motors might trip the overload
protection before the motor accelerates the load to its operating speed. Verify the NEMA design letter
on the old motor as part of the replacement evaluation. Be careful not to mistake the motor insulation
class code or kVA code letter for the NEMA design letter.

3.5.4. For most applications, NEMA Design E motors can be used instead of NEMA Design A or B
motors. But the locked rotor torque and the locked rotor current should be evaluated to ensure that each
Design E motor is able to start its load, and do so without tripping its associated electrical protection.
Refer to paragraphs 3.1.2.3 through 3.1.2.3.3 for additional information regarding the Design E motor.

3.6. Rewinding and Repair:

3.6.1. Motor Failures:

3.6.1.1. Any motor will eventually fail. The following problems can lead to motor failure:

3.6.1.1.1. Insufficient lubrication—can cause bearings to fail.

3.6.1.1.2. Too much lubrication—excess grease can be forced into the motor past bearing seals and onto
the motor windings where it can damage the insulation.

3.6.1.1.3. Improper lubrication—mixing incompatible greases can cause premature grease breakdown.

3.6.1.1.4. Contaminated grease—foreign particles can damage bearings.

3.6.1.1.5. Overvoltages—voltage spikes from lightning or switching transients can damage insulation.

3.6.1.1.6. ASD voltage spikes—ASDs can generate high-frequency voltage spikes that eventually
damage the insulation, especially if cable lengths are long.

3.6.1.1.7. Harmonics and voltage unbalance—can contribute to motor overheating.

3.6.1.1.8. High operating temperatures—will contribute to insulation damage and can be caused by high
ambient temperatures, motor overload, dirt in cooling passages, and operation at high altitudes.

3.6.1.1.9. Moisture—can cause motor damage and high humidity can cause problems if the motor is
deenergized for long periods without space heaters.

3.6.2. Repair Versus Replacement Analysis:

3.6.2.1. When an existing motor fails, the following options are recommended:

3.6.2.1.1. If the motor is already energy efficient, have it repaired. When an energy efficient motor
requires repair, rewinding or repairing it at a quality repair shop will degrade its efficiency, but only
slightly.

3.6.2.1.2. If it is an ODP motor, replace it with an energy efficient motor. It is usually not cost-effective
to rewind ODP motors. Note: ODP refers to a motor enclosure design that allows outside air to blow
directly through the motor, but has a cover that prevents drops of liquid from entering.

3.6.2.1.3. If it is a TEFC motor and is not energy efficient, replace it when it is smaller than the
horsepower breakpoint. Otherwise send it out for repair. If the repair will cost more than 60 percent of
a new energy efficient motor, replace the motor with a new energy efficient motor. Note: TEFC refers
to a motor enclosure design that prevents outside air from flowing into the frame. Cooling of TEFC
motors is provided by fins and a fan. TEFC motors are suitable for outdoor use, and in dusty or
contaminated environments.

3.6.2.2. Figure 3.5 illustrates the repair or replacement evaluation process. In Figure 3.5, the question,
“Motor Less Than *** hp?”, refers to the minimum motor size below which it is more economical to
replace it rather than repair it. Refer to paragraph 3.6.2.3 for additional information regarding how to
determine this motor size.

3.6.2.3. Figure 3.6 shows how to determine the horsepower breakpoint as a function of local electricity
cost (the term breakpoint refers to the motor size below which it is more economical to replace the motor
than repair it). This figure is adapted from the Industrial Electrotechnology Laboratory Horsepower
Bulletin, available from the DOE Motor Challenge Program Information Clearinghouse at PO Box
43171, Olympia, Washington, 98504-3171 or by telephone at 800-862-2086. Refer to this bulletin for

       EXAMPLE: Assume the average cost of electricity is $0.06/kWh and the motors of
       interest operate for a minimum of 6,000 hours per year. Figure 3.6 shows the
       recommended horsepower breakpoint (shown in red). Motors smaller than 100
       horsepower should be replaced rather than repaired.

3.6.2.4. As part of a repair versus replacement evaluation, verify that the new motor has the same frame
design as the old motor. If a new frame size is provided, additional effort will be necessary to complete
the installation.

3.6.2.5. For specific evaluations, MotorMaster® can be used to determine whether repair or replacement
is the best alternative. Refer to paragraphs 3.7.3 through 3.7.3.2 for additional information regarding a
MotorMaster® analysis.

3.6.3. Motor Repair Guidelines:

3.6.3.1. The Electric Motor Model Repair Specifications manual is recommended as a reference for
motor repair and rewinding. It is based in part on the Electric Apparatus Service Association (EASA)
Standards for the Repair of Electrical Apparatus. Background information regarding motor repair is
provided in Industrial Motor Repair in the United States and Quality Electric Motor Repair: A
Guidebook for Electric Utilities. All of these documents are available from the DOE Motor Challenge
Program Information Clearinghouse at PO Box 43171, Olympia, Washington, 98504-3171 or by
telephone at 800-862-2086.



                                                          28
3.6.3.2. Improper motor repair will lead to early motor failure also. The following problems have
occurred with motor repair:

3.6.3.2.1. Errors in the winding pattern, substitution of smaller gauge wire, or changes in number of
turns, which tend to increase motor losses, thereby causing a higher operating temperature.

3.6.3.2.2. Excessive vibration can occur during operation if an out-of-balance rotor or bent shaft are not
corrected before reassembly.

3.6.3.2.3. Poor impregnation of varnish can cause poor heat transfer or winding motion under magnetic
forces.

3.6.3.2.4. Poorly restrained end turns can cause acoustic vibration when powered from an ASD.

3.6.3.3. The following guidelines are recommended to ensure a quality motor repair:

3.6.3.3.1. Ensure the original design is duplicated by the repair with regard to number of turns; winding
design and coil configuration; wire cross sectional area; and rolling bearing size, type, and specification
including seals and shielding, if applicable.

3.6.3.3.2. Replace bearings as part of the rewind. Almost half of motor failures involve bearing failures.

3.6.3.3.3. Record core loss before and after stripping.

3.6.3.3.4. Repair or replace defective laminations.

3.6.3.3.5. Measure and record winding resistance, no-load amperes, voltage, and no-load watts.

3.6.3.4. The following repair practices are not recommended:

3.6.3.4.1. Heating of stators above 650 °F (343 °C).

3.6.3.4.2. Sandblasting of iron core.

3.6.3.4.3. Knurling, painting, or peening bearing fits.

3.6.3.4.4. Stripping with an open flame.

3.6.3.4.5. Grinding laminations or filing slots.

3.6.3.4.6. Increasing the air gap.

3.6.3.4.7. Increasing the stator winding resistance.

3.6.3.4.8. Changing the winding design.

3.6.3.4.9. Modifying the motor mechanical design without approval.

                                                       29
3.6.3.5. The repair shop should be capable of performing a high quality repair or rewind service. To
asses repair shop capability, recommend checking for:

3.6.3.5.1. Implementation of EASA Q, International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000, or other
quality assurance program.

3.6.3.5.2. Procedures in place conforming to EASA guidance.

3.6.3.5.3. Test equipment available and calibrated at specific periodic intervals, such as annually.

3.6.3.5.4. Variety and adequate quantity of wire sizes and shapes in stock.

3.6.3.5.5. Neat and organized facility with knowledgeable personnel.

3.6.3.5.6. Maintenance records for all repairs.

3.7.2.2. The database can be used to evaluate different motor options. For example, different motors
can be compared to determine if a motor with higher efficiency provides adequate savings to justify a
possibly higher list price. Figure 3.10 shows an example comparison between two motors with
efficiencies of 92 percent and 94.5 percent, respectively. Notice that a utility rate schedule is selected to
develop the operating cost of each motor. The hours of use per year are entered by the user and the
motor list price is obtained from the MotorMaster® database. Figure 3.11 shows that the higher initial
cost of the higher efficiency motor is paid back within 1.88 years. MotorMaster® performs this
calculation automatically.

3.7.3. MotorMaster® Repair Versus Replacement Evaluations:

3.7.3.1. Paragraphs 3.6 through 3.6.3.5.6 provide specific guidance regarding motor repairs.
MotorMaster® supports a rewind or replace decision by comparing the cost of a rewind to the cost of a
replacement motor. Figure 3.12 shows the MotorMaster® entry screen. The motor to be rewound can
be manually entered or can be retrieved from the inventory list. The MotorMaster® database is used to
select the desired replacement motor. The new motor will have a higher efficiency and will save energy
compared to the rewound motor. Based on the expected replacement motor price and the cost of
electricity, MotorMaster® then calculates the payback time for the replacement motor to break even with
the rewound motor. Figure 3.13 shows a sample MotorMaster® calculation.

                                      ADJUSTABLE SPEED DRIVES

4.1. Introduction:

4.1.1. Adjustable speed drives (ASDs) are electronic controllers that vary the speed of motors. ASDs
save substantial energy when applied to variable torque loads and the application of ASDs will result in a
reduction in electricity consumption in most facilities. Other potential benefits include improved process
control, reduced mechanical stress by soft start capability, and improved electrical system power factor.

4.1.2. The guidance provided in this chapter will not result in the least expensive design. Although
ASDs can provide significant energy savings and operational improvements, numerous problems have
also occurred with ASD installations. Common problems have been addressed in this chapter by ensuring
that ASDs are properly designed to be reliable under a variety of operating conditions. And, potential
ASD interactions with the rest of the electrical system have been considered. In summary, the energy
savings that can be realized with ASD installations should not be obtained at the expense of a less reliable
electrical system. For this reason, ASD design guidance in this chapter addresses issues well beyond
energy efficiency.

4.1.3. ASDs take a 50 hz or 60 hz ac input and generate a variable frequency output to control the speed
of the motor as necessary to meet the load demand. Figure 4.1 shows a simplified layout of an ASD.
The rectifier converts the incoming ac power to a dc output. The dc link further reduces any ripple in the
rectifier output. The inverter circuit converts its dc input into a variable frequency ac voltage to control
the speed of an induction motor. Figure 4.2 shows a typical ASD.

4.1.4. The best applications for ASDs are large motors that can operate for many hours each year at
reduced speeds. Variable flow applications with throttling or bypass devices to modulate flow are good
candidates for ASDs. Potential applications include centrifugal fans, pumps (centrifugal, propeller,
turbine), agitators, and axial compressors. If HVAC fans have inlet vanes or outlet dampers to throttle
full air output in variable air volume (VAV) systems, these dampers or vanes can usually be removed or
disabled and retrofitted with ASDs. Circulation pumps for chilled water often have throttling or bypass
valves that can be retrofitted with ASDs.

4.1.5. Energy savings are possible with variable torque loads, such as fans and pumps, because torque
varies as the square of the speed, and horsepower varies as the cube of speed. For example, if fan speed
is reduced by 20 percent, motor horsepower (and energy consumption) is reduced by 50 percent. If fan
speed can be reduced by 50 percent, the power requirement is only 12.5 percent of the full-speed value,
or an energy savings of almost 90 percent. Figure 4.3 shows a common operating history for a
centrifugal fan in a VAV system. As can be seen in this example, the system operates at 70 percent
volume or below almost 90 percent of the time. In a case such as this, an ASD can provide a significant
energy savings.

4.1.6. ASDs can be retrofitted into existing motor systems, and can operate both standard and high
efficiency motors ranging in size from less than one horsepower to several thousand horsepower. Unlike
mechanical and hydraulic motor controllers, ASDs can be located remotely (within limits) and do not
require mechanical coupling between the motor and the load. This simplifies installation and alignment of
motor systems.

4.1.7. The installation of an ASD involves some change in the process control method. Figure 4.4 shows
a simplified example of a water flow system in which a flow element measures water flow and a flow
controller uses the flow signal to adjust the flow control valve position and control the flow rate. With
the installation of an ASD, the control valve is removed (or fully opened) and the flow signal is sent to
the ASD, which then controls the motor speed to maintain the desired flow rate.




                                                                             40

4.1.8. ASD installations can also solve ongoing maintenance problems. For example, one hospital used a
unique inlet vane design for HVAC flow control. Because of their unique design, repair or replacement
of the inlet vanes tended to be relatively expensive. By installing ASDs, the inlet vanes were locked in the
fully open position and the associated maintenance expense was avoided in the future. ASDs can also be
used for motor soft starts to reduce the stress on the connected load or to reduce the motor starting
current.

4.2. Design Criteria. Refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181 for minimum design requirements. The guidance
provided in this chapter supplements AFMAN(I) 32-1181.

4.2.1. ASD Designs:

4.2.1.1. Although there are other types, two types of ASD designs are most commonly used: variable
source inverter (VSI), and current source inverter (CSI).

4.2.1.2. VSI designs use pulse width modulation (PWM) to generate the output waveform. PWM is the
dominant ASD design technology in the ≤1 horsepower to 500 horsepower range because of its
reliability, affordability, and availability. PWM outputs emulate sinusoidal power waves by varying the
width of the pulses in each half cycle. Advantages of PWMs are low harmonic motor heating, excellent
input displacement power factor, high efficiency of 92 percent to 96 percent, and the ability to control
multiple motor systems with a single drive.

4.2.1.3. CSI designs are also reliable because of their inherent current-limiting characteristics and simple
circuitry. CSIs have regenerative power capabilities, meaning that CSI drives can reverse the power flow
back from the motor through the drive. Unfortunately, CSIs reflect large amounts of power harmonics
back to the source, have poor input power factors, and can produce jerky motor operations (cogging) at


                                                      41
very low speeds. CSIs are usually used for large (over 300 horsepower) induction and synchronous
motors.

4.2.2. Motor Design Considerations for ASDs:

4.2.2.1. At the rated full load of the driven equipment, the output voltage and frequency of the ASD
should be the same as the motor’s rating. Note that this design recommendation also places limits on the
motor design; the motor should not have a significantly higher full load horsepower or speed rating than
the driven load. Mismatches can easily cause operational problems, including efficiency losses and
increased ASD input current. In extreme cases, a mismatch can cause the ASD to trip on overcurrent
during motor starting or cause the ASD input current to be substantially higher than the design without
the ASD.

4.2.2.2. The ASD short term current rating should be adequate to produce the required motor starting
torque, including loads with high starting torque. Inappropriate designs, such as using an 1,800 rpm
motor at reduced speed to drive an 870 rpm load can cause the ASD to exceed its short term current
rating.

4.2.2.3. Motors can overheat at the lower operating speed set by an ASD and, in some cases, they can
overheat even at full load/full speed operation because of the ASD’s non-sinusoidal output. On fan-
cooled motors, decreasing the motor’s shaft speed by 50 percent decreases the fan’s cooling effects
proportionately. If the motor is fully loaded and speed decreases, the motor must supply full torque with
reduced cooling. In extreme cases, this can cause the motor insulation to fail or can reduce the motor
life. For many applications, the load will be well less than full load and the motor will be able to operate
at reduced speed without overheating.

4.2.2.4. The motor should have a minimum 1.15 service factor or be rated well above the actual load it
will be carrying. Verify with the manufacturer that the motor is capable of acceptable operation with an
ASD. Standard motors can often operate down to 50 percent of rated speed, high efficiency motors can
often operate down to 20 percent of rated speed, and “inverter duty” motors can operate below 20
percent of rated speed without problems in a variable load application. Motors designed specifically for
ASD operation usually incorporate special cooling provisions and may use a higher class insulation.

4.2.3. Power Quality:

4.2.3.1. Harmonic Distortion. Ensure that the final installation complies with IEEE 519 regarding
harmonic distortion limits (refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181, Chapter 8, for an explanation of harmonic
distortion limits). The amount of harmonic current distortion generated by the ASD depends on the ASD
design and the ASD filter design. Some ASD manufacturers provide software to assist with a harmonic
distortion evaluation. Power quality field measurements should be taken after the installation is complete
to confirm that the system total harmonic distortion is not degraded beyond acceptable levels. If the ASD
can be provided power from a standby generator upon loss of normal commercial power, the harmonic
distortion evaluation must include the system effects when the standby generator is the power source.
Refer to paragraphs 4.3.5 through 4.3.5.5 for additional guidance regarding harmonic distortion.




                                                    42
4.2.3.2. Voltage sags can cause nuisance tripping. The ASD should be protected against undesired
tripping on momentary voltage sags or short duration voltage losses. Refer to paragraphs 4.3.2 through
4.3.2.3.2 for additional information.

4.2.3.3. Nearby capacitor switching can cause transient overvoltages, resulting in nuisance tripping. In
this case, ensure the ASD either has input filtering to reduce the overvoltage or has automatic reset
circuitry.

4.2.3.4. Medium voltage motor applications should be carefully evaluated to verify that the selected
design will not degrade power quality below acceptable levels. ASD designs for medium voltage
applications often generate a larger proportion of harmonic distortion.

4.2.4. Bypass Operation:

4.2.4.1. Important applications should include bypass operation capability to allow motor operation
independent of the ASD. Some applications require bypass so that the motor can always be operated,
such as for heating and cooling of a communications or computer room. More commonly, bypass ability
is provided to enable continued motor operation in the event of ASD failure. Fire and safety
requirements might necessitate a bypass to ensure the evacuation of smoke from a building after a fire.

4.2.4.2. Bypass capability can be accomplished by a manual transfer switch or by magnetic contactors.
Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show the two types of configurations. More complex transfer schemes are usually
not cost-effective. Manual transfer is used in applications in which short term loss of the motor is
acceptable, followed by manual action to restore power to the motor. The use of magnetic contactors
allows remote operation of the bypass and can include auxiliary contacts to operate the bypass on loss of
the ASD.

4.2.4.3. The manual transfer switch is the least expensive option and is acceptable for many applications.
Regardless of the selected design approach, all NEC requirements for motor protection must be satisfied
upon transfer to bypass. This includes motor short circuit and overload protection. The bypass should be
rated for motor starting current rather than motor full load current; this is necessary so that the motor can
be safely started when on bypass.

4.2.4.4. When bypass capability is provided, a disconnect switch for the ASD should also be provided as
shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. This allows electrical isolation for ASD repair, replacement, or testing.

4.2.4.5. ASD manufacturers are capable of providing bypass capability with an ASD. The procurement
specification should list the desired bypass features.

4.2.4.6. Bypass operation should consider the effect of full speed motor operation on the load. In some
system designs, it will be acceptable for the motor and driven load to operate at full speed. In other
system designs, it might be necessary to restore the previous method of flow control or otherwise limit
the flow. For example, an HVAC system might have been controlled by inlet vanes. Upon installation of
an ASD, the inlet vanes should have been repositioned to full open. But, on bypass operation, the inlet
vanes might need to be repositioned or directly controlled, depending on the situation.

4.2.5. Acoustical Noise. In some installations, an ASD will increase the motor’s acoustical noise level.
The noise occurs when the ASD’s non-sinusoidal current and voltage waveforms produce vibrations in
the motor’s laminations. The non-sinusoidal current and voltage waveforms are a consequence of the
ASD transistor switching (carrier) frequency. Newer ASDs tend to operate at higher carrier frequencies,
which reduces the non-sinusoidal output. Some ASDs include special provisions designed specifically to
reduce acoustical noise. For locations with low ambient noise level, the acoustical noise generated in a
motor by its ASD can be noticeable. The location for an ASD should be evaluated to determine if the
procurement specification should address noise as a design consideration. For existing installations with
acoustical noise problems, a load reactor might be required to reduce the noise.

4.2.6. Other Design Considerations. Additional design considerations are provided in paragraphs 4.6.
though 4.7.2.

4.3. Power Quality:

4.3.1. Introduction:

4.3.1.1. The term power quality has different meanings, depending on the user, the application, and the
type of electrical system disturbance. All definitions of power quality somehow relate to the relative
frequency and magnitude of deviations in the incoming power supplied to electrical equipment from the
normal, steady-state, 60 hz sinusoidal waveform of voltage and current. These aberrations can affect the
operation of electrical equipment. The term poor power quality means that there is sufficient deviation
from the normal voltage and current waveform to cause equipment misoperation or premature failure.
Conversely, good power quality means that there is a low level or incidence of these deviations.
Obviously, such general definitions of good and poor power quality depend on the equipment used in the
system: some equipment might be very resistant to power aberrations while other equipment might fail
quickly under equivalent conditions.

4.3.1.2. Potential power quality concerns associated with ASDs include:

4.3.1.2.1. Harmonic distortion on the line side and the load side of the ASD.

4.3.1.2.2. Nuisance tripping of ASDs because of voltage sags and momentary interruptions.

4.3.1.2.3. Motor overheating because of ASD-generated harmonic currents.

4.3.1.2.4. Motor winding or bearing failure caused by overvoltages due to ASD-generated voltage high
rise times.

4.3.1.2.5. Notching and transient oscillations associated with power electronics switching.

4.3.1.2.6. Nuisance tripping of ASDs caused by capacitor switching transients.

4.3.1.3. Refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181 for a detailed overview of power quality issues and design
solutions. AFMAN(I) 32-1181 provides extensive design criteria related to power quality, including
designing the electrical system for nonlinear loads and neutral circuit sizing for nonlinear loads. This
chapter supplements AFMAN(I) 32-1181 specifically with regard to ASDs. Power quality issues should
be addressed at the design phase to ensure they do not become problems after ASD installation.

4.3.2. Voltage Sags:

4.3.2.1. A voltage sag is a decrease in the supplied voltage, outside of the normal system tolerance,
usually with a duration of about one cycle to less than a few seconds. Figure 4.7 shows an example
waveform of a voltage sag.




                                                    45

4.3.2.2. Voltage sags can be caused by the following conditions:

4.3.2.2.1. Faults on adjacent feeders causing a reduction in nearby voltages.

4.3.2.2.2. Faults in the commercial power system.

4.3.2.2.3. Starting of large loads.

4.3.2.2.4. Overloaded or undersized wiring.

4.3.2.2.5. Utility switching.

4.3.2.2.6. Equipment failure.

4.3.2.3. ASDs should be protected against voltage sags by two levels of protection:

4.3.2.3.1. An ASD should have a minimum of 3-cycle ride-through capability; this ensures that the ASD
should not deenergize during most momentary transients. Verify with the manufacturer the specific speed
and torque performance during and after a voltage sag.

4.3.2.3.2. Ride-through capability will not keep an ASD operating through longer duration voltage sags
or temporary interruptions. For these conditions, the ASD should have a second level of protection—
automatic reset circuitry that will automatically restart the ASD upon restoration of adequate quality
power.

4.3.3. Overvoltages Caused by Long Motor Leads:

4.3.3.1. Standard motors have been designed to receive sinusoidal power. The fast switching of
insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) inside a PWM ASD causes a voltage surge to be developed on
the ASD and motor terminals. The surge has a steep wave front, which causes the motor cable to appear
as a transmission line. Each voltage pulse reflects back and forth between the ASD and motor terminals.
These reflected pulses add to the inverter output voltage and can cause the motor terminal voltage to be
as high as twice the rated voltage. The magnitude of this overvoltage depends on the IGBT rise time and
the cable length between the ASD and the motor. Also, the high switching frequency can cause uneven
voltage distribution within the motor windings, often causing an overvoltage on the first winding. The
net effect of this voltage is stress on the motor insulation and it can lead to early motor failure.
Depending on the motor design, the high voltage rise time can also induce bearing currents, leading to

                                                    46
premature bearing failure. As an example, one facility reported that over half of its 10 horsepower
motors powered by PWM drives failed within 30 days after they were installed. It was assumed that the
motors were defective and all of the motors were replaced with new motors of another make. But,
within one week, these new motors also began to fail. Investigators found that the cables connecting the
drives and motors were about 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and the voltages at the motor terminals were
about 1,500 volts peak.

4.3.3.2. Overvoltage effects can be minimized by the following approaches:

4.3.3.2.1. Specify motors that are designed for ASD applications. These are often referred to as inverter
duty motors and they are designed to withstand the overvoltages generated by an IGBT ASD.

4.3.3.2.2. Minimize the cable length between the ASD and the motor. Verify with the ASD
manufacturer the maximum recommended distance for acceptable long term operation.

4.3.3.3. Both of the above are recommended whenever a new motor is procured as part of the ASD
installation. If ASD-duty (commonly referred to as inverter duty) motors are not used or if cable lengths
are longer than 20 feet (6 meters) between the ASD and the motor for standard design motors, additional
design measures might be required. One of the following approaches can reduce the overvoltage at the
motor terminals:

4.3.3.3.1. Install a motor terminal filter. This type of filter connects in shunt at the motor terminals and
matches the motor and cable surge impedances. The design depends on the cable length.

4.3.3.3.2. Install an ASD output filter. This type of filter connects in series to the ASD output and
reduces the rate of voltage rise to an acceptable level. The design depends on the cable length. An ASD
output filter would be used instead of a motor terminal filter if the motor terminals are inaccessible, such
as with a submersible pump.

4.3.3.3.3. Install a load reactor. Paragraphs 4.3.5.4 through 4.3.5.5 describe the application of load
reactors. If a load reactor is not required for other reasons, a motor terminal filter or ASD output filter is
a simpler alternative.

4.3.4. Overvoltages Caused by Nearby Capacitor Switching:

4.3.4.1. Each time a power system capacitor is energized, a transient voltage oscillation occurs between
the capacitor and the power system inductance. The transient overvoltage can be twice the normal
system voltage at the capacitor location. Furthermore, these transient overvoltages can be magnified
within the facility if low-voltage capacitor banks have been installed for power factor correction.

4.3.4.2. Smaller ASDs usually have a VSI rectifier and use a PWM inverter to supply the motor. The dc
link between the rectifier and the inverter often has a fairly narrow range of allowed operation and it is
not uncommon for an ASD to trip whenever the dc overvoltage exceeds 120 percent or less of the rated
value. Capacitor switching transients can cause a current surge into the dc link capacitor, causing an
overvoltage and subsequent ASD trip. Nuisance tripping of this type can occur several times a day as the
utility switches nearby substation capacitors.


                                                     47
4.3.4.3. Filter reactors can be necessary to correct nuisance ASD tripping of this type. A series
inductance on the input of the ASD reduces the current surge into the ASD, thereby reducing the dc link
overvoltage. Refer to paragraphs 4.3.5 through 4.3.5.5 for additional information regarding filter
reactors.

4.3.5. ASD Filter Reactors for Harmonic Distortion Mitigation:

4.3.5.1. ASDs generate harmonic distortion and are also sensitive to harmonic distortion. IEEE 519,
IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems,
provides the industry-accepted method of evaluating harmonic voltages and currents. IEEE 519 provides
system level guidance, not equipment specific guidance. What this means is that harmonic distortion
limits are established for the facility and the installation of any equipment should not degrade the system
to beyond acceptable levels. Meeting IEEE 519 limits can be easy for a facility with primarily linear
loads, and it can be very difficult and costly for a facility with predominantly nonlinear loads. As an
example, some facilities have installed many ASDs for HVAC system motors in an attempt to reduce
energy usage. Unfortunately, each ASD generates current harmonic distortion and nuisance tripping of
other equipment has occurred at some facilities as a consequence. Refer to AFMAN(I) 32-1181 for a
detailed discussion of harmonic distortion and its effects.

4.3.5.2. To limit the impact of harmonic distortion, filtering is recommended on the line side of the ASD.
Reactors can be a cost-effective solution for control of harmonic distortion. Reactors provide a filtering
function by blocking offending harmonic currents, thereby lessening the harmonic effects elsewhere in the
facility.

4.3.5.3. Figure 4.8 shows a line reactor, a reactor applied on the line side of a device. Line reactors are
used on the line side of an ASD to minimize harmonic distortion and reduce the magnitude of voltage
spikes in the electrical system. A line reactor serves the dual purpose of improving the power quality
supplied to the ASD while also minimizing the effect of the ASD on the rest of the electrical system;
ASDs do contribute to the electrical system’s total harmonic distortion.

Figure 4.8. Line Reactor.

4.3.5.4. Figure 4.9 shows an example of a load reactor. Reactors are often used on the load side of an
ASD for the following reasons:

4.3.5.4.1. To provide protection under motor short circuit conditions by acting as a current limiting
device. The reactor slows the rate of rise of the short circuit current and limits the short circuit current to
a more manageable level. By slowing the rate of current rise, the reactor allows more time for the ASD’s
protective circuit to react to the fault.


                                                      48
4.3.5.4.2. To absorb motor-generated surges that might otherwise cause the ASD to trip.

4.3.5.4.3. To reduce harmonic distortion to the motor, which can improve motor efficiency and life.

4.3.5.4.4. To reduce the voltage rise time of the ASD output.

4.3.5.5. Reactors are rated in terms of percent impedance. Higher impedance reactors provide greater
filtering, but also increase the voltage drop. For example, a 3 percent impedance reactor will introduce a
3 percent voltage drop across it under rated conditions. Evaluate the effect of the additional voltage drop
as part of any filter application.

4.3.6. Isolation Transformers. Isolation transformers can be used on the input of an ASD to reduce the
harmonic distortion effect of the electrical system upstream of the ASD. If the only purpose of the
isolation transformer is to reduce the level of harmonic distortion, a line reactor will be a more cost-
effective approach.

4.4. Energy Efficiency Analysis:

4.4.1. ASDs can provide a substantial energy savings when applied to lightly loaded motors. Fully
loaded motors will show little or no energy savings.

4.4.2. ASDs often show a rapid payback when installed on variable air volume (VAV) fan motors to
control fan speed. By controlling the fan motor’s speed and torque, the system can efficiently adjust fan
speed as necessary to satisfy building load conditions. Rather than running at full speed 90 percent to 95
percent of the time, a fan motor controlled by an ASD can operate at speeds of 80 percent or less which
can reduce energy consumption by up to 50 percent, or more. The potential energy savings are
calculated by the affinity laws for fans as follows (Figure 4.10 illustrates the variations as a function of
speed):

4.4.2.1. Quantity of air flow (cfm) varies directly with the fan speed (rpm):

        cfm2   rpm 2
             =
        cfm1   rpm1




                                                    49
4.4.2.2. Pressure (p) varies with the square of the fan speed:

        p 2  rpm 2 
           =       
        p1     rpm1 



4.4.2.3. Brake horsepower (hp) varies with the cube of fan speed:

                                 3

4.4.3. ASDs can also be used to reduce the energy consumption of centrifugal chillers. ASDs are often
installed on only one chiller per system because the fixed speed chillers can be staged for base load, with
the ASD-controlled chiller varying capacity according to swings in the load. Savings can be significant
provided the following conditions are met:

4.4.3.1. Loads are light for many hours per year.

4.4.3.2. The climate does not have a constant high wet bulb temperature.

4.4.3.3. The condenser water temperature can be reset higher under low part load conditions.

4.4.4. If an ASD installation is considered on the basis of energy efficiency, perform an economic
evaluation in accordance with the process shown in Figure 4.11.

4.4.5. Obtain Motor Nameplate Data—Step 1 of Figure 4.11:

4.4.5.1. The motor nameplate data is needed to verify that the motor is capable of acceptable operation
with an ASD. Older motors might overheat at lower operating speeds and also might require special
protection against ASD overvoltages.

4.4.5.2. Confirm with the motor manufacturer the limits associated with operating an existing motor by
an ASD. Determine if motor replacement is needed as part of the ASD design.

4.4.5.3. Refer to paragraphs 4.2.2 through 4.2.2.4 for additional information regarding motor design
criteria for an ASD application.

                                                      51
4.4.6. Determine Actual Motor Load—Step 2 of Figure 4.11:

4.4.6.1. The key to an economic evaluation is to determine whether or not the motor will be fully loaded
under expected operating conditions. If the motor is always loaded at or near 100 percent of rated load,
then little if any savings will be realized by the installation of an ASD. However, it is common to
discover that the actual load current is significantly less than rated. For example, Figure 4.12 shows an
example in which a 60 horsepower (44.8 kW) motor used in an HVAC application normally operates at a
load of less than 24 kW. In this case, an ASD can provide substantial savings.

4.4.6.2. Estimate the operating time for each evaluated motor. As an example, Figure 4.12 shows that
the evaluated motor operated continuously during the monitored period.

4.4.6.3. Calculate the full load input power (kW) of the motor by multiplying its nameplate horsepower
by 0.746 and by dividing by the motor’s full load efficiency:

                                                     0.746 kW
                                                               Rated hp ×
       Motor Full Load Input Power (kW ) =

                                           Full Load Efficiency

4.4.6.4. Estimate the load profile for each evaluated motor. Figure 4.12 shows an example in which the
motor operated near 50 percent of rated load, with little variation in load. In many cases, the one-week
load profile shown in Figure 4.12 will be repeated each week. In other cases, the load cycle might have
seasonal variations. Some applications will exhibit greater load variation even on a daily cycle; for
example, a simple load profile for a motor might be estimated as follows:

4.4.6.4.1. 50 percent of operating time—60 percent of rated load.


                                                                52
4.4.6.4.2. 25 percent of operating time—70 percent of rated load.

4.4.6.4.3. 25 percent of operating time—80 percent of rated load.

4.4.6.5. The energy use can be estimated for a given horsepower motor by the following expression:

                                                       0.746 kW
                               Rated Horsepower ×
        Energy Use (kWh ) =                                     × (# of hours annual use ) × (load factor )
                                                           hp
                                         Rated Efficiency

       EXAMPLE: A 50 horsepower motor with rated efficiency of 94 percent, operating
       continuously throughout the year (8,760 hours) at a load factor of 75 percent, has the
       following expected energy use:
                                       0.746 kW
                             50 hp ×
        Energy Use (kWh ) =                     × (8,760 ) × (0.75) = 260,703 kWh per year
                                           hp
                                     0.94

4.4.6.6. The above information is needed to characterize the existing energy usage and to predict energy
usage with an ASD.

4.4.7. Calculate Predicted ASD Energy Usage—Step 3 of Figure 4.11:

4.4.7.1. The goal is to obtain an energy savings by operating the motor at a lower speed while still
satisfying the load requirements. The ideal application is one defined by the affinity laws of Figure 4.10 in
which power varies with the cube of the motor speed:

                           3
        hp 2  rpm 2 
            =       
        hp1     rpm1 



4.4.7.2. The expected energy usage with an ASD varies with the following parameters:

4.4.7.2.1. Load profile or energy use.

4.4.7.2.2. Percent time that ASD can operate motor at reduced speed.

4.4.7.2.3. Predicted motor speed with ASD operation.

4.4.7.2.4. ASD Efficiency.

4.4.7.3. Applying the affinity laws, use the following equation to predict the energy use with an ASD:

                                      Full Load (kW )
        ASD Energy Use (kWh ) =                          × (Percent Rated Speed ) × ( Number of Hours )
                                                                                 3

                                    ASD Rated Efficiency




                                                     53
       EXAMPLE: Assume the rated full load is 40 kW, the ASD rated efficiency is
       95 percent, the load requirements can be satisfied at a constant reduced speed of
       70 percent of rated speed, and the motor will run continuously throughout the year
       (8,760 hours). The expected energy use with an ASD is given by:

4.4.8. Determine if ASD Requires Special Design Features—Step 4 of Figure 4.11:

4.4.8.1. ASDs are often provided with a minimum of features; the user is expected to specify the options
and design features that are necessary for the given application. ASD manufacturers often ensure
competitive pricing by including design options only as specified by the user.

4.4.8.2. An ASD economic evaluation should be based on the expected ASD installation price including
necessary design options. For example, in some cases, it will be necessary to install a new motor, include
a complete ASD bypass design, and install special power quality design features. Each of these additions
might well be necessary to ensure a reliable design, but they will also increase the ASD installation cost,
thereby extending the payback time.

4.4.8.3. Ensure that the economic evaluation is based on a satisfactory ASD design and reflects the
expected procurement and installation cost of a better quality installation.

4.4.9. Determine Energy Costs and Calculate Estimated Savings—Step 5 of Figure 4.11. The average
energy cost per kWh, including demand charges, should be used to determine the expected annual energy
savings. The energy costs should be based on actual local utility charges.

       EXAMPLE: If the existing motor installation uses 100,000 kWh annually, operation with
       an ASD is expected to use only 36,000 kWh annually, and the average energy cost is
       $0.06/kWh, the estimated annual energy savings is given by:

        ASD Annual Energy Savings = (100,000 kWh − 36,000 kWh ) × $0.06 / kWh = $3,834

4.4.10. Estimate ASD Installation Costs and Calculate Payback Period—Step 6 of Figure 4.11:

4.4.10.1. Paragraphs 4.4.8 through 4.4.8.3 describe the process of determining the ASD design
requirements and the associated cost of special design features. This information is needed to determine
the expected total installation cost of the ASD and associated equipment.

       EXAMPLE: The previous example calculated a predicted annual savings of $3,834 per
       year. Assume the expected ASD installation cost is $10,000. The payback time is
       calculated as follows:
                                         ASD Installation Cost   $10,000
               Payback Time ( years ) =                        =         = 2.6 years
                                        Annual Energy Savings     $3,834




                                                    54
       EXAMPLE: Table 4.1 provides a sample economic evaluation for an ASD installation
       for a continuously operating HVAC system motor. This evaluation was for an
       application in which higher initial ASD costs were expected to address harmonic
       distortion concerns as part of the design. Even so, a payback period of about two years
       is estimated.

4.4.10.2. As can be seen in Table 4.1, an ASD economic evaluation is most sensitive to the following
assumptions:



                                                  55
4.4.10.2.1. Total Motor Operating Time Per Year. Unless it is fully loaded, a continuously energized
motor will show a faster payback than an intermittently energized motor.

4.4.10.2.2. Estimated Actual Motor Load/Speed. For a standard centrifugal fan motor, energy usage is
proportional to the cube of the speed. For example, if the motor speed can be reduced to 80 percent of
rated speed, the energy usage can be reduced to almost 50 percent of its nominal value.

4.4.10.2.3. Cost Per Kilowatt Hour. The local average energy cost should be used.

4.4.10.2.4. ASD Equipment and Installation Cost. For critical locations, the added cost of ensuring
acceptable power quality can double the total initial cost. Even so, an acceptable payback is frequently
obtained.

4.4.10.3. Payback periods greater than 5 years should not be approved solely on the basis of economic
savings; operating system improvements should also be an identified need for these cases.

4.4.10.4. Table 4.1 uses a constant ASD efficiency of 95 percent for this simple example. The ASD
manufacturer can provide the actual ASD efficiency as a function of speed. A single average efficiency is
often acceptable down to 50 percent speed. Below this speed, ASD efficiency declines rapidly and actual
efficiency values should be used as provided by the manufacturer.

4.4.10.5. The motor load factor or load profile is an important value to establish as part of the analysis.
Motors are rarely fully loaded and assuming full load operation will inappropriately inflate the expected
savings. Power or current measurements for at least a week should be recorded to ensure the load is
properly characterized. If seasonal variations are expected, this should also be factored into the analysis.

4.4.10.6. Although ASD energy savings calculations can be performed manually on a spreadsheet as
shown in Table 4.1, ASDMaster® is recommended as the preferred method of performing ASD energy
efficiency analyses. ASDMaster® will provide a detailed analysis of the system to establish the expected
savings. Table 4.1 is provided to illustrate an energy savings analysis and the example was deliberately
kept simple by applying the affinity laws. Refer to paragraphs 4.5.2 through 4.5.2.3 for information
regarding the ASDMaster® energy efficiency analysis.

4.5. ASDMaster® Evaluations:

4.5.1. Introduction:

4.5.1.1. ASDMaster® is a software program developed by the Electric Power Research Institute for the
evaluation of ASDs. It consists of six different modules as follows:

4.5.1.1.1. Instruction. Provides basic information regarding ASD operation, analytical methods, power
quality, and its impact on ASD equipment.

4.5.1.1.2. Energy Analysis. Computes energy usage of conventionally controlled equipment. Provides
examples for various application types.


                                                    56
4.5.1.1.3. Other Benefits.    Assists in the evaluation of non-energy-savings benefits as part of an
economic assessment.

4.5.1.1.4. Equipment Specification. Generates an equipment specification and serves as a checklist for
the consideration of various ASD options and features.

4.5.1.1.5. Database. Includes a database of standard ASDs with search capability to reduce the list to
those ASDs appropriate for the application.

4.5.1.1.6. Economic Analysis. Calculates the economic benefit of installing an ASD. A complete
economic report can be prepared.

4.5.1.2. ASDMaster® is recommended for the evaluation of ASD applications. ASDMaster® is
available from the Bonneville Power Administration, Energy Efficiency, PO Box 3621-NCP, Portland,
Oregon, 97208-3621, and it can be ordered by telephone at 1-800-973-7479.

4.5.2. ASDMaster® Energy Efficiency Analysis:

4.5.2.1. ASDMaster® should be used as a screening tool to determine if an ASD application will provide
an adequate level of energy savings. ASDMaster® has a built-in screening algorithm to determine if the
expected energy savings will be adequate. This screening algorithm provides a quick and easy method to
screen out applications that are not good candidates for adequate energy savings. The screening
algorithm is based on the following inputs:

4.5.2.1.1. Type of load. If the torque and horsepower requirements of the load decrease with decreasing
speed, the application is likely to be a good candidate for an ASD retrofit.

4.5.2.1.2. Load duty cycle. If the load is often well below 100 percent of rated load, the savings can be
substantial.

4.5.2.1.3. Motor size. ASDs cost more with increasing horsepower requirements, but the potential
energy savings increase even more. Larger motors are likely to be better candidates for energy savings.

4.5.2.1.4. Total operating hours. The maximum operating time per year is 8,760 hours. Applications
that run more than 6,000 hours per year are usually good candidates and applications that run less than
2,500 hours per year are often poor candidates.

4.5.2.2. ASDMaster® keeps the initial analysis simple by declaring the application as good, probably
marginal, or probably not a good application. This simplified approach allows the designer to quickly
focus on the most cost-effective applications for ASDs.




                                                   57
4.6. ASD Equipment Specifications:

4.6.1. Introduction:

4.6.1.1. Consider three aspects of an ASD application as part of a specification:

4.6.1.1.1. The environment for the new ASD equipment.

4.6.1.1.2. The motor to be controlled.

4.6.1.1.3. The ASD to be used.

4.6.1.2. A basic need in the specification of the ASD is to define the ASD application as concisely as
possible. Limit information to that which is relevant to the application of the ASD within the overall
system. The best specification is one that does not over specify or over simplify. Avoid specifying items
that are desirable but not necessary, items that can not be directly assessed or measured, and items that
are internal ASD manufacturing design decisions. Specify to ensure the “fitness of purpose” of those
aspects of the ASD that can be directly evaluated.

4.6.1.3. ASDMaster® can be used for the generation of ASD-related equipment specifications.
ASDMaster® effectively functions as an equipment specification checklist to ensure important ASD
features are considered. Upon completion of the equipment specification module, ASDMaster®
generates a complete equipment specification in a format readily understandable by equipment
manufacturers.

4.6.1.4. Attachment 4 provides an example equipment specification; the purpose of this attachment is to
illustrate the type of information needed for a specification.

4.6.2. Motor Information:

4.6.2.1. Either an existing motor might be retrofitted with an ASD or a new motor might be installed
with the ASD. In either case, the motor nameplate information must be provided to the ASD vendor.
Information of interest includes:

4.6.2.1.1. Motor type and NEMA classification.

4.6.2.1.2. Enclosure type.

4.6.2.1.3. Horsepower rating.

4.6.2.1.4. Current, frequency, and voltage rating.

4.6.2.1.5. Rated speed and maximum allowable speed.

4.6.2.1.6. Rated efficiency.


                                                     58
4.6.2.1.7. Service factor.

4.6.2.1.8. Bearing type.

4.6.2.2. For an existing motor, it is important to establish that it is sized to provide the necessary load
torque while operating at reduced speed. The motor’s power capability can be restricted at low speed
because the motor’s shaft-mounted cooling fan is less effective at low speed. Compare the motor output
capability with the load requirement over the full speed range. A constant-speed motor-driven fan might
be required to cool the motor in such applications as constant torque loads. Also, with an existing motor,
ensure that the bearing system will operate properly over the entire speed range. Antifriction bearings are
usually acceptable at all speeds; however, sleeve bearings have a minimum continuous operating speed to
ensure lubrication.

4.6.2.3. ASDs usually generate a steep-fronted output waveform that has a higher voltage rate of change
than a standard 60 hz waveform. This high rate of voltage change can exceed the voltage rating of
existing induction motor windings. The ASD vendor should be informed of the type and age of the
motor to ensure that it will perform properly in an ASD environment. The ASD vendor might
recommend cable termination devices designed to attenuate transient voltages and might require cable
lengths of less than 50 feet (15 meters) between the ASD and the motor.

4.6.2.4. Antifriction bearings can be affected by the PWM voltage waveforms applied to the motor
stator. Capacitive coupling from the stator winding to the rotor can create elevated static voltages.
Unless a safety path is provided for the static charge, the voltage level can build up to a level that will
cause electrical discharge through the lubricant of the antifriction bearing. Each electrical discharge can
produce a small pit on the bearing and repeated discharges will shorten the bearing life. A safety
discharge path can be provided by a ground brush on the motor, electrically conductive grease, or other
methods provided by the ASD or motor vendor.

4.6.2.5. Motor nameplate information is important in the selection of the correct ASD and associated
equipment. Motor speed is particularly important because ASDs are rated according to number of poles.
Applications above 6 poles might require ASD derating to accommodate higher reactive currents.

4.6.2.6. For new motors, the motor vendor should be informed that the application is associated with an
ASD. New motors should be purchased as inverter duty motors.

4.6.3. Motor Interface:

4.6.3.1. The cable length between the ASD and the motor is an important specification item. Depending
on the cable length, the ASD vendor might recommend additional voltage protection for the motor.

4.6.3.2. The ASD might provide some level of protection for the motor. The ASD vendor needs to
understand the protection requirements so that thermal protection is designed properly.




                                                    59
4.6.4. Power Supply:

4.6.4.1. The ASD has to interface with the existing electric supply. The following electrical system
features and characteristics should be known:

4.6.4.1.1. Short circuit current available from the electric supply.

4.6.4.1.2. Harmonic content of the supply voltage before the ASD is applied.

4.6.4.1.3. Degree of voltage unbalance in the supply to the ASD.           Voltage unbalance can cause
additional heating in both motors and ASDs.

4.6.4.1.4. Magnitude and time duration of sags and swells in the supply voltage.

4.6.4.1.5. Variations in electrical supply frequency.

4.6.4.1.6. Presence of automatic power factor correction capacitors, which can cause ASD tripping due
to switching transients.

4.6.4.1.7. Surge transient frequency.

4.6.4.2. If a standby or emergency source of power is available, the above information should be
provided for this power source also. For example, commercial power experiences very minor frequency
variations, but an onsite engine generator might have significant frequency variations.

4.6.5. Enclosure and Enclosure Options:

4.6.5.1. The selected enclosure type depends on the environment around the ASD. Inspect the area
where the ASD is intended to be installed and evaluate for the following types of environmental concerns:

4.6.5.1.1. Large quantities of airborne material, conductive, abrasive, or explosive dust. This material
can collect on unprotected ASD equipment, causing overheating or electrical faults.

4.6.5.1.2. Humid and chemically-laden atmospheres that can penetrate the surface of electrical
components, thereby shortening the life of electrical equipment.

4.6.5.1.3. Presence of rodents, insects, ants, birds, or snakes. The warmth of an ASD cabinet will attract
these pests and the enclosure should be designed to keep them out.

4.6.5.1.4. Ambient temperatures above 104 °F (40 °C). Keeping the ASD equipment clean and cool will
provide the best conditions for reliable operation.

4.6.5.1.5. Complying with equipment clearances and guarding requirements.

4.6.5.2. Enclosure selection also includes the following items:

4.6.5.2.1. Instruments and controls.

                                                        60
4.6.5.2.2. Safety interlocks and lighting.

4.6.5.2.3. Paint type and color.

4.6.5.2.4. Heat rejection capability.

4.6.6. System Environment:

4.6.6.1. ASDs are usually designed to operate in a maximum ambient temperature range of 104 °F
(40 °C) to 122 °C (50 °C). But, life will be extended by keeping the ambient temperature around the
electronics well below this upper limit. Particular attention is required if the equipment is exposed to
direct sunlight. Minimum temperature can be controlled by thermostatically operated space heaters.

4.6.6.2. Specify the humidity at which the ASD will operate. The standard for low voltage ASDs is
95 percent humidity, noncondensing. More severe environments will require special design features.

4.6.6.3. ASDs are designed to reject heat to the surrounding air. Standard designs can operate up to an
elevation of 3,000 feet (914 meters) above sea level. Unless supplemental cooling (air conditioning) is
provided for altitudes above 3,000 feet (914 meters), the ASD and associated equipment might require
derating.

4.6.6.4. ASDs can produce noise from the internal power circuits and associated electronic control
circuits. Acceptable noise levels depend on the application environment.

4.6.6.5. Specify for the expected site vibration levels, which should have been previously specified for
other installed electrical equipment. Standard low voltage ASDs are often able to withstand 0.2 g
(acceleration of gravity) peak at 10 hz to 60 hz.

4.6.7. Efficiency:

4.6.7.1. The desired ASD efficiency should be specified. Efficiencies of 90 percent to 95 percent are
achievable at rated output.

4.6.7.2. The efficiency of the ASD and motor should be provided by the vendor as a function of speed.
This will allow the designer to estimate more closely the expected energy savings for a given application.

4.6.8. Reliability:

4.6.8.1. The ASD reliability should be addressed at two levels: the inherent reliability and maintainability
of the ASD and associated equipment, and the reliability of the ASD when exposed to abnormal
conditions.

4.6.8.2. ASD reliability is specified as either the mean time between failure (MTBF) or as a percentage of
the ASD population that can fail over a period of time (usually per year). Industry data for MTBFs range
from 40,000 to 80,000 hours for good quality ASDs. MTBF data will usually be provided by the
manufacturer.

                                                    61
4.6.8.3. The ASD should also be evaluated with respect to the mean time to repair (MTTR) based on
knowledge regarding available spare parts. The MTTR will be affected by the ASD mechanical
construction and the ease of replacing internal components. Diagnostic tools should help identify the
cause of failure.

4.6.8.4. Some reliability features must be specified for the ASD. Bypass capability, redundancy,
momentary ride-through, and transient susceptibility can require additional design features.

4.6.9. System Protection:

4.6.9.1. Most ASDs offer a full range of protection features that can be applied to most applications.
Review the manufacturer’s standard ASD protection features and adopt the desired features in the
specification.

4.6.9.2. The most important part of system protection is to evaluate ASD performance under system
fault or abnormal conditions. Faults include mechanical overload, electrical short circuit or ground fault
in the motor circuit, or an electrical fault upstream of the ASD.

4.6.10. Control Signals:

4.6.10.1. Determine the available signals for control of the ASD and ensure the specification properly
describes the signal requirements. The ASD must be compatible with the existing electric controls.

4.6.10.2. ASD output signals are used to provide information regarding the operating condition of the
ASD and its load. The required output signals will vary with the facility design.

4.6.10.3. The ASD should have adjustment capability to ensure optimal performance with its motor.
The following adjustments should be provided if needed: current limit, voltage boost, overspeed trip,
volts per hertz, speed regulation, carrier frequency, skip frequency. The commissioning process will
adjust these parameters to obtain the desired performance.

4.6.11. Bypass Capability. A bypass circuit is recommended to allow the motor to be connected directly
to the electric supply, completely bypassing the ASD. This ensures that ASD failure can be
accommodated without complete system loss. Paragraphs 4.2.4 through 4.2.4.6 describe bypass options.

4.7. Summary of ASD Design Considerations:

4.7.1. ASDs are recommended for facility energy efficiency improvements. However, the ASD design
should be carefully evaluated and specified to ensure that ASDs do not cause other electrical system or
operational problems. The following summarizes the important design considerations:

4.7.1.1. The ASD, motor, and driven load must be compatible. The motor should be capable of reliable
operation with an ASD. Refer to paragraphs 4.2.2 through 4.2.2.4.




                                                   62
4.7.1.2. The ASD should not degrade the electrical system beyond acceptable limits by the generation of
harmonic distortion. The ASD should also be capable of withstanding common electrical system
transients such as voltage sags. Refer to paragraphs 4.3.2 through 4.3.4.3.

4.7.1.3. Important applications should include the ability to bypass the ASD. Refer to paragraphs 4.2.4
through 4.2.4.6.

4.7.1.4. The ASD should be carefully specified to ensure that it is compatible with the motor, the driven
load, and the input control signal. Equipment suppliers should certify full compliance with the
specification or identify exceptions. Refer to paragraphs 4.6 through 4.6.11 for additional guidance
regarding ASD specifications.

4.7.2. The expected savings and payback to be realized by an ASD installation should be evaluated as
discussed in paragraphs 4.4 through 4.4.10.6. Applications with a payback of less than 5 years are
preferred and paybacks of less than 2 years are common. The expected savings should not be overly
optimistic. After installation, the ASD should be monitored to confirm that the predicted energy savings
have been achieved. Refer to paragraphs 4.5.2.2 through 4.5.2.3 for an overview of the applications that
are best suited for energy savings by an ASD installation.




                                                   63

                                    ELECTRICAL PROTECTION

5.1. Motor Starting Currents and Short Circuit Protection:

5.1.1. There are two terms (often misused) pertaining to starting current—momentary inrush current and
locked rotor current. The familiar locked rotor current begins after contact closure and tapers off over
several seconds while the motor accelerates. Locked rotor current is limited by NEMA standards to
roughly six times full load current for both standard and energy efficient Design B motors. Design E
motor standards are consistent with European standards and allow a higher locked rotor current in most
horsepower ranges, roughly 10 times full load current.

5.1.2. Another aspect of starting current is the momentary inrush current that persists for less than a
hundredth of a second, which can substantially exceed locked rotor current. Inrush current can spike as
high as 13 times full load current in standard motors and as high as 20 times full load current in Design E
and energy efficient Design B motors. Inrush current is too brief to trip thermal protection devices, but
energy efficient motors powered through magnetic circuit protectors or other instantaneous trip devices
can sometimes experience nuisance starting trips.

5.1.3. The 1999 National Electrical Code (NEC), Article 430-52, states that the instantaneous setting for
an instantaneous only breaker can not exceed 13 times the motor’s full load current, and 17 times for
Design E or Design B energy efficient motors (this NEC article continues to change with each revision
and should be reviewed whenever high starting currents are expected). Unfortunately, this limit may not
always be adequate to prevent nuisance breaker trips during some motor starting transients. When the
circuit is closed to provide power to a motor, the initial current consists of two components: a sinusoidal
steady-state current and a transient component current that rapidly decays away. After a few
milliseconds, only the sinusoidal term remains with a magnitude corresponding to the motor locked rotor
current. As the motor accelerates, the current eventually falls to the normal full load value (see Figure
5.1).

5.1.4. Either thermal-magnetic, magnetic only, or solid-state breakers can be used for motor applications.
Magnetic only breakers provide short circuit and high level ground fault protection. This type of breaker
must be used with a combination motor starter; the starter provides overload protection for each
conductor. The instantaneous trip on the breaker must be adjustable so that it can be set just above the
starting current of the motor, within the limits established by NEC Article 430-52 and NEC Table 430-
152 (1999 edition). This allows for short circuit protection to be provided for any current slightly above
the instantaneous peak starting current of the motor. Figure 5.2 shows this basic arrangement.

5.1.5. A breaker or other protective device must allow a motor to start, accelerate, and attain its full load
current without tripping. Figure 5.3 shows an example set of protective device time-current curves in
relation to an example motor starting curve. After a time interval ranging from several cycles to several
seconds depending on the motor design and the applied voltage, the current falls to the full load current
of the motor. The overload relay and motor circuit protector (MCP) time-current curves must be above
and to the right of the motor starting curve. And, whatever protective devices are selected must satisfy
both design needs: they must allow the motor to start and run under design conditions, but also must
protect the motor from sustained overload or short circuit conditions.

5.1.6. Computer-generated time-current curves will show the motor locked current, usually set about 6
times the motor full load current. But, when voltage is initially applied to a motor, the initial transient
current may peak higher than the motor locked rotor current, which is seldom shown on computer-
generated time-current curves. As the motor accelerates, the current stabilizes at the locked rotor current
of the motor as shown on Figure 5.4. This initial transient current can cause nuisance tripping during
starting and it is often not repeatable because the peak depends on the voltage phase angle at the instant
of starting. Energy efficient motors can have even higher initial transient currents than standard efficiency
motors. This is why the 1999 NEC allows the instantaneous setting for an instantaneous only breaker to
be set as high as 17 times the full load current for Design E or Design B energy efficient motors.

5.1.7. Whenever a standard efficiency motor is replaced with an energy efficient motor, evaluate the
instantaneous overcurrent protection and adjust the instantaneous trip setting as necessary, within NEC
limits, to minimize nuisance trips during starting. If the instantaneous trip setting is adjusted, evaluate the
response to the available short circuit current.

5.2. Overload Protection:

5.2.1. Introduction:

5.2.1.1. A motor can experience an overload condition while running. Although an overload might not
draw enough current to actuate short circuit protection (circuit breaker or fuses), an overload can


                                                                  67
produce sufficient heat to overheat and burn up the motor. The heat generated during an overload
condition eventually causes insulation failure.

5.2.1.2. Circuit breakers and fuses are used to protect against overcurrent conditions such as varying
levels of short circuit current, but these protective devices are not always suitable for overload protection.
In this case, overload relays are used. Overload relays are sized so that they will not open the circuit
during motor starting conditions, but do open under overload conditions. As part of motor protection
design, overload relays will usually have sufficient time delay to allow temporary overloads (such as
motor starting) without opening the circuit. Figure 5.5 shows the approximate time-current
characteristics of standard thermal overload relays.

5.2.2. Overload Relay Selection and Sizing:

5.2.2.1. The overload relay size should be evaluated as part of any motor replacement. A newer energy
efficient motor might have different starting and running characteristics than the motor that was replaced.
For example, many motors are oversized and underloaded, and a motor might be downsized to a lower
horsepower rating as part of an energy efficiency improvement effort. But, the existing motor overload
relays can violate NEC protection requirements if a smaller motor is installed. The overload relay design
must be evaluated as part of a motor change.

5.2.2.2. NEC Article 430-32 (1999 edition) requires continuous duty motors rated above one
horsepower having a marked service factor of not less than 1.15 or a temperature rise not over 104 °F
(40 °C) to have overload protection rated for no more than 125 percent of the motor nameplate full-load
rating. All other continuous duty motors above one horsepower shall have overload protection rated for
no more than 115 percent of the motor nameplate full load rating.


                                                     68
5.2.2.3. Automatically started motors, permanently installed motors, or motors not in sight of the
controller location that are rated one horsepower or less have essentially the same requirements as for
motors above one horsepower. A non-automatically started motor rated at one horsepower or less is
allowed to be protected by the branch circuit short-circuit and ground-fault protective device, provided
that it is within sight of the controller and is not permanently installed.

5.2.2.4. Verify that an overload relay is properly sized for the associated motor and then check the
overload relay tripping time for the motor’s rated locked rotor current. The overload relay tripping time
as a function of current should allow sufficient time for the motor to start, accelerate, and reach full
speed. The selected overload relay should not actuate throughout the motor’s operating current range,
from starting current to long term operation at full load current. If the overload relay size is not adequate
to start the motor or carry the load, the next higher size overload relay is permitted by the 1999 NEC,
provided that it does not exceed the following percentages of motor full load rating:

5.2.2.4.1. 140 percent for motors with a marked service factor of not less than 1.15.

5.2.2.4.2. 140 percent for motors marked with a temperature rise not over 104 °F (40 °C).

5.2.2.4.3. 130 percent for all other motors.

5.2.2.5. If the overload relay is located in a lower ambient temperature than the motor, its time-current
rating should be corrected for the lower ambient temperature. The manufacturer can provide the
appropriate correction factors.

       EXAMPLE: Evaluate the overload protection for the following motor:

           50 horsepower, 460 volts
           65 amperes full-load current
           Locked rotor current = 6 times full-load current
           Motor rated for service factor of 1.15 and 40 °C temperature rise
           Ambient temperatures: 40 °C at motor and 30 °C at starter
           Starter size = NEMA 3
           Overload relay: Class 20, 61.3-65.4 amperes continuous rating

       Maximum allowable trip unit rating is 125 percent of motor full-load rating, or 125
       percent of 65 amperes. Actual trip current is 125 percent of minimum overload relay
       setting, or 125 percent × 61.3 = 76.63 amperes. The actual trip rating is 76.63/65 = 118
       percent, which is acceptable.

       The starter is in a lower ambient temperature than the motor. Assume the manufacturer
       provides an ambient temperature correction factor of 1.1. The approximate trip current
       then is 76.63 × 1.1 = 84.3 amperes. Determine the expected trip time at locked rotor
       current by determining the multiple of trip current rating, or (6 × 65)/84.3 = 4.63.
       Referring to Figure 5.5, the Class 20 overload relay will actuate in about 20 seconds at
       this current. Verify that the motor will start and accelerate well within this time. A 50
       percent safety factor is desirable, or the motor should start within 13 seconds.


                                                     69
5.3. Unbalanced Voltages:

5.3.1. A voltage unbalance occurs when the voltages of a 3-phase supply are not equal. The principal
source of a steady-state voltage unbalance is unbalanced single-phase loads on a 3-phase system.
Unbalanced voltages can also be caused by blown fuses on one phase of a circuit or single phasing
conditions. Even under ideal conditions, a perfectly balanced 3-phase voltage is unlikely because of the
following:

5.3.1.1. Single-phase loads are not evenly distributed among the three phases.

5.3.1.2. Single-phase loads are continually connected and disconnected for the electrical system.

5.3.1.3. The 3-phase supply voltage might not be completely balanced.

5.3.2. Voltage unbalance is an important consideration for 3-phase motor loads. ANSI C84.1, Electrical
Power Systems and Equipment—Voltage Ratings (60 Hz), specifies a no-load service entrance voltage
unbalance of less than 3 percent to avoid motor overheating or failure. Unbalanced voltages cause
3-phase motors to operate at temperatures higher than their rated limits. And, the rate of temperature
rise increases with increasing voltage unbalance.

       EXAMPLE: The temperature rise attributed to voltage unbalance can be estimated as
       follows:

               Temperature Rise (°C ) = 2 × (Percent Unbalance )
                                                                    2




       If the percent voltage unbalance is 4 percent, the expected temperature rise associated
       with this unbalance is:

               Temperature Rise (°C ) = 2 × (4% ) = 32°C
                                                   2




       A common rule of thumb is that every 18 °F (10 °C) reduces expected motor life by
       50 percent. A temperature rise of 36 °F (20 °C) caused by voltage unbalance can reduce
       expected motor life by 75 percent.

5.3.3. High efficiency motors are particularly susceptible to unbalanced voltages; these motors have a
lower negative sequence reactance which causes higher negative sequence currents during unbalanced
voltage conditions.

5.3.4. A motor operating in an unbalanced circuit cannot deliver its rated horsepower and the rated load
capability of 3-phase motors is reduced when voltage unbalance is present. Figure 5.6 shows the internal
temperature rise of motors as a function of percent voltage unbalance. Figure 5.7 shows a derating factor
for 3-phase induction motors as a function of voltage unbalance. As can be seen, unbalanced voltages
can have a significant effect on motor operation and life.

5.3.5. ASDs are also sensitive to voltage unbalance. As the amount of voltage unbalance increases, the
ASD phase current unbalance can be significantly higher. For example, even if the ANSI C84.1
recommended limit of 3 percent voltage unbalance is met, the ASD current unbalance might be higher
than 50 percent, which can actuate some overload protection. ASDs also generate more harmonic
currents with increasing voltage unbalance, including third harmonic current. The magnitude of current
unbalance also depends on the ASD loading, the dc link capacitor size, and the line impedance. Evaluate
the voltage and current unbalance as part of any ASD installation to ensure that the ASD performance
will be acceptable. If an ASD periodically trips off-line, evaluate the degree of current unbalance to
determine if it is potentially actuating overload protection. If the voltage unbalance cannot be corrected
by redistributing single-phase loads, it might be necessary to install filter reactors to improve the current
unbalance (refer to paragraphs 4.3.5 through 4.3.5.5).

5.3.6. A commonly used method of evaluating voltage unbalance is as follows:

                               Maximum Phase Deviation from Average Voltage
       Percent Unbalance =                                                  × 100%
                                            Average Voltage

       EXAMPLE: Assume that phase voltages are 460, 464, and 450. The average phase
       voltage is 458. The maximum deviation from the average voltage is 8 volts and the
       percent unbalance is given by:

                                       8
               Percent Unbalance =        × 100% = 1.75%
                                      458

5.3.7. Notice that the above method of calculating percent unbalance is based on easily taken electrical
measurements. If the percent unbalance exceeds 2 percent, evaluate the electrical system in more detail
to determine if corrective action is necessary.

5.4. ASD Protection:

5.4.1. ASD installations must comply with NEC requirements for overcurrent protection. If a bypass is
provided with the ASD, the bypass must be provided with all NEC required protection. Refer to
paragraphs 4.2.4 through 4.2.4.6 for additional information.

5.4.2. Other ASD design features for protection against voltage transients, harmonics, and other power
quality problems are described in Chapter 4.

                                          COMMISSIONING

6.1. Motor Commissioning:

6.1.1. Motors and motor control circuits should be inspected and tested in accordance with NETA
ATS-1991, Acceptance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Distribution Equipment and
Systems.

6.1.2. If the motor was installed as part of an energy efficiency improvement effort, monitor the motor
running current to confirm that the expected energy savings have been achieved.

6.2. ASD Commissioning:

6.2.1. An ASD installation should be completely inspected and tested to ensure that standard electrical
safety requirements have been met.

6.2.2. An ASD requires a careful checkout to ensure that it operates as expected. The manufacturer’s
installation and startup manual should provide specific guidance for verifying the proper operation of the
ASD. The interfaces to the external control signals must be verified to operate properly and ASD output
functions must be checked.

6.2.3. After the ASD is programmed and fully prepared for operation, the motor should be connected
and started from the ASD. Motor operation with the normal control signal should be confirmed. The
motor speed should be checked from minimum speed to full speed. The motor should be started with full
load applied to confirm that the ASD is capable of accelerating and running the motor.

6.2.4. The power or current input to the ASD should be monitored as part of commissioning to confirm
that the expected energy savings have been achieved.

6.3. Power Quality Monitoring:

6.3.1. Because an ASD can affect the power quality of the electrical system, power quality monitoring
should be performed with and without the ASD operating to determine its impact on the electrical
system.

6.3.2. Refer to IEEE 1159, IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality, for
guidance regarding power quality measurements.

                     REDUCED VOLTAGE MOTOR STARTING METHODS

A3.1. Primary Resistor Starting:

A3.1.1. Primary resistor starting is a reduced voltage starting method that uses a resistor connected in
each motor phase to produce a voltage drop during starting. This reduces the motor starting current as it
passes through the resistor. The associated control circuit closes contacts that bypass the resistors after
the motor has accelerated to the specified speed. By this approach, the motor is started at reduced
voltage, but operates at full line voltage.

A3.1.2. Primary resistor starters provide smooth starting because the voltage increases across the motor
terminals as the motor accelerates. Standard primary resistor starting circuits have a single resistor in
each phase with the voltage reduced to approximately 70 percent of line voltage upon motor starting.
Multiple steps can be obtained in which additional resistance is progressively removed from the circuit as
the motor accelerates.

A3.1.3. The control circuit for primary resistor starting is relatively simple as shown in Figure A3.1.
When the motor starter is energized, the M contacts are closed, thereby applying voltage to the motor
through resistors R1, R2, and R3. Another M contact closes and actuates a timer. After the timer delay,
it closes contacts C1, C2, and C3 to bypass the resistors. The resistor size and wattage is usually selected
based on the motor horsepower.

A3.2. Autotransformer Starting:

A3.2.1. Autotransformer starting uses a tapped 3-phase autotransformer to provide reduced voltage
starting. Autotransformer starting is preferred over primary resistor starting when the motor starting
current must be held to a minimum limit, but the maximum starting torque per line ampere is needed.
During autotransformer starting, the various transformer windings are added to and taken away from the
motor circuit to provide reduced voltage while starting.

A3.2.2. With an autotransformer, the motor terminal voltage does not depend on the load current.
Although the current to the motor will change because of the motor’s changing characteristics during
starting, the voltage to the motor remains relatively constant. In autotransformer starting, the
transformer motor current and the line current are not equal as they are in primary resistor starting.
Instead, the autotransformer turns ratio is used to provide more current on the load side than on the line
side. Autotransformer starting is usually able to provide more starting torque than primary resistor
starting, which can be important for motors with a substantial load.

A3.2.3. Figure A3.2 shows an example of a simplified autotransformer starting circuit. When the motor
starting circuit is initially energized, contacts C2 and C3 are closed to energize the motor through the
transformer circuit. Different taps are usually provided in the autotransformer to allow user control of
the motor starting current. After a specified time delay, contact C1 closes and contacts C2 and C3 open,
thereby placing full line voltage across the motor.

A3.2.3. Two types of autotransformer control schemes are used: open circuit transition and closed
circuit transition. Open circuit transition momentarily disconnects the motor from the circuit as the
autotransformer incrementally adjusts voltage. Closed circuit transition maintains voltage to the motor as
it adjusts the output voltage. Closed circuit transition produces the least disturbance to the electrical
system, but is also more expensive.

A3.3. Part-Winding Starting:

A3.3.1. Part winding starting is a method of starting a motor by first applying power to part of a motor’s
coil windings for starting and then applying power to the remaining coil windings for running.
Part-winding starting is not actually a reduced voltage starting method, but it is classified as reduced
voltage starting because of the reduced current and torque during starting. In most applications, a wye-
connected motor is used, but a delta-connected motor can also be started using part-winding starting.

A3.3.2. Part-winding starting requires the use of a part-winding motor. A part-winding motor has two
sets of identical windings that are designed to be used in parallel. The windings then produce reduced
starting current and reduced starting torque when energized in sequence. Most dual voltage 230/460 volt
motors are suitable for part-winding starting.

A3.3.3. Part-winding control circuits are commonly designed such that one winding of the motor is
connected directly to line voltage upon starting. This winding draws about 65 percent of rated locked
rotor current and develops approximately 45 percent of normal motor torque. After about one second,
the second winding is connected in parallel with the first winding so that the motor is electrically
complete across the line and it develops its normal torque. Figure A3.3 shows a simplified control
circuit. Upon motor starting, M1 energizes starter M1 for the first winding. A contact from M1
energizes the time delay timer, which then energizes M2 after the specified time delay. The motor now
has both sets of windings connected to the line for full current and torque. Notice that each magnetic
motor starter need be only half-size because it controls only half the winding.

A3.3.4. Part-winding starting is less expensive than most other methods because it requires no voltage-
reducing components such as transformers or resistors, and it uses only two half-size contactors. But,
part-winding starting has poor starting torque. Always consult the manufacturer’s specifications before
applying part-winding starting to a motor.




                                                   89
A3.4. Wye-Delta Starting:

A3.4.1. Wye-delta starting accomplishes reduced voltage starting by first connecting the motor leads into
a wye configuration for starting. A motor started in a wye configuration receives approximately 58
percent of the normal line voltage and develops approximately 33 percent of normal torque.

A3.4.2. Wye-delta motors are specially wound with six leads extending from the motor to enable the
windings to be connected in either a wye or a delta configuration. When a wye-delta starter is energized,
two contactors close, with one contactor connecting the windings in a wye configuration, and the second
contactor connecting the motor to line voltage. After a time delay, the wye contactor opens
(momentarily deenergizing the motor) and a third contactor closes to reconnect the motor in a delta
configuration. This is an open transition system because the motor leads are disconnected and
reconnected as the motor is switched from a wye to a delta connection.

A3.4.3. Wye-delta starting does not require additional voltage reducing components such as resistors or
transformers. Also, it produces a higher starting torque per line ampere than part-winding starting, with
less noise and vibration.

A3.4.4. The open transition transfer from wye to delta operation is the principal disadvantage of this
method. Closed transition designs are available at higher cost. Closed transition design is often
accomplished with an additional contactor and resistor bank to maintain the motor windings energized for
the period of transfer from wye to delta.

A3.5. Solid-State Starting:

A3.5.1. Solid-state starting uses a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) that controls motor voltage, current,
and torque during acceleration. This type of starting can provide a smooth, stepless acceleration of the
driven load, which is useful for many industrial applications.

A3.5.2. SCRs are small in size, rugged, and have no contacts. The disadvantage of solid-state starting is
the relatively high cost compared to other options.

A3.6. Comparison of Reduced Voltage Starting Methods:

A3.6.1. Several reduced voltage starting methods are available. However, there is not a single method
that is appropriate for all applications. The amount of reduced current, the amount of reduced torque,
and the cost of each method must be considered when selecting the starting method. Also, the selection
cannot focus only on the method that reduces the most starting current. If the starting current is reduced
too low, the motor will not start and the overloads will eventually trip.

A3.6.2. The amount of starting current reduction can be compared for each reduced voltage starting
method. The starting current reduction is adjustable with autotransformer or solid-state starting. Some
primary resistor starting methods have some adjustment capability, while other available types have no
adjustment capability. Part-winding and wye-delta methods are not adjustable. Figure A3.4 shows the
starting current that can be achieved with each type.

A3.6.3. The reduction in applied torque can also be approximated for each method. As with the starting
current, the torque reduction is adjustable with the autotransformer and the solid-state methods.
Autotransformer starting is adjustable to the degree allowed by the transformer types and solid-state
starting is adjustable throughout its range. With each method, the applied torque must be greater than
the load torque or else the overloads will trip. For this reason, the torque requirements must be
considered when selecting the reduced voltage starting method. Figure A3.5 provides a summary of the
current, torque, and cost of each method.

A3.6.4. The first consideration is the reduction in starting current or starting torque compared to the
load requirements when selecting a reduced voltage starting method. Second, cost should be considered,
particularly because of the wide variation in cost between methods.

                                                    91
A3.6.5. The primary resistor starting method is used when it is necessary to restrict inrush current to a
predetermined value or increments. Primary resistors can be designed for almost any current inrush limit
and they provide smooth motor acceleration.

A3.6.6. The autotransformer starting method provides the highest possible starting torque per ampere of
line current and is the most effective means of motor starting for applications where the inrush current
must be reduced with a minimum sacrifice of starting torque. Multiple taps are provided to allow for
field adjustment. Cost must be considered because this method is more expensive.

A3.6.7. Part-winding starting is simple in construction and has a low cost. It provides a simple method
for starting low-torque loads. The cost is lower because no external resistors or transformers are
required.

A3.6.8. Wye-delta starting is suitable for applications involving long accelerating times or frequent starts.

A3.6.9. Solid-state starting provides smooth, stepless acceleration, and it controls motor voltage,
current, and torque during the acceleration. This method provides the most control over a wide range,
but it is also the most expensive method.

A3.6.10. Table A3.1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each reduced voltage starting
method.
