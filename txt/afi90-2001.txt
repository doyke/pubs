                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background. The Air Force Encroachment Management (AFEM) Program addresses
encroachment and sustainment challenges that have the potential to affect both the Air Force
mission and the quality of life in surrounding communities. It is a cross-functional program that
integrates Air Force efforts to sustain operations by preventing or reducing the impacts of
encroachment on Air Force facilities and missions. This Instruction defines encroachment
management responsibilities at the Headquarters United States Air Force (HAF), MAJCOM,
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and installation levels; these
responsibilities, which leverage existing foundational programs and resources, include the
designation of encroachment management teams and the development of Installation Complex
Encroachment Management Action Plans (ICEMAPs).
1.2. Foundational Programs. The AFEM Program goals, objectives, and compliance
requirements will be accomplished through the effective implementation of foundational
programs. The purpose of the AFEM Program is to leverage these programs to manage
encroachment through existing forums, rather than creating new or additional duties. In order to
protect the ability of the Air Force to execute its mission, while complying with state and federal
regulations and protecting the public’s health, safety, and welfare, the installation-level
encroachment management program builds on and integrates existing foundational programs,
which may include, but are not limited to: Comprehensive Planning programs including the Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program, the Installation Development Plan (IDP),
and the Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) Program; Airspace Management programs including the
Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/AAA) Program, the Airfield Operations
Compliance Inspection (AOCI), and the Mission Compatibility Evaluation Process for renewable
and other energy projects; Environmental Programs including Natural Resources Management,
Cultural Resources Management, and the Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management
Program; Range Management programs including Comprehensive Range Plans; Antiterrorism
(AT) Programs, including Installation Vulnerability Assessments; and Communications
Programs including the Air Force Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program. These
foundational programs, and others, are the core of encroachment management. Through these
programs, and the greater situational awareness of encroachment developed through
implementation of the AFEM framework (see Section 1.4), the Air Force will be able to
anticipate, prevent, and reduce the majority of encroachment and sustainment challenges
affecting missions and communities.
   1.2.1. The AFEM Program leverages existing foundational programs to create
   comprehensive encroachment Management Actions. While this Instruction does not establish
   new billets or Unit Manning Documents for the Executive Director of the IEMT (see Section
   2.29.2), it does provide new structure and support to the personnel responsible for
   encroachment management programs at all levels of the Air Force.
   1.2.2. AICUZ Program. The Air Force AICUZ Program, where applicable, works to prevent
   incompatible development around military air installations by promoting compatible land use
   practices. AICUZ Program objectives include protecting the public health, safety, and
 6                                                            AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


     welfare from the impacts of Air Force activities within the AICUZ area of influence (i.e.,
     zones) and protecting Air Force operations from the impacts of incompatible development.
     Since the mid-1970s, the AICUZ Program has been the Air Force’s primary encroachment
     management program. The concept of collaboratively working with local governments to
     achieve mission compatible land development and engaging with local civic, real estate, and
     development groups is critical to encroachment management strategies. The AICUZ Program
     remains one of the primary foundational programs for the AFEM Program.
1.3. A Systems Approach to Encroachment Management. The Air Force is using a systems
approach to manage encroachment and sustainment challenges, which are defined in Attachment
2. Each Air Force installation is a system comprised of smaller system components (e.g., airfield,
transportation, and utility systems). Other associated systems also exist outside the fenceline that
are critical to successful execution of the installation mission; these include airspace, ranges, and
other geographically separate facilities and sites (e.g., missile fields, radar relays, and drop
zones). Together, these assets comprise the larger system called the Installation Complex (IC).
Each component of the IC is essential to accomplish the mission; a threat to any one component
is a threat to the integrity of the whole system. Additionally, units at one location may routinely
require the use of facilities, ranges, and airspace that are associated with another installation, or
even another Service. These other routinely used assets are called the Mission Footprint (MF).
The combined IC/MF defines the geographic area that must be monitored for encroachment. The
Installation Complex may be defined differently for overseas installations, based on bi-lateral
agreements. Installations should contact their MAJCOM Encroachment Management Team
(EMT) Chair for more information if needed.
     1.3.1. The IC/MF must function within the larger regional system, which includes other
     military installations, other federal lands, and state and private lands. This systems approach
     expands upon the traditional, installation-centric focus to encroachment management and
     requires installation commanders to address encroachment and sustainment challenges across
     the system, while engaging other commanders who manage lands, facilities, airspace, and
     ranges that provide direct mission support to the installation. It is essential for Air Force
     installations to be aware of the users, owners, and operators of IC/MF system components to
     promote situational awareness and facilitate communication when conditions change.
1.4. AFEM Framework. A framework that cuts across organizational boundaries allows for a
cross-functional, integrated approach to encroachment management. The AFEM Framework
(Figure 1.1) consists of the following four elements (see Chapter 3 for details on each element):
     1.4.1. Organize: creates the structure and scope for the AFEM Program at all Air Force
     echelons.
     1.4.2. Assess: develops and maintains enterprise-wide knowledge of the 13 encroachment
     and sustainment challenge areas (see Attachment 2).
     1.4.3. Act: implements encroachment Management Actions and strategies to achieve
     appointed goals.
     1.4.4. Monitor: provides continuous situational awareness of encroachment and sustainment
     challenges.
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     7


Figure 1.1. AFEM Framework.




1.5. Engagement within AFEM. Successful encroachment management requires all echelons
of the Air Force to engage, build relationships, and work collaboratively with communities,
regions, states, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), federal agencies, and individual land
owners to ensure enduring mission capability that also supports community sustainability.
Proactive outreach and engagement are required to maintain situational awareness of the IC/MF
area. Engagement with stakeholders, both internal and external to the IC/MF, is the foundation
upon which the AFEM Framework functions. At overseas installations, implement this
paragraph with applicable international agreements, COCOM policy, and LEC directives.
1.6. Waivers. Waivers to this Instruction are authorized and shall be processed IAW AFI 33-
360. Waiver authority for this Instruction is delegated to SAF/IEI for compliance items above the
unit level. For unit-level compliance items, waivers may be approved by the appropriate Tier
waiver approval authority. At the unit level, the IEMT Executive Director should monitor
implementation of this Instruction and review authorized waivers anytime the circumstances that
prompted the waiver or the impacts of the excepted activity change substantially.
   1.6.1. Waiver requests. The content of a waiver request must include details specific in AFI
   33-360, paragraph 1.9.5.2. Additional content is at the discretion of the waiver authority. For
   waiver requests needing publication OPR/Approver concurrence or approval (SAF/IEI or
   higher), the waiver request must also include the following:
       1.6.1.1. Installation name, location, and a point-of-contact.
       1.6.1.2. Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander/director
       is requesting a waiver.
       1.6.1.3. Description of the conditions at issue to include:
           1.6.1.3.1. Potential alternatives and their impact on test and training operations,
           maintenance, cost, and other factors deemed appropriate by the requesting agency.

                   ENCROACHMENT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

3.1. Introduction. Because encroachment and sustainment challenges arise from a variety of
internal and external sources, proactive engagement, both internally and externally, will help Air
Force leadership protect current missions, prepare for future missions, and ensure the
sustainability of the IC/MF and surrounding community. To promote successful engagement, the
Air Force utilizes a cross-functional AFEM Framework, introduced in Chapter 1, which
integrates activities of existing foundational programs into a comprehensive encroachment
management strategy. Without this integrating framework, encroachment management becomes
disjointed and Air Force installations, and the missions they support, could be compromised.
Additional details on encroachment management are provided on the AFEM SharePoint
(https://eis.af.mil/cs/safiei/default.aspx) or successor site.
3.2. AFEM Framework. The four elements in the AFEM Framework (Organize, Assess, Act,
and Monitor) introduced in Chapter 1, are further described below.

Figure 3.1. AFEM Framework.




3.3. Organize. Organizing for successful encroachment management requires strong, sustained
leadership involvement, a cross-functional management structure (e.g., EMTs) at all echelons of
the Air Force, a designated Executive Director to implement the AFEM Program at the
installation level, an issue elevation structure, and a well-defined geographic scope for the
program (the IC/MF).
   3.3.1. Leadership Involvement. Air Force leadership at the HAF, MAJCOM/DRU, FOA,
   and installation levels must maintain situational awareness of the mission and community
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   23


  impacts of encroachment in order to provide the necessary proactive and sustained leadership
  involvement required to combat encroachment and sustainment challenges.
  3.3.2. Cross-Functional Management. Encroachment issues are addressed by the cross-
  functional EMWG at HAF and by the EMT structure at MAJCOMs/DRUs and installations.
     3.3.2.1. HAF EMWG. The HAF EMWG is a cross-functional working group, formally
     established by SAF/IEI. The EMWG develops and refines proposed courses of action to
     address encroachment and sustainment challenges and provides recommendations to the
     Strategic Basing-Executive Steering Group (SB-ESG) for approval or situational
     awareness, when appropriate.
         3.3.2.1.1. EMWG Membership. The EMWG includes Air Force leadership at the O-6
         level, their civilian equivalents, or their representatives from across HAF. Invitations
         for others to become members of the EMWG may be extended by the EMWG Chair
         (SAF/IEI) or Vice-Chairs (AF/A3O-B and AF/A7C). The EMWG membership
         includes designated primary and alternate representatives from the following
         organizations: Legislative Liaison (SAF/LLP); SAF/GCN; Public Affairs
         (SAF/PAO); Finance & Budget (SAF/FMB); SAF/CIO A6; Manpower (AF/A1M);
         Intelligence (AF/A2CG); Logistics (AF/A4L); Strategic Basing (AF/A8PB); Studies
         and Analysis (AF/A9R); Safety (AF/SE); Surgeon General (AF/SG); Test and
         Evaluation (AF/TE); AF/A7S; AF/A10; Air Force Reserve (AF/REX); NGB/A7;
         AFLOA/JACE; and AFSMO. The EMWG is supported by additional FOA subject
         matter experts, as needed. The EMWG shall:
             3.3.2.1.1.1. Maintain situational awareness of encroachment and sustainment
             challenges across the Air Force.
             3.3.2.1.1.2. Review and monitor encroachment Management Actions and
             address, as needed, encroachment and sustainment challenges elevated through
             the EMT guidance described below. (See Section 3.3.3)
             3.3.2.1.1.3. Advocate for education and training requirements throughout the Air
             Force.
             3.3.2.1.1.4. Advocate for policy and legislative initiatives to prevent and reduce
             encroachment.
             3.3.2.1.1.5. Review and comment on Air Force policy, guidance, or initiatives
             related to encroachment management.
             3.3.2.1.1.6. Review proposed AFEM research needs, endorse recommendations,
             and advocate for funding through appropriate research programs. Research may
             be needed to identify and develop technical solutions and strategies to prevent or
             reduce the impacts of encroachment. When the need for research is identified,
             either in an ICEMAP or through other means, it shall be reviewed and validated
             through the EMT structure and elevated to HAF. Results of such research will be
             briefed to the EMWG.
             3.3.2.1.1.7. Task subordinate offices, as necessary and appropriate, with specific
             action items related to encroachment management.
24                                                      AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


     3.3.2.2. MAJCOM/DRU EMT. MAJCOM and DRU Commanders will establish
     EMTs and designate the EMT Chair and Vice Chair. The MAJCOM/DRU EMT advises
     and assists the MAJCOM/DRU Commander and appropriate organizations with their
     encroachment management responsibilities, serving as the primary intermediary between
     HAF and installations. Further, the MAJCOM/DRU EMT engages, as necessary, with
     both the EMWG and IEMTs on encroachment and sustainment challenges. The
     MAJCOM/DRU EMT can establish issue-oriented working groups to address specific
     encroachment and sustainment challenges that affect MAJCOM/DRU installations (e.g.,
     a Sustainable Water Strategy Working Group) (T-2).
        3.3.2.2.1. MAJCOM/DRU EMT Membership. The MAJCOM/DRU EMT shall
        include representatives from the following organizations (additional representatives
        may be invited where appropriate): Airfield Management; Airspace Management;
        TERPS; Budget; Civil Engineer (e.g., Environmental, Community Planner/AICUZ
        Manager, Real Property); Communications; PA; Manpower, Organization, and
        Resources; Plans; Range Operations; Tenant Commands (e.g., ANG or Air Force
        Reserve Command (AFRC)); Safety; Security Forces; Spectrum Management; Staff
        Judge Advocate; Command Surgeon; Weather; Logistics; and Test and Evaluation.
        These representatives provide the subject matter expertise necessary to allow the
        EMT to address encroachment across the MAJCOM/DRU enterprise. Relevant FOAs
        and SAF/IEE REOs can be invited to participate as members of the MAJCOM/DRU
        EMT, as requested. EMT members are responsible for sharing and distributing cross-
        functional knowledge of encroachment and sustainment challenges to each other.
        This information-sharing will promote situational awareness of encroachment issues.
        The MAJCOM/DRU EMT shall:
            3.3.2.2.1.1. Maintain situational awareness of encroachment across their
            enterprise. To promote cross-functional awareness of encroachment, EMT
            members shall routinely provide updates on the status of current and potential
            challenges within their program areas of responsibility and expertise to other
            members of the EMT.
            3.3.2.2.1.2. Coordinate the review of and develop positions for, when necessary
            and appropriate, the MAJCOM/DRU commander on proposed federal, state, or
            local agency legislation, regulations, guidelines, programs, or plans that could
            result in encroachment. Provide input, when necessary and appropriate, to reviews
            of state legislation and regulations to the appropriate SAF/IEE REO for
            integration with other MAJCOM or installation resources.
            3.3.2.2.1.3. Assist the MAJCOM/DRU in communicating the Air Force’s overall
            encroachment management policy and guidance to their installations.
     3.3.2.3. IEMT. The installation commander will establish an IEMT to assist in
     implementing the AFEM Program at the installation. Instead of creating a new cross-
     functional team, installations may utilize (and augment as necessary to ensure the
     appropriate functional organizations are represented) existing teams, such as the Air
     Operations Board, the Facilities Board, or the Environmental Safety and Occupational
     Health Council, to conduct the duties of the IEMT. Additionally, the IEMT can establish
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                25


     issue-oriented working groups to address specific encroachment and sustainment
     challenges (T-3).
        3.3.2.3.1. IEMT Membership. The membership of the IEMT shall include
        representatives from the following functional organizations (additional
        representatives may be invited where appropriate): Airfield Operations (e.g., Airfield
        Management, Air Traffic Control); Airspace Management; TERPS; Financial
        Management; Civil Engineer (e.g., Environmental, Community Planner/AICUZ
        Manager, Real Property, Emergency Manager); Communications; PA; Manpower,
        Organization, and Resources; Range Management; Installation Tenants (e.g., ANG or
        AFRC); Safety; Security Forces; Spectrum Management; Office of the Staff Judge
        Advocate; Surgeon General (e.g., Bioenvironmental Engineering); Weather; and Test
        and Evaluation. These representatives provide the subject matter expertise necessary
        to allow the IEMT to address encroachment across the IC/MF. Relevant FOAs and
        SAF/IEE REOs can be invited to participate as members of the IEMT, as requested.
        IEMT members are responsible for sharing and distributing cross-functional
        knowledge of encroachment and sustainment challenges to each other. This
        information-sharing will promote situational awareness of encroachment issues;
        opportunities may include, but are not limited to, Wingman Days, Newcomer
        Briefings, and Commander’s Calls. The IEMT shall (T-3):
            3.3.2.3.1.1. Maintain situational awareness across the IC/MF. Annually review
            the IC/MF for accuracy and update as appropriate. Routinely provide updates on
            the status of current and potential encroachment and sustainment challenges
            within their program areas of responsibility and expertise to other members of the
            IEMT. Report annually on the status of the AFEM Program implementation at the
            installation level to the MAJCOM EMT (T-3).
            3.3.2.3.1.2. Conduct an internal encroachment study and develop an internal
            ICEMAP (if no external ICEMAP exists). Annually maintain the internal
            ICEMAP until the external study and ICEMAP are completed (see Section 3.4 for
            additional details on encroachment studies and ICEMAPs). Once the external
            study and ICEMAP are complete, the IEMT will maintain the Action Plan portion
            (including the Management Action Spreadsheet) to ensure it reflects current
            conditions (T-3).
            3.3.2.3.1.3. Brief the installation commander, tenant commanders, and other
            internal stakeholders, at least annually, on encroachment, emerging threats, the
            status of progress on prioritized action items, and recommended encroachment
            management focus areas for the coming fiscal year (T-3).
            3.3.2.3.1.4. Through established processes, comment upon pending and potential
            legislation that could result in actions affecting IC/MF operations (T-3).
  3.3.3. Executive Director of the IEMT. The Executive Director of the IEMT is the
  installation lead for coordinating AFEM Program activities. The Executive Director will
  report to the installation commander, serving as the primary advisor to leadership on
  encroachment and sustainment challenges and proposed management strategies (T-3).
26                                                         AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


  3.3.4. Elevating Issues. Although most encroachment and sustainment challenges will be
  addressed at the installation level, there may be situations in which MAJCOMs or higher
  headquarters can provide guidance or assistance, or should simply be made aware of a
  potentially sensitive situation, such as negative mission impacts, negative media attention, or
  political interests. The guidelines for conditions or situations that should be elevated to the
  next higher level are depicted in Figure 3.2. HAF will mediate conflicts arising between
  tenants and hosts under different MAJCOMs or Services. Relevant energy projects analyzed
  through the Mission Compatibility Evaluation Process must be elevated through the DOD
  Siting Clearinghouse process when necessary.
     3.3.4.1. Formal and informal project reviews tasked to the Air Force by the DOD Siting
     Clearinghouse can lead to substantive discussions between installation personnel and
     energy project proponents, the focus of which are identifying mitigations to mission
     impacts created by proposed energy projects. The purpose of an informal review is to
     identify potential impacts and provide the project proponent with an installation point of
     contact for further discussions. During a formal review, if unacceptable impacts are
     identified, a Mitigation Response Team (MRT) will routinely be established by the DOD
     Siting Clearinghouse. It is the responsibility of the IEMT or appropriate installation
     personnel to initially work with the developer to resolve the conflict. HAF and MAJCOM
     assistance are available as needed. If the developer is willing to negotiate, periodic
     updates (e.g., every two weeks) should be provided to AF/A3O-B through the MAJCOM.
     These updates will be provided by AF/A3O-B to the DOD Siting Clearinghouse and to
     the FAA, as required. If the conflict cannot be resolved at the local level, or the developer
     is unwilling to negotiate, then it should be elevated to the MAJCOM. The MAJCOM
     should determine if the conflict can be resolved and if not, then it should be elevated to
     HAF. In these cases, HAF will coordinate with OSD to establish a HAF/OSD level MRT.
     3.3.4.2. EMWG Issue Elevation. The EMWG reviews very significant encroachment and
     sustainment challenges elevated through the EMT structure, such as those that may
     constrain military readiness or operational capacity and capability, or those that may
     result in negative impacts on local communities. The chair of the EMWG decides
     whether to elevate an issue to the SB-ESG IAW Figure 3.2. The SB-ESG approves or
     recommends any major courses of action to the SECAF or the Chief of Staff of the US
     Air Force (CSAF), as appropriate.
     3.3.4.3. MAJCOM Issue Elevation. In addition to supporting the MAJCOM/DRU
     commander, the EMT will elevate issues IAW the guidelines provided in Figure 3.2
     through the appropriate member’s chain of command to HAF, via the program manager.
     MAJCOM EMTs may also set their own criteria for specific types of issues they wish to
     see elevated to their level. MAJCOM EMT briefings to the HAF-level EMWG will be
     coordinated with relevant FOAs, SAF/IEE REOs, and IEMTs, as necessary.
     3.3.4.4. Installation Issue Elevation. In addition to the guidelines in Figure 3.2, IEMTs
     can elevate issues, using their own discretion, in unique or extreme circumstances to the
     MAJCOM EMT.

   3.3.5. IC/MF. The IC/MF (see Section 1.3) defines the geographic scope of an installation’s
   encroachment management responsibilities. The IC/MF is used to understand total system
   requirements, including component control and usage responsibilities, needed to support host
   and tenant operations. The IC/MF also helps identify stakeholders with shared interests.
      3.3.5.1. Mapping the IC/MF. A geospatial depiction of the IC/MF will be created using
      approved data sources IAW AFI 32-10112. The IEMT, with assistance from AFCEC as
      necessary, is responsible for maintaining the currency of IC/MF maps, or creating an
      initial map if one does not exist, to ensure that encroachment studies address challenges
      across the IC/MF. Where one exists, the GI&S office will create, collect, and standardize
      data used to develop the IC/MF and ICEMAP, providing consistent analysis of
      encroachment and sustainment challenges. Any geospatial data created, collected, or
      maintained shall be done so in DOD Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure,
      and Environment 3.0 format (or successor format) IAW the AF/A7C Geobase
      governance process. Once compiled, installations will store and update their data at
      DISA-Global Information Grid (GIG) Content Delivery System (GCDS). Working
      versions may be stored either at a GCDS workspace or at an installation-level location.
          3.3.5.1.1. Details on defining the IC/MF, Region of Influence (ROI), and ROI
          Priority Areas, including preferred data sources, can be found on the AFEM
          SharePoint site (https://eis.af.mil/cs/safiei/default.aspx). These maps are housed on
          the AFEM SharePoint site and should be updated as part of the internal or external
          study (see Section 3.4.1).
      3.3.5.2. Region of Influence. The ROI is the larger geopolitical area that the installation
      operates within, including the installation and other assets such as airspace and training
      areas. This area usually coincides with communities where the installation has contextual
      interest (i.e., economic, political, cultural, social, environmental, and legal) and focuses
      outreach and engagement resources. The ROI defines the areas where the installation or
      its higher headquarters should engage with external stakeholders to address prevention or
 28                                                         AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


       reduction measures for the impact of mission operations on nearby communities or vice
       versa.
          3.3.5.2.1. ICEMAP ROI Priority Areas. In cases where the ROI includes extensive
          geographic areas (e.g., such as multi-state Military Training Routes (MTRs)), the
          ICEMAP delineates ICEMAP ROI Priority Areas to focus limited engagement
          resources on the geopolitical areas where critical mission operations take place or
          stakeholder actions incompatible with mission operations have been identified or are
          most likely to occur. The factors that determine the ICEMAP ROI Priority Areas will
          vary between installations because each ICEMAP is tailored for an installation’s
          mission operations, encroachment challenge analysis, and required outreach. ROIs
          change over time as installations and communities evolve. Thus, the ROI and the ROI
          Priority Areas in particular, should be monitored for trends and changes in use, local
          and regional planning, and development.
       3.3.5.3. Engagement within the IC/MF. The IC/MF geopolitical area should be used to
       identify local communities where some level of outreach and engagement may be needed
       (i.e., the ROI) to address encroachment and sustainment challenges. The IC/MF helps the
       IEMT identify and prioritize stakeholder and engagement strategies for all relevant sites
       and activities.
3.4. Assess. This key component of the AFEM Program (see Figure 3.1) includes developing
encroachment studies and ICEMAPs and studying internal and external relationships. IEMT
members will study encroachment and sustainment challenges across the entire IC/MF. These
challenges (defined in Attachment 2), can be more generally grouped into five broad categories:
1) Environmental, Health or Safety Regulatory Restrictions; 2) Compatible Use; 3) Competition
for Resources; 4) Security; and 5) Long-term Mission Sustainment.
   3.4.1. Encroachment Studies. The encroachment study is the process used to develop an
   ICEMAP. There are two types of studies: 1) the mandatory internal study, which is
   conducted by the IEMT using in-house resources and produces an internal ICEMAP, and 2)
   the optional external study, which is conducted by a contractor or MAJCOM (in close
   coordination with installation staff) and produces an external ICEMAP which will build off
   of, and replace, the internal ICEMAP. Both studies apply mission and community constraints
   (defined in Attachment 2) to identify encroachment and sustainment challenges.
   Additionally, both studies evaluate the installation’s encroachment condition, relative to four
   evaluation factors: 1) mission impacts; 2) community impacts; 3) program implementation;
   and 4) external stakeholders; there is also a “N/A” category for those factors that are not
   applicable. The major differences between the two studies include the depth and extent of the
   analysis and the team conducting the study. The IEMT is responsible for maintaining the
   currency of internal and external ICEMAPs. Additional details on the study are on the AFEM
   SharePoint site (https://eis.af.mil/cs/safiei/default.aspx). The encroachment studies include
   criteria that will be used to determine the condition of stakeholder relationships and identify
   gaps where relationships are needed. The encroachment studies also include the development
   of Management Actions.
       3.4.1.1. Internal Study. The internal study process leverages foundational programs and
       resources to produce a baseline encroachment analysis and associated proposed
       management actions to prevent or reduce encroachment. To conduct the study and
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    29


     develop the internal ICEMAP, IEMT members will understand their respective areas of
     responsibility across the IC/MF in relation to encroachment and sustainment challenges.
     The internal study also includes a brief analysis of existing stakeholder relationships and
     the development of Management Actions, which will drive resource prioritization.
     Identified stakeholder relationships should be maintained or updated through existing
     information-sharing processes to raise awareness of the AFEM Program. A detailed
     description of how to conduct the internal study is on the AFEM SharePoint site
     (https://eis.af.mil/cs/safiei/default.aspx). The internal study process does not include
     active engagement with external stakeholders.
     3.4.1.2. External Study. The external study process is a more detailed, comprehensive
     analysis of the IC/MF, is completed in close coordination with the IEMT, and produces
     an external ICEMAP. The external study can be completed by contractor or MAJCOM
     personnel, with additional reachback support provided by AFCEC or other FOAs, as
     needed. Centrally funded or contracted support from MAJCOMs can supplement the
     external study process at the installation level. The external study process includes the
     components of the internal study process, as well as comprehensive reviews of Air Force
     programs, comprehensive reviews of relevant installation reports and documents,
     interviews with internal and external stakeholders, and research of external programs,
     policies, and conditions that contribute to potential encroachment, as appropriate. The
     external study provides the context for each of the encroachment and sustainment
     challenge areas and the team’s findings, including proposed solution strategies, a detailed
     outreach and engagement strategy, and the Commander’s Action Plan.
  3.4.2. ICEMAPs. Active encroachment management requires an Action Plan to prioritize
  the use of resources and initiatives that provide the best opportunities for success. Internal
  and external ICEMAPs are required to include four basic items: 1) the identification of
  encroachment and sustainment challenges; 2) the identification of resources and
  opportunities for overcoming identified threats (i.e., Management Actions); 3) a plan to
  address each challenge as appropriate, although some challenges may not warrant or require
  action; and, 4) a tracking tool for maintaining progress (i.e., a Management Action
  Spreadsheet). ICEMAPs are living documents that require maintenance as conditions change;
  the IEMT is responsible for maintaining the currency of ICEMAPs by continuously
  identifying and studying new encroachment and sustainment challenges and solution
  strategies. An internal ICEMAP should contain, at minimum, a description and map of the
  IC/MF, encroachment condition summaries for relevant encroachment and sustainment
  challenge areas, Management Actions and a Management Action Spreadsheet, and a
  Stakeholder Matrix. (See Attachment 3 for a notional listing of external ICEMAP contents.)
     3.4.2.1. JLUS and AFEM Relationship. The AFEM Program builds on, and enhances,
     other programs that address encroachment issues, such as the OSD OEA Compatible Use
     program. The Compatible Use program is the only federal program that provides direct
     assistance to communities to help them work with the military to prevent and reduce
     encroachment. For installations within the United States, technical and financial
     assistance is available for state and local governments through the JLUS process to
     partner with local military installations to plan and implement strategies promoting
     compatible civilian use adjacent to installations, ranges, and military flight corridors. The
     JLUS process and the encroachment study with its resulting ICEMAP are DOD and Air
30                                                          AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


     Force mechanisms that provide value in addressing encroachment and sustainment
     challenges. The JLUS is a community-driven initiative to guide compatible civilian
     development within military areas of influence (e.g., installation, ranges, military training
     routes, etc.). The encroachment study and resulting ICEMAP represent an internal Air
     Force analysis of encroachment factors with prioritized management actions for the
     Installation Commander and IEMT. See Department of Defense Instruction 3030.3, Joint
     Land Use Study (JLUS) Program, for additional details.
     3.4.2.2. The JLUS Process. Based upon the Air Force’s technical data describing the
     operational activities, MF, and areas of influence, the affected jurisdictions engage with a
     variety of stakeholders (including military; federal, state, and local officials; residents;
     businesses; and landowners) to develop a strategic plan with specific implementation
     actions. The underlying purpose of a JLUS primarily enables associated jurisdictions to
     address and prevent incompatible civilian development that could impair the operational
     utility of the military missions or affect available resources (e.g., air, land, water, and EM
     spectrum). Some examples of implementation actions include establishing military
     overlay districts with specific land use and zoning requirements; unified development
     ordinances; amending capital improvement plans; transfer of development rights;
     building code, sound attenuation measures; and local development review procedures to
     ensure input from the military.
  3.4.3. Host–Tenant and Joint Base Internal Relationships. Strong host–tenant and Joint
  Base internal relationships are necessary for effective encroachment management;
  understanding the quality, type, and frequency of these relationships supports the
  development of successful encroachment management and engagement strategies. Air Force
  ICs support their host unit (i.e., the primary user and manager of the installation) and a
  potentially large and diverse number of tenants and/or mission partners. While these missions
  may be complementary to the host unit’s mission, competition is not uncommon for
  facilities, operating space, or other resources. Installations shall incorporate tenant and/or
  mission partner missions and operating space into the AFEM Program and include them in
  the encroachment studies and ICEMAPs, when applicable. At Joint Bases, Supporting
  Commanders are responsible for implementing encroachment management in support of the
  supported Services operational mission, IAW the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for
  Installations and Environment Memorandum, “Environmental Supplemental Guidance for
  Implementing and Operating a Joint Base,” 15 April 2008 (Note: Copies may be obtained at
  https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/560093). Any internal host–tenant conflicts over
  resources are typically resolved through adjustments to internal processes and procedures
  defined in host–tenant agreements.
  3.4.4. External Stakeholder Relationships. Building external stakeholder relationships is
  an essential element of the AFEM Program; understanding the quality, type, and frequency
  of relationships outside the fenceline also supports successful encroachment management and
  engagement strategies. Installation commanders and encroachment managers must
  understand the value of maintaining positive external stakeholder relationships; these
  relationships enhance mission readiness, simplify engagement on specific issues, and help
  the Air Force anticipate changing encroachment trends. Both internal and external
  encroachment studies will identify existing relationships related to foundational program
  responsibilities, as well as additional stakeholder relationships (both formal and informal)
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    31


   that exist between the installation and surrounding communities. IEMT members should
   engage with stakeholders according to their foundational program responsibilities. All
   engagement activities should be coordinated with the IEMT Executive Director. Maintaining
   and enhancing stakeholder relationships is a critical part of the AFEM Program. At
   installations located outside the United States and its territories, implement this paragraph
   with applicable international agreements, COCOM policy, and LEC directives. Installations
   should contact their MAJCOM EMT Chair for more information if needed.
3.5. Act. Taking action is the most crucial element of encroachment management, and occurs
throughout all programs and at all echelons of the Air Force. It may include activities such as
implementing ICEMAP Management Actions, building resource requirements, engaging with
stakeholders, developing new tools, and obtaining necessary training and education. The actions
taken to implement the foundational programs, such as developing plans or analyzing specific
development proposals for compatibility, are also equally important. OPRs or Offices of
Collateral Responsibility (OCRs) for specific actions will report progress on the execution of
projects or solution strategies to the IEMT on a regular basis.
   3.5.1. ICEMAP Execution. Internal and external ICEMAPs contain recommended
   Management Actions that are designed to prevent and reduce encroachment. Encroachment
   and sustainment challenges may require a range of actions that must be executed to promote
   successful encroachment management and the sustainment of the AFEM Program.
   3.5.2. Building Resource Requirements. OPRs for assigned Management Actions
   developed in the ICEMAP shall identify projects and resource requirements in their
   organizational funding process. Requirements that compete for funds from AF/A7C centrally
   managed programs will be identified in the applicable BAMP and prioritized in the BCAMP
   at the installation level. These requirements are then captured in the appropriate MAMP and
   prioritized in the MCAMP at the MAJCOM level. At the HAF level, the requirements are
   captured in the appropriate Air Force Activity Management Plan (AFAMP) which supports
   the FYDP and prioritized in the Air Force Comprehensive Asset Management Plan
   (AFCAMP) (budget year). Other foundational programs may establish strategies for their
   installations to fund ICEMAP actions.
   3.5.3. Engagement. Active partnering with stakeholders is essential for effective
   encroachment management and occurs throughout every element of the AFEM framework.
   Specifically within the Act element, encroachment managers engage with stakeholders to
   build beneficial and lasting relationships. In addition to the engagement activities identified
   through the encroachment study process, stakeholder engagement also occurs through
   implementation of the foundational programs, such as the AICUZ Program. MAJCOM
   EMTs, the EMWG, or the SB-ESG shall be consulted in the design and execution of
   engagement strategies, if needed, for issues elevated to HAF. The IEMT shall work with
   installation PA to develop messaging and communication plans to work with civic leaders,
   media, and key elected officials, as well as Airmen and senior Air Force leaders. At overseas
   installations, implement this paragraph with applicable international agreements, COCOM
   policy, and LEC directives. Installations should contact their MAJCOM EMT Chair for more
   information, if needed.
   3.5.4. Development of Tools. As new technologies present new encroachment and
   sustainment challenges, HAF or the FOAs, as appropriate, will develop or fund methods and
 32                                                         AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


   tools to predict and reduce impacts to operations. MAJCOM EMTs shall work with
   foundational program representatives to identify areas in need of specific analysis. The
   EMWG will work with MAJCOM EMTs to determine the appropriate means of analysis and
   to interpret the results for incorporation in IEMT plans or for use within foundational
   programs. SAF/IEN and the DOD Siting Clearinghouse will be included when considering
   R&D needs for energy-related encroachment studies and tool development. Additional
   details are provided in the respective AFIs. The foundational programs (see Section 1.2)
   utilize existing tools to manage encroachment; however, emerging challenges are creating the
   need for new tools, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
      3.5.4.1. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Impacts and Radar Toolbox. AF/A3O will seek
      AFFSA support, when appropriate, for predictive analysis of energy development
      impacts on ATC radar system.
      3.5.4.2. Airborne Radar Impact Tool. AF/A3O will seek Air Force Materiel Command
      support, when appropriate, for predictive analysis of energy development impacts on
      airborne radar during testing and training.
      3.5.4.3. Mission Compatibility Analysis Tool (MCAT). AF/A3O developed an
      expansion of the US Navy’s MCAT to enable Air Force assessments of obstructions and
      energy projects. The MCAT is the OSD system for evaluating energy projects in
      accordance with 2011 National Defense Authorization Act Section 358. The MCAT is
      the system for official Air Force responses to both OSD and the FAA, augmenting the
      current process for conducting OE/AAA. AF/A3O-B is coordinating MCAT
      implementation across the Air Force; further information on the MCAT will be published
      in future training materials and manuals as necessary.
          3.5.4.3.1. MCAT access will be provided as required at every echelon of the Air
          Force. The specific role assigned to MCAT users will depend on their requirements
          and expertise. For instance, GI&S professionals will have capabilities and
          permissions that local airspace managers do not.
   3.5.5. Education and Training. AFEM policies, strategies, and techniques will be
   integrated into education and training curricula at all levels of the Air Force. Topics include
   AFEM roles and responsibilities, encroachment issue elevation, competencies needed for
   engaging stakeholders, and outreach activities to develop joint actions and agreements on
   encroachment and sustainment challenges. AFEM education and training opportunities shall
   be distributed through existing Air Force seminars, councils, courses, and webinars as
   appropriate. Additional informal education and training resources will be posted on the
   AFEM SharePoint site (https://eis.af.mil/cs/safiei/default.aspx).
3.6. Monitor. Maintaining situational awareness of encroachment issues, mission needs, and
the IC/MF through a range of monitoring activities is critical to successful encroachment
management; many of these activities occur on an existing daily or routine basis through
foundational programs. Monitoring must occur at all levels of the Air Force.
   3.6.1. Establish Monitoring Responsibilities. Installation organizations monitor their areas
   of responsibility under the supporting foundational programs and, through the AFEM
   processes, the IEMT monitors the overall implementation of ICEMAPs and engagement
   strategies; these responsibilities will be documented appropriately through the encroachment
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      33


   study process outlined in Section 3.4.1. Monitoring to understand local, regional, state, or
   federal positions on encroachment and sustainment challenges and regional trends is critical
   to proactively determine what issues may require action. FOAs and MAJCOMs/DRUs also
   play an active role in monitoring encroachment and sustainment challenges, providing
   necessary updates through the cross-functional encroachment team structure. The AFCEC
   shall provide additional monitoring support, as necessary.
   3.6.2. IC/MF Conditions. The IC/MF defines the primary geographic area that shall be
   monitored by the installation. Through existing foundational programs, such as the AICUZ
   and installation planning programs, or installation PA media monitoring, installations shall
   monitor,
1) local land and infrastructure development trends and projects; 2) updates to local land use
plans and zoning ordinances; and, 3) state agency and local municipal planning policies that
could affect growth and development, for example, transportation plans, highway expansion
plans, comprehensive plans, and energy-use plans. MAJCOMs shall maintain situational
awareness across their enterprise to help share best practices and identify actions that need to be
taken by the MAJCOM EMT. This includes identifying funding for implementing ICEMAP
actions or issues that need to be considered as part of basing or beddown activities. SAF/IEE
REOs will monitor state programs, while HAF, in coordination with SAF/IEE REOs, will
monitor federal agency policies and programs that can inadvertently create encroachment and
sustainment challenges. Any issues or concerns discovered during these monitoring activities
should be brought to the attention of the MAJCOM EMT. In these instances, installations should
contact the MAJCOM EMT before taking action other than continued monitoring. Additional
areas to monitor include, but are not limited to, the following:
       3.6.2.1. Mission Needs. The MSG/CC has the lead for monitoring mission needs,
       including tenant and mission partner needs. Understanding current and potential mission
       needs is necessary to plan resource requirements, successfully implement Management
       Actions and engagement strategies, and maintain situational awareness of potential
       challenges.
       3.6.2.2. Media. Installation PA has the lead for monitoring media sources. Media
       coverage can provide an indication of future challenges, functioning as a gauge on the
       community’s sentiment regarding military actions occurring on and off the installations
       or the impacts of an action on the military installation and mission. Media monitoring
       shall include traditional media sources, such as newspapers and television reports, and
       also non-traditional media sources, including blogs and social media, as appropriate.
       Continuous monitoring of media will also help identify potential stakeholder partnerships
       beneficial to encroachment management.
       3.6.2.3. Legislation and Government Policies. Various Air Force echelons have
       responsibilities for maintaining situational awareness of legislation and government
       policies. Installations must remain aware of proposed changes to legislation, policies, and
       practices at the local level. SAF/IEE REOs will monitor and analyze proposed regional,
       state, or federal regulations in association with AFCEC and AFLOA/JACE. The AFLOA
       Regional Counsel will coordinate with SAF/IEE REOs, DOD RECs, and affected
       installations to address encroachment and sustainment challenges identified in ICEMAPs
34                                                       AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


     or other approved sustainment programs, such as AICUZ, in the development of
     proposed state legislation.
     3.6.2.4. Technology. Some private sector technologies result in unintentional impacts to
     the performance of Air Force mission critical equipment; however, emerging
     technologies can also provide encroachment mitigation solutions. The Air Force must
     have the capability to monitor both the positive and negative potential impacts of
     emerging technology that may affect mission capability and military readiness. Air Force
     organizations will monitor and identify technologies and incorporate knowledge and
     understanding into the AFEM Program.

Terms
Compatible Use—Uses of land, water or airspace by the military and others that can co-exist
with minimal adverse effects.
Contingency Location—A non-enduring location outside of the United States that supports and
sustains operations during named and unnamed contingencies or other operations as an
appropriate authority directs and is categorized by mission life-cycle requirements as initial,
temporary, or semi-permanent.
Encroachment—In connection with the encroachment challenges set forth in AFPD 90-20,
Paragraph 1.7, any deliberate action by any governmental or non-governmental entity or
individual that does, or is likely to inhibit, curtail, or impede current or future military activities
within the installation complex and/or mission footprint; or any deliberate military activity that
is, or is likely to be incompatible with a community’s use of its resources.
Encroachment Management—Efforts undertaken by the Air Force alone or in conjunction with
other federal, local, state, regional, and private entities, to prevent, eliminate or minimize impacts
caused by encroachment.
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     41


Installation Complex—The land, facilities, airspace and ranges which provide direct mission
support to and/or are managed by the installation. This includes a combination of land and
facilities comprised of a main installation and its noncontiguous properties (auxiliary air fields,
annexes, and missile fields) that provide direct support to or are supported by that installation.
Installation complexes may comprise two or more properties, e.g., an installation or a support
site, each with its associated annex(es) or support property(ies).
Installation Complex Encroachment Management Action Plan (ICEMAP)—The ICEMAP
is a three volume document (Action Plan, Reference Book, and Community Brochure) which
addresses current and future encroachment and sustainment challenges facing Air Force
installations and their surrounding communities.
Lead Environmental Component—The Secretary of a Military Department, Combatant
Commander, or Sub-unified Commander, designated by DOD to establish environmental
compliance requirements for DOD enduring installations located outside the United States and
US territories (i.e., in foreign countries). LEC duties may be delegated through the chain of
command to an appropriate general or flag-level commander pursuant to DODI 4715.05,
Environmental Compliance at Installations Outside the United States.
Mission Footprint—The installation complex plus any land, facilities, airspace, and/or ranges
which are not managed by the installation, but which provide direct, routine support to the
mission.
Priority Region of Influence Areas—The limited geopolitical area of the ROI where critical
mission operations take place or stakeholder actions incompatible with mission operations have
been identified or are most likely to occur.
Region of Influence—The geopolitical area that the installation operates within, including both
the installation and other assets, such as airspace and training areas. This area usually coincides
with communities where the installation has contextual interests (e.g., economic, political,
cultural, social, environmental, and legal) and focuses outreach and engagement resources.
Stakeholder—A person or organization, either internal or external to the IC/MF, with personal,
financial, or other manifest interest in an issue or decision. Stakeholders include, among others:
DOD components; installation tenants; federal, state, regional, and local governments and
agencies; Tribal Councils; individuals or groups outside DOD installations; current and future
land owners; local or national advocacy groups; and the media.
Sustainable Installation—A sustainable installation efficiently supports current operations with
minimal impacts on the built and natural environments without compromising the ability to meet
future mission requirements.
System—A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex or
unitary whole.

                  ENCROACHMENT CONDITION SUMMARY,
            ENCROACHMENT AND SUSTAINMENT CHALLENGE AREAS,
                AND MISSION AND COMMUNITY CONSTRAINTS

A2.1. Background. This attachment outlines components of the internal study and ICEMAP
(which is eventually replaced by the external study and ICEMAP), describes the 13
encroachment and sustainment challenges, and lists potential mission and community constraints
resulting from encroachment.
A2.2. Internal Study. The internal study is intended to 1) educate members of the IEMT on
how their existing programs and ongoing roles and responsibilities complement the 13
encroachment and sustainment challenge areas; 2) provide members of the IEMT with specific
examples of encroachment and sustainment challenges related to their programs and areas of
responsibility, and information on how to recognize these challenges; 3) provide guidance to
IEMT members on their role in the development of the internal study; 4) help the IEMT identify
key stakeholders and related ongoing engagement efforts, while using existing engagement
efforts to enhance the study process; and 5) develop Management Actions. The internal study
process and subsequent internal ICEMAP focus on leveraging existing foundational program
resources and knowledge for successful encroachment management, but do not include active
engagement with external stakeholders.
A2.3. Evaluation Factors. The internal study analyzes individual encroachment and
sustainment challenges relative to the following factors: 1) Mission Impacts resulting from
encroachment and sustainment challenges, including “mission constraints” that may require
workarounds; 2) Community Impacts, both actual and perceived by the community, resulting
from military mission-related activities, including “community constraints” that may affect
quality of life; 3) Program Implementation of existing foundational programs related to
encroachment and sustainment challenges and status of documents, studies, and plans related to
the challenges; and 4) External Stakeholder considerations, including community support or
opposition, quality of relationships, regulatory protections, and information sharing related to the
challenges. IEMT members should be aware that the following descriptions are provided as
informative guidelines for conducting the internal study.
   A2.3.1. Mission Impacts and Community Impacts study the significance of encroachment on
   mission capability and perceived community quality of life using a green-through-red scale,
   with an option to select “Not Applicable”. The following definitions provide guidance for
   rating encroachment and sustainment challenges for the internal and external studies:

Figure A2.1. Mission and Community Impact Categories.
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  43


   A2.3.2. Program Implementation factors study the outcomes of programs related to
   encroachment and sustainment challenges. External Stakeholder factors study community
   support or opposition, quality of relationships, regulatory protections, and information
   sharing related to the challenge. Program Implementation and External Stakeholder
   categories are indicated using a green-through-red scale, based on likely effectiveness, with
   an option to select “Not Applicable”:

Figure A2.2. Program Implementation and External Stakeholder Categories.




   A2.3.3. Figures A2.3 and A2.4 in the following sections utilize the categories defined above
   to provide guidance for studying encroachment and sustainment challenges across the
   IC/MF. The language below is not intended to provide definitions of how to rank individual
   encroachment and sustainment challenges; rather, it provides notional examples of how these
   challenges may be affecting missions or communities. Within each cell, the guidelines
   provide unique examples of how encroachment may be manifested on installations and in
   communities. Every encroachment situation is different; IEMTs should be aware that not
   every example in the tables below will exist for every impact. After using the four factors
   defined in A2.3 to analyze encroachment and sustainment challenges across the IC/MF, the
   ICEMAP team can produce the Encroachment Condition Summary, Figure A2.5.

A2.4. Encroachment and Sustainment Challenge Areas. As stated in AFPD 90-20, the 13
encroachment and sustainment challenge areas defined below can be grouped into five broader
categories: 1) Environmental, Health, or Safety Regulatory Restrictions; 2) Compatible Use; 3)
Competition for Resources; 4) Security; and 5) Long-term Mission Sustainment. Each of the
encroachment and sustainment challenge descriptions below contains a characterization of the
negative impacts to military operations or local communities, a listing of foundational programs
that have responsibilities for managing the issue, and the primary category it falls under. Some
include a secondary category to capture multiple aspects of the issue. These descriptions are
intended to guide encroachment studies; IEMTs should be aware that encroachment and
sustainment challenges are dynamic and new challenges emerge over time.
   A2.4.1. Airspace and Land Restrictions. The Air Force requires air and land to conduct
   realistic training, weapons employment, and critical testing and evaluation of aircraft,
   weapons, and systems. Airspace and Land Restrictions include any regulatory, internal, or
   external actions that compete with Air Force activities for the same land, airspace, or
   geometric airfield surfaces in and around the IC/MF necessary for maintaining operational
   readiness. Emerging platforms and systems may require more rather than less airspace and
   land for realistic training and testing. Special Use Airspace (SUA) will become increasingly
   crucial with increasing emphasis on near-real-time management. These restrictions also
   include lack of required access to MTRs, ranges, and training and testing facilities, as well as
   land development or mineral right development activities that could disturb Air Force
   underground or surface infrastructure, such as communications or power cables for
   geographically separate sites (e.g., communications sites, missile fields, and drop zones).
        A2.4.1.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: the
        development of tall structures (including utility-scale wind turbines); limited access to
        MTRs or SUA; new mission requirements resulting in capacity concerns; and
        competition between Air Force and civil aviation interests. Existing programs that
        address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not limited to, the AICUZ
        Program; the OE/AAA Program; and the UEI. The Primary Category for Airspace and
        Land Restrictions is: Competition for Resources.

  A2.4.2. Airborne Noise. Airborne Noise is any noise associated with military readiness
  activities (e.g., aircraft operations, small and large caliber weapons firing, rocket launches,
  munitions detonations from test and training operations, and sonic booms) that impacts
  nearby communities. The issues associated with noise include annoyance, real or perceived
  health impacts, impacts on animals (wildlife or domestic stock), and impacts to structures. In
  response to noise complaints, installations have created avoidance areas along training
  routes, modified flight tracks around the airfield for departures or arrivals, and modified
  pattern altitudes; each of these reduces the usefulness of the airspace for conducting realistic
  training.
     A2.4.2.1. The AICUZ program, where implemented, is the primary program for
     addressing noise issues around the airfield. The Primary Category for Airborne Noise is:
     Compatible Use.
  A2.4.3. Urban Growth. Urban Growth encompasses the development of nearby
  communities resulting in additional housing and infrastructure, higher population densities,
  loss and conversion of agricultural, grazing, or forest land, or commercial property
  development. It is a potential driver of other encroachment and sustainment challenges (e.g.,
  Spectrum Encroachment, Energy Compatibility and Availability, Air, Water, and
  Endangered Species and Critical Habitat) and can be the root cause of other encroachment
  concerns including traffic congestion, noise, light pollution, and energy development.
  Increasingly, urban growth occurs from emerging issues; for example, utility privatization
  can potentially encourage land use development. Urban growth in close proximity to the
  IC/MF could lead to operational risks and might constitute health and safety threats (e.g.,
  noise) to the community. Residential areas and places of public assembly, such as schools,
  churches, restaurants, theaters, and shopping centers, are often incompatible with Air Force
  activities when located in accident potential zones close to the IC.
     A2.4.3.1. Specific encroachment examples include: incompatible development in safety
     zones; changes to land use planning and zoning near the IC/MF; and impacts associated
     with new development, including light pollution and traffic congestion. Existing Air
     Force programs that address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not
     limited to, the AICUZ Program and the Comprehensive Planning Program. The Primary
     Category for Urban Growth is: Compatible Use; the Secondary Category is: Competition
     for Resources.
  A2.4.4. Spectrum Encroachment. Spectrum Encroachment, broadly defined, involves: 1)
  the use of the EM spectrum, whether in-band or near band, licensed or unlicensed, shared or
  exclusive; 2) in-band or near band noise of sufficient intensity and duration; 3) the authorized
  removal or reallocation of previously exclusive or shared mission critical bandwidth; or 4)
  the siting of structures that physically or electronically block or impede the line-of-sight
  necessary to successfully transmit or receive data. With few exceptions, military operations,
  training and testing rely heavily on the frequency spectrum; therefore, spectrum
  encroachment has the potential to inadvertently or unintentionally increase the risk of
  mission degradation, cancellation, or failure. The Air Force and other federal agencies share
  the EM spectrum and use radio frequency spectrum for communications, navigation, and
  other critical purposes. Spectrum regulations and allocations vary from nation to nation,
  which complicates Air Force use. Reallocation or commercialization of spectrum, increased
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    49


  EM interference, and military–civil competition for limited bandwidth could constrain Air
  Force missions.
     A2.4.4.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: radar and
     microwave line-of-sight conflicts; EM interference; increasing demand for commercial
     use of frequencies; and alternative energy development, such as small wind energy
     systems. Existing Air Force programs that address this encroachment challenge area may
     include, but are not limited to, the AICUZ Program and the AFSIR Program. Because
     there are multiple aspects of spectrum encroachment, availability, and interference, there
     are two primary categories: Competition for Resources and Compatible Use.
  A2.4.5. Endangered Species and Critical Habitat. Many IC/MFs are surrounded by urban
  development and often become the last, large undeveloped areas available for endangered
  species support; because of this, Air Force lands provide habitat for more than 300 federally-
  listed threatened and endangered species protected under the Endangered Species Act and the
  Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Installations are responsible for considering environmental
  problems (e.g., loss of habitat, pollution) that result in an increased number of threatened and
  endangered species and a decrease in habitat for these species. Installations must consult with
  the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) before taking any action that may affect a
  federally-listed threatened or endangered species, or result in the loss of critical habitat or
  ecological benefits. The USFWS may impose non-discretionary terms and conditions to
  protect threatened or endangered species, reducing flexibility for operations, training, and
  testing. Under this category, migratory pathways, wetlands and habitat fragmentation, and
  species at risk, such as federal candidate species and birds of conservation concern, would
  also be considered.
     A2.4.5.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: the presence
     of endangered species or a negative biological opinion that could result in habitat
     restrictions leading potentially to the loss of training range access. Existing Air Force
     programs and offices that address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are
     not limited to, the Air Force Natural Resources Management Program and the Air Force
     Safety Center (AFSEC/SEFW) programs. The Primary Category for Endangered Species
     and Critical Habitat is: Environmental, Health, or Safety Regulatory Restrictions; the
     Secondary Category is: Competition for Resources.
  A2.4.6. Air. Air pollution or opacity restrictions can affect Air Force operations.
  Operational readiness limitations can arise due to application of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to
  emissions generated on Air Force ICs. The two most common concerns are air quality
  conformity requirements and opacity rules. Compliance with the CAA requires that certain
  air emissions remain below National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set by the US
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Areas which consistently violate the NAAQS
  because of anthropocentric activities are classified as nonattainment areas, and must
  implement a plan to reduce ambient concentrations below the maximum pollution standards.
  Maintenance areas are those regions where the NAAQS had previously been exceeded, but
  are now being met. CAA requirements established for regulating nonattainment or
  maintenance areas may restrict certain missions. In nonattainment and maintenance areas,
  general conformity requirements may result in limitations imposed on such activities to
  ensure they comply with State Implementation Plans. Opacity rules also can restrict or
  prohibit some training and testing activities (e.g., use of smoke, mounted maneuver training,
50                                                           AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


  helicopter and drop zone training, or engine run-up activity) and can limit fire use prescribed
  for vegetation management. Opacity can be a sensitive issue with the public, especially near
  national parks, designated wilderness areas, and within urban centers.
     A2.4.6.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: maintaining
     current emissions attainment levels and avoiding harmful emissions that affect air quality,
     evaluating the impact of future greenhouse gas emissions, and analyzing the potential for
     future carbon offsets regulations. The Air Quality Compliance and Resource
     Management Program, where implemented, is the primary program for addressing air
     issues. The Primary Category for Air is: Environmental, Health, or Safety Regulatory
     Restrictions.
  A2.4.7. Water. Water restrictions on the Air Force or nearby communities result from a
  variety of issues, including quality, supply (i.e., quantity and availability), water rights,
  floodplains, infrastructure, and regulations. Water is an environmentally sensitive issue for
  the public on and near Air Force IC/MFs. Water rights, particularly in Great Plains and
  Southwestern states, are critical to mission sustainment; thus, it is imperative that the Air
  Force maintains all documents relating to water rights. The Clean Water Act (CWA)
  regulates pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States and gives the EPA and
  delegated states the authority to implement pollution control, such as setting water quality
  and pollutant standards and permitting requirements affecting wastewater and stormwater.
  The CWA has direct application to military lands, where certain munitions constituents,
  combat force effluents, and other contaminants may discharge into water sources protected
  by law. Range management and operations must conduct training and testing in accordance
  with applicable CWA requirements. Moreover, range sustainment must comply with the
  CWA by protecting rangeland surface waters from contaminants. This category also
  encompasses the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requirements and its effects on Air Force
  installations. The SDWA directly applies to installations that own or operate public water
  systems regulated by the EPA or states with delegated authority, and may affect military
  activities in wellhead protection areas or underground aquifers. Stormwater runoff, flooding,
  and impermeable surfaces are related challenges associated with this category.
     A2.4.7.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: installation
     management of water infrastructure and supply, continued availability and security of
     potable water, and groundwater contamination as a result of pollution or depletion of
     aquifers. Existing Air Force programs that address this encroachment challenge area may
     include, but are not limited to, the Water Quality Compliance Program, the
     Comprehensive Planning Program (for on-site issues), and the Air Force infrastructure
     management program. The Primary Category for Water is: Environmental, Health, or
     Safety Regulatory Restrictions; the Secondary Category is: Competition for Resources.
  A2.4.8. Cultural Resources. Cultural resources include any prehistoric or historic district,
  site, building, structure, or object included, or eligible for inclusion, in the National Register
  of Historic Places, whether or not such eligibility has been formally determined. Cultural
  resources include all artifacts, records, and material remains related to such a property or
  resource. American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, or Native Hawaiian sacred sites or traditional
  cultural properties are also a part of the general Cultural Resources inventory. Further,
  archaeological resources, artifact collections, and their associated records are protected under
  federal law. These cultural resources are common on Air Force IC/MFs, can restrict Air
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    51


  Force operations, and are protected by federal laws, including the National Historic
  Preservation Act, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and the Native American
  Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act directs the
  Air Force to conserve these resources and to consult with the State Historic Preservation
  Officer, federally recognized tribes, and other interested parties, on minimizing potential
  adverse effects of proposed activities on these resources. Requirements to preserve culturally
  significant resources may interfere with military activities, including, in some cases, training
  and testing, by limiting access to areas where these resources are found. Mitigation resulting
  from required consultations may lead to training workarounds or restrictions on operations
  and other activities deemed to have adverse effects.
     A2.4.8.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: limited
     accessibility and potential mission restrictions associated with culturally significant sites
     within the IC/MF and the designation of historic districts or buildings. Existing Air Force
     programs that address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not limited
     to, the Cultural Resources Management Program and the Tribal Relations Program. The
     Primary Category for Cultural Resources is: Environmental, Health, or Safety Regulatory
     Restrictions.
  A2.4.9. Unexploded Ordnance and Munitions. Munitions and Explosives of Concern
  (MEC) involve safety and environmental concerns (e.g., cleanup requirements, soil and water
  contamination) that are a consequence of Air Force mission activities. The three categories of
  MEC include: Unexploded Ordnance (UXO); Discarded Military Munitions; and munitions
  constituents present in a high enough concentration to pose an explosive hazard. Within the
  IC/MF, ranges and training areas are critical to the Air Force’s ability to conduct realistic,
  live-fire training and weapon systems testing. Live-fire is, and will remain, the cornerstone of
  service training and testing; and, by necessity, deposits MEC and munitions constituents onto
  military lands. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
  Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the CWA, and the SDWA all have
  implications for the use of military munitions and management of MEC and munitions within
  the IC/MF (on ranges, for example).
     A2.4.9.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: the presence
     of legacy munitions and their impacts on wildlife and environmental quality and the loss
     of range access due to the presence of UXO. Existing Air Force programs that address
     this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not limited to, the Environmental
     Restoration Program (including the Military Munitions Response Program for cleanup of
     “other than operational” ranges) and the Comprehensive Range Planning Program. The
     Primary Category for Unexploded Ordnance and Munitions is: Environmental, Health, or
     Safety Regulatory Restrictions.
  A2.4.10. Marine Resources. Marine Resources include the competition for ocean space by
  humans (e.g., through recreation or commercial uses) and wildlife that can compromise Air
  Force operations, training, or testing within the IC/MF. Regulatory compliance can
  complicate the Air Force’s ability to sustain its mission in, over, and around the maritime
  environment. For example, the Marine Mammal Protection Act seeks to protect sensitive
  habitats and living marine resources. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
  Management Act regulates marine fishery resources management in US federal waters. The
  Coastal Zone Management Act provides for management of the nation's coastal resources
52                                                         AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


  and encourages states to develop and implement coastal zone management programs. These
  acts regulate Air Force operations in maritime environments. In July 2010, President Obama
  signed EO 13547, Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes, establishing
  the National Ocean Council, which coordinates ocean regulation and management across
  governmental agencies, while setting the framework for zoning of off-shore uses. These acts
  in many cases require the Air Force to consult with other federal agencies (e.g., the National
  Marine Fisheries Service) and state regulators when a proposed action may affect a protected
  marine or coastal resource. The consultation process can result in potential mission
  constraints.
     A2.4.10.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: the
     utilization of existing port channels for mission activities, competing stakeholder
     interests, and the effect of recreation interests on mission activities. The Air Force
     Natural Resources Management Program, where implemented, is the primary program
     for addressing maritime issues. The Primary Category for Marine Resources is:
     Environmental, Health, or Safety Regulatory Restrictions.
  A2.4.11. Energy Compatibility and Availability. Potential energy compatibility conflicts
  include those from the development, siting, distribution, or transmission of energy resources,
  including energy. Insufficient coordination of energy and transmission development can
  cause encroachment and sustainment challenges for Air Force installations. These challenges
  include, but are not limited to, incompatible land use issues within the IC/MF or outlying
  mission-critical spaces, impacts to spectrum dependent systems (e.g., radars, microwave
  systems, and satellite communications systems), tall structures obstructing low-level flight
  training and testing, loss of habitat, and competition for water resources. Understanding the
  regulatory environment and the potential for energy resources within the IC/MF requires
  outreach to state and regional energy agencies and companies. This outreach will help Air
  Force installations anticipate and reduce impacts. Additionally, energy availability and the
  reliability and resiliency of the energy supply are primary concerns for installations where
  adequate power grid connectivity to energy resources is essential due to mission needs.
     A2.4.11.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: the
     development of renewable energy, natural gas exploration, hydraulic fracturing, and the
     increase in energy transmission lines near the IC/MF. The OE/AAA Process, where
     implemented, is the primary Air Force program for addressing mission compatibility
     issues. DOD programs include the DOD Siting Clearinghouse. The Primary Category for
     Energy Compatibility and Availability is: Compatible Use.
  A2.4.12. Security/Safety. Security encroachment occurs from actions compromising the
  security and safety of the IC/MF that also result in mission and community impacts (e.g., AT
  issues, Quantity Distance (QD) Safety Arcs, lines-of-sight or vantage points onto
  installations). The relative openness of an IC/MF increases exposure to security incidents
  (e.g., when undocumented aliens, transients, recreational users, or scavengers illegally enter
  ranges). To prevent internal encroachment from security challenges, installation leadership
  must work with tenants and higher headquarters to avoid security compromises.
     A2.4.12.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: trespassers,
     gate and border security compromises for the installations, established AT processes, and
     QD arcs associated with the storage of explosive materials. Existing Air Force programs
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     53


       that address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not limited to: the
       Installation Vulnerability Assessment, Safety Program, and the Installation Real Property
       Program. The Primary Category for Security/Safety is: Security.
   A2.4.13. Natural Factors and Climate Effects. Natural Factors and Climate Effects
   encompass weather or disaster events and related management (both short- and long-term)
   that affect nearby communities and Air Force installations. Examples of natural factors
   include: severe weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires), natural disasters
   (e.g., earthquakes), and coastal erosion. Examples of climate effects include insect population
   changes, invasive species propagation, sea level rise, and changes to drinking water quality
   and supply. This category also includes ecosystem management, which refers to any
   regulatory or legislative requirement directing installations to manage surrounding habitats or
   wildlife. All of these factors can compound existing stresses, such as population growth, land
   use changes, and pollution. Changing climates affect installation mission capabilities; for
   example, warmer climates could lead to earlier spring snowmelt and higher stream flows
   earlier in the spring season—and correspondingly lower stream flows during summer and
   fall—resulting overall in a reduced and less reliable water supply. Severe weather and
   disaster events affect installations and the public; for example, IC/MFs in proximity to
   coastal areas may be affected by rising sea levels, resulting in a loss of natural resources,
   flooding of low-lying lands, and potential degradation of tests and training mission
   capabilities or capacities caused by damage to, or loss of, operational areas and
   infrastructure.
       A2.4.13.1. Specific encroachment examples include, but are not limited to: coastal
       flooding and erosion, increased presence of invasive species, and increased threats of
       climate impacts including wildfires, droughts, and severe weather. Existing Air Force
       programs that address this encroachment challenge area may include, but are not limited
       to, the Air Force Weather System, the Environmental Management System, the Critical
       Infrastructure Program, and the Air Force Natural Resources Management Program. The
       Primary Category for Natural Factors and Climate Effects is: Long-term Mission
       Sustainment.
A2.5. Mission Constraints. The degradation or elimination of certain operations, training, and
testing within the IC/MF may affect the overall mission and readiness of the Air Force. The
mission constraints described in this section represent some of the typical impacts or responses
that may result from encroachment. The descriptions below will assist in understanding the
severity of the mission impacts associated with each encroachment and sustainment challenge.
Additionally, it is important to realize that constraints imposed on missions may exist as a way to
reduce Air Force operational impacts (i.e., military encroachment) on communities, resources, or
land owners. The requirement for these may be documented in Environmental Assessments, or
Environmental Impact Statements and subsequent Records of Decisions, or as a part of the
AICUZ, natural resource, or cultural resource management programs. Distinction between self-
imposed ad hoc restrictions and formally agreed upon mitigations of Air Force impacts is
important; IEMT members should be aware of the difference and the related impacts associated
with each. Encroachment and sustainment challenges may result in combinations of multiple
constraints, as defined below.
   A2.5.1. Creating Avoidance Areas. Avoidance areas on installations or ranges, and
   underneath airspace, may be unavailable for training or operations permanently or
54                                                          AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014


  temporarily. These may include areas of endangered species breeding or nesting grounds, or
  areas of sensitive land uses, such as homes, ranches, farms, or National Parks, which require
  minimal noise impacts. Avoidance areas often impede ground troop activities and can
  degrade, inhibit, or impede the quality of training operations.
  A2.5.2. Reducing Usage Days. Operations and training events can be restricted or
  prohibited on some days in some areas. For example, aircraft may not be able to operate in
  certain areas at specified times because of habitat restrictions, such as migratory bird patterns
  or the mating seasons of protected species.
  A2.5.3. Prohibiting Certain Operational, Training, and Testing Events. Certain
  operations, training, and testing events may be prohibited. For example, ground troops may
  be prohibited from digging into the ground to create realistic fighting positions; aircraft may
  be prohibited from using flares or chaff; or ships may be prohibited from using sonar
  equipment. In these cases, the training must be conducted at other locations, or workarounds
  must be developed.
  A2.5.4. Reducing or Limiting Range Access. Encroachment can reduce range access. For
  example, the approaches to target areas might be limited to certain specified corridors, rather
  than permitting access from multiple approaches. Such limitations may degrade the realism
  and value of the training event and could cause safety hazards, in certain circumstances.
  A2.5.5. Limiting the Use of New Technologies. Concerns about encroachment may limit
  training or testing with new technologies. For example, encroachment may limit the Air
  Force’s ability to conduct realistic testing or training with Remotely Piloted Aircraft, which
  are now a standard tool on the battlefield. Testing limitations could translate into limited
  application readiness in combat, as forces tend to apply technologies as they have in training,
  which might reduce the technology’s full potential.
  A2.5.6. Modifying Operations. Civilian use of higher altitudes, development on the
  ground, or noise sensitive areas like National Parks or wilderness areas, may result in the Air
  Force having to restrict flight altitudes, which reduces full airspace capability. In training,
  aircraft may be forced to fly at artificially low or high altitudes, which reduces realism,
  potentially causing negative practices that must be “unlearned” prior to actual combat. Flight
  minimums for approaches may be affected by the construction of large buildings or wind
  turbines, or flight tracks from the installation may be modified to avoid large residential areas
  or other noise sensitive land uses. Long Range Standoff Weapons test and training events are
  being unrealistically executed (truncated launch parameters, such as reduced platform
  altitude and speed) due to lack of sufficient range space.
  A2.5.7. Inhibiting Development of New Tactics. By restricting maneuver areas,
  approaches to targets, altitudes, and certain technologies, the creative development of new
  tactics might be limited.
  A2.5.8. Restricting Night Time Flight Operations. Operating at night is a critical
  component of Air Force operations. Nighttime operations and training (generally occurring
  between 2200 and 0700 local time – often referred to as “acoustic night”) are essential to Air
  Force operational readiness. Nighttime (darkness conditions), however, is also the time when
  residents near Air Force installations are most especially sensitive to noise. Voluntary or
  mandatory restrictions that limit flight capacity exclusively to mission essential operations
AFI90-2001 3 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     55


   during these hours may reduce impacts on the local community and foster better community
   relations, though they could pose critical limitations on essential training. The Air Force
   limits nighttime flying operations to essential missions.
   A2.5.9. Reducing Use of Live-Fire. Encroachment from community development,
   threatened or endangered species, environmental regulations, and other natural factors can
   reduce opportunities for the use of live-fire ordnance, thereby reducing proficiency. While
   the use of simulations and inert ordnance can replace some live-fire training, training with
   live ordnance within the confines of secure training spaces remains essential for adequately
   preparing the Air Force for combat.
   A2.5.10. Increasing Temporary Duty for Training. Encroachment may require increases
   in personnel tempo when forces must deploy away from their home station to receive
   effective training.
   A2.5.11. Increasing Costs or Risks. Encroachment can increase costs in a variety of ways.
   Examples include, but are not limited to, transportation and other costs for units to train away
   from the home station when training there is encroached upon; fuel costs for aircraft training
   missions that must be aborted because of the occasional presence of natural wildlife in target
   areas or having to travel to ranges farther away; and the increased fiscal responsibility for
   installations to manage natural resource conservation projects, as mandated by federal laws.
   A2.5.12. Segmenting Training and Reducing Realism. Encroachment may require
   sequential training events to be segmented. While these events naturally follow in sequence
   to mirror their occurrence in combat, segmentation of training reduces realism and, thus,
   degrades the value of training experiences. For example, aircraft might have to practice
   ordnance delivery and evasive maneuvers at different times, rather than sequentially or
   together. Ground forces might have to practice ship-to-shore maneuvers at one time and
   assaults on enemy positions at another.
A2.6. Community Constraints. External community stakeholders are the exclusive source for
this section. One or more of these notional constraints was expressed by stakeholders during
various external ICEMAP interviews. (Site-specific factors will determine whether an
installation and its operations impose any actual community constraints.) Presenting the notional
views of community members is intended to help understand community impacts associated with
each encroachment and sustainment challenge area. While the Air Force cannot immediately
alter public perception and sentiment, an understanding can be formed around these perceptions
to strengthen relationships and work productively to resolve them together, when practicable, in
appropriate engagement strategies.
   A2.6.1. Restricting Community Access during Military Exercises. Communities may
   perceive negative impacts (e.g., health and safety concerns, security issues, or usage
   conflicts) associated with restricted military areas. For example, civilians may not be able to
   enter areas due to the presence of ground troops or be allowed to utilize cultural areas found
   on installations. They may also be prohibited from entering areas contaminated by on-site
   activities.
   A2.6.2. Restricting General Aviation. Military SUAs or development on the ground may
   prevent the community from taking full advantage of airspace. General aviators may be

  forced to alter flight patterns or schedules. These impacts could increase the costs or risks
  associated with civilian air travel or cause delays.
  A2.6.3. Limiting Community Development. Certain types of community development
  may interfere directly with installation testing or training events. For example, energy
  development (e.g., wind turbines) could be restricted or prohibited by installation energy
  preferences or mission objectives (e.g., radar testing and training). Similarly, aircraft noise
  prevents certain land uses and, thus, restricts economic development. In these cases, the
  event or action must be conducted at other locations or eliminated entirely from the
  community. For example, in order to prevent negative impact to Night Vision Devices
  ground and air test and training operations, a “dark skies” ordinance can ensure only lighting
  that does not interfere with these operations is allowed in certain areas. Low-level routes and
  airfield approaches require limitations on structure heights and residential land use to ensure
  missions are not constrained due to Airborne Noise impacts.
  A2.6.4. Affecting Economic Development. Communities may perceive negative economic
  impacts resulting from installation activities. While installation personnel typically provide
  additional revenue for local governments, businesses, and communities, and are often held as
  economic drivers and job providers, the adverse perception could spread within an IC/MF
  that installation activities limit the economic growth of surrounding communities by
  occasionally prohibiting an event or development that generates revenue.
  A2.6.5. Affecting Technology Use. Communities may perceive or experience technology
  interference due to Air Force operations (e.g., garage door openers occasionally malfunction
  due to frequency interference from the installation). Similarly, communities may be unable to
  develop new technologies due to installation proximity and related security issues.
  A2.6.6. Straining Community Assets. Installation personnel fluctuations (as a result of
  new or lost missions and changing command posts) may be viewed as having potentially
  negative impacts to community assets, such as services and infrastructure. Public services,
  including transportation, schools, and emergency response units, might be unable to
  effectively manage population turnovers. Traffic congestion, particularly along local roads
  leading to installation gates, can result in significant community constraints. Similarly, utility
  infrastructure systems may become inundated by installation use, thereby reducing the
  availability for adjacent communities.
  A2.6.7. Deteriorating Health and Wellness. Communities may perceive new or increased
  health or safety risks in a variety of ways. These risks include, but are not limited to, noise,
  water, and air quality impacts. Similarly, stakeholders could begin to believe that aircraft
  operations can directly threaten lives and property.
  A2.6.8. Reducing Availability of Resources. Communities may be forced to compete with
  installations for resources (e.g., clean water, reliable electricity, transit infrastructure, or air
  and land space). Installation management of resources could exacerbate current issues (such
  as ineffective stormwater management) or create new problems (such as erosion associated
  with dredging projects).

                      NOTIONAL EXTERNAL ICEMAP CONTENTS

A3.1. External ICEMAP Development. The external study includes a comprehensive
literature review, installation and community interviews, and a thorough analysis of
encroachment and sustainment challenges at the installation. External study teams should utilize
the guidelines below while conducting the study and developing the external ICEMAP, which is
a suite of three documents: Volume I: The Action Plan, Volume II: The Reference Book, and,
when appropriate, Volume III: The Community Brochure. The following sections detail the
outline and content suggested for the external ICEMAP documents. Internal ICEMAP guidance
is posted to the AFEM SharePoint site.
A3.2. ICEMAP Volume I: Action Plan. This document is intended for internal use only and
provides recommendations to reduce the impacts of encroachment and sustainment challenges on
specific Air Force IC/MFs and communities. The target audience for the Action Plan is the
installation commander, the IEMT, and any additional organizations that have responsibilities to
address specific elements of encroachment. The Action Plan summarizes current mission
operations and encroachment and sustainment challenges (current and potential), and prioritizes
installation encroachment challenges and Management Actions described in detail in the
Reference Book (see below). The Action Plan shall be marked “For Official Use Only” in
accordance with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. The Action Plan
contains deliberative process information which is exempt under the Freedom of Information
Act, 5 United States Code § 552, (b)(5), as intra-agency advice, opinions, suggestions and
recommendations, as well as subjective evaluations, all of which relate to the decision-making
process for encroachment management. Government interests in these materials include, among
other details, information of a speculative or evaluative nature into land use compatibility and
information of inquiries, inspections, surveys, and other investigations into the safety, security,
internal management, or operation of IC/MFs. Other exemptions and legitimate government
interests may apply.
   A3.2.1. Action Plan Contents. The Action Plan includes the ICEMAP Overview,
   Encroachment Condition Summary, the Installation Encroachment and Sustainment
   Summary (for all challenges rated “yellow” and above), the Management Action Summary
   (including the Commander’s Functional Engagement Plan), and the Geographic and
   Operational Context (including thorough descriptions of the IC/MF and Current Mission
   Operations).
A3.3. ICEMAP Volume II: Reference Book. This document is also intended for internal use
only and is accordingly marked “For Official Use Only.” It provides a comprehensive summary
and evaluation of installation-specific information (e.g., situational awareness of mission,
IC/MF, host units, and tenants) and provides suggested actions to reduce current and prevent
potential encroachment to both IC/MFs and local communities. The Reference Book includes the
Compatible Land Use Strategy (CLUS), an evaluation of land associated with mission priorities,
which, if developed incompatibly, could result in mission impacts. The CLUS provides a
prioritized list of land parcels along with a variety of compatibility strategies ranging from land
use planning to encroachment partnering to fee simple acquisition. All of the detailed analysis
contained in the Reference Book is summarized in the Action Plan. The Reference Book shall be
marked “For Official Use Only” in accordance with AFI 31-401. The Reference Book contains

deliberative process information which is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC
§552, (b)(5), as intra-agency advice, opinions, suggestions and recommendations, as well as
subjective evaluations, all of which relate to the decision-making process for encroachment
management. Government interests in these materials include, among other things, the CLUS
and such other matters as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise acquire and dispose of
real estate or facilities, the disclosure of which would provide undue or unfair competitive
advantage to private personal interests or would impede legitimate government functions.
Premature release of this information is likely to affect the Air Force’s negotiating position.
Other exemptions and legitimate government interests may apply.
   A3.3.1. Reference Book Contents. The Reference Book consists of the ICEMAP
   Overview, Management Action Summary, eight unique chapters, and relevant appendices.
