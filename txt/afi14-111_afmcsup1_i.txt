                   INTELLIGENCE IN FORCE MODERNIZATION PROCESS

1.1. Introduction. Intelligence integration in support of Air Force and Joint systems development has
never been more important or challenging than it is in today’s environment. When intelligence is not fully
integrated into the Air Force’s modernization processes, the results often include scheduling delays,
costly work-arounds, and unplanned adjustments to Operations & Maintenance, and Pre-Planned Product
Improvements (P3I). As future systems become more intelligence-dependent, the cost of omitting intelli-
gence integration will increase. This AFI outlines process and policy to ensure intelligence is integrated
appropriately within AF modernization activities.
1.1. (AFMC) Introduction. (Added) This AFMC supplement provides AFMC-specific guidance on
Acquisition Intelligence (also known as IFM) operations and responsibilities. Special Access Programs
(SAPs) are to comply with this AFMC supplement. The Air Force Materiel Command Operations Manual
for Acquisition Intelligence Support contains specific how-to information consisting of detailed check-
lists, document formats, and processes.
   1.1.1. Desired Effects. To provide qualitative and quantitative improvements in performance and
   capability and to reduce acquisition time and cost.
   1.1.2. Capabilities. The following capabilities are necessary for intelligence to be effectively inte-
   grated within force modernization processes:
       1.1.2.1. A common understanding of program/initiative intelligence needs across the intelligence,
       operations, and acquisition communities.
       1.1.2.2. A working familiarity of intelligence infrastructure and threat analysis among acquisi-
       tion/operational authorities and their associated intelligence stakeholders. In-time delivery of tai-
       lored/stock intelligence products or customer-funded alternatives.
       1.1.2.3. Integration of Intelligence in Force Modernization (IFM) stakeholders into planning, pro-
       gramming, and decision activities to weigh costs/benefits/tradeoffs.
       1.1.2.4. An ability to analyze and compare a variety of intelligence requirements and deficiencies
       across numerous programs/initiatives so as to be able to recommend and advocate prioritized, effi-
       cient solutions at reasonable cost.
   1.1.3. IFM Process. The IFM process typically involves the following steps:
       1.1.3.1. Identifying intelligence-sensitive programs/initiatives.
       1.1.3.2. Analyzing intelligence need and identifying the requisite level of effort necessary to
       address that need.
       1.1.3.3. Conducting Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis (IIA).
       1.1.3.4. Planning for and developing materiel and non-materiel intelligence solutions.
       1.1.3.5. Advocating for resources and deficiency resolution.
   1.1.4. Primary Instruments. The primary instruments for implementing IFM are the Intelligence Sup-
   port Steering Group (ISSG), the Intelligence Support Working Group (ISWG) and the Threat Steering
6                                                         AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


    Group (TSG). Success in IFM depends upon the empowerment of Implementing MAJCOM/INs and
    their Directors of Intelligence (DIs) to engage appropriately in program/initiative execution.

1.2. Identifying Intelligence-Sensitive Programs/Initiatives. In general, the IFM process begins when
a force modernization effort is identified as intelligence-sensitive. Intelligence-sensitive efforts include
those that produce, consume, process, or handle intelligence data. The effort could be a new acquisition
program/initiative, Battlelab initiative, maturing technology, an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) concept
study, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), an upgrade to an existing weapon sys-
tem, or other acquisition related effort. The Battlespace Awareness representative to the Joint Capabilities
Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Gatekeeper organization will determine those programs
that produce, consume, process, or handle intelligence data, for which joint intelligence certification
applies. Once intelligence sensitivity is identified, preferably in the conceptual phase, the IFM community
assembles to help shape the effort and ensure requirements for intelligence are effectively addressed. This
normally results in the conduct of Intelligence Infrastructure, Threat, and Cross-Program Analyses.
1.2. (AFMC) Identifying Intelligence-Sensitive Programs/Initiatives.
    1.2.1. In 2004, SAF/AQ, AF/XI, and the AF-CIO sponsored an effort to streamline the requirements
    process for Air Force acquisition programs/initiatives. The process that resulted from this effort is
    called the Lean IT/NSS Acquisition Process. This process focuses on sharing key information
    throughout the life of each program or system in lieu of generating, staffing, and reviewing redundant
    documentation. The primary goal of the new process is to acquire systems that, once fielded, will be
    secure, interoperable, supportable, sustainable and usable (SISSU). To make this goal attainable, the
    Lean IT/NSS Acquisition Process aims to ensure stakeholder involvement early and often, and pro-
    vide a mechanism for SISSU needs to be communicated across all stakeholder organizations. Addi-
    tional information can be found on NIPRNET: <https://www.xi.hq.af.mil/xiw/xiws/Lean_Reeng/>.
    1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Within AFMC, the supporting Center/site Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO)
    determines a program/initiative’s intelligence-sensitivity in consultation with the program/initiative
    manager. Ongoing intelligence support can encompass a wide variety of intelligence products/ser-
    vices/support and may serve the program/development team, the testing community, the eventual
    operator, or all three. The OAS Intelligence Division will make initial intelligence sensitivity determi-
    nation for programs not otherwise assigned to or identified by Center/site SIOs. Center/site SIOs then
    assign identified programs/initiatives to an intelligence sensitivity tier, list them in the AFMC pro-
    gram status database and revalidate intelligence sensitivity tiers at each milestone. Center/site SIOs
    consider the criticality of intelligence support to program success and the Center commander’s prior-
    ities when assigning an intelligence sensitivity tier. The following guidelines will also be considered
    in assigning the appropriate intelligence sensitivity tier:
       1.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Tier One Sensitivity: Established or identified programs/ initiatives,
       program spirals, or capabilities that require ongoing intelligence support or are of high Center pri-
       ority. Most Tier One programs significantly depend on intelligence support for program success.
       Lack of intelligence support could significantly impact program cost, schedule, performance and
       risk. This intelligence support could take many forms, e.g., document requests, Production

AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                         7


       1.2.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Tier Two Sensitivity: Established or identified programs/ initiatives,
       program spirals, or capabilities that require occasional intelligence support. Lack of intelligence
       support could moderately impact program cost, schedule, performance, and risk. This program,
       program spiral, or capability will require many of the same types of support as Tier One Sensitive
       programs but on a less frequent, less intense level.
       1.2.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Tier Three Sensitivity: Established or identified programs/ initiatives,
       program spirals or capabilities that require limited/infrequent intelligence support. Lack of intelli-
       gence support may have only minor impact on program cost, schedule, performance, and risk.
       This program, program spiral, or capability will require fewer types of support than Tier Two Sen-
       sitive programs and on a less frequent, less intense level.

1.3. Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis (IIA). IIA is the process employed by programs to assess the
level of intelligence support required to achieve mission success at Initial Operational Capability (IOC)
and throughout its life-cycle. AF intelligence documents the requirements for intelligence threat and
infrastructure support necessary to successfully acquire and employ future Air Force capabilities. IIA
should begin as early as possible during system development processes for all intelligence-sensitive pro-
grams/initiatives. If IIA is not conducted, the Air Force risks developing systems that are sub-optimized
or unsupportable. This analysis supports the development of the intelligence content of the Information
Support Plan (ISP) (see Attachment 3) and the intelligence requirements certification that are directed by
CJCSI 3170.01 and described in CJCSI 3312.01.
1.3. (AFMC) Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis (IIA).
   1.3.1. IIA Content. As a minimum, IIA should identify, as specifically and completely as possible,
   projected requirements for intelligence products, information, or services to include required perfor-
   mance, descriptive, or qualitative attributes.
       1.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The following standardized IFM definitions will be used in AFMC:
           1.3.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Intelligence Requirement: Intelligence product or service pro-
           vided to a program/initiative by the Intelligence Community (IC) that is integral to the pro-
           gram/initiative at some point within its life cycle.
           1.3.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Intelligence Deficiency: Intelligence requirement not met by the
           current intelligence infrastructure.
           1.3.1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Capability: The ability to execute a specified course of action.
           1.3.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Capability Gap: The inability to execute a specified course of
           action.
   1.3.2. IIA Documentation. IIA results should be documented as specified in this AFI. Proper docu-
   mentation of this analysis will: 1) show traceability to the system’s operational baseline; 2) identify
   derived intelligence requirements and intelligence infrastructure (people, systems, procedures, prod-
   ucts, etc.) needed to satisfy the operational requirements; 3) highlight any gaps or system intelligence
   deficiencies between the required infrastructure and the existing infrastructure; 4) highlight
   time-phased courses of action necessary to ensure these system intelligence deficiencies are resolved
   before such time as the support is needed; and 5) identify estimated costs associated with each pro-
   posed solution.

1.4. Cross-Program Analysis (CPA). CPA involves an analytical effort designed to “look across” all
intelligence-sensitive programs/initiatives and the related intelligence deficiencies. The purpose of CPA is
to identify common requirements and achieve synergies within resulting common solutions. Synergies
between programs/initiatives and cost savings are realized when solutions are identified that support mul-
tiple programs/systems. An additional aspect of CPA is to identify system or program integration issues.
In addition, linkage of documented requirements with multiple customer sets serves to strengthen AF
requirements forwarded to the larger Intelligence Community for action.

1.5. Intelligence Support Steering Group (ISSG). The ISSG initiates the IFM process for program/ini-
tiatives, preferably in the conceptual phase (pre-MS A/KDP A). The ISSG assigns organizations respon-
sibilities for intelligence support, assesses (at a high level) the type of intelligence support each program/
initiative would likely need, starts the necessary processes to build intelligence support cost estimates for
insertion into funding processes, and provides an overview of the recommended process needed to iden-
tify intelligence requirements and deficiencies. The ISSG is comprised of key personnel including the
program/initiative lead, intelligence personnel, and other IFM stakeholders (see Attachment 4).
1.5. (AFMC) Intelligence Support Steering Group (ISSG).
    1.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Programs with the program managers, Center/site SIOs, and the intelligence
    community already actively and cooperatively engaged may not require an ISSG.

1.6. Intelligence Support Working Group (ISWG). The ISWG brings functional representatives from
throughout the intelligence and acquisition communities together to ensure all intelligence considerations
for the developing system or capability are addressed. The goal is to derive and develop the intelligence
requirements and deficiencies, to research and develop potential solutions to the deficiencies, to create
action plans to accomplish those solutions, to estimate solution costs, and to document results in the
Weapon Systems Intelligence Support Requirements Database (WSISRD). This information is also inte-
grated into the ISP as the intelligence content and forms the basis for Section 9, Intelligence Supportabil-
ity, of the Capability Development Document (CDD) and Capability Production Document (CPD).
1.6. (AFMC) Intelligence Support Working Group (ISWG).
    1.6.1. ISWG Participants. Either the program representative designated to oversee intelligence sup-
    port planning or the intelligence partner who is leading intelligence infrastructure analysis typically
    chairs ISWGs. The ISSG-designated intelligence partner should participate in ISWGs and ensure the
    correct intelligence community participants attend the meetings. ISWGs are composed of the follow-
    ing major interest groups:
       1.6.1.1. System developers and supporters.
       1.6.1.2. System testers.
       1.6.1.3. Operational users.
       1.6.1.4. Intelligence providers (Intelligence Community representatives, intelligence functional
       POCs, intelligence requirements managers, etc.).
    1.6.2. Difference Between the ISSG and the ISWG. An ISSG is very broad-based and involves only
    the highest level of program management. It brings together the program office, resource manager,
    and key intelligence support organizations for the purpose of identifying key roles and responsibili-
    ties. ISSGs lay the groundwork for subsequent ISWGs. The ISWG is a follow-on meeting to the ISSG
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                      9


   that is convened as a means of identifying all intelligence requirements that must be achieved in order
   for the program to be successful at IOC and throughout its life-cycle. ISWGs involve detailed analy-
   ses and involve every aspect of the program’s supported mission from intelligence collection to
   unit-level mission planners and operators. Figure 1.1. and Figure 1.2. are visual depictions of where
   the ISSG and ISWG occur in relation to the DOD 5000 and Space Acquisition Models.

Figure 1.1. ISSG & ISWG in relation to the DOD 5000 Model.




Figure 1.2. ISSG & ISWG in relation to the Space Acquisition Model.

        1.6.2.1. (Added-AFMC) When the program manager/technology lead, Center/site SIO, and sup-
        porting IC partners agree on roles and responsibilities, IFM processes can begin and ISWGs con-
        vened without a formal ISSG.

1.7. Derived Requirements Generation Process: IIA & CPA. IIA is core to the activities of the ISWG.
The same basic four steps to conduct IIA should be followed regardless of the weapon, information, C2,
or ISR system that is being analyzed. Figure 1.3. depicts the process flow and eight steps for derived
intelligence requirements identification, documentation and analysis. IIA is comprised of the first four
steps of the derived requirements generation process. The next three steps include Level I CPA, Level II
CPA, and the monitoring and tracking of deficiency satisfaction. After completing the initial seven steps,
requirements must be revalidated every year to ensure that any significant changes have been taken into
consideration.
1.7. (AFMC) Derived Requirements Generation Process: IIA and CPA.

Figure 1.3. IFM-Derived Requirements Process.




     1.7.1. Step 1: Define the Operational Baseline and Operational Imperatives.
        1.7.1.1. The operational baseline includes the combined technology, targets, tactics, CONOPS,
        environment, capabilities construct, employment considerations/options, operational factors and
        threats to the system. This operational baseline serves as a starting point for IIA. The operational
        baseline will flow from these four sets of questions:
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                       11


         1.7.1.1.1. What operational steps must be taken in the use of this system through all phases of
         employment? From pre-wartime planning through employment and re-deployment?
         1.7.1.1.2. What are the inputs, outputs, and interfaces for the system?
         1.7.1.1.3. How will the system be designed? Does the technology drive specific support
         requirements? What information does the system developer need to optimize system design?
         What data (based upon the design) does the system need to meet the operational requirements?
         1.7.1.1.4. How will the system be employed? In what environments, under what conditions?
         What capability or effect does the system contribute to?
     1.7.1.2. As the program matures, the operational baseline will become more refined, resulting in
     better-defined derived intelligence requirements. Continued intelligence support analysis will be
     needed to react to changes or modifications to the operational baseline.
  1.7.2. Step 2: Conduct Strategy-to-Task Analysis (STT). STT is a methodology that should be used
  by ISWGs as they derive intelligence requirements and identify intelligence deficiencies. The STT is
  a strong framework for depicting operational considerations, system relationships, and requirements.
  Figure A3.1. in Attachment 3 depicts the STT methodology.
  1.7.3. Step 3: Derive Intelligence Requirements. From initial derived intelligence requirement identi-
  fication, more detailed requirements in terms of timeliness, accuracy, volume, etc. will need to be
  defined. By systematically looking at each operational consideration for the system inputs/outputs or
  employment and identifying corresponding derived intelligence requirements, the program can
  clearly show its linkages and dependencies to intelligence suppliers. A series of functional area check-
  lists (contained in Attachment 3) help conduct a systematic assessment to derive intelligence require-
  ments.
  1.7.4. Step 4: Identify & Document Intelligence Deficiencies and Costs. Analysis of each derived
  intelligence requirement against the existing infrastructure and products will determine whether or not
  there are potential deficiencies to be acted upon.
     1.7.4.1. No further analysis is required if the derived intelligence requirement can be fully satis-
     fied by the existing intelligence with no changes to systems, training, manpower, facilities, pro-
     cesses, procedures, and/or policies; i.e., the required information, product, or resources exist in the
     current infrastructure. These requirements should be included in a depiction of the STT.
     1.7.4.2. Further analysis is required if the derived intelligence requirement cannot be fully satis-
     fied by the existing intelligence infrastructure. Shortfalls should be identified as intelligence defi-
     ciencies and further defined through intelligence deficiency analysis documentation. Intelligence
     planners should provide details on each of the intelligence deficiencies and document them within
     the WSISRD. They should also document any proposed solutions to deficiencies. The goal is to
     clearly describe the intelligence deficiency, its foundation in an operational requirement, and the
     plan for satisfying the intelligence deficiency. Estimated costs must be included as early as feasi-
     ble. Program Offices and supporting Directors of Intelligence should consult with AFMC intelli-
     gence costing elements (OAS/OL-AB) to determine what costing data is required for each
     program/initiative and how it should be used. While documenting deficiencies, it is important to
     ensure each intelligence deficiency is a discrete deficiency.
     1.7.4.3. The program office and the supporting directorate of intelligence share the responsibility
     for the management of derived intelligence requirements. Derived intelligence requirements are
12                                                    AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


     entered into WSISRD by the supporting intelligence organization. This action is accomplished on
     SIPRNET at <http://afc2isrc.af.smil.mil>. The process for submitting requirements at the web-
     site can be found under ISR Web Requirement Tools. A user-ID and password are required for
     login and an automated procedure to obtain them is provided at the website.
     1.7.4.4. The Air Force requirements process is described in AFI 10-601, Capabilities Based
     Requirements Development. This AFI describes the actions that must be taken by the sponsors of
     any program/initiative to attain approval and validation of the requirements that must be fulfilled
     in order to achieve a specified capability. AFI 10-601 mandates that sponsors submit all capabili-
     ties-based requirements documents (ICDs, CDDs, and CPDs) to AF/XORD for review and valida-
     tion by the Air Force Requirements for Operational Capabilities Council (AFROCC).
     1.7.4.5. The AFC2ISRC and MAJCOM SIOs will maintain awareness of intelligence deficiencies
     and associated solutions. The Implementing MAJCOM will inform the PM of changes in status
     whenever significant progress or setbacks occur, or before each Key Decision Point/Milestone.
     The Operating MAJCOM will provide feedback to the Implementing MAJCOM regarding short-
     falls in intelligence infrastructure support following program IOC.
     1.7.4.6. Identifying Intelligence Deficiency Solution Costs. In many cases, satisfying intelligence
     deficiencies will require additional funding. Potential cost drivers include the equipment/systems,
     manpower, training, data formats, collection, production, and facilities supporting an operational
     capability.
        1.7.4.6.1. AFMC/XRI cost specialists should be consulted to cost as many of the intelligence
        deficiencies/solutions as possible. Intelligence planners will need to provide the costing spe-
        cialists with assumptions, background data, and access to cost data from similar deficiencies.
            1.7.4.6.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The OAS Intelligence Division is the Command focal point
            for acquisition intelligence costing. The cost analysis process is conducted by the site SIO
            and validated by the OAS intelligence division using validated costs for derived require-
            ments. Each deficiency is analyzed to determine cost impact, the results of which are com-
            municated back to the deficiency submitter for further action. Once costs are confirmed as
            accurate and finalized, they are incorporated into WSISRD deficiency inputs and for-
            warded to AFC2ISRC for Level II CPA.
        1.7.4.6.2. IIA should include documentation of total costs to resolve deficiencies that will be
        funded by the program/initiative, as well as costs that will be covered by other organizations
        and agencies [e.g. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), NASIC, Air Education
        and Training Command (AETC), National Security Agency (NSA), etc.]. All cost estimates
        should be given in a designated base year dollars. Key facts, assumptions, and costing guide-
        lines should be referenced in all cost estimates.
        1.7.4.6.3. By necessity, cost models will vary between programs/initiatives. However, a few
        guidelines should be applied when getting cost assessments:
            1.7.4.6.3.1. Document actual costs where possible and provide costs to AFMC/XRI.
            1.7.4.6.3.2. Estimation process and inputs duplicated independently.
            1.7.4.6.3.3. Assumptions must be made clear.
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                        13


   1.7.5. Step 5: Conduct Level I CPA. Level I CPA is performed by the MAJCOMs. In this stage, Level
   I CPA should result in direct feedback to the program/initiative lead with regard to recommended
   design changes and proposed solutions that take advantage of requirements, including Production
   Requirements (PR), already articulated and being acted upon for other programs/initiatives. Require-
   ments and potential solutions are identified and documented through AFC2ISRC via WSISRD.
   WSISRD can be accessed on SIPRNET at <http://afc2isrc.af.smil.mil>. The process for submitting
   requirements at the website can be found under ISR Web Requirement Tools. A user-ID and password
   are required for login and an automated procedure to obtain them is provided at the website.
       1.7.5.1. (Added-AFMC) The OAS Intelligence Division performs Level I CPA in AFMC. Level
       I CPA consists of collection and analysis of all AFMC system/capability/program/initiatives’ doc-
       umented intelligence requirements in order to identify like requirements between programs. Level
       I CPA information is also used by the Intelligence Division to identify potential deficiency solu-
       tions and develop costing models for future use.
   1.7.6. Step 6: Conduct Level II CPA. Results of CPA at the MAJCOM level are forwarded to
   AFC2ISRC for inclusion in AF-level analysis. AFC2ISRC uses the results of Level II CPA to guide
   AF integration efforts, identify interoperability and capability issues to AF/XI, and provide inputs to
   the ISR Mission Area Plan (MAP), Intelligence POM and AF POM processes.
   1.7.7. Step 7: Monitor and Track Deficiency Satisfaction. The status of derived deficiencies and cor-
   responding impact to system development cost, schedule and performance must be monitored and
   understood. HQ USAF/XOI, the AFC2ISRC and the MAJCOMs accomplish this monitoring.
   1.7.8. Step 8: Revalidate Deficiency Documentation. Revalidation of deficiencies is performed by the
   MAJCOMs within ISWGs. Each documented deficiency contains a significant amount of perishable
   information. The solutions, and action items associated with them must be revalidated annually. Any
   deficiency that has not been formally revalidated will expire one year after it is documented. Deficien-
   cies that have been revalidated and found to be current, even with no additional change, should also be
   resubmitted with a new “as of” date to reflect the update. Deficiency data must be current to impact
   ISR MAP and POM processes.

1.8. Information Support Plan (ISP). The ISP is an acquisition document mandated for most service
and joint programs and initiatives by Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions.
Among other things, the ISP is comprised of service and joint coordinated documentation from the results
of IIA, including identification of shortfalls and details of solutions that are derived, with designation of
responsible agencies. JCS/J-2 is responsible to certify the adequacy of the intelligence analysis and
results. Guidance for compiling the ISP is provided in Attachment 5 of this document.
   1.8.1. ISP Coordination. Before the ISP enters formal AF-wide coordination, the intelligence portion
   should be reviewed and agreed to by members of the ISWG team. Authors should seek agreement
   from key intelligence, operations, requirements, and acquisition players on the derived intelligence
   requirements and actions needed to remedy intelligence deficiencies. The draft ISP will be reviewed
   by the Program Office intelligence partner who will assess sufficiency of the intelligence content and
   report their results to the Program Office and headquarters staffs for information and action. AF/
   XOIIA-F will direct Air Staff-level intelligence coordination of the ISP.
   1.8.2. Intelligence Support Coordination for Space Acquisition Programs. The intelligence support-
   ability content for the Integrated Program Summary (IPS) should be reviewed by the System Program
14                                                          AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


     Office (SPO) (or its designee) and AFSPC/IN six weeks before the start of the IPS drafting process.
     Once approved by AFSPC/IN and the SPO, the intelligence supportability content is forwarded to AF/
     XOIIA-F for final review/coordination. The intelligence supportability content should arrive at AF/
     XOIIA-F four weeks before the IPS drafting process begins to ensure sufficient time for review. For-
     mal review and coordination of the complete ISP will occur after Key Decision Point (KDP)-C.
     1.8.3. Classifying ISPs. ISPs should be releasable to contractors, as appropriate, under competition
     sensitivity rules and classified at the lowest classification consistent with user needs and security con-
     siderations. There may be a requirement for a separate annex at a higher classification, or one not
     releasable to contractors. Special Access Programs may require special-access ISPs, or ISPs with spe-
     cial-access annexes.

1.9. Intelligence Certification. Intelligence certification is performed by JCS/J-2 on ISPs, ICDs, CDDs,
and CPDs as part of overall acquisition approval for specific programs or initiatives, as directed by CJCSI
3170.01 and described in CJCSI 3312.01. These certifications occur as part of normal document coordi-
nation and apply to threat, supportability, and interoperability. This AFI outlines IIA and threat support
processes designed explicitly to address JCS/J-2 intelligence certification. A suggested format for docu-
menting IIA results is included as an attachment to this AFI. CJCSI 3312.01 lists all the necessary steps to
accomplish certification. Enclosure D of CJCSI 3312 provides a matrix checklist to assure all the required
areas are addressed
1.9. (AFMC) Intelligence Certification.
     1.9.1. (Added-AFMC) For programs requiring Intelligence Certification per CJCSI 3312.01, the
     SIO must assess the intelligence content of the Information Support Plan and JCIDS documents and
     address the IIA guidance (provided in Attachment 3 of AFI 14-111) and the Intelligence Certification
     Criteria checklist (described in Enclosure D of CJCSI 3312.01).
     1.9.2. (Added-AFMC) Tier One intelligence-sensitive AFMC programs under development or per
     Headquarters Air Force direction should also satisfy Intelligence Certification criteria.
     1.9.3. (Added-AFMC) The OAS Intelligence Division analyzes JCIDS and ISP documents for com-
     pleteness, supportability and impact IAW CJCSI 3312.01 criteria. Analysis results are provided to the
     document originator, HQ AFMC/A2/5, AF/A2, AFC2ISRC and the National Intelligence community
     in the form of documentation change recommendations designed to support successful intelligence
     certification assessments.

1.10. Planning and Programming for Intelligence In Force Modernization. Air Force intelligence,
planning, programming, requirements, operations, and acquisition communities must work together to
ensure derived intelligence requirements and intelligence deficiencies are identified early in the acquisi-
tion life cycle of new systems to ensure support is available, sustainable, suitable, and affordable.
Resource implications of proposed solutions must be clearly understood and incorporated within corpo-
rate planning and programming efforts.
1.10. (AFMC) Planning and Programming for Intelligence in Force Modernization.
     1.10.1. AF/XOI Advocacy. AF/XOI advocacy for intelligence requirements occurs at key points in
     the planning and programming cycles. This corporate Air Staff advocacy will not take the place of the
     MAJCOMs’ advocacy of requirements, but will supplement their efforts and ensure their visibility at
     the Air Staff level. To support IFM participation in their MAJCOM POM processes, AF/XOI provides
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                      15


  annual IFM guidance to MAJCOM SIOs. This guidance highlights pertinent ISP-derived intelligence
  infrastructure requirements along with resource considerations raised in ISSGs. In addition, AF/XOI
  will ensure intelligence infrastructure requirements are addressed in the APPG and PMGM as applica-
  ble.
  1.10.2. AFC2ISRC Advocacy. The AFC2ISRC conducts AF ISR modernization planning via the ISR
  MAP to optimize integration and interoperability across all ISR information domains. The resulting
  Mission Area Plan as well as ISR linkages within other Mission Area Plans and Capabilities Plans are
  used to guide AF planning and programming activities.
  1.10.3. MAJCOM Advocacy. Given current planning and programming procedures, issues cannot be
  identified from the Air Staff level alone. All issues must first be identified in the MAJCOM POM/
  IPBS. It is essential, therefore, that IFM action officers in the MAJCOMs successfully insert derived
  requirements into their own planning and programming processes.
  1.10.4. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Center/Site SIO Coordination. AFMC Center/site SIOs must
  actively coordinate the transition of program/initiative intelligence support with each other as the pro-
  gram/initiative transitions from one life cycle phase to the next. This coordination includes IIA docu-
  mentation and resource (manning and infrastructure) estimates. A transition ISSG is a good vehicle to
  facilitate this type of effort (see AFI 14-111 Attachment 4). For transitions involving only AFMC
  organizations, the transition ISSG needs only AFMC participants. The OAS Intelligence Division will
  facilitate cross-Center/lab communication for transitioning systems/technologies.

                                            THREAT SUPPORT

2.1. Threat Analysis. Threat analysis defines the environment in which a U.S. system will operate and
identifies threats that could be encountered by that system at IOC and IOC +10 years. Threat support to
force modernization includes threat assessments, data audits (simulation validation or SIMVAL), scenar-
ios, and other threat production identified through the Department of Defense Intelligence Production
Program (DODIPP) and the DOD Futures Intelligence Program. For the purpose of this instruction, a data
audit is the process of verifying that threat information contained in computer models accurately reflects
the current DOD intelligence position. Threat analysis accomplishes the following:
     2.1.1. It ensures threat-based issues drive efficacy and feasibility decisions of a program or initiative.
     2.1.2. It ensures cross-program analysis considerations are included when addressing threat issues.

2.2. Threat Assessments. Threat assessments describe the threat capabilities to be countered by a spe-
cific U.S. system and/or assess the potential of hostile parties to neutralize or degrade the effectiveness of
that system. Threat assessment documents include Capstone Threat Assessments (CTA), System Threat
Assessment Reports (STAR) and System Threat Assessments (STA), intelligence reports, and certain
other threat assessments. AF/XOI oversees the production of threat assessment documents developed by
the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).
2.2. (AFMC) Threat Assessments.
     2.2.1. Capstone Threat Assessment (CTA).
        2.2.1.1. A Capstone Threat Assessment is the DOD Intelligence Community's (IC) official
        assessment of the principal threat systems and capabilities within a category of warfare (e.g. Air,
        Space, Information Operations, Naval Warfare, etc.) that a potential adversary might reasonably
        bring to bear in an attempt to defeat or degrade U.S. weapon systems undergoing development.
        The Capstones are the product of a community process, not a unilateral development by a single
        producer, and constitute the authoritative DOD IC position. The Defense Intelligence Agency
        (DIA) and the Service intelligence production centers develop the CTAs in a collaborative effort.
        DIA manages the development of, and validates, CTAs.
        2.2.1.2. The Capstones will replace the Air Force’s Threat Environment Descriptions (TED) and
        provide a broad overview of the threat environment and threat capabilities of potential adversaries
        within a particular category of warfare. They serve as a baseline from which system-specific threat
        assessments are developed.
        2.2.1.3. The CTAs are used to support:
            2.2.1.3.1. All planning, programming, budgeting, development, and test and evaluation activ-
            ities throughout the acquisition process.
            2.2.1.3.2. Pre-Milestone (MS) B or pre-Key Decision Point (KDP) B analyses.
            2.2.1.3.3. System-specific threat assessments when referenced by a STAR or STA.
            2.2.1.3.4. Programs that do not require a system-specific STAR/STA or that are not subject to
            the milestone review process.
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                       17


         2.2.1.3.5. Automated Information System (AIS) ACAT 1D programs.
  2.2.2. System Threat Assessment Report (STAR).
     2.2.2.1. The STAR is the authoritative, system-specific threat capabilities reference for Acquisi-
     tion Category (ACAT) I programs and Space Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP). AIS
     programs are required by DODI 5000.2 to use the Information Operations CTA. An AIS program
     can supplement the IO CTA with a system-specific STAR, if required.
     2.2.2.2. The STAR is developed by NASIC and either (1) validated by DIA for ACAT ID and
     Space MDAP programs or (2) approved by NASIC/CC for ACAT IC programs.
     2.2.2.3. The STAR includes a system-specific overview of threat system capabilities that could be
     employed against a proposed U.S. system and the projected threat environment in which the U.S.
     system will operate at IOC (or an established baseline) and IOC/baseline +10 years. As a mini-
     mum, the STAR should include threat capabilities of those countries addressed in the Multi-Ser-
     vice Force Deployment (MSFD) scenarios. (See Attachment 2 for content and format
     information.)
         2.2.2.3.1. The STAR is typically required by MS B or KDP B and is updated as necessary
         every 18 months throughout the development of the system.
         2.2.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) The SIO’s representative will engage the other members of the
         TSG annually after publication of the STAR to determine if an updated STAR will be required.
  2.2.3. System Threat Assessment (STA).
     2.2.3.1. The STA is the authoritative, system-specific threat capabilities reference for ACAT II
     and Space Major System programs.
     2.2.3.2. Similar to the STAR in format and content, the STA is developed by NASIC and
     approved by NASIC/CC.
     2.2.3.3. The STA is typically required by MS B or KDP B and is updated as necessary every 18
     months throughout the development of the system.
         2.2.3.3.1. (Added-AFMC) The SIO’s representative will engage the other members of the
         TSG annually after publication of the STA to determine if an updated STA will be required.
  2.2.4. ACAT III and Space Non-Major System programs do not require a threat capabilities assess-
  ment. Instead, the threat section, and any references identified therein, of the Initial Capabilities Doc-
  ument (ICD), Capability Development Document (CDD), and Capability Production Document
  (CPD) will summarize the threat capabilities assessment. (For systems still using Operational
  Requirements Documents (ORDs), the ORD also contains a threat section.) Document authors use
  their supporting intelligence office to develop the threat capabilities assessment using DIA- and/or
  AF-approved information. In some non-warfighting systems the threat may be listed as not applicable.
  2.2.5. Intelligence Reports. Intelligence Reports are concise, issue-oriented memorandums that:
     2.2.5.1. Inform AF/XOI of contentious threat issues of Air Force or DOD acquisition programs or
     provide a status of programs of interest to AF/XOI.
     2.2.5.2. Inform Air Staff and Air Force Secretariat offices of threat issues of Air Force or DOD
     acquisition programs and the AF/XOI position on those issues.
18                                                          AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


     2.2.6. Other Threat Assessments. Air Force operating and implementing commands produce unique
     threat documents to satisfy specific customer requirements. The threat data in documents supporting
     acquisition programs must be consistent with the CTAs, STAR/STA, or other DIA- and/or
     AF-approved information. When requested or required, AF/XOIIA-F reviews and comments on these
     documents.
     2.2.7. Threat Assessments in Program Documents. JCIDS documents (ICD, CDD, and CPD) and
     many acquisition documents (CONOPS, Functional Solutions Analysis study plan, Analysis of Alter-
     natives study plan and report, Program Protection Plan, Information Support Plan, Single Acquisition
     Management Plan, Test & Evaluation Master Plan) contain threat-related information. Document
     authors should work through their supporting intelligence office to extract threat capabilities from the
     CTAs, STAR/STA, or other DIA- and/or AF-approved information. Consultation with the Threat
     Steering Group is recommended if the system-specific threat assessment (i.e. a STAR or STA) is not
     yet available. AF/XOIIA-F reviews and comments on these documents, as required, during the formal
     coordination process.
     2.2.8. Classifying Threat Assessments. Threat assessments must be classified at the lowest level pos-
     sible, consistent with user needs and security considerations. For some programs, such as Special
     Access Programs (SAPs), threat assessment documents might carry a higher classification. In such
     instances, this might require the preparation of a separate annex at a higher classification level than
     the basic document. This makes the basic document more accessible to stakeholders while affording
     the more sensitive information greater protection from improper disclosure.

2.3. Threat Steering Group (TSG).
2.3. (AFMC) Threat Steering Group (TSG).
     2.3.1. After MS A or KDP A, a Program Office or MAJCOM may formally request a threat assess-
     ment. A TSG may be assembled to meet this request. NASIC, in coordination with AF/XOIIA-F,
     assembles a dedicated TSG to support each ACAT I, ACAT II, Space MDAP, and Space Major Sys-
     tem program. The TSG draws on the expertise of intelligence and acquisition representatives who are
     stakeholders in the acquisition process and acts as the advisory body on all threat matters related to the
     specific program. The TSG determines the nature and level of documentation and other required
     activities to ensure consistent, efficient cradle-to-grave threat support. NASIC chairs the TSG, and
     AF/XOIIA-F provides oversight.
        2.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC program/initiative offices shall request threat assessments
        through their Center/site SIO who will submit the formal request to the intelligence community
        via a PR (see AFI 14-201 Intelligence Production and Applications).
     2.3.2. TSG membership should include representatives from:
        2.3.2.1. Intelligence staffs of the Service and Unified Commands, as appropriate
        2.3.2.2. Intelligence staffs of the implementing and operating commands
        2.3.2.3. Staff of the Program Director
        2.3.2.4. SAF/AQ or SAF/US, as appropriate
        2.3.2.5. DIA
        2.3.2.6. AFOTEC/TSI
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                       19


       2.3.2.7. Operations and Requirements staffs from the implementing and operating commands, as
       appropriate
       2.3.2.8. Other organizations, as appropriate
   2.3.3. TSG responsibilities include:
       2.3.3.1. Scheduling STAR or STA production.
       2.3.3.2. Establishing tasking.
       2.3.3.3. Determining requirements for exceptional documents, such as STAR supplements.
       2.3.3.4. Preparing a STAR or STA outline.
       2.3.3.5. Advising on Critical Intelligence Categories (CIC) development.
       2.3.3.6. Conducting a line-by-line review and revision of the draft STAR to provide a “cam-
       era-ready” copy to the NASIC Commander for approval. A Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) reflecting
       TSG members’ coordination for their organizations will accompany the final copy. The SSS will
       reflect all pertinent issues, to include potentially contentious positions, and will recommend
       approval of the document.
       2.3.3.7. Advising on target set selection.
       2.3.3.8. Recommending sources of digital data for analysis.
       2.3.3.9. Developing a countermeasures matrix, if required.
       2.3.3.10. Coordinating support provided by TSG members to Concept Refinement Phase and
       Technology Development Phase activities (or Study Phase and Design Phase activities for space
       acquisition programs), testing, and other efforts to ensure the program is provided complete, cur-
       rent, and consistent threat information.

2.4. Threat Working Group (TWG). TWGs are working-level IPTs, with similar membership as that of
TSGs, that are held as required to discuss threat issues and ensure consistent threat support to acquisition
programs throughout their lifecycle.
2.4. (AFMC) Threat Working Group (TWG).
   2.4.1. (Added-AFMC) TWGs are appropriate forums for addressing threat issues for all Acquisition
   Category (ACAT) programs.

2.5. Developing Documentation.
2.5. (AFMC) Developing Documentation.
   2.5.1. Capstone Threat Assessment (CTA).
       2.5.1.1. DIA manages the development of the CTAs and validates the final product. A designated
       lead producer, along with multiple collaborators, from among DIA and the Service intelligence
       production centers, will develop and update each CTA.
       2.5.1.2. DIA assembles and chairs the Acquisition Intelligence Support Working Group
       (AISWG), consisting of the appropriate Service representatives (AF/XOIIA-F and NASIC for
       CTAs involving Air Force lead or collaborative production), to determine the scope and provide
20                                                        AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


        guidance to the Capstone producers. The CTAs have independent update cycles, ranging from six
        months to two years.
     2.5.2. Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).
        2.5.2.1. The threat assessment of the ICD is prepared using DIA- and/or AF-approved threat
        information. ACAT ID, or potential ID, programs and Space MDAP programs must include
        DIA-validated threat references; all others may use AF-approved threat references. In accordance
        with CJCSM 3170.01, the Threat/Operational Environment section of the ICD includes:
            2.5.2.1.1. A general description of the operational environment in which a capability must be
            exercised.
            2.5.2.1.2. A summary of the current and projected threat capabilities (both lethal and
            non-lethal) to be countered throughout the capability’s lifecycle.
            2.5.2.1.3. A summary of the organizational resources that provided threat support to capabil-
            ity development efforts.
            2.5.2.1.4. A reference of the most current DIA-validated threat documents (mandatory for
            ACAT ID, potential ID, and Space MDAP programs) and/or AF-approved products or data
            used. A short source document list of supporting classified publications is suggested for all
            ICDs and mandatory for any ICD that requires an unclassified threat section. All references
            should include the document title, classification of title, document number, publication date,
            and classification of the document. [Note: If a reference document is classified, the classifica-
            tion markings do not make the ICD classified, only a classified title will do so.]
        2.5.2.2. As part of the staffing process for JCIDS documents with Joint Potential Designator
        (JPD) of JROC Interest and Joint Integration, the Joint Staff, J-2/DIA, will provide threat valida-
        tion, as directed by CJCSI 3170.01. Therefore, the Threat/Operational Environment section of the
        ICD must meet the Threat Validation certification criteria outlined in CJCSI 3312.01.
        2.5.2.3. AF/XOIIA-F will review all AF ICDs (and Joint ICDs which involve the AF) for AF/
        XOI during the JCIDS document staffing process to ensure threat information meets DOD and
        CJCS requirements.
     2.5.3. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).
        2.5.3.1. When requested or required, AF/XOIIA-F will assist the MAJCOM/IN in obtaining
        USD(P) and DIA approval of threat scenarios and other threat data in the AoA to ensure that:
            2.5.3.1.1. The threat environment in which the system will operate, to include projected
            adversary forces, strategy and tactics (including countermeasures), limitations on threat effec-
            tiveness, and sensitivities to variations in the threat, is accurately described.
            2.5.3.1.2. AoA scenarios and threats are validated and reference materials meet DOD and Air
            Force requirements.
        2.5.3.2. Baseline scenarios used in the AoA should be based on the Strategic Planning Guidance
        (SPG) Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS), unless otherwise directed by USD(P). The AoA may
        consider excursions from the SPG DPS when they would contribute to the analysis. To the greatest
        extent possible, the AoA will use MSFD scenario products from NASIC to support scenario
        needs. In cases where no appropriate MSFD scenarios exist, the AoA study team must work
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                     21


     closely with AF/XOIIA-F, NASIC, USD(P), and the local intelligence staff to develop other sce-
     narios or excursions to meet analytical needs.
     2.5.3.3. When requested or required, NASIC and AF/XOIIA-F will formally review and evaluate
     the threat and scenarios portion of AF-led and AF-interest AoAs. As part of this review process,
     NASIC performs AoA data audits that verify the accuracy of the threat data and the manner in
     which it is used in models that support the AoA.
     2.5.3.4. When requested or required, NASIC and AF/XOIIA-F will formally review and evaluate
     all AF-led AoAs under consideration for approval by the AFROCC or Joint Requirements Over-
     sight Council (JROC).
  2.5.4. Capability Development Document (CDD) and Capability Production Document (CPD).
     2.5.4.1. The threat assessment of the CDD and CPD is prepared using the current STAR/STA, if
     it exists, and DIA- and/or AF-approved threat information. ACAT ID, or potential ID, programs
     and Space MDAP programs must include DIA-validated threat references; all others may use
     AF-approved threat references. In accordance with CJCSM 3170.01, the Threat Summary section
     of the CDD and CPD includes:
        2.5.4.1.1. A description of the projected threat environment in which a capability must be
        exercised, including the nature of the threat and threat tactics.
        2.5.4.1.2. A summary of the current and projected threat capabilities (both lethal and
        non-lethal) to be countered throughout the capability’s lifecycle.
        2.5.4.1.3. A summary of the organizational resources that provided threat support to capabil-
        ity development efforts.
        2.5.4.1.4. A reference of the most current DIA-validated threat documents (mandatory for
        ACAT ID, potential ID, and Space MDAP programs) and/or AF-approved products or data
        used. A short source document list of supporting classified publications is suggested for all
        CDDs and CPDs and mandatory for any CDD or CPD that requires an unclassified threat sec-
        tion. All references should include the document title, classification of title, document number,
        publication date, and classification of the document. [Note: If a reference document is classi-
        fied, the classification markings do not make the CDD or CPD classified, only a classified title
        will do so.]
     2.5.4.2. As part of the staffing process for JCIDS documents with Joint Potential Designator
     (JPD) of JROC Interest and Joint Integration, the Joint Staff, J-2/DIA, will grant threat validation,
     as directed by CJCSI 3170.01. Therefore, the Threat Summary section of the CDD and CPD must
     meet the Threat Validation certification criteria outlined in CJCSI 3312.01.
     2.5.4.3. AF/XOIIA-F will review all AF CDDs and CPDs (and Joint CDDs and CPDs which
     involve the AF) for AF/XOI during the JCIDS document staffing process to ensure threat informa-
     tion meets DOD and CJCS requirements.
  2.5.5. Test & Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP).
     2.5.5.1. The threat capabilities information in the TEMP is prepared using the current STAR/
     STA, if it exists, and other DIA- and/or AF-approved threat information. The threat information of
     the TEMP will:
22                                                        AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


           2.5.5.1.1. Briefly summarize the threat environment described in the STAR/STA. [Exception:
           If the STAR/STA does not yet exist or is not required, the TEMP drafter will use current DIA-
           and/or AF-approved products, such as CTAs, and address threat environments at IOC and
           IOC+10.]
           2.5.5.1.2. Identify the type, number, availability, and fidelity requirements for all representa-
           tions of the threat at IOC and IOC+10.
           2.5.5.1.3. Compare the requirements for threat representations with available and projected
           assets and their capabilities and highlight major shortfalls in the ability to adequately charac-
           terize or to accurately represent specific threats listed in the STAR/STA (or other DIA- and/or
           AF-approved products) within the test environment.
           2.5.5.1.4. Reference the STAR/STA, if it exists, and other DIA- and/or AF-approved products
           or data used.
        2.5.5.2. When requested or required, NASIC and AF/XOIIA-F reviews and approves the
        threat-related sections of the TEMP.
     2.5.6. System Threat Assessment Report (STAR) and System Threat Assessment (STA).
        2.5.6.1. AF/XOIIA-F, in conjunction with SAF/AQ or SAF/US, the implementing command, the
        operating command, and DIA, determines within 30 days of the initial Program Management
        Directive (PMD) date whether a TSG is required to support the program.
        2.5.6.2. If a TSG is warranted, NASIC, in conjunction with AF/XOIIA-F, will notify appropriate
        organizations and convene an initial TSG meeting as soon as possible to review/coordinate
        post-MS A threat support and ensure timely STAR or STA production to support the MS/KDP-B
        decision. The implementing command’s intelligence office shall formally task production of the
        STAR/STA by submitting a production requirement in accordance with AFI 14-201.
           2.5.6.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The “implementing command’s intelligence office” in paragraph
           2.5.6.2. is defined to be the Center/site SIO responsible for directly supporting the program
           requiring the STAR/STA. For example, ASC/XRI submits the STAR/STA PR for intelli-
           gence-sensitive programs at ASC.
        2.5.6.3. Based on the STAR/STA table of contents, schedule, and other TSG guidance, NASIC
        drafts the document and distributes it to TSG members for review.
        2.5.6.4. Thirty days (45 days if sister-Service review is required) after draft distribution, or as
        specified by the TSG, TSG members shall provide the TSG Chairman and other TSG members
        with their substantive comments.
        2.5.6.5. Seven calendar days after comment exchange, the TSG will reconvene to conduct a
        line-by-line substantive and editorial review/revision of the draft. During this seven-day period,
        each member will review other TSG members’ comments/positions and conduct research and/or
        discussions in preparation for the reconvened TSG. NASIC will consolidate all comments.
        2.5.6.6. The TSG will conduct an intensive review to ensure the accuracy and quality of the final
        product. At the completion of the TSG meeting, each member will coordinate for his or her orga-
        nization on a staff summary sheet (SSS) recommending AF approval/disapproval. The SSS,
        signed by the TSG Chairman, will highlight any significant issues that the TSG was unable to
        resolve and any assessments that are suspected to be highly contentious or of particular concern to
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                   23


      the acquisition customer. The reconvened TSG membership will, whenever possible, be the same
      as for the original TSG. For Joint programs, sister Services will be invited to participate in the
      TSG.
      2.5.6.7. NASIC will staff the TSG recommendation, obtain Air Force approval from the NASIC
      Commander, and publish/distribute final STARs/STAs in accordance with the production schedule
      set at the original TSG meeting.
      2.5.6.8. The forward of the final Air Force-approved product will contain the following state-
      ment: “This document has been reviewed by NASIC/CC as the delegated agent for AF/XOI and is
      approved for use in support of the (program name) program as of (publication date) and is effec-
      tive through (18 months after publication date), unless earlier superseded.”
      2.5.6.9. NASIC submits Air Force-approved STARs for ACAT ID programs (and ACAT IC pro-
      grams at MS B only) to DIA for validation. The TSG Chairman will review DIA comments prior
      to incorporation in the STAR for comparison with TSG results. DIA comments directing signifi-
      cant changes to the Air Force-approved STAR may warrant formal Air Force appeal. In these
      cases, the TSG Chairman will consult with and represent the TSG membership in presenting and
      defending the Air Force position and working with DIA to resolve the issue.
      2.5.6.10. After a STAR has been approved and validated, the implementing command will closely
      monitor the status of CICs and notify TSG members and the program office of major develop-
      ments. The TSG will direct interim changes or revisions when significant changes occur in either
      the threat or the U.S. system specifications and characteristics.
      2.5.6.11. The review timelines set forth in this section are subject to modification by the TSG.
      Once the production schedule has been developed at the initial TSG, any changes of more than two
      days will be documented by message from the TSG Chairman to the full TSG membership.
      2.5.6.12. STAs and STAR supplements follow the same review procedures as STARs.
      2.5.6.13. On TSG recommendation, the NASIC Commander grants Air Force approval of STARs
      (for ACAT I and Space MDAP programs) and STAs (for ACAT II and Space Major System pro-
      grams). In addition, Air Force-approved STARs for ACAT ID programs (and ACAT IC programs
      at MS B only) must be submitted to DIA for validation.

2.6. Updating Threat Documentation.
   2.6.1. The implementing command will ensure threat data is updated appropriately in program docu-
   ments for subsequent milestone reviews and decision points. The intelligence provided must be con-
   sistent with the most current DIA- and/or AF-approved assessments.
   2.6.2. When requested or required, NASIC and AF/XOIIA-F will review all documents/studies for
   AF/XOI prior to milestone reviews, ensuring the threat information meets DOD and AF standards.
   2.6.3. Updating a STAR.
      2.6.3.1. Approximately 6 weeks before the one-year anniversary of a STAR, NASIC requests
      TSG members review and provide recommendations as to the need for an update of the STAR.
      2.6.3.2. NASIC consolidates recommendations on or before the anniversary date and determines,
      with AF/XOIIA-F coordination, whether a STAR requires an update.

        2.6.3.3. If a STAR does not require updating, the TSG Chairman will obtain the concurrence of
        the TSG members on the SSS recommending the NASIC Commander reaffirm the currency of the
        information and assessments in the STAR. NASIC will publish a new STAR cover, title page, and
        preface that documents this decision, and will make distribution to STAR recipients.
        2.6.3.4. If a STAR requires updating, NASIC will convene the TSG and follow the processes out-
        lined in section 2.5.6. of this instruction.
     2.6.4. All threat capabilities assessments must be maintained in a current and approved or validated
     status throughout the acquisition process.
2.7. (Added-AFMC) Providing Detailed Intelligence Data Support for Engineering Studies and
Analyses:
     2.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Engineering studies and analyses conducted during system development and
     modification will likely require a significant amount of detailed intelligence on threats that are only
     broadly described in their threat assessment. The following procedures ensure that only validated
     intelligence is used and that it is properly controlled:
        2.7.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Program/project offices will request intelligence data required for engi-
        neering studies and analyses via their Center/site SIO.
            2.7.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) If contractors are involved in engineering studies or analyses, pro-
            gram/project offices will accomplish a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification
            Specification, and an AFMC IMT 210, Intelligence Information Request, to allow proper
            access to required intelligence data.
        2.7.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Center/site SIOs will acquire DIA/AF-validated data and scenarios
        from the existing knowledge base.
        2.7.1.3. (Added-AFMC) In cases where new data is needed, the supporting intelligence office
        will coordinate with the program office to generate an intelligence PR in accordance with proce-
        dures in AFI 14-201. Supporting Center/site SIOs will track completion of PRs and ensure pro-
        gram offices are informed of any issues regarding completeness or timeliness of data that have
        potential to impact program cost, schedule, or performance. In cases where PRs cannot be satis-
        fied due to intelligence resource constraints, the reason(s) shall be considered a derived deficiency,
        and the supporting Center/site SIO will document it via the appropriate process (e.g., WSISRD),
        and then it will be validated by the OAS Intelligence Division.

Terms
Acquisition Intelligence Support Working Group (AISWG)—A DIA-led, multi-Service forum for
discussing acquisition intelligence issues, such as Capstone Threat Assessments, System Threat
Assessments, scenarios, and acquisition intelligence policy.
Acquisition Program—A directed, funded effort designed to provide a new, improved, or continuing
materiel, weapon, or information system or service capability in response to a validated operational or
business need.
Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)—The evaluation of the operational effectiveness and estimated costs of
alternative materiel systems to meet a mission need. The analysis assesses the advantages and
disadvantages of alternatives being considered to satisfy requirements, to include the sensitivity of each
alternative to possible changes in key assumptions or variables. The AoA assists decision-makers in
selecting the most cost-effective material alternative to satisfy a mission need.
Capability Development Document (CDD)—A document that captures the information necessary to
develop a proposed program(s), normally using an evolutionary acquisition strategy. The CDD outlines
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                       41


an affordable increment of militarily useful, logistically supportable and technically mature capability.
The CDD is validated and approved before MS/KDP B.
Capability Production Document (CPD)—A document that addresses the production elements specific
to a single increment of an acquisition program. The CPD is validated and approved before MS/KDP C.
Capstone Threat Assessment (CTA)—The DOD Intelligence Community's (IC) official assessment of
the principal threat systems and capabilities within a category of warfare (e.g. Air, Space, Information
Operations, Naval Warfare, etc.) that a potential adversary might reasonably bring to bear in an attempt to
defeat or degrade U.S. weapon systems undergoing development.
Concept Refinement Phase—The first phase of the DODI 5000.2 acquisition management framework
during which the initial concept is refined, the Analysis of Alternatives is conducted, and the Technology
Development Strategy is developed.
Critical Intelligence Categories (CIC)—Categories of threat information dealing with platforms,
weapons, systems, doctrine, or operational employment that, if developed, procured, or implemented by
potential adversaries could significantly influence the effective operation of the deployed system. (Refer
to DIAR 55-3)
Cross-Program Analysis (CPA)—CPA is an analytical effort designed to “look across” all
Intelligence-sensitive programs and the related Intelligence deficiencies. The primary objective of CPA is
to identify and consolidate like deficiencies. Synergies between programs and cost savings are realized
when solutions are identified that support multiple programs / systems. The results of CPA guide
identification and development of solutions to the documented deficiencies. An additional aspect of CPA
is to identify system or program integration issues. Two levels of CPA include Level I CPA performed at
the MAJCOM level and Level II CPA performed by the AFC2ISRC.
Derived Intelligence Requirement—Intelligence requirements that impact system development and
operational employment. These requirements are derived from Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis,
Threat analysis and Capabilities analysis.
Evolutionary Acquisition—An acquisition strategy whereby a basic capability is fielded with the intent
to develop and field additional capabilities as requirements are refined. The key concept is to rapidly
develop and field useful increments of capability (goal of 18 months or less for each delivery of an
incremental capability), and to leverage user feedback in refining required capabilities for additional
increments.
Implementing Command—The command or agency designated by the Air Force Acquisition Executive
to manage an acquisition program. The intelligence support to the manager of an acquisition program
usually resides with the Product Center/Logistics Center/Lab Research Site Directorate of Intelligence.
Information Support Plan (ISP)—The ISP (previously known as C4ISP) is an acquisition document
mandated for most service and joint programs and initiatives by Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs
of Staff instructions. Among other things, the ISP is comprised of the service and joint coordinated
documentation of the results of Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis, including identification of shortfalls
and details of solutions that are derived, with designation of responsible agencies. JCS/J-2 is responsible
to certify the adequacy of the intelligence analysis and results for joint programs.
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)—Documents the need for a materiel approach to a specific
capability gap derived from an initial analysis of materiel approaches executed by the operational user
42                                                        AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


and, as required, an independent analysis of materiel alternatives. It guides initial program activities and
supports MS/KDP A.
Intelligence Community (IC)—IC members include the Service Intelligence Organizations (Service
Cryptologic Elements (SCEs)), NSA, CIA, DIA, NRO, and NGA, as well as Coast Guard Intelligence,
Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, Department of Treasury,
and Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Intelligence Deficiency—These are derived intelligence requirements that cannot be met by the current
intelligence infrastructure.
Intelligence Infrastructure—The totality of intelligence support needed to ensure effective operation of
a system once operational. This includes intelligence people, products, processes, systems, training, and/
or facilities.
Intelligence-Sensitive Force Modernization Initiative—Any program/initiative that produces,
consumes, processes, or handles intelligence information, thereby requiring threat or intelligence
infrastructure support, and which will be measured and evaluated by a program or project office in terms
of cost, performance, and impact on warfighter capabilities and fielding, shall be considered
intelligence-sensitive. If it is likely that, in the future, the program/initiative would produce, consume,
process, or handle intelligence information, then it should be considered intelligence-sensitive.
Intelligence Support Planners—Used as a generic term to refer to individuals who are tasked with
creating all, or a portion of, the intelligence content required by this guidance for AF ISPs.
Interoperability—The ability of the systems, units, or forces to provide data, information, materiel, and
services to and accept the same from other systems, units, or forces, and to use the data, information,
materiel, and service so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.
ISR MAP Preparation Conference—A meeting (possibly virtual) of IFM intelligence experts from
each MAJCOM, AFC2ISRC, and AF/XOIIA-F to determine which capstone deficiencies (created by
AFC2ISRC in their cross-program analysis of ISP intelligence content) should be included in the ISR
MAP and to establish a prioritized ranking of those deficiencies. The purpose of the meeting is to ensure
that the IFM community presents the ISR MAP RAWG with a single, common prioritized list of
ISP-derived deficiencies for inclusion in the MAP.
Joint Potential Designator (JPD)—A designation assigned by Vice Director J-8 to specify JCIDS
validation, approval, and interoperability expectations.
Key Decision Points (KDP)—Major decision points that separate the phases of a Space acquisition
program. (Refer to National Security Space Acquisition Policy 03-01.)
KDP A—Concept/Architecture Development Phase approval
KDP B—Risk Reduction & Design Development Phase approval
KDP C— Acquisition & Operations Support Phase approval
Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP)—An acquisition program that is not a highly sensitive
classified program and is estimated by the USD(AT&L) to require an eventual total expenditure of more
than $365 million in RDT&E funds, $2.190 billion in procurement funds measured in FY 2000 constant
dollars, or programs designated as an MDAP by the USD(AT&L).

NASIC that provides details on enemy, friendly, and non-aligned forces in specific geographic areas.
National Security Systems (NSS)—Telecommunications and information systems operated by the
Department of Defense – the functions, operation, or use of which (1) involves intelligence activities; (2)
involves cryptologic activities related to national security; (3) involves the command and control of
military forces; (4) involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons systems; or (5) is
critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Subsection (5) in the preceding
sentence does not include procurement of automatic data processing equipment or services to be used for
routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel
management applications).
Operating Command—The command primarily operating a system, subsystem, or item of equipment.
Generally applies to those operational commands or organizations that Headquarters USAF designates to
conduct or participate in operations or operational testing.
Operational Baseline—Described in Sections 2 and 3 of an ISP, the operational baseline should include
the combined technology, targets, tactics, CONOPS, environment, employment options, operational
factors and threats to the system. This operational baseline serves as a starting point for intelligence
infrastructure analysis.
Operational Imperatives—Refinements to the operational baseline. May be expressed in terms of
accuracy, precision, timeliness, interoperability, and data formats. Operational imperatives define the
basic characteristics of the intelligence support required to make a system effective.
Program Management Directive (PMD)—PMDs direct the implementation of decision documentation
in acquisition decision memorandums. PMDs initiate and terminate actions, cite funding sources, and
assign responsibilities and tasks to appropriate commands and agencies.
Program Office Intelligence Partner—The intelligence office designated by an ISSG to provide
day-to-day intelligence support and oversight on intelligence infrastructure analysis captured in ISP to the
program office. Also responsible for distributing ISP-derived deficiency analyses to AFC2ISRC
requirements managers.
Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG)—Replaces the policy/strategy sections of the old Defense Planning
Guidance. Secretary of Defense’s policy and fiscal guidance upon which the military services and defense
agencies base their programs and budgets. The SPG provides a broad overview of the expected threat
environment and potential adversaries. To establish a thread of continuity in Air Force STARs, SPG
scenarios will form the basis for the operational threat environments in STARs.

System Development and Demonstration Phase—The third phase of the DODI 5000.2 acquisition
management framework. The purpose of this phase is to develop a system or increment of capability;
reduce integration and manufacturing risk; ensure operational supportability; implement human systems
integration; design for producibility; ensure affordability; and demonstrate system integration,
interoperability, safety, and utility.
System Program Director (SPD)—The single Air Force manager designated by the Program Executive
Officer ultimately responsible and accountable for decisions and resources in overall program execution
of a military system. (Refer to AFI 10-601)
System Threat Assessment (STA)—System-specific threat assessment produced by the NASIC, under
the guidance of a TSG, for ACAT II or Space Major System programs. While following the same format,
the STA is generally shorter than a STAR and does not require DIA validation.
System Threat Assessment Report (STAR)—System-specific threat assessment produced by the
NASIC, under the guidance of a TSG, for ACAT I programs or Space MDAPs. The STAR identifies and
prioritizes foreign threats to a system at initial operational capability (IOC) and at IOC+10 years. STARs
are validated by DIA for ACAT ID programs and Space MDAPs, or by NASIC/CC for ACAT IC
programs.
Technical Exchange Meeting (TEM)—Held as a subtask to ISWGs to support the derivation,
development and documentation of intelligence requirements and deficiencies associated with a proposed
program. Not attended by the general members of the ISWG. These meetings include only the technical
experts needed to clarify and assess specific program issues that the general ISWG membership is not
capable of assessing.
Technology Development Phase—The second phase of the DODI 5000.2 acquisition management
framework. The purpose of this phase is to reduce technology risk and determine the appropriate set of
technologies to be integrated into a full system.
Weapon System Intelligence Support Requirements Database (WSISRD)—A database designed to
support Intelligence in Force Modernization (IFM) implementation. The database is administered by
AFC2ISRC/IN, is web-enabled on the SIPRNET, and is used to catalog intelligence deficiencies
identified during Intel Infrastructure Analysis. AFC2ISRC/IN uses the database to support Level II
Cross-Program Analysis. WSISRD can be found on SIPRNET at <http://afc2isrc.af.smil.mil> under
ISR Web Requirement Tools.

                 SYSTEM THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT (STAR) FORMAT

A2.1. Summary. Provides a complete, autonomous threat overview. This section is sharply focused to
provide key intelligence judgments. If the Threat Steering Group (TSG) is in agreement on all threat lev-
els for all adversary systems, then the Summary will contain a Threat Matrix (listing major threats and
depicting a threat level for each threat at IOC and IOC+10 years). The summary also contains a sub-sec-
tion entitled, “Significant Changes for this STAR” that identifies significant changes that have been noted
since the previous STAR was published and, if a Threat Matrix is included, define the reasons why threat
levels were modified.

A2.2. Foreword. Provides the opportunity to identify all of the TSG members and name all of the signif-
icant contributors to the STAR. It identifies all of the organizations that coordinated on the STAR and
includes names and phone numbers for the STAR author and system Special Program Organization or
Joint Program Organization.

A2.3. Section I. Introduction. Includes the mission need for the US system and a sub-section entitled,
“Scope of This STAR” that directs the reader to other documents that define threats to critical US systems
associated with, but not included in, the STAR.

A2.4. Section II. U.S. System Description. Describes the US system in sufficient detail to assess which
threats could jeopardize the proposed system’s ability to perform its mission.

A2.5. Section III. Operational Threat Environment. Portrays a generalized, but complete, overview
of the operational, physical and technological environment in which the system will have to function.
Developments and trends that could reasonably be expected to affect mission capability during the US
system’s lifetime are projected out to 10 years beyond IOC. Areas covered include enemy doctrine, strat-
egy and tactics affecting system mission(s) and operations. Threat content varies, based on the nature of
each program. Should DIA so recommend, a reference to a CTA may replace this section.

A2.6. Section IV. Threats to be countered (if applicable). Includes a full range of targets or other
threats to be engaged within the mission areas in which the system is designed to perform. If applicable,
an analysis of the actual capabilities and signatures of projected adversary targets/systems is provided.

A2.7. Section V. System-Specific Threat. Focuses on threat capabilities that are relevant to the mission
and performance of the US system throughout its operational life. Timeframes for threat “snapshots” are
depicted at IOC of the US system and IOC+10 years.

A2.8. Section VI. Reactive Threat. Contains an analytical estimate of the actions potential adversaries
might reasonably be expected to take in reaction to the fielding of our developmental system. This esti-
mate is based on historical trends, evidence of research and development, perceived military and politi-
cal-economic requirements, and technological capabilities. It includes changes in policy, doctrine and
tactics or the development of systems with the intent to degrade or defeat our proposed system’s capabil-
ities.

A2.9. Section VII. Technologically Feasible Threat. Contains those threats not projected, but consid-
ered feasible. Presents plausible alternative courses of action, should the adversary’s requirements change
from those currently assessed to be most likely. The technologically feasible threat, though not con-
strained by intelligence projections, is consistent with an adversary’s technological base, economic situa-
tion, and industrial production capabilities. The technologically feasible threat provides decision-makers
with a basis for judgment about the impact on a specific US system, if the threat were to evolve in a direc-
tion other than that considered most likely by the US intelligence community.

A2.10. Appendix A. Critical Intelligence Categories (CICs). CICs are categories of threat information
established and examined through the collaborative and joint efforts of the intelligence, requirements and
acquisition management communities. CICs depict adversary system- and weapon-related characteristics,
employment information, and/or technological threshold parameters, changes to which would critically
impact the effectiveness or survivability of our proposed developmental system. Each CIC is backed up
by a Production Requirement submitted by the SPO/Implementing Command. If a CIC is breached, a tele-
phonic TSG will be called immediately to determine if program reevaluation is necessary.

A2.11. Appendix B. Critical Program Information. Contains system-related information that, if
released to potential adversaries, could compromise our developmental system’s ability to successfully
perform its mission, once fielded. If a Program Protection Plan (PPP) exists, a reference to the PPP should
be included in Section II of the STAR/STA, and no Appendix B is required.

A2.12. Appendix C. Abbreviations. A table defining acronyms used in the STAR.

A2.13. Additional Appendixes. May be included, as necessary.

       INTELLIGENCE INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS FORMAT AND CHECKLISTS

A3.1. Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis and ISPs. Intelligence infrastructure analysis, if docu-
mented as prescribed below, will result in the content necessary to support DOD ISP requirements. The
results of the IIA typically will be used as the intelligence content within the ISP, as the basis for the intel-
ligence support plan within the Integrated Program Summary (for space acquisition initiatives), as input
to other acquisition related documents (CDD, CPD, CRD, etc), and to support cross-program analysis.
The analysis format recommended below makes visible the logical progression from operational employ-
ment or capabilities development concepts to essential supporting infrastructure and interoperability
requirements. For programs with moderate or substantial intelligence support needs, the results of IIA
will appropriately be documented as an annex to the program ISP to augment and explain the intelligence
content within the ISP.

A3.2. Executive Summary. Executive Summary should highlight key intelligence deficiencies and call
out any “showstoppers” or major concerns for the program. It should be written for senior-level personnel
and be able to stand alone. Ideally, the Executive Summary should be unclassified for widest dissemina-
tion.

A3.3. Operational Employment. This section defines the employment concept for the system from
which INTELLIGENCE support requirements are derived. Intelligence support planners should ensure
that the details of the operational baseline and employment considerations that were used in their require-
ments analysis process are included. Relevant intelligence activities, interfaces and information flows
should be included in the architecture views. “Foreign Threat Considerations” should be included in this
portion of the document and is completed as follows:
    A3.3.1. If there is no foreign threat annotate this section with “Foreign threat is N/A.”
    A3.3.2. If there is a foreign threat and that threat is referenced in a system CDD or CPD, this section
    may refer to the CDD/CPD for threat details.
    A3.3.3. If there is a foreign threat and there is no CDD or CPD, this section should contain an appro-
    priate DIA-validated or approved threat reference (e.g., STAR, STA, or CTA).

A3.4. Derived Intelligence Support Requirements. Derived intelligence requirements contain the details
of the STT analysis used. ISR Support to Operations (Intelligence Considerations). For each step of the
STT analysis, a table should be included that lists the operational considerations, derived intelligence
requirements, and the cross-reference to intelligence deficiencies that are discussed in Potential INTEL-
LIGENCE Support Shortfalls and Proposed Solutions discussion. These tables show traceability to oper-
ational considerations. The standard STT table format is given in Figure A3.1.

A3.5. Potential ISR Support Deficiencies and Proposed Solutions. This section addresses deficien-
cies in required ISR support capabilities, deficiencies in manpower, training, or doctrine, and any other
changes that must be implemented for ISR to support the system. Note: Intelligence partners should
ensure existing Intelligence Community products are used to the fullest advantage to resolve potential
intelligence deficiencies identified through STT analyses. Each deficiency analysis should be called out
separately.
   A3.5.1. Identify potential intelligence deficiencies required for system support along with
   ISWGs-developed solutions and action plans to resolve each deficiency. This information is captured
   in the intelligence deficiency analysis documentation described below. Each deficiency analysis
   should begin a new page for ease of identification.
   Control Number: XX-YYYY-####
   A3.5.2. To enable the Cross-Program Analysis of requirements at the Air Force level, a standard
   numbering scheme must be followed when documenting these deficiencies. All deficiency analyses
   will follow the “XX-YYYY-####” numbering scheme described below.
   XX = The first characters are a two-letter designator of the category of the process which this intelli-
   gence deficiency impacts. This characterization scheme provides a consistent method of identifying
   the category of requirement. There are nine requirement functional categories:
   AQ = Acquisition Support – to include support to testing
   OP = Operations Support – catch-all for employment-related requirements
   MP = Mission Planning Support
   TN = Training Support
   TG = Targeting
   MS = Modeling & Simulation
   AF = Analysis and Fusion
   CM = Collection Management
   EX = Exploitation and Dissemination Support

     A3.5.3. YYYY = The second set of characters is a four character alphanumeric designator (acronym)
     for the system designated by the author of the deficiency. This designator provides a unique descriptor
     used to track which program a specific deficiency analysis comes from. AFC2ISRC/IN or AF/
     XOIIA-F may request a change of the designator to preclude duplicates. Its only use is for tagging
     specific deficiencies.
     A3.5.4. #### = The final part of the deficiency documentation numbering scheme is a four-digit num-
     ber defining from which intelligence functional area the solution for the unique deficiency comes.
     Additional requirements in the same functional area are sequentially numbered (e.g.,
     XX-YYYY-1000, XX-YYYY-1001). Using this numbering scheme consistently provides a mecha-
     nism for managing requirements across systems. There are 12 solution functional areas in this part of
     the numbering scheme:

     A3.5.5. As an example, if intelligence support planners are working a program called Advanced Air-
     plane of the Future (AAOF) and have identified a deficiency during capabilities planning that can only
     be solved with a modification to current intelligence training, the number for this deficiency would be:
     MP-AAOF-1100.
        A3.5.5.1. Title: A descriptive, unclassified title of the requirement that, when read alone, clearly
        states the deficiency. The title should provide some context for the reader of the requirement.
        A3.5.5.2. Functional Description: A concise summary of the deficiency analysis. This statement
        should include a description of the deficiency and the reason the information/resource is required
        and what operational/acquisition function it supports.
        A3.5.5.3. Impact/Risk Statement: A statement addressing what the impact will be if the require-
        ment is not met.
        A3.5.5.4. Reference: A reference to the specific section in the CDD, CPD, CONOPS, ISP and/or
        STT from which this requirement is derived. Include specific chapter/section or a quotation from
        the CDD/CPD/CONOPS. Reference information is mandatory to provide traceability back to the
        operational/acquisition requirement.
        A3.5.5.5. Satisfaction Criteria: The specific details that fully describe the requirement. Some
        examples of satisfaction criteria are format, accuracy, timeliness, volume, classification, etc.
        Define the required capability in as many dimensions as needed and write in terms of measures of
        performance – the quantitative measure of the lowest level of performance needed to satisfy a
        requirement. The data to populate the “Criteria” column can be generated using the intelligence
        functional area checklists. Figure A3.2. displays a satisfaction criteria table.

         be identified.
         A3.5.5.7. Significant Action Items: This describes the key action items/steps assigned to imple-
         ment the time-phased activities, presented in sequence order that will ensure satisfaction of the
         intelligence deficiency solution. OPRs and operational need dates should be provided. These
         action items should describe a critical path, which by definition, will result in the overall require-
         ment being satisfied if the action items themselves are successfully executed.
         A3.5.5.8. Cost Data: The predicted cost associated with correcting the identified deficiency. If
         cost information is not available, or the program will not incur a cost, this should be stated. The
         means to satisfy costs should be identified. This ensures total life-cycle costs can be captured for
         the system regardless of the funding source.
   A3.5.6. Provide a table, including a summary of cost drivers and fiscal year break down of associated
   costs. An example of a table is Table A3.3. below.

                                              ISSG PROCESS

A4.1. Background. The need for an Intelligence Support Steering Group was identified during the
development of the Intelligence in Force Modernization strategy. The strategy defines goals and objec-
tives that address shortfalls in Air Force intelligence integration in weapons program development. Spe-
cifically, the ISSG engages key acquisition and intelligence players, provides guidance, and assigns
responsibilities to turn the concept of intelligence support to acquisition into the reality of fielded capabil-
ities to support the warfighter.

A4.2. Purpose. The ISSG has four primary purposes:
     A4.2.1. Assign organizations (intel partners) clear roles and responsibilities for providing intelligence
     support for the nominated program/initiative. Clear lanes-in-the-road are defined by the ISSG to
     ensure requirements are understood and POCs are identified.
     A4.2.2. Estimate the type and level of intelligence support required to ensure intelligence issues are
     properly addressed throughout the program/initiative’s acquisition process and field operations.
     A4.2.3. Provide critical cost and intelligence infrastructure availability information to force modern-
     ization decision makers. Known shortfalls, as well as commitments to resolve them, are documented
     in the ISSG minutes.
     A4.2.4. Provide an overview of the Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis process to key acquisition
     and intelligence personnel.

A4.3. Membership of an ISSG.
     A4.3.1. Core members include:
     Chair, AF/XOIIA-F
     Operating MAJCOM Intelligence
     Operating MAJCOM Requirements and/or Operations
     Implementing MAJCOM Intelligence
     Applicable Center/Lab/Research Site DI
     AFC2ISRC Intelligence
     Program/Initiative Lead
     A4.3.2. Other members may include: Center/Lab/Research Site requirements and future plans
     offices, SAF/AQ/FM/XI, AFCAA, HQ AFRL, AFOTEC, OAS, intelligence production centers, AIA,
     other services, agencies, departments, etc.

A4.4. Operational Concept.
     A4.4.1. Types of ISSGs. There are three types of ISSGs: Topical, Out-of-Cycle, and Transition.
        A4.4.1.1. Topical ISSGs. Topical ISSGs are held annually to address intelligence support plan-
        ning for a large number of programs. Nominated programs are consolidated into topical areas of
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                        65


     interest whenever possible. Topical categories include Aeronautical, Air Armament, C4ISR/IW
     (Command, Control, Communications, and Computers/ Information Warfare), Space and Mis-
     siles, and Joint Programs. Force Modernization initiatives may be placed into one of these general
     topical categories, or further broken out into smaller ISSG categories, as required. Location of the
     ISSG will be based on the location of the nominated initiatives. The goal is to host the meeting
     where the majority of responsible offices/stakeholders reside. Video teleconferencing may also be
     considered. Nominations that cannot be addressed (for example, due to time constraints or
     unavailability of principals) at the announced ISSG will be scheduled for the next topical ISSG. If
     a program/initiative requires immediate support, MAJCOM SIOs should consider requesting AF/
     XOI to convene an ISSG outside of the normal cycle.
     A4.4.1.2. Out-of-Cycle ISSGs. MAJCOM SIOs can request Out-of-Cycle ISSGs if a program/
     initiative requires urgent attention or it was not ready to be presented at its applicable topical ISSG.
     Out-of-Cycle ISSGs are held on an as needed basis. Location of the ISSG will be based on the
     location of the nominated initiative(s). The goal is to host the meeting where the responsible
     offices/stakeholders reside. Video teleconferencing may also be considered.
        A4.4.1.2.1. After considering/researching the request for an ISSG, AF/XOIIA-F is the deci-
        sion authority to convene an ISSG. If AF/XOIIA-F decides not to convene an ISSG, they will
        identify to the requestor suitable references to obtain the information they need about baseline
        intelligence infrastructure capabilities and costs.
     A4.4.1.3. Transition ISSGs. Transition ISSGs are held only if necessary to enable reconsideration
     of intelligence support needs/shortfalls/costs as the program/initiative matures from one acquisi-
     tion phase to the next. There may be derived deficiencies that remain "open" as a program begins
     to transition and the role of intel partner may shift from one DI to the next or from the implement-
     ing command to the operating command. The transition ISSG reassigns responsibilities and
     ensures intel support continues to be seamlessly integrated into the program. The purposes of the
     transition ISSGs are slightly different from other ISSGs. They include:
        A4.4.1.3.1. Address status of outstanding derived deficiencies.
        A4.4.1.3.2. Assign responsibility for tracking remaining derived deficiencies.
        A4.4.1.3.3. Reassign intelligence partner roles.
        A4.4.1.3.4. Refine estimates of the baseline intelligence infrastructure capability to support
        the weapon/program intelligence needs (based upon the developer’s refined understanding of
        their own issues/problems).
        A4.4.1.3.5. Address outstanding derived deficiency costs and the potential budgeting strategy
        for each.
     A4.4.1.4. ISSG Nomination Process. AF/XOI will release an ISSG call for topics message NLT
     75 days prior to an ISSG start date. This announcement identifies the ISSG topic and invites MAJ-
     COMs to nominate programs/initiatives that need to be addressed.
     A4.4.1.5. Each MAJCOM and AFC2ISRC will solicit nominations from their respective units
     and headquarters staff. MAJCOM SIOs validate, prioritize, and consolidate their command nomi-
     nations into a single list that is sent to AF/XOIIA-F, with info to AFMC/XRI. MAJCOM SIOs
     must ensure that nominations contain all required information and that nominated initiatives meet
66                                                        AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


     "intelligence sensitivity" criteria. MAJCOM SIOs must sign nomination packages (electronic sig-
     nature is acceptable).
     A4.4.1.6. Ideally, ISSGs are convened during the concept or technology phase. This enables intel-
     ligence interoperability and supportability issues to help shape the design of the future program/
     initiative. Major modifications, upgrades, or pre-planned product improvements may also require
     ISSGs if the program/initiative has not been addressed previously by the ISSG process.
     A4.4.1.7. Nomination Evaluation Criteria. The following criteria are used to evaluate ISSG nom-
     inations:
     A4.4.1.8. Intelligence Sensitivity
     A4.4.1.9. MAJCOM requirements (Who wants the system? Has the operational concept been
     accepted?)
     A4.4.1.10. MAJCOM priority (How soon is this system needed?)
     A4.4.1.11. Resource constraints (Is there funding or plans to fund intelligence infrastructure anal-
     ysis and development? Funding for intelligence operations?)
     A4.4.1.12. Program milestone or status
     A4.4.1.13. Planning for emerging (potential "black") programs (What intelligence infrastructure
     needs to be in place?)
     A4.4.1.14. Accelerated technology integration (higher priority due to operational need)
     A4.4.1.15. Intelligence Sensitivity Criteria. The following criteria should be applied to determine
     intelligence sensitivity of the program/initiative:
     A4.4.1.16. Any program/initiative that produces, consumes, processes, or handles intelligence
     data, thereby requiring threat or intelligence infrastructure support, and which will be measured
     and evaluated by a program or project office in terms of cost, performance, and impact on warf-
     ighter capabilities and fielding, shall be considered intelligence-sensitive. If it is likely that, in the
     future, the program/initiative would produce, consume, process or handle intelligence informa-
     tion, then it should be considered intelligence-sensitive.
     A4.4.1.17. Intelligence Infrastructure = People, Products, Process, Systems, Training, and/or
     Facilities.
     A4.4.1.18. Required information for Nominations. The following information is required in order
     for AF/XOIIA-F to consider a nomination for an ISSG:
         A4.4.1.18.1. Name and description of program/initiative
         A4.4.1.18.2. Status (ACAT/Milestone information as applicable)
         A4.4.1.18.3. Sponsoring operational MAJCOM
         A4.4.1.18.4. Date ISP is needed (if known)
         A4.4.1.18.5. Rationale for nomination (intelligence sensitivity level, type of intelligence sup-
         port issues, etc.)
         A4.4.1.18.6. Name, organization, and phone number of POC (Program Manager, study lead,
         MAJCOM and Acquisition POCs)
AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006                                                                    67


NOTE: MAJCOM SIOs must ensure that program managers/study leads understand their role at the
ISSG and within IFM Strategy at the time of their nomination.
      A4.4.1.19. ISSG Cost Estimating. The ISSG will estimate the approximate cost of intel support
      planning for each program/initiative. This will include day-to-day intel support by the MAJCOM
      and production center intelligence staff, ISWG activity, and production of the intelligence support
      plan. The costs defined during the ISSG are usually defined in man years by the organization
      responsible for direct intelligence support together with the program initiative lead. This agree-
      ment is then integrated into the program/initiative budget/POM. Detailed intelligence costs are
      defined via the ISWG process.
      A4.4.1.20. ISSG Due Outs. The ISSG Chair will ensure the objectives of the ISSG are attained
      and results are documented. These results as well as ISSG decisions are published via an AF/XOI
      message. Specifically, the AF/XOI message documents:
          A4.4.1.20.1. Clear "lane-in-the-road" responsibilities for each participating member of the
          ISSG, including assignment of the intel partner and agreement on responsibility for organizing
          and facilitating associated Intelligence Support Working Groups (ISWGs).
          A4.4.1.20.2. Estimates of the level and type of intelligence support required for the program/
          initiative, project or technology.
          A4.4.1.20.3. Preliminary cost estimates for intelligence support.
          A4.4.1.20.4. For "Transition ISSGs": reassign responsibility for tracking outstanding derived
          requirements.
          A4.4.1.20.5. For "Transition ISSGs": reassign the intelligence partner role.

                                 ISP PROCEDURES AND FORMATS

A5.1. Background. The ISP replaces the C4ISP originally mandated in the DOD 5000 series directives.
CJCSI 6212.01C mandates that an ISP be created for all ACAT programs. The ISP describes system
dependencies and interface requirements in sufficient detail to enable testing and verification of IT and
NSS interoperability and supportability.

A5.2. Format. Guidelines for the ISP format are contained in DODI 4630.8. This instruction does not
currently contain enough detail to rely on exclusively for guidance in identifying data necessary for inclu-
sion. Recommend referring to DOD 5000 series directives for detailed guidance. ISPs are composed using
the following format:
Chapter 1 – Introduction (Overview and Program Data)
Chapter 2 – Analysis
Chapter 3 – Issues
Appendix A. – References
Appendix B. – Systems Data Exchange Matrix (System View-6)
Appendix C. – Interface Control Agreements
Appendix D. – Acronym List
Other Appendixes
   A5.2.1. Intelligence Content. The content within the ISP should mirror chapters four and five from
   the C4ISP. For organizations that have a C4ISP and need to develop an ISP, it is acceptable to transfer
   the data from chapters four and five of the C4ISP into the ISP annex renumbering paragraphs as
   required. This does not eliminate the requirement to update this data annually. Intelligence content
   associated with each chapter is depicted below:
       A5.2.1.1. Chapter 1 – Introduction: Overview text should address how the capability relates to
       the battlespace awareness integrated architecture, or other intelligence support elements of other
       Joint Functional Areas/Concepts (JFA/JFC), such as targeting subarchitectures as part of the Force
       Application JFA/JFC. Address whether the desired capabilities described relate to any of the key
       intelligence Capstone Requirements Documents such as Distributed Common Ground/Surface
       System (DCGS), Imagery and Geospatial Intelligence (IGI), United States MASINT System
       (USMS), Moving Target Indicator (MTI), or Unified Cryptologic System (UCS). Program Data
       addresses any program-related acquisition scheduling issues that have precluded conducting full
       intelligence information need and supportability analysis. For example, system-level detail may
       not be available until prime contractor selections have been made, or until the functional solution
       has been more refined.
       A5.2.1.2. Chapter 2 – Analysis: Ensure the service or joint intelligence support missions or func-
       tions to be provided are consistent with the operational capabilities outlined in the associated CDD
       or CPD. Ensure intelligence information needs are completely addressed and clearly related to
       these missions or functions, and that they include the required qualitative and quantitative
72                                                     AFI14-111_AFMCSUP1_I 23 MARCH 2006


     attributes discussed in Enclosure E of DODI 4630.8. Ensure the scope of analysis for intelligence
     information needs addresses all stages of acquisition, to include development, testing, training,
     and operation. Ensure the supportability assessment adequately considers the ability of the service
     or joint intelligence architecture to both quantitatively and qualitatively satisfy the intelligence
     information needs. This section of the ISP must contain a description of the Intelligence require-
     ments derived from the Intelligence Infrastructure Analysis outlined in chapter 1.7. of this docu-
     ment. The content of this section must be consistent with chapter 9 of the associated CDD or CPD.
     A5.2.1.3. Chapter 3 – Issues: Ensure that all intelligence-related shortfalls, issues, and associated
     mitigation strategies or resolution paths generated by IIA have been addressed. The content of this
     section must be consistent with chapter 9 of the associated CDD or CPD.
     A5.2.1.4. Appendix A. – References: Ensure the Battlespace Awareness Joint Functional Concept
     is cited if applicable. Ensure the currency of any relevant DIA or Service-validated threat refer-
     ences used.
     A5.2.1.5. Appendix B. – Systems Data Exchange Matrix (System View-6): Ensure intelligence
     nodes and systems/subsystems have been adequately represented in the Systems Information
     Exchange Matrix (SV-6).
     A5.2.1.6. Appendix C. – Interface Control Agreements: Not applicable.
     A5.2.1.7. Appendix D. – Acronym List: Ensure appropriate intelligence-related acronyms are
     included for clarity.
     A5.2.1.8. Other Appendixes: If any intelligence considerations exist that are not addressed else-
     where in the ISP, the supporting intelligence office should determine in conjunction with the pro-
     gram manager whether an additional appendix to address the issue would be appropriate.
