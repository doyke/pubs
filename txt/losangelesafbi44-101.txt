2.1. Deterrence:
   2.1.1. Inspection testing should be conducted frequently, especially in areas where there is a
   high availability of controlled substances or evidence of a serious or widespread problem of
   drug use. Testing must be administered in a manner which will ensure unpredictability of test
   dates and subjects. Access to the dates and names of subjects must be limited to the absolute
   minimum number of people who must have advance notice.
   2.1.2. Commanders may conduct unit sweeps. A sweep of their unit must be coordinated
   with the DRPM and SMC/JA two duty days prior to the desired testing date to ensure proper
   chain of custody requirements can be met.
   2.1.3. Random gate sweeps may be conducted during and outside of normal duty hours as
   directed by the 61 ABG/CC. The dates and times of testing will be coordinated with
   SMC/JA, 61 SFS, and DDR.
      2.1.3.1. Gate sweeps will be a joint effort involving the on scene commander, First
      Sergeants, DDR Staff and JA. The operational plan for gate sweeps will be devised to
      ensure randomness of selection and that the overall traffic flow onto the installation is not
      significantly impacted. Prior to the designated date of testing, the SMC/JA will conduct a
      legal review of the operational plan.
      2.1.3.2. All instances of failure to report to the clinic as directed, refusal to provide a
      specimen, or late reporting will be reported to the 61 ABG/CC and SMC/JA immediately
      following closure of the testing window.
2.2. Suspected Drug Abuse:
   2.2.1. Probable Cause (Search and Seizure)
      2.2.1.1. Probable cause is determined through coordination with the SMC/JA, SFOI, and
      OSI.
      2.2.1.2. The member is escorted to the DDRP office by a reliable observer of the same
      gender between 0730-1500 hrs on regular duty days with a completed Drug Testing
      Memorandum. The observer reads and signs a statement of understanding. Outside of
      duty hours, the on-call lab technician must be contacted through the Command Post for
      collection of specimen. (Attachment 6 and Attachment 7)
      2.2.1.3. The authorization to search, whether oral or written, should clearly indicate, if
      possible, the specific drug or group of drugs to be tested.
      2.2.1.4. Once completed, a copy of an AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize is
      forwarded to the DTPAM.
   2.2.2. Consent: The individual is sent to the DDRP office between 0730-1500 hrs on regular
   duty days with a completed AF Form 1364, Consent for Search & Seizure. A reliable
   observer of the same gender escorts the member to the DDRP office. This observer reads
   and signs a statement of understanding. (Attachment 7)

     2.2.3. Commander-Directed Testing:
        2.2.3.1. Incidents that may precipitate a commander-directed referral for urinalysis
        testing may include, but are not limited to:

            2.2.3.2.1. Voluntarily consented to testing on AF Form 1364, Consent for Search &
            Seizure
            2.2.3.2.2. A probable cause search has been authorized by the appropriate authority,

        through the Command Post outside of duty hours to collect specimen.

    NOTIFICATION PROCESS TO COMMANDERS FOR POSITIVE URINALYSIS

The following checklist will be used as standard operating procedure for positive urinalysis test:

       Medical Review Officer (MRO) review indicates a positive illegal result.

       Demand Reduction Program Manager (DRPM) informs the Base Installation Commander
       of the positive urinalysis (UA)

       DRPM notifies Security Forces Officer Investigations (SFOI) and hand carries the
       positive package in a sealed envelope to SFOI office. If SFOI officers are not available,
       the positive package will be sealed and marked across the seal “SFOI EYES ONLY “ and
       delivered to the law enforcement desk.

       DDRPM will have the duty officer at the law enforcement desk call SFOI officers to
       notify them of the positive package being dropped off from the Drug Demand Reduction
       (DDR) office.

       SFOI will review the package and notify Air Force Office of Special Investigations
       (AFOSI) and Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). Within a timely manner of reviewing the
       package SFOI will notify the commander of the positive UA of the military member.
       SFOI will ask the commander not to question the affected member. Member must not be
       notified of their positive results until SFOI/AFOSI has had an opportunity to question the
       individual or conduct an investigation. Set up a time with the commander, 1stSgt and
       military member to meet in the SFOI office. AFOSI will be working in concert with
       SFOI.

       During the interview SFOI will give the commander a letter for the member to report to
       Alcohol Drugs Abuse Preventive and Treatment (ADAPT) at the Military Treatment
       Facility (MTF) within seven duty days.

       Once the initial interview is over and all the blocks on the checklist have been signed the
       package will be returned by the DDR office and filed for record.
