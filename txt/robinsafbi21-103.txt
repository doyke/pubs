This instruction covers wire rope, alloy steel chain, metal mesh, synthetic web, safety nets, cargo
nets, beam slings, and restraints. A sling is defined as an assembly which connects a load to
material handling equipment and/or a holding device. Improper use of slings can cause injury,
death, and property damage. Mishaps often occur when loads are dropped or slip because the
sling or its attachments break. Most sling mishaps can be attributed to inadequate design,
improper selection, poor inspection, failure to make sure loads are properly attached and secured,
or improper storage and care. This instruction establishes policies and procedures to implement
the 402d Maintenance Wing (402 MXW) sling program and to mitigate these factors. In
addition, this instruction assigns responsibilities to individuals and organizations (users) to
implement the commander’s program. Squadron commanders are ultimately responsible for
ensuring compliance where organizations or users are referenced. All personnel with duties
requiring use or inspection of slings will receive the sling user formal training course. Only
personnel that have received the sling user training course are qualified to perform periodic
inspections. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of
primary responsibility using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with (IAW) AF Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
