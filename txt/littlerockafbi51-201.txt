1. General Responsibilities. No later than the 15th day of each month, the following
commanders will submit a member nomination list of officer personnel available for courts-
martial and/or discharge board duty for the following month to 19 AW/JAM (Military Justice
Section):
   1.1. 19 OG/CC
   1.2. 19 MSG/CC
   1.3. 19 MXG/CC
   1.4. 19 MDG/CC
 2                                              LITTLEROCKAFBI51-201 19 AUGUST 2013


     1.5. 19 AW/DS
     1.6. 314 OG/CC
     1.7. 314 MXG/CC
2. Responsibilities of the Nominating Commanders:
     2.1. The Air Force relies on commanders to nominate their most qualified officers and
     enlisted members for this duty. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 25,
     requires the court-martial convening authority to detail as panel members those members
     who in his/her opinion “are best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training,
     experience, length of service, and judicial temperament.” Subordinate commanders must
     utilize the same criteria when submitting nominations, and should consider all members of
     their command regardless of AFSC or duty assignment.
     2.2. Each group will supply a sufficient number of nominees in accordance with Attachment
     2, unless there is an inadequate number of qualified candidates reasonably available.
     Commanders will ensure a Court/Board Member Data Sheet, 18th Air Force, is completed
     by each nominee. A sample data sheet is at Attachment 3. These items are submitted to 19
     AW/JAM by the 15th day of each month with the list of monthly nominees. If previously
     submitted, nominees must ensure 19 AW/JA is provided an updated TDY and leave
     schedule.
     2.3. The nomination list must consist of a representative sample of the entire officer
     membership of each unit. The list must contain, at a minimum, the number of personnel who
     meet the rank requirements in accordance with Attachment 2, unless the unit lacks a
     sufficient number of candidates qualified under Article 25.
     2.4. Each member is nominated for the single month following submission of nominations.
     For example, the list submitted by 15 March nominates members for courts-martial and
     boards convened during the month of April.
     2.5. If a group/unit is unable to adequately support the required number or grade distribution
     of nominees, the group or unit commander must submit a written memorandum or email to
     19 AW/SJA that details why he/she is unable to comply.
     2.6. Commanders will ensure the nomination list is e-mailed to both the officer in charge
     (OIC) and the noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of Military Justice. Commanders
     are encouraged to appoint points of contact (POC) to comply with this requirement.
     2.7. Commanders will not submit personnel whom they know will be unavailable for any
     part of the month they are submitted for or whom do not possess the attributes required by
     Article 25, UCMJ (see above).
     2.8. Should a member selected for a court or board be unable to serve, the member’s
     immediate commander will:
        2.8.1. Obtain a written excusal request from the member which he/she will review and
        forward through the group commander through 19 AW/JA, to the special or general
        court-martial convening authority for approval.
LITTLEROCKAFBI51-201 19 AUGUST 2013                                                          3


      2.8.2. Submit the names of two replacement members for each member to be replaced.
      The replacement members must be of equal grade or higher, be eligible to serve, and be
      available to serve on the pending court or board.
   2.9. Enlisted members will be nominated by their respective group commanders as needed.
   2.10. 18 AF/CC philosophy regarding the importance of court-martial duty is at Attachment
   4.
3. Responsibilities of the Nominated Member:
   3.1. Nominated members will complete and submit an electronic data sheet to the NCOIC of
   Military Justice, 19 AW/JAM, for each month they are nominated. Nominees type their
   information directly on the electronic version of the data sheet. Every block must be
   completed. The nominee’s data sheet will be maintained by the unit POC and Military
   Justice, as this will simplify updates in the event a member is nominated multiple times
   throughout the year. Nominated members should contact their unit POC and the Military
   Justice Section to obtain their data sheet and make any updates.
   3.2. In the event of a conflict between service on a court-martial or discharge board panel
   and another obligation, the member must make every effort to resolve the conflict so that
   he/she may perform this important duty. Excusable delays are dictated by the court-martial
   convening authority. If a conflict occurs that cannot be resolved, refer to paragraph 2.8
   above.
