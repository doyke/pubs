inspection on an Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment
Record or AF Form 2411, Inspection Document.
10.2.1.15. In the situation of only one person in a shop, it will require a second party or the on-
duty supervisor to turn the item back into the tool room. (Example. one Non-Destructive
Inspection (NDI) personnel on night shift will have production supervisor return the tool in
TAS).
10.2.1.17. Aircrew and Life Support personnel will account for all tools and equipment
dispatched to the flight line (i.e. flashlights and aircrew headsets etc.). If an aircrew member
discovers a tool missing and it can not be located after an initial search, the aircrew member will
place a Red X in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document with a
description of the tool and a specific last known location. If a Life Support member discovers a
tool missing and it can not be located after an initial search, the person who lost the tool will
notify the aircraft expeditor/production supervisor and Life Support supervision immediately.
10.4.1.2.1. Chits may be used as an additional back-up accountability system to the Tool
Accountability System (TAS) automated system for tools issued from tool rooms or work center
CTKs. Mark or etch each set of chits with the unit's nine-character worldwide EID to distinguish
each set of chits. All chits are considered accountable items and will be maintained in a secure
location in the tool room or work center. Document chit issue in TAS. The work center
supervisor or CTK monitor will inventory chits at the beginning and end of each shift.
10.4.2.1.1. Maintain a consolidated list of all lost/broken tools broken from CTKs, kits, or
equipment on an AF Form 3126, General Purpose (8 1/2 x 11 on E pubs) labeled Lost/Removed
Tools and Equipment Log. The title will have the equipment number the blocks will contain
nomenclature of tool removed, reason, date out, date replaced and the initials of the individual
that replaced the tool.
10.4.2.1.2. For on-equipment aircraft maintenance only: After verifying accountability of all
tools, equipment, Technical Orders (TO)s and/or items used to perform on-equipment
maintenance, document the AFTO Form 781A, by adding a tool and FOD check completed
statement in the corrective action block of all applicable maintenance discrepancies. The person
clearing the discrepancy symbol is verifying the tool and FOD check was accomplished.
10.4.2.1.3. Individuals returning a CTK, tool, or item will perform a visual inspection jointly
with the supervisor or CTK monitor to verify serviceability and condition, and to ensure there are
no missing tools or components. The user will remove all foreign objects from the CTK or
equipment and ensure item is dry before turn-in.
10.4.2.2. Scheduled inspections. At a minimum a quarterly inspection will be completed. If
TAS is not available document the inspection on an IMT Form 3126, Titled Inspection Log. The
following information is required: tool kit number, due date, completion date, inspector’s
signature and employee number. Transfer to TAS when available. When discrepancies are
discovered, correct serviceability and inventory problems prior to placing the item back into
service.
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_MCGUIREAFBSUP 16 DECEMBER 2009                                                  5


10.4.2.2.1. Secure sealing procedures of low-use tool (i.e. CTK’s packed in Mobility Conex, or
CTK’s not used for day to day maintenance) may have a tamper proof seal (i.e. lead seal, plastic
zip strip, etc.) placed on the toolbox after inspection. This method involves identifying the items
that ordinarily require counting during shift inventories, and sealing the items with a physical
indicator to speed inventory by avoiding unnecessary counting. Identify the item(s) in TAS as a
low-use tool, label the item with the signature of individual performing the tool count, date
counted and sealed, tool kit number or item number and next CTK annual inventory date. The
low-use sealed items are only required to be verified as present during daily shift inventories as
long as the seal is intact. The seal remains valid as long as the item is unused and the seal
remains secure, or until the next annual CTK inventory. Low use items will be identified on the
appropriate MIL.
10.4.2.3. When dispatched roll-away tool cabinets are used by more than one individual, use a
―multiple users‖ log or TAS to ensure accountability at all times. Each user will sign for each
tool used. When the user has completed using the tool, it will be returned to the CTK. The
individual who initially signed for the CTK will inventory and clear the ―multiple user‖ log or
TAS.
10.4.2.4. Tools, equipment, and kits maintained in a decentralized location will be locked and
secured when not in use. All items will be returned to the decentralized storage area and
inventoried at the beginning and end of each shift to ensure accountability and secured storage.
Tools, equipment, and kits maintained in a decentralized location will be reflected on the work
center’s MIL along with the decentralized location.
10.4.2.5. Equivalent forms may be substituted for forms identified in this instruction as long as
the data elements match the original forms. EXCEPTION: MXG Form 7, Lost Tool/Item
Report (Attachment 1), must be used.
10.4.4. Responsibilities and Procedures for Tools and Equipment Issued from the Contractor
Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS). The Boeing KC-10 COMBS maintains and
controls contractually required tools and equipment in accordance with the contract statement of
work.
10.4.4.1. COMBS maintained/issued equipment will be marked with the approved Boeing
identification code, i.e. KCMXXX-XX and does not require the nine-character worldwide
Equipment Identification Designator (EID). Any COMBS equipment stored in the 305/605
combined CTK will be marked with the nine-character EID in addition to the COMBS
identification number (KCMXXX-XX); this does not constitute double-etching. COMBS
equipment assigned to toolboxes will have the nine-character worldwide equipment
identification designator for the respective toolbox assigned.
10.4.4.2. Tools and equipment issued from COMBS to 305 and 514th Maintenance Group
(MXG) personnel are subject to the accountability requirements of this instruction while in the
possession of assigned personnel. Report lost or missing tools in accordance with this
instruction.
10.4.4.3. Return tools and equipment issued from COMBS upon job completion, when no
longer needed or no later than the end of the shift that it was issued. If job completion is
extended beyond the end of the shift, transfer custodial responsibility to the person who will be
responsible for the tools and/or equipment in accordance with this instruction. Notify COMBS

personnel when tools and equipment are required for long-term issue (i.e. Flying Crew Chief
(FCC) mission, maintenance recovery team, etc.) and provide an estimated return date.
10.4.4.4. The 605 AMXS/305 Maintenance Squadron (MXS) production supervisors will review
the GOLD status report available from COMBS to verify all COMBS equipment no longer
needed has been returned to COMBS. The GOLD report is available at anytime upon request.
10.4.4.5. I mmediately report and return to COMBS tools and equipment that are unserviceable,
damaged and/or have an expired calibration date.
