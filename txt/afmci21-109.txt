                           CAPITAL PURCHASES PROGRAM

Section 1A—Introduction

1.1. Purpose. Congress authorized the establishment of the Capital Purchases Program (CPP)
within the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF), now Defense Working Capital Fund
(DWCF), beginning in FY92. The program was devised to provide a responsive avenue for the
modernization of the Department of Defense (DoD) depot maintenance industrial base. The CPP
allows the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) to include capital depreciation in
customer sales rates as one means of financing the replacement of capital assets. This concept
places DMAG operations in a more business-like posture and allows business-like investments
for transforming depot maintenance, replacing unserviceable or technologically obsolete capital
assets, and providing for productivity enhancements and environmental improvements.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. The DMAG CPP is governed by DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9 and
   Volume 11B, Chapter 58. Where more recently revised references conflict with Volume
   11B, Chapter 58, the most recently revised references take precedence.
   1.2.2. CPP requirements are submitted in the capabilities based programming and budgeting
   format. The objective is to eliminate or reduce Secretary of the Air Force Financial
   Management & Budgeting (SAF/FMB) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
   Comptroller line item approval of the CPP budget or reprogramming submission, and allow
   greater flexibility by capability within the approved budget amount. This reduced oversight
   requires AFMC and the ALCs to be even more diligent in complying with all CPP regulatory
   and accountability requirements.
       1.2.2.1. CPP requirements must be planned, programmed, managed, obligated, executed,
       and reported in one of the following six (6) categories: Weapon System Sustainment
       (WSS), Test and Inspection Equipment, Minor Construction (MC), Automated Data
       Processing Equipment (ADPE) and Telecommunications Equipment, Software
       Development, or Depot Maintenance Transformation (DMT).
          1.2.2.1.1. Weapon System Sustainment Equipment. This category includes new and
          replacement equipment purchases, rehabilitation of existing equipment, and
          modification of existing equipment not designed for test and inspection. See Chapter
          2 for detailed guidance on depot maintenance equipment.
          1.2.2.1.2. Test & Inspection Equipment.         This category includes new and
          replacement equipment purchases, rehabilitation of existing equipment, and
          modification of existing equipment specifically designed for performance of test and
          inspection on depot maintenance workloads.
          1.2.2.1.3. Minor Construction (MC). New facility construction or alteration of
          existing facility up to $750,000 and meeting the definition of MC as provided in AFI
          32-1032, Ch 3, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance,
6                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


           Repair, and Construction Projects.         MC includes replacement, productivity,
           environmental or new mission projects.
           1.2.2.1.4. Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) and Telecommunications
           Equipment. This category consists of computer hardware, operating system software
           (including utility and communications software), and telecommunications equipment.
           ADPE and telecommunications equipment projects include replacement, productivity,
           environmental, or new mission.
           1.2.2.1.5. Software Development. This category includes the actual development
           and acquisition of the information system (both in-house (organic) and contractor
           support). This category does not include software developed for a customer for use in
           a weapon system. For additional guidance on software, see DoD FMR 7000.14-R
           Volume 2B, Chapter 9.
           1.2.2.1.6. Depot Maintenance Transformation (DMT). This category is formerly
           known as the $150M Program and is defined as a process that shapes the changing
           nature of depot maintenance through new combinations of concepts, capabilities,
           people and organizations that optimize existing capabilities. This program ends after
           FY09.
    1.2.3. All projects comprising a given capability must be defined within only one of the six
    general capital investment categories (See para. 1.2.2.1.). In addition, each CPP requirement
    whether ―singular‖ in nature (i.e., a project comprised of a lone capital asset) or grouped as
    ―capability-based‖ (i.e., a project comprised of multiple capital assets) must include a 9a
    (Capital Investment Summary), 9b (Capital Purchases Justification), and be certified by an
    Economic Analysis (EA) or Cost Analysis (CA) as an individual line-item entity. If a CPP
    project has multiple items that all fall into the capital investment category and they are used
    for the same capability, then separate EAs for each item is not required. Business Case
    Analyses (BCA) submitted for depot maintenance transformation projects will be reviewed
    and certified on a case-by-case basis. See para. 4.3 for additional guidance.
    1.2.4. CPP has an investment threshold of $250,000 per OSD Comptroller guidance DoD
    FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, 060103A1, D, with the exception of MC which has
    an investment threshold of $100,000. This program covers investments at or above the CPP
    threshold with a useful life of two years or more that are made in support of DMAG activities
    for the six capital investment categories (para. 1.2.2.1). See para. 2.2.1 regarding
    investments that meet the CPP threshold and para. 2.2.2 regarding investments that do not
    meet the CPP threshold.
    1.2.5. Because of capabilities based programming and budgeting, OSD requires strong
    justification to approve carryover of capital authority.
1.3. Methodology. Each Center will develop and maintain a local operating instruction that
integrates all activities of CPP and that charters the Capital Purchases Program Working Group
(CPPWG). All DMAG activities have the authority and responsibility for budgeting and funding
capital investments through the DWCF CPP. Each Center is charged with managing DMAG
capital assets acquired via sources both within and outside the DWCF. The CPP encompasses
five fundamental phases: strategic planning (para. 1.5), requirements development (para. 1.6),
budgeting (para. 1.7), execution (para. 1.8), and results measurement (para. 1.9). Processes for
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                         7


each phase ensure capital investments meet installation, Major Command (MAJCOM), Air
Force, and DoD needs, and generate revenue for reinvestment in the DMAG. The CPPWG is
central to the effective conduct of all five phases of the program.
1.4. Communications . All transmittals and other official communications requiring review,
acknowledgement or approval of official CPP activities (e.g., tables of labor rates, discount
factors, or EAs, 9a’s (summary of CPP requirements in DoD FMR format), 9b’s (focused
narrative justifying investment and impact if not funded), Savings to Investment Ratios (SIRs),
paybacks, etc.,) shall be posted at the Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) CPP Community of
Practice (CoP) at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-CP-
P0, hereafter referred to as the CPP CoP.

Section 1B—Policy

1.5. Strategic Planning . This phase will ensure all infrastructure investments, as mandated by
Public Law No. 109-364, Subtitle D, Section 332(a), Minimum Capital Investment for Certain
Depots, are focused on resolving capability gaps or achieving returns on investment in
accordance with Air Force strategy. The depot maintenance strategy ensures AF depots are
provided with the state of the art, environmentally compliant, efficiently configured, and
properly equipped facilities to support existing depot maintenance workload and new weapon
system technologies.
   1.5.1. Public Law No. 109-364, Subtitle D, Section 332(a) requires a minimum 6%
   investment in the capital budgets of the Air Force depots. Infrastructure investments are
   defined in terms of the DMAG capability that is to be satisfied, all actions that must occur to
   accommodate the requirement and the costs and benefits that result from requirement
   capitalization.
       1.5.1.1. Interim guidance provided from HAF (Headquarters, Air Force)/A4/7P states the
       following:
          1.5.1.1.1. The required 6% investment will be calculated by existing Congressional
          language contained within DoD FMR 7000.14-R ,Volume 2B, Chapter 9, and/or the
          Annual Operating Budget. After calculation, HQ AFMC will release the current year
          numbers to the ALCs.
          1.5.1.1.2. The categories included in the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF)
          Depot Maintenance 6 percent investment are:           Capital Purchases Program,
          Maintenance and Repair (M&R), Depot Maintenance Transformation (DMT),
          Military Construction (MILCON), and depot stand-up equipment (procurement, 3010
          dollars).
   1.5.2. AF Depot Maintenance Strategies include implementation of Lean Thinking and Air
   Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21). The AF is utilizing these new
   processes and partnerships to drive down costs. Using these strategies will posture depots for
   further improvements and reinforce the ability to sustain three viable AF depots with state-
   of-the-art technology, and continue to transform our organic depots into ―world class‖
   maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations. This strategy will cascade down to the
   Wings, Groups, Squadrons, and appropriate levels. The CPPWG will develop a five-year
8                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


    plan (current year, budget year, one out year, and a projected requirements list for two
    additional years) that identifies equipment and minor construction requirements.
    1.5.3. AF continues to recognize the need to maintain robust public and private sector’s
    maintenance capabilities. As a result, partnering with private sector to ensure access to
    complementary or dual depot maintenance capabilities is an integral element of the AF depot
    strategy. It allows the AF to simultaneously support aging weapons systems laden with
    obsolete hardware and software problems while integrating support for new and advanced
    technology weapon systems entering the inventory (See para 2.5.1.2 for additional
    information).
1.6. Requirements Development. DMAG investment requirements may initiate from a variety
of drivers including new mission, replacement, productivity, and/or environmental interests. It is
critical that CPP requirements be thoroughly defined, validated, documented, and coordinated
among all interested parties prior to submitting for budget consideration.
    1.6.1. Each proposed acquisition of a capital asset shall be reviewed to ensure satisfaction of
    the following criteria:
       1.6.1.1. It is more economically feasible to purchase rather than to lease the capital asset.
       While leasing is not a part of CPP, it may be appropriate for areas of fast-changing
       technology or when work loads are expected to cease before the end of the program or
       payback period.
       1.6.1.2. The acquisition of a capital asset meets the Air Force’s long-range planning and
       programming objectives and results in satisfying a documented need for capability to
       perform valid operations, functions, or services that cannot be performed as effectively or
       economically by the use of existing equipment and facilities or by contract..
       1.6.1.3. The acquisition of a capital asset complies with policies and regulations
       governing the acquisition and management of facilities, special tooling, and special test
       equipment as established by DoD Directive 4275.5, ―Acquisition and Management of
       Industrial Resources,‖ as well as other applicable policies and regulations governing the
       lease and acquisition of equipment and facilities.
       1.6.1.4. Capital assets recommended for acquisition shall be those deemed to most
       efficiently and effectively accomplish the objective for which they are justified. The
       criteria are: improved efficiency (savings) or effectiveness; required new capability and
       capacity that cannot be met with current equipment and facilities; replacement of unsafe
       (locally determined by an authorized safety representative), beyond economical repair, or
       inoperative and unusable assets; and environmental, hazardous waste reduction, or
       regulatory agency (state, local, or Federal) mandated requirements.
    1.6.2. Control Symbol Number (CSN) Generation Guideline. The CSN is a unique six digit
    alphanumeric project identifier. The CSN associates a specific project to the owning Air
    Logistics Center (ALC), initial year of budget, assigned capability, Maintenance Group
    (MXG), and project sequence.
       1.6.2.1. The ALC CPP Manager is responsible for generating, tracking, and ensuring
       configuration control. Additionally, the ALC CPP Manager is responsible for outlining
       how they utilize the last three ALC discrete positions.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                       9


       1.6.2.2. The following table contains the CSN structure:

       1.6.2.3. ALC Codes: OC-ALC = "H"; OO-ALC = "G"; and WR-ALC = "L".
       1.6.2.4. Capability Codes: WSS = "W‖; Test = "T"; ADPE = "A"; SW = "S"; and MC =
       "M". Transformation projects will code to their respective capability.
   1.6.3. A pre-investment cost analysis (CA) shall be used for projects under $1M. An
   economic analysis (EA) shall be prepared to justify capital investment projects of $1M or
   more. The EA shall be prepared on a net present value (NPV) basis and shall comply with
   applicable DoD or Agency guidance as well as functional program guidance. (See Chapter
   4, Economics, Benefits, and Simulation Analysis, for additional information on preparation of
   CA/EAs).
   1.6.4. Requirement submissions and justification should be documented on a Fund 9b,
   Capital Purchases Justification. This exhibit provides detailed cost data and narrative
   justification for each project submitted in the budget year. The cost data justifying the
   project must match the current project dollar amount. Therefore, this exhibit may require
   continued adjustments until the project is fully obligated.
1.7. Budgeting. The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) DMAG CPP management office in
HQ AFMC/A4DM (Modernization and Investments Branch) with coordination from HQ
AFMC/FMRD (Depot Maintenance Financials) issues annual capability budget calls. Budget
submittals are prepared by the Center via local CPPWG processes to justify CPP requirements.
The Center CPP manager forwards MXW/CC-approved (Logistics Board (LB) Tier 2
representative) prioritized budget submissions to HQ AFMC/A4DM for corporate budget
consolidation, capability target establishment, and submission as part of the Air Force DMAG
budget. HQ AFMC/A4 reviews the CPP budget baseline as part of the corporate six percent
minimum capital investment tracking.
   1.7.1. ALC wing budget office prepares DMAG CPP budget submissions according to DoD
   FMR 7000.14-R, this instruction, and HQ AFMC budget guidance. Any requirement that is
   not sufficiently justified or is not completely, accurately and consistently represented in a
   Center budget submittal will be removed from the Command budget submittal.
10                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     1.7.2. Each Center submits a prioritized CPP budget not to exceed the annual depreciation
     that will be recovered by that Center during the budget year, less the ALCs allotted share of
     Command initiatives funded by CPP. Each ALC (not including 309 Aerospace Maintenance
     & Reclamation Group {309 AMARG}) will equally share the annual budgetary requirement
     of HQ AFMC or Air Staff managed capital investments. The ALCs will justify the annual
     programming submission by populating the depreciation spreadsheet, to be provided with the
     annual data call. (See para. 2.5 for a complete discussion of depreciation). Each Center will
     also program for capital authority for expending funds that are a result of substantiated depot
     efficiencies acquired within Expeditionary Logistics, 21st Century (eLog21) targets.
     1.7.3. Budget year requirements that exceed a particular Center’s depreciation basis may be
     identified as separate Program Objective Memorandum (POM) initiatives or disconnects for
     that year, but will be included in the CPP budget. AFMC POM guidance (separate from this
     instruction) delineates the process for such actions.
     1.7.4. Each Center will also submit a future year’s priority plan that identifies each out year
     requirement that is not a part of the current budget submission. HQ AFMC/A4DM will
     provide the template under separate cover during the budget call.
     1.7.5. Due to past history of untimely obligation rates, ALCs will be provided the ―authority
     to advertise‖ in the year prior to execution so an advanced start in the procurement cycle can
     be enabled. Goals for obligation are established by SAF/FMR at 50 percent by the end of the
     2nd fiscal quarter, 80 percent by the end of the 3rd fiscal quarter, and 100 percent by the end
     of the FY execution. Current contracting timelines severely inhibit our ability to meet these
     obligation goals through normal contracting processes.
        1.7.5.1. This authority to advertise allows completion of all necessary contracting actions
        prior to release of funds for the next fiscal year. This does not provide authority to
        obligate.    Obligation will occur once funds authorization is released by HQ
        AFMC/FMRD.
1.8. Execution. The CPP execution process entails obligation and execution of DWCF
authority to acquire DMAG capital assets according to a capabilities based Annual Operating
Budget (AOB). OSD issues the DMAG CPP AOB based on Congressional approval of the
President’s Budget and the ALCs execute DWCF authority according to the AOB.
     1.8.1. Annual Operating Budget (AOB). HQ AFMC typically receives notification of the
     OSD approved AOB from SAF/FMB in the early part of the first quarter of a budget year.
     The AOB is reviewed by HQ AFMC staff and compared to the consolidated budget submittal
     previously approved by LB Tier 2 (See para. 1.7). HQ AFMC then notifies the ALCs of the
     AOB and works with Air Staff and OSD for acceptable resolution of any discrepancies.
     1.8.2. Funds Distribution. HQ AFMC/A4DM validates all documentation for sufficiency
     and coordination, and ensures Economic Analyses (EA) have appropriate certification before
     authorizing HQ AFMC/FMRD to issue funding authority in accordance with the Annual
     Operating Budget (AOB). Once the sufficiency validation of 9b and/or certification of EA
     are met, HQ AFMC/A4DM will release funds no later than 15 October of the current fiscal
     year, or within 5 working days of the review. Funding authority will be distributed to the
     ALCs via funding advices posted to the HQ AFMC/FMRD Capital Purchases Program (CPP)
     Community of Practice (CoP) (See para. 1.4). After this posting, Center CPP managers will
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                   11


  notify the Capital Purchases Program Working Group (CPPWG) of the requirement
  approval. Execution of CPP funding authority must adhere to the capability approved. Any
  deviation without prior approval from HQ AFMC/A4DM, or higher, is subject to
  consequences of the Anti-Deficiency Act and other public law as appropriate.
  1.8.3. Obligation of CPP Funding Authority. ALCs are responsible to ensure 100 percent
  obligation during the first year of execution. A funding document is considered ―committed‖
  upon certification. Obligations are documents that bind government dollars for a specific
  requirement. Examples of obligation documents include, but are not limited to, contracts,
  internal obligation letters, and acceptance to a CAT I Military Interdepartmental Purchase
  Request (MIPR). CAT II MIPRs bind upon contract award. Commitments and obligations
  are posted to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) accounting system as
  they occur for each requirement. Following are the required steps that will ensure timely
  obligation of CPP funding authority:
     1.8.3.1. Not later than mid-June prior to the execution year, the project engineers will
     begin preparation of acquisition documents to support pre-planning meetings. Examples
     of acquisition documents include, but are not limited to, Market Research, Statement of
     Work (SOW), Appendix C-Industrial Safety Requirements, Justification & Approval
     (J&A), Performance Work Statement (PWS), and Performance Plan (PP).
     1.8.3.2. Beginning 1 August prior to execution year, CPPWG will conduct pre-planning
     meetings with Center PK and/or the procuring organization for each CPP project to
     identify additional documents and clarify applicable contracting guidance prior to
     acquisition. Center CPP managers will provide status of PK pre-planning review
     beginning the 5th working day of August prior to year of execution, and continue
     providing status every 30 days thereafter until review of all CPP projects have been
     reviewed. HQ AFMC/A4DM will report this status to the Tier 3 Logistics Board (LB).
     1.8.3.3. Center CPP managers are required to submit an execution year spend plan for
     each requirement no later than 31 August in accordance with format provided by HQ
     AFMC/A4DM. Spend plans are based on HQ AFMC/PK milestones provided in Figure
     1.8 (See Below). Obligation reports will be provided by Center CPP managers as
     directed by HQ AFMC/A4DM (format will be provided at the beginning of each fiscal
     year (FY) no later than the 5th working day of each month indicating obligation status).
     HQ AFMC/A4DM will report this status to the Tier 3 LB. The reporting frequency may
     increase during the fourth quarter. Beginning 1 July, any un-obligated funding authority
     will be reported to the Tier 2 LB and will be subject to realignment/reprogramming to
     other Tier 2 LB approved CPP requirements. HQ AFMC/A4DM recognizes that timely
     obligations are dependent upon 1st quarter FY funds release, and will thus advocate on
     behalf of the Center if obligations are affected by untimely funds release.
12                                                               AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


Figure 1.8. Requirement Timeline Matrix.




     1.8.4. Reprogramming. The ALCs will execute their program according to the approved
     distributed funding authority, without approved exception. ALCs should make every effort
     to minimize or eliminate the need for reprogramming actions. CPP capabilities-based
     categories are described in para. 1.2.2.1; however, the AOB guidance has precedence over
     the category distinction. Under capabilities-based programming and budgeting, the ALCs
     have the discretion to reprogram their requirements within the approved capability budget
     amount. HQ AFMC/A4DM will review and approve all cross-capability reprogramming
     requests on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with guidance provided by the
     execution year AOB. Current guidance limits reprogramming dollars at the Command level
     to an aggregated year total of $2M across all six categories. Reprogramming total above
     $2M must be approved by the Director of revolving Funds, SAF/FMB. If reprogramming
     becomes necessary, the following guidelines are applicable:
        1.8.4.1. Reprogramming within Capability. Under capabilities-based programming and
        budgeting, the Center has the discretion to reprogram their requirements within an
        approved capability; described as an internal transfer. Each Center will submit a Funds
        Realignment Request (FRR) electronically to notify HQ AFMC/A4DM of any internal
        transfers within the same capability. Notification will include the adjusted 9b(s) and a
        Memorandum for Record (MR) in order to justify why the requirement is needed in lieu
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                      13


      of the original. ALCs have 30 days to complete any Cost Analysis (CA)/EA associated
      with the project. Any revisions to supporting documentation, such as 9b(s), CA/EAs or
      MRs, will be posted to the CoP/Teamcenter.
      1.8.4.2. Reprogramming across Capabilities. When requesting the reprogramming of
      funds across capabilities, a 9b/MR/FRR is to be submitted to HQ AFMC/A4DM. This
      documentation, at a minimum, will identify the following: capability category, CSN,
      project title, dollar amounts, and a brief justification for the new and previous
      requirement. Documentation revisions supporting reprogramming action, such as 9b(s),
      CA/EAs (See para. 4.3.4) or MRs, will be posted to the CoP/Teamcenter. HQ
      AFMC/A4DM will review and approve all cross-capability reprogramming requests, on a
      case-by-case basis considering functional need, mission impacts, and priorities;
      sufficiency of all required documentation; and ensuring the Command reprogramming
      threshold is not breached. Upon approval, HQ AFMC/A4DM submits the finalized
      request to HQ AFMC/FMRD. HQ AFMC/FMRD will provide validation of the finalized
      request against funding advices and financial policy.         Upon validation, HQ
      AFMC/FMRD will adjust funding advices within three working days of HQ
      AFMC/A4DM’s MR receipt.
          1.8.4.2.1. Reprogramming above Command Threshold. During HQ AFMC/A4DM’s
          sufficiency review (See para. 1.8.4.2), if a request exceeds the Command
          reprogramming threshold (a total yearly dollar amount of $2M across all capabilities),
          the following actions occur:
              1.8.4.2.1.1. HQ AFMC/A4DM notifies the submitting Center that their
              reprogramming request is on hold pending any additional SAF/FMBMR
              justification requirements.
              1.8.4.2.1.2. If the action in para. 1.8.4.2.1 results in the $2M reprogramming
              threshold breach, HQ AFMC/A4DM, working in conjunction with the submitting
              ALC, will develop the additional documentation, if required, justifying the
              reprogramming action. This justification package will be submitted, through HQ
              AFMC/FMRD, to SAF/FMBMR requesting reprogramming approval. HQ
              AFMC and the requesting Center must wait for an approval from SAF before
              reprogramming any funds from one capability to another.
              1.8.4.2.1.3. If the total dollar amount for reprogramming across the six
              capabilities is greater than $3M in a fiscal year, OSD is the approval authority.
   1.8.5. Carryover. ALCs are expected to achieve 100 percent obligation of distributed
   funding authority within the year of execution as stated in para. 1.8.3. Upon determining the
   Center’s inability to meet the 100 percent obligation standard, the Center CPP Manager is
   required to notify HQ AFMC/A4DM in writing not later than the end of the third fiscal
   quarter. Because of capabilities-based programming and budgeting, OSD requires strong
   justification to approve carryover of capital authority.
1.9. Results Measurement.
   1.9.1. Strategic Investment Measurement. All investments will support achievement of the
   mandated 6 percent investment (See para. 1.5). HQ AFMC will track (through metrics)
   ALCs obligations and expenses, as applicable. Projects will be managed to obligate during
14                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     the fiscal year of funding; execute to cost, schedule, and performance to attain full
     operational capability (FOC); both for current and past years.
     1.9.2. Cost and Benefit Reporting (CBR). AFMC is required to report projected and actual
     savings of each DMT project/business unit to Air Staff annually on 1 May and 1 November.
     The Cost and Benefit Reporting (CBR) tool is the means to document all project/actual cost
     and benefit data (tangible and intangible) of each DMT project. The CBR tool shall be
     loaded/updated with projected and actual savings in accordance with the CBR tool business
     rules, ―Cost and Benefit Reporting Tool Business Rules‖, and in accordance with the CBR
     tool guidance located in the $150 Million Projects Reporting & Tracking CoP (See para.
     4.4.1.2). See para. 4.4 for additional guidance.
     1.9.3. Inventory/Asset Management. To enable results measurement, each Center will
     maintain accurate records of all capital assets either procured through the DWCF or
     contributed to DMAG organizations via non-DWCF sources. Full accounting of all DMAG
     capital assets ensures realistic projections of depreciation costs accrued and enables full
     recapitalization of installed DMAG industrial base.
1.10. Prior Year Capital Obligation Authority .
     1.10.1. For prior year increases, requests are to be forwarded to HQ AFMC/A4DM using the
     HQ AFMC/FMRD template (See AFMCI 65-101).
     1.10.2. If sufficient funds are available in the capital program for the prior fiscal year, then
     the requesting ALC will:
        1.10.2.1. Identify a project that is eligible for de-obligation. The de-obligation and the
        re-obligation must occur in the same fiscal year and within the same program year.
        Otherwise, see para. 1.10.3
        1.10.2.2. Prior year within-scope increases of less than $100K can be adjusted
        automatically.
        1.10.2.3. Prior year within-scope increases of more than $100K must have SAF/FMB
        approval.
        1.10.2.4. The requesting Center shall ensure contract award and obligation of funding is
        accomplished by the end of the fiscal year in which the request was approved.
     1.10.3. If no sufficient prior year funds are identified, requests must go through the AOB
     Approval Process; request and justification to use current year capital authority to finance the
     prior year increases.
        1.10.3.1. Requires SAF approval.
        1.10.3.2. SAF issues a new prior year AOB increasing budget line of capability.
        1.10.3.3. SAF issues a new current year AOB decreasing budget line of capability.
        1.10.3.4. The requesting Center shall ensure contract award and obligation of funding is
        accomplished by the end of the fiscal year in which the request was approved.

                         DEPOT MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT

Section 2A—Introduction

2.1. Purpose. Adequate support equipment is one of the most important requirements in the
capability to perform depot maintenance. Each depot maintenance activity is responsible for
reviewing and satisfying equipment needs on a continuing basis and for providing economical
depot maintenance support to operational activities while minimizing ownership of industrial
equipment. The proper management of depot equipment within maintenance activities requires
adequate policy to ensure accurate identification of requirements, visibility of inventory, and
proper documentation.
2.2. Scope. To ensure depot maintenance activities are able to adequately sustain DMAG
industrial base and infrastructure, two distinct investment categories are defined as follows:
   2.2.1. PACER UPHOLD (Code 279). This category is a subset of CPP. It includes new
   purchases with an acquisition cost of $250,000 or more and a useful life of 2 years or more;
   equipment rehabilitations or modifications costing $250,000 or more and extending the
   useful life 2 years or more. These investments are capitalized and depreciated over the useful
   life/new useful life.
       2.2.1.1. Qualifying Equipment. Listed below are examples of equipment items that
       qualify under this category. ALCs should purchase commercial off-the-shelf equipment
       to the extent possible.
          2.2.1.1.1. Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE).
          2.2.1.1.2. Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) Equipment.
          2.2.1.1.3. ADPE Hardware (NOTE: As the AFMC CIO, AFMC/A6/7 will approve
          ADPE hardware purchases. The AFMC CIO is accountable for technology purchases
          in AFMC).
          2.2.1.1.4. Automated Test Systems (ATS), including Automated Test Equipment
          (ATE), operating software, Test Program Sets (TPSs), Unit Under Test (UUT) TPSs,
          and Interface Test Adapters (ITAs)..
          2.2.1.1.5. Initial Outfitting Equipment (IOE).
          2.2.1.1.6. Initial lay-in of weapon system support equipment (peculiar and common)
          required for existing weapon systems, unless provided through appropriated accounts.
          (See para. 2.4.1) Reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9.
          2.2.1.1.7. Technical equipment in support of an MC project. Project planning and
          design costs associated with MC projects are considered a capital investment cost that
          is capitalized by the DWCF activity and financed in the MC portion of the capital
          budget. Planning and design costs are not included as part of the statutory threshold
          for MC projects. The amount of planning and design funds should be separately
          indentified individual projects in the BES.
          2.2.1.1.8. Mechanized Material Handling System (MMHS).
18                                                                 AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


            2.2.1.1.9. Standard test equipment.
            2.2.1.1.10. Portable office buildings defined as equipment (See AFI 32-1032,
            Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and
            Construction Projects, AFI 65-601, and AFI 32-1021, Planning and programming
            Military Construction (MILCON) Projects). Buildings acquired as equipment must
            be for a transient use (normally 3-5 years) or interim to a permanent MILCON
            project. These buildings must be approved by AFMC/A6/7. There are exceptions for
            ―portable buildings moved intact‖ – small one person/two person offices that can be
            moved with a forklift. These can be bought as equipment with local approval. (MC
            or M&R funds are used for requirements utilizing permanent space, which is a real
            property requirement. If the requirement does not add to the footprint and/or volume
            of the building, then it is M&R; the only exception is for installation of new HVAC,
            which is MC).
            2.2.1.1.11. Other Plant Equipment (OPE).
        2.2.1.2. Non-qualifying Equipment. Listed below are examples of equipment items that
        do not qualify under this category.
            2.2.1.2.1. Passenger and recreational vehicles.
            2.2.1.2.2. Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE).
            2.2.1.2.3. Initial lay-in of weapon system support equipment (peculiar/unique) for
            newly introduced weapon systems.
            2.2.1.2.4. Portable office buildings defined as a permanent structure (See AFI 32-
            1032, and AFI 65-601).
            2.2.1.2.5. ATS software and equipment to prototype, test, and integrate a form, fit,
            and function replacement for obsolete D041 components, where the ATS software
            and equipment is not being changed.
            2.2.1.2.6. Software maintenance on TPSs, where the ATS is not being changed.
     2.2.2. PACER EXPENSE (Code 670). This category is not a subset of CPP. It includes
     equipment projects costing less than $250,000 which are not capitalized or depreciated.
     Typically this includes low-cost equipment. However, items purchased to repair a next
     higher assembly, regardless of cost, can be included. Also, any rehabilitation or modification
     project which does not qualify for PACER UPHOLD can be included. However, OSD
     memo, 24 Sep 07, directed that PP&E DWCF activities between $100,000 and $250,000 will
     be capitalized (See para. 2.5.10 for additional information).
2.3. Methodology. The CPP provides all depot maintenance working capital funded
organizations with a method for budgeting and funding equipment needs. Projects funded in the
PACER UPHOLD will be capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Projects
funded in the PACER EXPENSE (Non-CPP) will be recovered through the sales rate charged to
the customer on a one-time basis.

Section 2B—Policy

2.4. Funding.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                       19


   2.4.1. Appropriated accounts financing new weapon system acquisitions will fund all depot
   capital equipment (peculiar and common) requirements in support of newly introduced
   weapon systems. All other depot capital equipment will be financed with the DWCF. The
   following examples are provided as possible funding scenarios that may occur in day-to-day
   activities:
      2.4.1.1. Depot capital equipment in support of weapon systems currently in production
      should be funded by the procurement accounts (e.g., BP10 for aircraft, BP20 for missiles,
      etc.). In the case of a weapon system spanning several years of production (e.g., F-22),
      the determinant should be whether the depot equipment is supporting a model/block
      currently in production. For example, depot equipment to support a block of F-22s,
      which are currently in production, should be funded with appropriated funds, specifically
      BP10. Whereas depot equipment that support a block of F-22s, which are currently out
      of production, should not be funded with appropriated funds. Specifically, BP10 should
      no longer be used to fund depot capital equipment. Only DMAG depot equipment may
      be funded through CPP funds. CPP cannot legally fund equipment for appropriated
      activities.
      2.4.1.2. All depot equipment, which cannot be funded with appropriated funds, may be
      funded with CPP capital equipment funds upon approval of the AFMC CPP Office of
      Primary Responsibility (OPR). All capital assets for use by businesses within the fund
      are financed through the DWCF. The Capital Budget shall not be used to establish a new
      capability or to expand organic capability except as specifically approved in the budget.
      CPP will fund these acquisitions with the expressed exception as defined per DoD FMR
      7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9, 090103D.
   2.4.2. Equipment financed by a DMAG within the DWCF will be issued only to organic
   depot maintenance activities. The use of equipment is at the discretion of the activity to the
   extent that, full cost recovery is ensured through depreciation and rate structure, so that
   equipment recapitalization may occur.
   2.4.3. In cases where projects are co-used by non-DMAG activities appropriate cost sharing
   will occur. A memorandum of agreement/service level agreement should be established if
   the use of DMAG resources is on a continuous basis. Payment for equipment use shall be for
   actual cost (depreciation, maintenance, repair and administrative costs). Payment can be in
   cash (treated as a refund) or an in-kind exchange (reduce base operating support payments).
   CPP funding execution authority does not apply to non-DMAG interests.
2.5. Depreciation.
   2.5.1. All DMAG capital assets (regardless of the initial capitalization source) are
   depreciated over their useful life. Depreciation measures how much of a given resource is
   consumed in a single year and is part of the total cost of producing an output. The planned
   yearly depreciation expense is recovered through the sales rates charged to the customer,
   thereby recovering the total asset cost over the useful life.
      2.5.1.1. Contributed Assets. ALCs will recover the depreciation remaining on
      contributed assets at the time it was contributed, through the assets remaining life.
      Reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R Volume 11B, Chapter 2, 020406A for an explanation of
      contributed assets.
20                                                                AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


        2.5.1.2. Public-private partnerships (PPP). PPP are agreements between organic depot
        maintenance activities and private industry or other entities to perform work and/or to
        utilize facility and equipment. PPP remains a key Air Force depot maintenance
        sustainment strategy and a preferred method under prime contracts to leverage the best
        capabilities of both sectors. Assets acquired through public-private partnerships are not
        depreciable unless the government obtains title of each asset. Partnerships improve
        utilization of DoD facilities, equipment and personnel and enhance support to warfighter.
        Conditions for the sale of goods and services to non-DoD entities must be based on
        specific statutory authority (See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, V2B, Ch 9, 090105 for additional
        guidance). Funding for organic depot maintenance activation is normally distributed by
        the system Program Manager (PM) directly to the Air Logistics Center.
            2.5.1.2.1. To execute its approved acquisition strategy, the PM ―programs‖ for 3010
            BP19 funds for organic depot activation, further defined as non-recurring expenses.
            These funds, in turn, can be added to the prime contract as a task order (TO)/contract
            line item number (CLIN) to activate a given workload at an ALC. PPPs are
            developed by creating written agreements known as Partnering Agreements between
            the parties, and to this point have encompassed all recurring expense activities
            required for performance of depot maintenance requirements, or for the use of
            existing facilities and equipment. Implementation Agreements (IA) are a subset of
            the Partnering Agreement and have thus far further defined the recurring activities.
               2.5.1.2.1.1. The prime contract and Partnering Agreement must identify organic
               depot maintenance activation activities as agreed upon by the stakeholders.
               2.5.1.2.1.2. The IA must identify the nonrecurring expense activities and
               specifically reference the prime contract TO/CLIN, and any contract
               modifications thereof, for all 3010 BP19 organic activation. The partnering
               entities are responsible for tracking and reporting.
               2.5.1.2.1.3. The Center will accept the cash as a budgetary resource and assume
               ownership of the modified portion of the equipment. The Center will also track
               the cost of the modification, funded with operational authority, as an equipment
               transfer in without reimbursement and separately depreciate the basic equipment
               and the upgraded portion. The transactions are: Dr Equipment (USSGL 1750)
               (for the cost of the upgrade upon completion); Cr USSGL 5720 – Transfer in
               Without Reimbursement.
     2.5.2. Methodology. Accurate accounting is critical to ensure depreciation is captured for
     financing recapitalization. Equipment labeling is a key component of accountability;
     therefore, ensure each piece of CPP equipment is labeled with its National Stock Number,
     assigned serial number, and Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL)
     document number, in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. All DMAG
     equipment will be accounted for by the ALCs in the Defense Industrial Financial
     Management System (DIFMS) and Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS).
     DIFMS is the financial reporting system that captures and depreciates replacement, upgrade,
     or modification costs to capital equipment for Program and Budget Review (PRW)
     submissions. DIFMS is also used as a means to capture rates recovery. AFEMS is the
     accountability system and is the source for asset reconciliation with custodian
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                      21


  authorizations/custody receipt listings (See AFI 23-110, V2, P2, Ch 22, para. 22.5.2309).
  AMARG will use a local inventory/accounting system and follow the same policies and
  procedures as the ALCs, to the maximum extent possible.
     2.5.2.1. Each Center will appoint a DIFMS Management OPR who will be responsible
     for setting up specific internal controls and to provide guidance and oversight. Internal
     controls should include, but are not limited to, the approval process for input of new
     equipment to DIFMS, error control procedures, the approval process for equipment
     deletions and adjustments, inventories and reconciliations. In addition, the DIFMS OPR
     is responsible for assigning file maintenance responsibilities, to include providing the
     Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) with any documentation they require
     when adjustments are made to the DIFMS data.
     2.5.2.2. Equipment custodians who manage capital equipment will complete CFO CBT:
     https://online.afit.edu/msg. Certificate will be maintained in applicable master CA/CRL
     jacket file.
     2.5.2.3. In DIFMS, a Custom Accountability Report (CAR) has been created to provide
     the custodian account code (Cust-A) that provides the location and the name of the
     directorate that owns each piece of equipment.
     2.5.2.4. Apply straight-line depreciation based on capitalized amount less residual value,
     including installation costs. Working Capital Fund (WCF) will use the following
     depreciation schedule (Reference: DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, P60205).
         2.5.2.4.1. Facilities Construction Projects (including minor construction) – 20 years.
         2.5.2.4.2. Equipment, other than ADPE – 10 years.
         2.5.2.4.3. ADPE and Telecommunications – <5 years, 5 years, or 10 years,
         depending on the actual estimated useful life as used in the acquisition justification.
         2.5.2.4.4. Software – 5 years.
     2.5.2.5. For the budgeting phase of CPP, the ALCs will justify annual programming
     submissions by populating the depreciation spreadsheet template. Headquarters Air
     Force Materiel Command/Depot Modernization and Environmental Branch (HQ
     AFMC/A4DM) will provide the template under separate cover during the budget call.
  2.5.3. Depreciation Spreadsheet Step by Step. The ALCs will use the following steps to
  populate the depreciation template, using data derived from DIFMS.
     2.5.3.1. For existing assets, start with the On Line Report Viewing (OLRV) 7310-501
     spreadsheet version.
         2.5.3.1.1. Sort by Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Delete all assets with zero RUL.
         2.5.3.1.2. Open the spreadsheet; cut and paste from 501 report into the appropriate
         column, and sort by Account Code (AC) under the appropriate headings. The
         spreadsheet will calculate monthly depreciation.
            2.5.3.1.2.1. Put AC 46, 56 on In Use Automated Data Processing System
            (ADPS).
            2.5.3.1.2.2. Put AC 43 on In Use ADPE.
22                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


               2.5.3.1.2.3. Put AC 14, 24 on In Use Equipment.
               2.5.3.1.2.4. Put AC on 22, 28, 62, 68 In Use Bldg.
               2.5.3.1.2.5. Subtotal by Responsibility Center Cost Center (RCCC).
        2.5.3.2. For the Future Tab, start with OLRV 7310-512 and update accordingly to reflect
        the CPPWG records for planned full operational capability and beneficial occupancy for
        assets/projects currently on contract, and contributed assets from inter-service
        agreements.
           2.5.3.2.1. Sort by AC. Under appropriate headings, put in depreciation start date.
           Spreadsheet will calculate monthly depreciation.
           2.5.3.2.2. Add assets for next three FYs not on 7310-512 report and insert the
           depreciation start date.
           2.5.3.2.3. Add known contributed assets and insert the depreciation start date.
           Subtotal by RCCC.
        2.5.3.3. Spreadsheet formula will populate Summary Tab.
        2.5.3.4. MILCON is only captured for the IF4 report; exclude this total for CPP
        depreciation projection.
     2.5.4. RUL Determination.
        2.5.4.1. Guidance. DOD 7000.14-R Volume 11B, Chapter 58 is used as the guideline for
        depreciation for all capitalized assets. Assets with an operational date prior to 1 October
        1991 will be depreciated using DIFMS, but will use the original estimated useful life of
        those assets.
           2.5.4.1.1. For assets purchased prior to 1 October 1993, the threshold acquisition cost
           is greater than or equal to $15,000.
           2.5.4.1.2. For assets purchased between 1 October 1993 and 30 September 1994, the
           threshold acquisition cost is greater than or equal to $25,000.
           2.5.4.1.3. For assets purchased between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1995, the
           threshold acquisition cost is greater than or equal to $50,000.
           2.5.4.1.4. For assets purchased after 30 September 1995, the threshold acquisition
           cost is greater than or equal to $100,000.
           2.5.4.1.5. For assets purchased after 4 April 2007, the threshold acquisition cost is
           $250,000, except for minor construction which remains at $100,000. Accounting
           threshold is $20,000 for both construction and non-construction.
        2.5.4.2. Full Operational Capability (FOC). Depreciation shall commence in the month
        the asset is installed and available for use. ―Available for use‖ is defined as the process
        engineer certifying the asset is functionally acceptable from the contractor. The CPPWG
        must justify why assets are not certified after being on-site greater than 90 days and will
        provide a monthly update to HQ AFMC/A4DM until certification. For assets that are
        owned ("14" and ―24" coded, see para. 2.5.11.1.1. for ACs) by DMAG activities,
        depreciation expense will be included as a funded expense to the DWCF. Assets on loan
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                          23


     to depot maintenance activities (―84‖ code), but owned by a non-DMAG activity, will be
     on file in DIFMS. Such assets will be reported in the DMAG general ledger as a
     memorandum entry for unfunded depreciation. The associated depreciation will be
     funded by the owning command.
  2.5.5. Depreciation of Software Enhancements. The acquisition cost of enhancements to
  existing internal use software (and modules thereof) shall be capitalized when such costs
  exceed the DoD capitalization threshold, and when it is more likely than not that such
  enhancements will result in significant additional capabilities. For example, if existing
  software is modified for making ad hoc queries, the cost shall be capitalized if it exceeds the
  capitalization threshold. The cost of routine or minor changes or modernizations that do not
  significantly add functionality shall be expensed.
  2.5.6. Depreciation of Software Impairment. If the software is no longer expected to provide
  substantive service potential and will be removed from service, or a significant reduction
  occurs in the capabilities, functions or uses of the software (or a module thereof), Reference
  DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter 6, 060209.I.
  2.5.7. Depreciation of Hardware CPP Projects. Hardware (ADPE) (e.g., infrastructure,
  cables, electrical power installation) will be depreciated by the amount spent at each Center
  and should begin in the month following the date the ADPE is installed and operational
  (regardless of whether it is actually used). Reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4,
  Chapter 6, 060209.A.
  2.5.8. Depreciation of Contributed Software. Depreciation for contributed software assets
  (Code 26) will be shared equally among benefiting ALCs. However, if 309 AMARG
  implements the software with one or more ALCs, the depreciation distribution shall be
  determined by HQ AFMC.
  2.5.9. Improvements and Upgrades of Existing Capital Assets. The cost to improve an asset
  shall be capitalized when the improvement increases the capacity, size, efficiency, or useful
  life. In addition, the cost of an improvement shall be capitalized only when it equals or
  exceeds the DoD capitalization threshold (See para. DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4,
  Chapter 6, 060103.A.1.d), regardless of funding source. Improvements shall be depreciated
  over the standard recovery periods (See para. 2.5.2.4).
  2.5.10. The depreciation of software data systems will rotate among the three ALCs. Once
  costs have been compiled for each Center, cost that fall short of the $100,000 depreciation
  threshold will be expensed; costs between $100,000 and $250,000 will be depreciated. It
  must be noted the CPP acquisition threshold is $250,000; however, the accounting threshold
  for depreciation is $100,000. (Reference AFMCI 65-101 for further information on
  depreciation of expensed dollars deemed "Capital Assets"). Depreciation should begin at
  each Center separately starting in the month after final acceptance testing of the software data
  system has been successfully completed or when the system begins to be used. Normally
  costs incurred after the final acceptance testing has been completed shall be expensed. When
  the software data system is to be installed at multiple sites, capitalization should cease at each
  site after testing is complete or the system begins to be used at that site. Software is typically
  implemented in phases, the capitalization will cease upon the acceptance of each phase for a
  site and depreciation will commence. Reference DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter
  6, 060209.J.2. The software will be depreciated in accordance with DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
24                                                                 AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     Volume 4, Chapter 6. Amortization is for intangible assets. Add reference to AFMCI 65-
     101 for further information on depreciation of expensed $$ deemed "Capital Assets".
     2.5.11. DIFMS Accounting.
        2.5.11.1. The Shop and the Customer Account field in DIFMS reflects ownership.
        Ownership of an asset can be transferred from the purchasing organization to the
        organization that will use the asset. However, the organization with current ownership of
        the asset has the responsibility to ensure that the asset is properly recorded in their
        inventory/accounting system including that required for depreciation. The Account Code
        (AC) is the field which determines the type of asset, (for example 14 and 24 is equipment
        while 26 and 46 is ADPE software). For this reason, it is critical that the AC entered in
        DIFMS accurately reflect true type of asset. DIFMS monitors (also referred to as DIFMS
        custodians) and/or CPP Managers will ensure that asset records accurately reflect type of
        asset. Listed below are the definitions of each AC category:
           2.5.11.1.1. Account Code (AC). The AC consists of a two-digit numeric data
           element. The first digit represents the Fixed Asset Type. The second digit represents
           the Fixed Asset Class. The code values are as follows.
               2.5.11.1.1.1. Fixed Asset Type (first digit):
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.1. 1 = Purchased.
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.2. 2 = Contributed.
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.3. 4 = Software, ADPE Systems Central Design Activity (CDA).
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.4. 5 = Software, ADPE Systems (In-House).
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.5. 6 = Minor Construction ($100K or more up to $750K).
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.6. 7 = Minor Construction (Not used).
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.7. 8 = Sponsor Owned.
                   2.5.11.1.1.1.8. 9 = Sponsor Owned, Not in Use.
               2.5.11.1.1.2. Fixed Asset Class (second digit):
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.1. 1 = Land.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.2. 2 = Buildings.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.3. 3 = Plant Equipment.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.4. 4 = Production Equipment.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.5. 5 = Other.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.6. 6 = Software.
                   2.5.11.1.1.2.7. 8 = Other Structures and Facilities.
               2.5.11.1.1.3. The following are examples of account codes in DIFMS:
                   2.5.11.1.1.3.1. 22 = Contributed (non-DWCF funded) building.
                   2.5.11.1.1.3.2. 62 = Minor construction (DWCF funded) building.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                         25


                 2.5.11.1.1.3.3. 14 = Purchased production equipment. To be used for DMAG
                 owned equipment items purchased with DMAG funds (i.e., Asset
                 Capitalization Program (ACP), CPP, etc.).
                 2.5.11.1.1.3.4. 24 = Contributed production equipment. To be used for
                 DMAG owned equipment items purchased with non-DMAG funds.
                 Equipment contributed to the DMAG for the life of the workload from the Air
                 Force Program Managers (PMs)/System Program Directors (SPDs) must be
                 recorded as a "24" item. Contributed assets must be timely installed and
                 available for use to recover any depreciation remaining on the contributed
                 asset. If depreciation for contributed assets is not included in the rates, then a
                 capital surcharge is required to generate cash for replacement equipment. Per
                 para. 2.5.4.2, depreciation shall commence in the month the asset is installed
                 and available for use. ―Available for use‖ is defined as the process engineer
                 certifying the asset is functionally acceptable from the contractor. The
                 CPPWG must justify why assets are not certified after being on-site greater
                 than 90 days and will provide a monthly update to HQ AFMC/A4DM until
                 certification.
                 2.5.11.1.1.3.5. 84 = Sponsor owned production equipment in use. To be used
                 for non-DMAG owned equipment items in use within a DMAG activity (i.e.,
                 loaned equipment). Interservicing and Partnership situations represent the
                 best example of instances where equipment may be provided to the DMAG on
                 loan. Sponsor owned items used by DMAG activities must have, on file, an
                 agreement between the DMAG activity and the owning activity that defines
                 the responsibilities of both parties concerning the use of the equipment item
                 (i.e., maintenance agreement, replacement responsibility, return rights/return
                 date specified, disposal instructions, other). This agreement should be in
                 place prior to receipt of the asset. Capital equipment items purchased with
                 appropriated dollars, including Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), by
                 activities outside the Air Force DMAG (e.g., Navy, Army, and Contractor) is
                 recorded as a Sponsor owned item if meeting the above conditions. The
                 Army, Navy or Contractor retains ownership and records depreciation for the
                 assets during the term of the loan.
                 2.5.11.1.1.3.6. 94 = Sponsor owned production equipment not in use.
                 2.5.11.1.1.3.7. 46 = Software and ADPE developed by others.
                 2.5.11.1.1.3.8. 56 = Software and ADPE developed ―in-house.‖
2.6. Equipment Authorization .
   2.6.1. Equipment purchased through the DWCF for the DMAG does not require prior
   Allowance Standard (AS) approval before requisition. This deviation from the normal Air
   Force supply and procurement process was granted to prevent delays in the acquisition and
   delivery of needed depot equipment. Complete equipment requisition packages must be
   prepared and processed according to AFMAN 23-110. The package must include needed
   ordering data and the AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, must be annotated to identify
   PACER UPHOLD/279 funding.
26                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     2.6.2. For equipment authorized in the AS, submit the AF Form 601 package with the AS
     number annotated to the appropriate supply activity.
     2.6.3. For equipment not authorized in AS, the following must be accomplished:
        2.6.3.1. The AF Form 601 will be annotated in the appropriate block to indicate the
        desired AS, part and section. The block labeled justification and item description must
        contain the end item application, and identification of workload being supported.
        2.6.3.2. For non-stock listed equipment, a DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item
        Requisition System Document, will be prepared and attached to the AF Form 601. The
        DD Form 1348-6 must be accompanied by a military, federal, or adopted industrial
        specification or standard, or preferably, a manufacture's brochure containing part number
        specifically identifying the required item.
        2.6.3.3. All base level approvals/coordinations required by AFMAN 23-110, applicable
        AS preface, local operating instructions, etc., will be obtained prior to verification by the
        designated product group. The product group is responsible for validating all equipment
        requirement documentation, regardless of cost. This validation ensures that the
        appropriate project code (i.e., PACER UPHOLD, PACER EXPENSE, etc.) is included
        on the AF Form 601. After validation, the request will be submitted to the appropriate
        supply activity for initiating an update to the applicable AS.
2.7. Cost Accounting Systems.
     2.7.1. Local operating instructions will identify processes and responsibilities for reconciling
     and updating the organic Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) cost accounting
     systems, the Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) and the Air Force
     Management System (AFEMS). All DMAG capital asset equipment managers, custodians,
     LRS and FMRD fixes asset cost accounting personnel must comply. At a minimum, the
     following categories will be addressed within the local instruction.
     2.7.2. Process flow and responsibilities for updating AFEMS & DIFMS when equipment
     greater than $100 thousand is purchased outside of LRS via a contractor, contributed to
     DMAG by another entity or transferred in from another entity and:
        2.7.2.1. Will posses Full Operational Capability (FOC) within 90 days.
        2.7.2.2. Will not possess Full Operational Capability (FOC) within 90 days.
        2.7.2.3. Process flow and responsibilities for updating AFEMS & DIFMS when
        equipment greater than $100,000 is purchased from the Standard Base Supply System
        (SBSS) via LRS.
        2.7.2.4. Process flow and responsibilities for all account record changes or transfers.
        2.7.2.5. Process flow and responsibilities for updating AFEMS and DIFMS with
        information when equipment is turned in.
        2.7.2.6. Process flow and responsibilities for inputting modification costs into AFEMS
        and DIFMS.
        2.7.2.7. Process flow and responsibilities for cyclical system reconciliations. Cyclical
        length determined locally but not to exceed one year's length.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                            27


2.8. Project Folders. Local operating instructions will identify responsibility for project folder
(also referred to as equipment folder) creation, maintenance and prescribed mandatory review.
All equipment capital assets (purchased or contributed) must be supported with a project folder
and properly entered into the DIFMS and AFEMS data bases. For reference, Equipment
Monitors (EMs) are DMAG personnel who transmit the appropriate forms to the individual
responsible for input into DIFMS Financial Accounting (FA) system and Equipment Custodians
(ECs) are the AF persons who coordinate with equipment management element (EME) to input
the data into AFEMS. The owning organization has the primary responsibility for the project
folder’s accuracy throughout its useful life and will accomplish this through effective CPPWG
coordination and information sharing. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, Ch 22, para 22.33 for
DoD financial management reporting of capitalized assets. Newly purchased or contributed
assets can be supported with an electronic project folder, posted to the CPP CoP (See para. 1.4).
A mandatory review of the project folder must be accomplished at intervals not to exceed two
years to ensure folders contain the required documentation listed on the checklist (See Figure
2.1 below). There are two parts of the AFEMS system. First being the CA/CRL inventory
portion listing equipment (which reflects market value and not necessarily acquisition costs) by
custodian and showing equipment under as well as over $100,000. Second part is the financial
portion, AFEMS CFO. At this time AFEMS CFO does not have the ability to track cost
modifications to equipment and is hard coded to depreciation exceeding 10 years. AFEMS CFO
excludes equipment values under $100,000 as shown on the CA/CRL. DIFMS FA System is
point in time reflecting capital assets under $100,000 purchased when threshold was under
$100,000 and depreciation years were more or less than 10 years according to equipment type.
There is currently no automated data system to reconcile data within DIFMS and AFEMS. Data
must be reconciled manually. EMs, in coordination with ECs/EME, is required to populate four
fields in DIFMS to assist with inventories and reconciliations between DIFMS and AFEMS.
The four fields consist of: (1) operation date, (2) national stock number (NSN), (3) serial
number (4) custodian account number. The EME/ECs, in coordination with EMs, are required to
populate six fields in AFEMS. Per AFI 23-110,V2, PT2, Ch 22, Equipment Management, para,
22.33.5.1, the mandatory inputs to AFEMS for capital assets are: 1) acquisition cost, 2)
acquisition date, 3) serial number, 4) fund designator and 5) unique identifier (part number &
cage code). If the investments result in multiple assets, a cross reference to each will be
maintained in the respective project folders. These folders will also contain supporting data used
to economically justify the project. The project folder will be retained locally until transfer, turn-
in, or disposal.
   2.8.1. Upon transfer of equipment, EM and EC will reconcile folder information. EMs will
   coordinate with ECs/and CPP Managers to ensure, as a minimum, values in DIFMS and
   AFMES match with regard to acquisition costs excluding modification cost and operational
   date.
   2.8.2. Upon any project folder review, the local operating instruction will identify
   responsibility and methodology for recreation of any missing item in the project folder.
   2.8.3. Notification of Center CPP Manager(s) shall occur prior to equipment transfer, turn-
   in, or disposal so that appropriate action can be taken to update DIFMS based on the status of
   the equipment. Minimum project folder contents are identified in Figure 2.1, Project Folder
   Checklist. A project folder checklist will be placed on the inside cover of each project folder.
   The checklist will be annotated to include the date of each change to the folder contents
28                                                               AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     and/or review that takes place. Items 1 through 9 of Figure 2.1 are mandatory for each
     equipment item. Depending on the situation, the requirements of either A, B, or C should be
     maintained in addition to items 1-9.

Figure 2.1. Project Folder Checklist.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                        29


2.9. Turn-in of Excess Equipment. The CPPWG will periodically screen their equipment for
underutilization. Equipment, which is no longer needed to support a valid workload or mission,
will be declared excess. Also, equipment being replaced will be tracked and declared excess
upon installation of the new equipment. All excess equipment will be physically turned in to
supply in accordance with AFMAN 23-110. Excess equipment will be removed from DIFMS
when Supply acknowledges receipt of proper turn-in documents.
   2.9.1. Before DMAG owned equipment is declared excess, the following must be
   accomplished in sequential order.
       2.9.1.1. Verification by the owning activity that the equipment is excess to their
       requirements.
       2.9.1.2. The other Center CPP managers will be contacted to determine if there is a
       requirement for the excess equipment at their ALCs.
       2.9.1.3. CPP managers within other services can be contacted for determining if they
       have a need for the equipment. If so, the other service will fund the removal and
       transportation costs. The un-depreciated amount of the equipment will be transferred to
       the other service’s DMAG.
   2.9.23. Notification of local Plant Management activity shall occur prior to equipment
   transfer, turn-in, or disposal so that the equipment can be removed from maintenance
   support, materiel support, and preventive maintenance planning requirements.
2.10. Equipment Installation.
   2.10.1. Purchased equipment that is to be installed and/or maintained by an in-house activity
   must become operational within 90 days after receipt. The CPPWG must justify any
   deviation monthly to HQ AFMC/A4DM until fully operational. Monitoring of installation is
   necessary to minimize potential adverse affects on the equipment itself or the equipment
   warranties and to minimize the loss of available use of this equipment. The in-house activity
   should be contacted prior to equipment arrival so that appropriate maintenance support,
   materiel support, and preventive maintenance planning can occur. Equipment to be installed
   and/or maintained by a contractor will be installed according to the applicable contract.
   2.10.2. Site preparation for the installation of equipment including costs such as direct
   foundation work (supporting concrete slab) and secondary utilities will be classified as
   equipment installation work, not MC.
   2.10.3. Installation costs shall be included in the total equipment project cost.
       2.10.3.1. If installation costs occur from a contributed asset and those costs meet the CPP
       accounting threshold, these installation costs (if material assets) can be capitalized.
       Examples of material assets: transformers, wiring, chillers, isolation pads, utilities,
       ventilation, cooling towers, wall for noise suppression, kerosene tank, amplifiers, air
       compressors. However, because AFEMS and DIFMS cannot handle sub-indentured
       assets, these occurrences will need to be handled as two separate assets: 1) the donated
       piece and 2) the installation piece in DIFMS.
   2.10.4. Equipment items, which are delivered and installed by contractors, must be received
   according to AFMAN 23-110.
30                                                                AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     2.10.5. See AFI 65-601,V1, 9.15.3 and 9.15.4. regarding installation or placing movable
     equipment into an existing facility.
2.11. Depot-Only ATS. Depot-only ATS includes ATE hardware, operating system software,
UUT, TPSs, and ITAs. Depot-only is defined as those systems residing only at the depots where
field activities do not have like systems. Operating system software and TPSs associated with a
DMAG ATS hardware investment will be planned, budgeted, and financed by the DMAG as a
part of the total investment. ATS projects should be planned to encompass all aspects of the
system that will be impacted including ATE hardware, operating software, TPSs, UUT software,
and ITAs, where applicable and prudent. ATS resident in both depot and field locations will
continue to be funded under existing guidelines and are not the responsibility of the DMAG.
     2.11.1. Funding.
        2.11.1.1. The cost of basic software (test executive, online or offline support software)
        and ATS self-test will be included in the acquisition cost of the ATS.
        2.11.1.2. The cost of application software, (to include TPSs) UUT, and software for
        ITAs that allows the new ATS to be effective and efficiently used will be financed by the
        DMAG and treated as an "other" cost in the EA.
        2.11.1.3. The cost of operational software and/or TPSs to update an existing ATS that is
        outdated and/or becoming unsupportable will be funded by the CPP capital equipment
        line if the cost is $250,000 or more.
        2.11.1.4. Engineering support activities that can be directly tied to a depot-only project
        should be financed by the CPP and included in the total project cost. In addition, this
        should be itemized in the EA/CA. If the engineering support activities, whatever they
        may be, cannot be tied to a specific CPP project it should be expensed to the DMAG,
        regardless of cost. Engineering support activity required for TPS changes, independent
        of an upgrade, will not be funded from the DMAG.
        2.11.1.5. Air Logistics ALCs must coordinate requirements development and funding
        submission with the ATS System Program Office at Warner Robins. HQ AFMC/A4DM
        will not authorize funding without the ATS System Program Office’s approval.
     2.11.2. Configuration Control. All ATS projects developed locally at a depot shall be
     coordinated and validated through the ATE program office. The ATE program office will
     address Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) elements and Operational Suitability, Safety and
     Effectiveness (OSS&E) requirements for the Command. Unless the ATE program office
     specifically grants local purchase authority, all ATS projects should be centrally procured
     through them. DMAG activities shall not modify or change configuration of ATS managed
     projects by the ATE program office without ATE program office coordination and validation
     (Reference: AFI 63-201, Automatic Test Systems and Equipment Acquisition Projects).
2.12. Mechanized Material Handling Systems (MMHS). The CPP will fund all MMHS used
and owned by DMAG activities. MMHS projects will be planned, programmed, and budgeted
like a normal equipment project. MMHS includes the composite methods, techniques, process
controllers, and equipment shelters required for handling materials in a proven mechanized
manner with a dedicated function. Examples of MMHS are wire or rail guided vehicles,

pneumatic tubes, other small part conveying systems, automatic storage and retrieval systems,
outdoor storage and retrieval systems, or any combination of the above.
2.13. Management of Computer Numerical Control (CNC)/Numerical Control (NC)
Equipment. This equipment is defined as any automated industrial plant equipment which
incorporates CNC or NC machine control technology for the manufacture, repair, and inspection
of end items. The users of such equipment at each Center are responsible for managing the
acquisition, operation, and maintenance of CNC/NC equipment subject to any applicable
provisions of this instruction and any local regulations.
   2.13.1. OO-ALC has the responsibility to maintain all current central processors and
   postprocessors being shared with other ALCs. This ongoing responsibility will exist as long
   as machines utilize the postprocessors centrally located at OO-ALC. ALCs must
   individually negotiate with OO-ALC for support on any additional future requirements above
   what is currently centrally located at OO-ALC.
   2.13.2. AFMC has adopted Binary Cutter Location (BCL) as a standard manufacturing
   language for CNC/NC machines. BCL specifies a particular binary format for NC data. All
   CNC/NC equipment purchases shall use BCL as the standard language unless a compelling
   reason can be justified and documented in the equipment project folder.
   2.13.3. CNC/NC equipment will be planned, programmed, budgeted, and economically
   justified like all equipment projects.
2.14. Technology Application/Insertion (A/I) Infrastructure. Technology A/I Infrastructure
projects are defined as those projects that apply existing proven technology that currently does
not exist within a depot to solve problems and improve performance of production processes.
Projects which require basic research or development of unproven technologies do not qualify
for CPP funding. If, however, a given technology currently exists and a requirement calls for
insertion of this proven technology into DWCF operations, the efforts necessary for introduction
into depot operations can be funded with CPP.
   2.14.1. Technology A/I Infrastructure projects will be planned, programmed, budgeted, and
   economically justified like all equipment projects.
   2.14.2. All technology A/I projects must be coordinated through the Center Technology
   Council (CTC) and AFMC/A6/7 prior to budget submission.
2.15. Environment, Safety and Health.
   2.15.1. Environmental impacts will be assessed in the acquisition and management of CPP
   equipment according to AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality.
   2.15.2. Consideration for safety and health will be a part of all equipment projects according
   to MIL STD 882D, Military Standard, Standard Practice For System Safety, AFI 91-202,
   USAF Mishap Prevention Program, Chapter 9, and AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and
   Environmental Safety, Fire Prevention and Health (AFOSH) Program. System safety
   analyses will be included in design requirements and applied as required by AFI 91-301. All
   facility and equipment contracts will comply with the applicable safety and health standards.
   Variances from such standards or any provision thereof are processed according to AFI 91-
   301. The workers, supervisors, and safety engineers will accomplish job safety analysis
   before the equipment becomes operational.

                               DEPOT FACILITY PROGRAM

Section 3A—Introduction

3.1. Purpose. The goal of DoD and AFMC is to right size ownership of industrial facilities
while ensuring essential defense production for both peacetime and wartime requirements. The
commander and/or director at each Center are responsible for reviewing the industrial complex.
This chapter covers the policies and responsibilities governing the replacement, modernization,
and new mission requirements for industrial facilities. This is accomplished through the
utilization of the MILCON, Minor Construction (MC), Maintenance & Repair (M&R),
Emergency Funds (P-341), and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Programs (See AFI 32-1021
and AFI 32-1032) for complete definitions of the MILCON, MC, M&R, P-341, and O&M
programs).
3.2. Scope. The depot facility program covers acquisition, construction, and use of property for
DMAG. It includes provisions for maintenance, repair, replacement, and modernization of
industrial facilities. The purpose of the program is to maintain an organic logistics plant that can
rapidly and effectively respond to the needs of current and programmed workloads and
mobilization efforts.
   3.2.1. It applies to all projects, including, but not limited to, those planned for
   accomplishment by organic forces (which include over-hires and temporary duty
   augmentees), troop labor, or contract (including Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineer
   Requirements {SABER}). This instruction addresses only O&M-funded unspecified minor
   military construction, facilities for operational requirements, and maintenance and repair
   projects for real property. These funds are normally in the 3400 appropriation (3740 for
   AFRC and 3840 for ANG), but may include 3600, Research, Development, Test and
   Evaluation (RDT&E); Working Capital Fund (WCF); or Defense SRM accounts when made
   available for O&M purposes. See AFI 32-1001, Operations Management, for guidance on
   functions at the installation level.
   3.2.2. Maintenance and repair are classes of work that are different from construction,
   whether O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction, MCA-funded unspecified
   minor military construction, or MILCON. Maintenance and repair do not change the nature
   of a facility, but simply ensure it can continue to be used effectively. Repair does not
   normally increase the volume or foot-print of a building, although it may result in greater
   usable floor space due to reconfiguration of the interior.
   3.2.3. Maintenance. Maintenance is work required to preserve real property and real
   property systems or components and prevent premature failure or wearing out of the same.
   Maintenance includes work to prevent and arrest component deterioration, as well as
   landscaping or planting work done in conjunction with a facility repair project, which is not
   capitalized.
   3.2.4. Repair. Repair means to restore real property and real property systems or components
   to such condition that they may effectively be used for their designated functional purposes.
34                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


     Real property and real property systems or components need not have failed to permit a
     repair project.
     3.2.5. Maintenance Funding. Maintenance is funded using O&M funds. There is no
     limitation on the amount of O&M funds that may be used for maintenance.
     3.2.6. Repair Funding. Repair of facilities or functional areas of multipurpose facilities,
     using O&M funds, is authorized by 10 U.S.C. §2811. There is no limitation on the amount of
     O&M funds that may be used for repair, but there are approval and notification requirements,
     depending upon the amount getting expensed.

Section 3B—Policy

3.3. Review of Industrial Facilities. According to AFMCI 21-105, Depot Maintenance Work
Measurement, the DMAG facilities shall be reviewed at least biannually. The purpose of the
review is to ensure facilities are operating at maximum economic efficiency to minimize cost,
increase productivity and utilization, and reduce the need for additional facilities. Industrial
facilities shall be modernized only after the completion of a review of the mission and workload
in support of current and programmed requirements. Under normal conditions, justification for
additional facilities is based on the workload of a single shift, 40 hours per week operation. High
cost facilities and equipment shall be based on a two-shift, (80-hour work) week if adequate
surge capability exists.
3.4. Disposal of Excess Facilities. Organizations shall screen their facilities for
underutilization. Depot Activities will work toward AF Footprint Reduction and Energy
reduction goals in making facility retention decisions. If no longer needed to support a valid
workload, they shall be declared excess as prescribed by AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real
Property, or analyze feasibility to lease out under 10USC 2474.
3.5. Environment, Safety and Health .
     3.5.1. Environmental impacts will be assessed in the acquisition and management of depot
     facilities according to AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality and 32 C.F.R. Part 989,
     Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
     3.5.2. Consideration for safety and health shall be a part of all facility projects according to
     MIL STD 882D, AFI 91-202, Chapter 9, and AFI 91-301. System safety analysis shall be
     included in design requirements as required by AFI 91-301. All facility contracts shall
     comply with applicable safety and health standards. Variations from such standards to any
     provision thereof shall be processed according to AFI 91-301.
3.6. Programming, Budgeting, and Finance.
     3.6.1. Depot Maintenance industrial facility MILCON, MC, P-341, O&M, or M&R projects
     shall be programmed, budgeted, controlled and entered into the Automated Civil Engineering
     Systems Program Management (ACES-PM) management information system subject to the
     rules set forth by AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032, Attachment 4.
     3.6.2. DMAG construction projects costing more than $100,000 and up to $750,000 are
     considered to be MC projects and are funded through the CPP. DMAG construction projects
     costing over $750,000 are funded through P-341 or MILCON programs, as appropriate.
     Facility M&R projects are funded through the DMAG business operations portion of the
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                       35

               ECONOMICS, BENEFITS, AND SIMULATION ANALYSIS

Section 4A—Introduction

4.1. Purpose. The decision for making capital equipment and facility investments is driven by
economic and mission factors. Economic Analysis (EA), Cost Analysis (CA), Benefits Analysis
(BA) and simulation modeling are methods used to assist the decision maker in determining and
evaluating proposed solutions to a defined problem, and in measuring its results. This chapter
provides policy and guidance for the justification of depot maintenance capital equipment and
depot maintenance MILCON projects. The objective is to provide the structure for better
decision making in the capital outlay of DoD resources directed towards the modernization of
AFMC depots.
4.2. Scope. This policy applies to all capital equipment projects funded through the CPP, all
depot maintenance MILCON programs, and all DMT projects as applicable. Additional
approval thresholds and authority may be required if the planned project falls under the
guidelines of HQ AFMC or AF/A4/7 portfolio management.

Section 4B—Policy

4.3. Economic Analysis (EA). EA is a systematic approach to the problem of making a rational
choice among competing alternatives. A good EA systematically examines alternatives and
reveals the present value of the monetary costs; benefits associated with all alternatives, and
provides an accurate picture of non-monetary costs and benefits.
   4.3.1. For all CPP investments, HQ AFMC/A4DM validates all EA documentation against
   the budget exhibit 9b for sufficiency and coordination before authorizing HQ AFMC/FMRD
   to issue funding authority in accordance with the AOB. Each EA must, at a minimum, match
   the companion 9b in accordance with the following criteria: non-recurring investment dollar
   values within 5%, Control Symbol Number (CSN), Project Title, and Project Description.
   A4DM will not authorize funding authority release for projects that do not meet the criteria.
   See para 1.8.2
   4.3.2. Equipment Methodology. General AF guidance for the preparation of an EA is
   contained in AFI 65-501. Specific guidance for proposed CPP funded equipment projects
   follows:
       4.3.2.1. Thresholds.
          4.3.2.1.1. For all projects costing $250,000 or more (except for minor construction
          projects costing $100,000 or more) but less than $1,000,000 (DoD FMR 7000.14-R,
          Vol2B, Ch 9, 090103, C, 10) the ALCs are required to complete a Cost Analysis
          (CA) or EA. This must be completed two months prior to the execution year or
          before approval of a reprogramming action. CA certification authority resides with
          the Center level Financial Management organization.
          4.3.2.1.2. For all projects costing $1,000,000 or more, an EA will be accomplished
          according to the standards and formats of AFMAN 65-506. EA certification
50                                                              AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


        authority resides at HQ AFMC/FMC. IOE in support of a MILCON project will be
        addressed in para. 4.3.3.6.
     4.3.2.2. Timing of Submittals. Completed EAs for projects costing $1,000,000 (total
     project cost) or more are required to be uploaded to the CPP CoP by the ALCs no less
     than two months prior to the execution year to allow for HQ AFMC/FMC review and
     certification (unless a waiver or exception is authorized in writing by HQ AFMC/FMP).
     HQ AFMC/FMC will complete this action through coordination with the ALCs, as
     applicable, not later than 30 September (unless a waiver or exception is authorized in
     writing by HQ AFMC/FMP). HQ AFMC/A4DM will report this status to the Tier 3 LB.
     4.3.2.3. Alternatives. Each EA must include a complete list of alternatives considered to
     meet the objective. All feasible alternatives identified in the preliminary EA must be
     costed and analyzed on a project basis where all life cycle costs and benefits are included
     in the analysis. All infeasible alternatives identified in the preliminary EA must be listed
     in the completed EA; however, life cycle costs and benefits will be excluded from the
     analysis. Status quo will always to be considered as an alternative (See AFMAN 65-506,
     para.1.3.3.).
     4.3.2.4. Format. The formats outlined in AFMAN 65-506, Attachment 8, are the
     suggested formats to utilize when performing EAs. Formats may be adapted to the
     information the analyst wants to include. Format A, Summary of Costs for Economic
     Analysis, ordinarily should be submitted for each feasible, costed alternative. Format A-
     1, Summary of Differential Costs for Economic Analysis, should express the differential
     cost between the recommended alternative and the status quo or upgraded baseline
     alternative. A Payback Period must be calculated and included in Format A-1.
     4.3.2.5. Comparison Criteria. Costs for all feasible alternatives evaluated in the EAs will
     be ranked in order to aid decision making. The discount factors available (See AFMAN
     65-506, Attachment 10) will be used to compute each alternative's net present value
     before comparing alternative costs to determine the recommended alternative.
     4.3.2.6. Criteria for Estimates. The simulation modeling process (optional) will generate
     data to support estimates and claims made in the EA. Validated modeling output is
     considered a good source for making estimates for critical cost and savings factors to be
     used in the EA; e.g., process cycle times, labor requirements, downtime, work-in-process,
     etc. At the very least, the modeling data must support and confirm estimates derived or
     obtained from any other source. Reference para. 4.5 of this instruction for more detailed
     guidance pertaining to optional simulation modeling. If modeling is not utilized the
     source and rationale behind all estimates must be documented.
     4.3.2.7. Economic Indicators. The SIR and payback period calculated in AFMAN 65-
     506, Format A-1, will be used to compare alternatives. A SIR greater than 1.0 and a
     payback period less than 10 years are considered to be economical. Normally, the
     alternative showing the best SIR and payback period is the alternative of choice.
     However, non-quantifiable factors can affect the selection process. Format D of AFMAN
     65-506, shall serve to summarize the ranking of alternatives and include the non-
     quantifiable benefits.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                       51


     4.3.2.8. CPP EA Certification Requirements. EAs performed for projects costing
     $1,000,000 or more must be certified by the base level Financial Management
     Directorate, and by the base level functional OPR IAW AFMAN 65-506, Attachment 4,
     prior to submittal for HQ AFMC/FMC (Cost Studies and Analysis Branch) approval.
     Certification by comptroller personnel attests to the proper use of economic principles in
     the analysis and to the adequacy of documentation such that the EA is a stand-alone
     document. Certification by functional personnel indicates that the assumptions,
     reasoning and cost-benefit assessments in the EA are consistent with their area of
     technical expertise. EAs shall be posted for disposition on the CPP CoP and HQ
     AFMC/FMC must certify the EA before funds release. EAs and/or CAs performed for
     projects costing less than $1,000,000 are certified and approved by the base level
     Financial Management Directorate, and by the base level functional OPR and posted to
     the CPP CoP.
  4.3.3. MILCON EA Methodology. General Air Force guidance for the preparation of EAs
  for MILCON projects, as with equipment, is contained in AFI 65-501. The guidance is
  standard regardless of type of program with a few exceptions. Specific guidance for
  proposed DMAG supported MILCONs is as follows:
     4.3.3.1. Thresholds. An EA shall be performed for all DMAG MILCON projects costing
     $2,000,000 or more. Projects based predominately on economic merit shall have an EA
     regardless of cost. AFI 65-501 contains additional conditions for accomplishment.
     Finally, when IOE in support of MILCON projects costs $750,000 or more, an EA is
     mandatory, regardless of the total MILCON cost. HQ AFMC/A4 may request an EA be
     performed at any time.
     4.3.3.2. Timing of Submittals. EAs (a component of the MILCON brochure covered in
     (para. 3.7.4.1.1) are due at the time of the Biennial MILCON program submittal. Refer
     to paragraph 3.7.2. Normally, this takes place two years ahead of the program year. EAs
     are due to HQ AFMC/FMC via the FMC CPP CoP at least two months prior to the
     MILCON BER.
     4.3.3.3. Alternatives. Requirements for identifying alternatives in MILCON EAs are
     similar to requirements for identifying alternatives in Equipment EAs (See para. 4.3.2.3).
     4.3.3.4. Format. The formats used for MILCON EAs are the same as formats used for
     Equipment EAs (See para. 4.3.2.4).
     4.3.3.5. Comparison Criteria. Comparison criteria are the same as that used for
     Equipment EAs (See para. 4.3.2.5).
     4.3.3.6. Initial Outfitting Equipment (IOE). IOE is the minimum new equipment, other
     than RPIE, required to provide basic capability in a new facility for the purpose it was
     intended. All IOE must be justified in the facility EA in order to determine the total cost
     of the project to the government. Identification of IOE shall be by line item in both the
     MILCON brochure and DD Form 1391c. When calculating the present value of IOE, the
     replacement of the IOE must be taken into account (every 10 years after the IOE begins
     operation or until the facility's useful life has been achieved). The total present value of
     IOE is the present value of the initial IOE purchase plus the present value of each
     replacement for an IOE item.
52                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


        4.3.3.7. Criteria for Estimates. For those projects submitted with simulations, the data
        shall be used to support estimates and claims made in the EA in a manner as explained in
        para. 4.3.2.6 For all projects, sources of estimates and all calculations must be clearly
        identified.
        4.3.3.8. Economic Indicators. Generally, alternatives are evaluated according to the
        economic indicators in para. 4.3.2.7
        4.3.3.9. Backup Information. AFI 65-501 contains guidelines for including backup
        information. All sources, estimates, and assumptions must be referenced with enough
        information provided to trace all calculations to their most basic inputs and all basic input
        and assumptions to its source.
        4.3.3.10. MILCON EA Certification Requirements. EAs must be certified by the base
        level comptroller and the base level functional OPR before upload to the MILCON CoP
        for HQ review. All DMAG MILCON EAs should be submitted as a part of the MILCON
        brochure to HQ AFMC/A4DM. HQ AFMC/A4DM will request a formal review by the
        HQ AFMC/FMC, who will issue a Certificate of Satisfactory EA upon certification.
     4.3.4. EA Updates/Revisions. All CPP funded equipment projects and DMAG sponsored
     MILCON projects requiring an EA must be reviewed yearly until contract award. Revised
     EAs shall be resubmitted and recertified according to the normal guidelines of this
     instruction. No contracts should be awarded for projects in a revision status. The following
     conditions warrant a revision:
        4.3.4.1. All CPP equipment, DMAG-sponsored MILCON or $150M depot maintenance
        transformation projects, that increase investment costs more than $1M over the original
        EA.
        4.3.4.2. An increase or decrease in workload of 10 percent or more.
        4.3.4.3. A decrease of projected savings of 15 percent or more.
        4.3.4.4. An investment increase of 15 percent or more.
     4.3.5. Waivers. Waivers to requirements for conducting an EA are specifically covered in
     AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 65-506. The Financial Management Directorate must concur with
     the base level functional office request for waiver. HQ AFMC/A4DM will evaluate the
     waiver request and will forward the request to HQ AFMC/FMC for concurrence. The
     ultimate approving authority is the OSD Comptroller.
4.4. Cost and Benefits Reporting (CBR).
     4.4.1. CBR is the means for AFMC to capture actual results data necessary to defend future
     infrastructure investment funding. CBR is required for each DMT project/business unit,
     including MILCON and program management type requirements funded with WCF
     operational authority. Using the original certified/business case analysis as a reference and
     considering fact of life changes, the CBR tool is a means to document all tangible (projected
     and actual) cost and benefit data and all intangible cost and benefit data for semi-annual and
     annual reporting to Air Staff. Each Center will complete this process for fifteen years, until
     the transformed process is no longer required, or the project has reached steady state in
     achievement of benefits. ALCs will report auditable data at the project level.
AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009                                                                      53


       4.4.1.1. This policy supersedes the DMT ($150M Program) two-year post investment
       analysis requirement.
       4.4.1.2. The tool and its accompanying detailed guidance can be accessed through the
       $150 Million Projects Reporting & Tracking CoP located at the following website:
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-MC-64.
       4.4.1.3. ALCs will maintain documentation for non-DMT projects should the Command
       require completion of a CBR tool.
       4.4.1.4. The CBR tool will serve as the AFI 65-601, V1 requirement that all capital items
       purchased with the intent to improve productivity or perform better must have a post
       investment analysis to evaluate results.
       4.4.1.5. Air Staff reports are due annually 1 May and 1 November. For all projects
       which have reached FOC, the CBR tool shall be updated with projected and actual
       savings in accordance with the CBR tool business rules, ―Cost and Benefit Reporting
       Tool Business Rules‖, and in accordance with the CBR tool guidance located in the
       $150M DMT Savings CoP (See para. 4.4.1.2).
   4.4.2. Waivers. AFMC/CC must approve a waiver from CBR for DMT projects and a
   deviation in the reporting format from that identified to Congress. If EA is waived, no
   information for CBR Tool is required.
4.5. Simulation Modeling (Optional). Computer simulation is the process of designing a
mathematical/logical model of a real system or process and experimenting with this model on a
computer. Simulation encompasses a model building process as well as the design and
implementation of an appropriate experiment involving that model.
   4.5.1. Purpose. Simulation models permit inferences to be drawn about processes without
   building, disturbing, or destroying them. New investment proposals are one of the most
   important management decisions. Mistakes in capital investments not only affect immediate
   cash flows, but also the operation of the business and future cash flows for years to come.
   Simulation is but another tool to aid in the decision making process, and when used in
   conjunction with an EA, adds credence to the selection of an alternative involving a capital
   investment.
   4.5.2. Equipment. All depot maintenance sponsored equipment projects proposed for CPP
   funding, or requiring partial CPP funding with a dollar value greater than or equal to
   $1,000,000 can be considered for simulation modeling. The simulation modeling and the EA
   should be accomplished concurrently to take advantage of the simulation data in deriving
   costs and benefits, assumptions, and estimates for the EA.
   4.5.3. Facilities (MILCON). All DMAG MILCON projects that require CPP funded IOE
   with a total cost of $750,000 or more can be considered for simulation modeling. The model
   should be detailed enough to support all IOE requirements and cover the scope of the
   proposed MILCON project. The simulation model and EA should be accomplished
   concurrently so that the simulation model can support the EA.
   4.5.4. Simulation Requirements.
       4.5.4.1. Output. The modeling process generates data to support claims made in the EA.
       A summary of the model formulation if completed may include all assumptions, all data
54                                                                  AFMCI21-109 18 MAY 2009


       inputs and sources, critical factors that were chosen for experimentation, all output
       reports, and a summary of the results as an attachment to the MILCON brochure.
       4.5.4.2. Summary Report. If a simulation is completed, the summary report includes
       throughput, inventory levels (including work-in-process) and operating costs for both the
       "As Is" and "To Be" processes. A narrative description of the simulation shall be
       included to summarize simulated findings and results.
       4.5.4.3. Training. It is each Center product group’s responsibility to train project
       engineers in the art of simulation modeling as needed. This includes any specific vendor
       training required to utilize a particular software program.
       4.5.4.4. Verification & Validation. A signature from a neutral (not having a direct stake
       in the project), process knowledgeable expert of the Center's choice will serve to certify
       that the models have been verified and validated by the Center. The AFMC Modeling
       and Simulation (M&S) Office, currently located within HQ AFMC/EN, is a Command
       resource that could assist with guidelines for ensuring that any models are successfully
       validated and verified. HQ AFMC/A4DM will review the simulation to check that the
       model has been verified and validated by the appropriate office.
