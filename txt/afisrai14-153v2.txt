                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides intelligence evaluators (IE) and examinees with procedures
and evaluation criteria used during knowledge and task phases of initial, periodic, and special
qualification evaluations. All evaluations will be conducted in accordance with (IAW) the
provisions of AFI 14-202 Volume 2, as supplemented and this instruction.
     1.1.1. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform
     required duties safely and effectively IAW applicable instructions and directives.
     1.1.2. Applicability. This volume applies to all individuals performing mission crew duties
     at AFDCGS ground sites.
1.2. Waivers. AFISRA/CC is the waiver authority for this publication, authority can be
delegated. Submit waivers through appropriate Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) channels
to AFISRA/A3V. Copies will be in message or memo format. Note: HQ AFRC and ANG unit
waivers will be coordinated with their respective A2 prior to submission to AFISRA.
1.3. Procedures.
     1.3.1. Prior to any qualification evaluation conducted by a qualified IE, the examinee must
     have completed all applicable training requirements as outlined in AFISRAI 14-153 Volume
     1, Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Intelligence Training.
     1.3.2. With the exception of the Formal Training Unit (FTU) and in-unit initial qualification
     (INIT QUAL) evaluations, IEs will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 of this
     volume and applicable checklists to conduct all intelligence evaluations. To ensure standard
     and objective evaluations, IEs will be familiar with the prescribed criteria.
     1.3.3. Prior to commencing the evaluation, the IE will brief the examinee on the evaluation
     conduct, purpose, requirements, and applicable criteria. The examinee will accomplish
     required planning in accordance with the duty position being evaluated.
     1.3.4. The IE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. The evaluation debrief
     will be accomplished as soon as practical after the end of the evaluation. This debrief will
     include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified), and any required additional training.
1.4. Grading Instructions.
     1.4.1. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 14-202 Volume 2, as
     supplemented and this instruction. The IE will compare examinee performance for each area
     accomplished during the evaluation with the standards provided and assign an appropriate
     grade for the area. The IE will derive the overall mission crew evaluation grade from the
     area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
     1.4.2. IEs will use the grading criteria IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and the AFISRA
     supplement to determine individual area grades. IE judgment must be exercised when the
     wording for general graded areas is subjective and when specific situations are not covered.
1.5. Instructor Specialized Qualification Evaluations.
AFISRAI14-153V2 15 MARCH 2013                                                                    5


   1.5.1. Instructor Evaluations. An Instructor receiving an area grade of unqualified (U) or
   qualified with discrepancies (Q-) with additional training in any area will result in an overall
   Q-3 for the specialized qualification evaluation.
   1.5.2. Crew Position Evaluations. An Instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with
   additional training in any “Grading Area” for a crew position(s) in which they are qualified
   to instruct, must not perform instructor or evaluator duties for that crew position until
   additional training is complete and/or restrictions have been resolved.
1.6. Examinations. Open and closed book written examinations are a requisite for mission
(MSN) evaluations. A closed book written examination is a requisite for the Instructor
specialized qualification evaluation. Note: For FTU Formal School Courses (Initial or
Requalification) see paragraph 2.2.1.1.1
   1.6.1. Open book examination. Open book examinations will consist of a minimum of 40
   questions with at least 20% and no more than 50% derived from tactical doctrine documents
   related to AF DCGS operations, e.g. Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
   (AFTTP). Questions for open book examinations will be derived from governing AFIs,
   command directives, operating manuals, and other authoritative guidance. Units will utilize
   AFISRA provided Question Data Bank (QDB) files for open book examinations when
   directed. Units may increase the number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of
   the examinee's knowledge.
   1.6.2. Closed book examination. Closed book examinations test general knowledge with a
   minimum of 40 written questions and include information that the crewmember may be
   required to recall from memory or possess a high level of familiarity (see paragraph 2.2.2).
   Closed book questions will be derived from AFISRA-approved Master Question Files
   (MQF). Units will utilize AFISRA provided Question Data Bank (QDB) files for closed
   book examinations when directed. Units may increase the number of questions to provide an
   in-depth evaluation of the examinee's knowledge.

                                            Chapter 2

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 14-202 Volume 2, the AFISRA
     supplement and Chapter 3 of this instruction. All periodic evaluations expire the last day of
     the 17th month following the month in which the task phase was successfully completed.
     2.1.2. Requisites and required areas for evaluations are shown in Tables 2.1 through 2.11
     (see paragraph 2.4.) Areas 1-11 are required for all crew positions and are annotated with an
     “R” in Table 2.2; additional required areas for specific crew positions are annotated with an
     “R” in Tables 2.3 through Table 2.11
        2.1.2.1. All required areas must be included in the mission crew evaluation. When it is
        impractical or impossible to accomplish a required evaluation area in a real-world setting
        or realistic environment in conjunction with local events, the IE may elect to evaluate the
        area(s) by an alternate method(s) (e.g., simulated, task scenario cards, etc.) in order to
        complete the evaluation. Document the reason and type of alternate method used in the
        [Comments] portion of the AF Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence Qualification IAW
        AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and the AFISRA supplement. If the IE determines that the
        required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will
        require an additional mission(s) to complete the evaluation.
2.2. Evaluations. Accomplish evaluations concurrently whenever practical. Each crewmember
will be evaluated at the frequency identified in AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and the AFISRA
supplement.
     2.2.1. Knowledge Evaluation. A knowledge evaluation will evaluate the examinee’s
     appropriate understanding of AF DCGS systems and capabilities, collection platform and
     sensor capabilities, crew positions responsibilities, DCGS architecture, emergency
     procedures, terms and definitions, report formats and timelines, CRITICs, NICKLEBACK,
     threat warning (TW), location-specific procedures, and Intelligence Personnel Training and
     Stan/Eval programs. Subject matter for open or closed book tests will be categorized IAW
     AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and AFISRA supplement.
     2.2.2. Task Evaluation. Units will use current evaluation materials derived from relevant
     intelligence, unit tasking and AOR specific information that incorporate all appropriate
     evaluation requirements. Evaluations may be conducted on AFISRA authorized simulations
     and shadow missions. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are not prohibited;
     however, units will apply operational risk management principles to the scheduling of the
     evaluation. Note: Real world contingencies may provide a unique opportunity to conduct an
     evaluation. However, factors beyond the control of the examinee and IE may preclude its
     successful completion. Units will utilize and conform to AFISRA/A3V directed baseline
     evaluation profiles when constructing unit evaluation profiles.
2.3. Evaluation Types.
     2.3.1. Qualification Evaluations (QUAL). Complete Initial Qualification (INIT QUAL)
     evaluations IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, as supplemented and Air Education and Training
AFISRAI14-153V2 15 MARCH 2013                                                                 7


   Command (AETC) Formal Training Unit (FTU) requirements. For in-unit INIT QUAL
   evaluations units are authorized to conduct the INIT QUAL evaluation concurrently with the
   crewmembers first initial MSN evaluation. Conduct evaluations using AETC FTU course
   developed QUAL evaluation criteria, or as directed by AFISRA/A3V, when AETC FTU
   course criteria is not available. Document the concurrent evaluations per AFISRA/A3V
   guidance.
       2.3.1.1. FTU Formal School Courses (Initial or Requalification) and FTU provided
       Qualification Training Packages (QTP).        Complete knowledge examinations as
       determined by the appropriate courseware or as identified in Table 2.1 when courseware
       examinations are not available. Document on the AF Form 4350 as type of exam
       followed by “(EOC)” or as directed by AFISRA supplement to AFI 14-202 Volume 2,
       date completed, and the appropriate score.
       2.3.1.2. Non-entry level crew positions will only require an INIT QUAL evaluation if the
       member has never been previously qualified in a AF DCGS mission position.
   2.3.2. Mission Qualification Evaluations (MSN). All crewmembers will successfully
   complete initial and periodic MSN. Complete evaluations IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, and
   the AFISRA supplement. MSN should be as realistic as possible with a minimum of
   simulated events and include the requisite open book, closed book, and task evaluation.
   2.3.3. Instructor Qualification Evaluation (INSTR). INSTR is a specialized qualification
   evaluation used to evaluate an individual’s ability to instruct others. All crewmembers
   maintaining instructor qualification must complete formal instructor training through the
   AFISRA-approved course IAW AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 1, have a successful instructor
   evaluation using criteria in Chapter 3 of this volume, and receive endorsement by the
   squadron commander in order to be designated as a qualified instructor.
       2.3.3.1. Conduct INSTR IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, the AFISRA supplement and
       Chapter 3 of this instruction. Individuals maintaining AF DCGS Instructor qualification
       must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional knowledge and capability
       in an AF DCGS crew position.          Initial and periodic instructional knowledge and
       capability may be evaluated on any AF DCGS crew position held by the individual.
       2.3.3.2. INSTR will include the requisite knowledge examination and a task evaluation.
       Document the INSTR requisite examination on an AF Form 4350 as “Closed Book”
       followed by “(INSTR)” or as directed by AFISRA supplement to AFI 14-202 Volume 2,
       date completed, and the appropriate score.
       2.3.3.3. Initial and Requalification INSTR. The emphasis of Initial (INIT) and
       Requalification (RQ) INSTR is instructor duties and abilities. These evaluations should
       be scheduled with a student requiring either Initial Qualification Training (IQT) or
       Mission Qualification Training (MQT). As a last resort, a qualified crewmember or the
       evaluator may act as the student. Note use of simulated student in the Comments section
       of the AF Form 4350 IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and the AFISRA supplement.
2.4. Evaluation Requirements. Table 2.1 identifies knowledge requisites for all crew
positions. General evaluation grading areas and task phase requirements are indentified in Table
2.2 and are required for all crew position evaluations. Tables 2.3 through 2.11 depict required

Critical Area—A critical area is a designated area that is absolutely necessary for the success of
the mission where failure to follow the strict requirements of instructions/regulations, safe
operations or conduct could compromise the mission.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure mission crews maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a given
event.
Debriefed Discrepancy—Remedial action taken by an intelligence evaluator to remedy a
discrepancy noted during an evaluation. This action is accomplished during debrief of the
evaluation wherein the intelligence evaluator provides briefing/instruction concerning the
discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
proficiency to remedy said discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated
with “Debriefed” in the Evaluator’s Remarks section of the AF Form 4350 Comments.
Debriefing—The process to convert mission information into intelligence for dissemination to
affected parties. The mission crewmember will extract relevant mission intelligence from the
pilot and sensor operator, ask amplifying questions relevant to the mission, identify time-
sensitive information and disseminate appropriately and expediently.

their specific squadron mission in an assigned position. This training is a prerequisite for CMR
or BMC status.
Proficiency—The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals derived
from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An individual is
considered proficient when he/she can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed,
accuracy, and safety.
Qualification Evaluation (QUAL)—An evaluation that certifies the basic qualification (BQ) of
the examinee. The QUAL is administered to ensure basic qualification in support to the MDS,
weapons system, function or activity, and duty position of the intelligence professional. The
designator for the qualification evaluation is “QUAL” as used with the AF Form 4350 and AF
Form 4349.
Requalification (RQ) Evaluation—An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6
months or a recheck following a failed evaluation.
Requisites—Requirements such as exams, academics, etc., that have to be accomplished before
