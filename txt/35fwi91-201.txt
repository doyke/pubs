     receive a login and password (in-process) or be archived (out-process).
     11.3. Supervisors will enter their subordinates 25 years of age and under, and any personnel partici-
     pating in high risk activities, into CARES as a case to determine their level of risk (this includes all
     motorcycle riders regardless of age). NOTE: Commanders may opt to have the C.A.R.E.S. represen-
     tative enter personnel into C.A.R.E.S. instead of having supervisors do it. In this event the C.A.R.E.S.
     representative is responsible to inform supervisors of the risk level of their respective subordinates.
     11.4. PCS’ing personnel.
        11.4.1. When supervisory personnel PCS/PCA they must have all cases under them switched to
        the new supervisor. The supervisor is then archived in C.A.R.E.S. .
        11.4.2. Non-supervisory personnel in C.A.R.E.S. as a “case” will be archived.
     11.5. PCA’ing personnel supervisor or “cases” will be archived and the C.A.R.E.S. representative will
     contact 35 FW/SEG to have the person moved to the gaining unit

        11.6.1. Tenant units wishing to use the PACAF C.A.R.E.S. system must contact 35 FW/SEG for
        access.

12. Confined Space Programs and Procedures
     12.1. Initial Workplace Survey and Evaluation of Confined Spaces
     12.2. All organizations will survey workplaces and facilities within their area of responsibility to
     identify potential confined spaces. Work centers will use 35 FW Form 125 to identify, inventory and
     describe confined spaces. 35 FW Form 125 (Test #1 Confined Space) is to identify the space and
     owner.
        12.2.1. If the survey and Test #1 indicate the unit does not have confined spaces, the unit com-
        mander will forward a memorandum indicating the negative results to 35 FW/SEG. 35 FW/SEG
        will provide a copy of this memo to BEE and Fire for their records. Commanders should be con-
        stantly vigilant for changes that may create a confined space. If a confined space is created or
        undergoes a change of conditions, additional testing and evaluation will be required.
     12.3. Classification of Confined Spaces. Newly identified confined spaces will be classified by BEE,
     Fire Department and SEG and documented on the 35FW Form 126 (Test #2 Permit-Required Con-
     fined Space) and 35FW Form 127 (Confined Spaces Classification)
     12.4. Procedures for Obtaining Permits
        12.4.1. Master Entry Permit (MEP) Procedures - Work-centers that require routine entry into per-
        mit required confined spaces may obtain an MEP. In order to receive an MEP, units must submit
35FWI91-201 8 AUGUST 2008                                                                             11


     their proposed MEP to the Wing Safety Office, Bldg 507 (This may be done electronically through
     email). The safety office will bring the plan to the CSPT for approval.
     12.4.2. All MEPs will expire on the last day of the month one year from the date of the final sig-
     nature (Example: a MEP signed on 15 Nov 07 would expire 30 Nov 08). Failure to obtain a new
     MEP prior to that day will require the unit submit an AF Form 1024 for each entry until the new
     MEP is received and approved.
     12.4.3. AF Form 1024, Confined Space Entry Permit Procedures - Personnel who do not routinely
     enter into permit required confined spaces, but are required to do so for specific duties, must sub-
     mit an AF Form 1024 to the CSPT for each entry. The Entry Supervisor will maintain a copy of the
     Entry Permit for one year.
     12.4.4. Welding Operations. Welding operations are not considered routine tasks, and can quickly
     change the atmosphere in a confined space. As a result, welding will not be permitted via MEP.
     When personnel desire to conduct welding operations in a confined space, they must complete
     both an AF Form 1024 and an AF Form 592, Welding Permit, for the confined space. During coor-
     dination of the AF Form 1024, BE will determine exposure monitoring requirements.
  12.5. Training
     12.5.1. All 35 FW personnel must receive Confined Space Awareness training. This may be con-
     ducted during the initial Job Safety Training (AF Form 55 training) each person receives upon ini-
     tial assignment to the unit. Awareness training must include the definition of permit-required and
     non-permit required confined spaces, potential hazards, and prohibitions on entry into confined
     spaces unless specifically training and authorized.
     12.5.2. Training for personnel conducting work in permit-required confined spaces will be docu-
     mented to show the specific position a worker is trained on (i.e. Entrant, Attendant, Entry Super-
     visor, Atmospheric Monitor, or Rescue). Supervisors will ensure the training is also updated in the
     Confined Space Database.
     12.5.3. For organizational rescue teams (specified in MEP), personnel must receive hands-on
     practice in rescue operations annually. All Lesson Plans will be submitted 35 CES/CEF, 35 FW/
     SEG, and 35 AMDS/SGPB for annual review.
  12.6. Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment
     12.6.1. Work-centers should maintain their own monitoring/testing equipment. However, if
     equipment is otherwise unavailable, BE can provide monitoring if coordinated in advance.
  12.7. Duration of Operations
     12.7.1. No confined space entry is allowed to exceed one, eight-hour shift.
     12.7.2. If the work inside the space is still ongoing at the end of the eight-hour period, the fire
     department must be notified that a new entry is starting.
     12.7.3. The new entry supervisor(s), attendant(s), and entrant(s) must be briefed on the conditions
     within the space and results of atmospheric testing or monitoring.
     12.7.4. The entry supervisor will call the base fire department at the beginning and end of all con-
     fined space entries.
12                                                                       35FWI91-201 8 AUGUST 2008

        flying deployments. The designated deployment flight safety representative will be a qualified
        flight safety officer (Wing Flight Safety Officer (WFSO), SFSO or ADFSO). Commanders will
        ensure 35 FW/SE is notified of who the designated deployment flight safety representative is prior
        to the deployment.
        13.1.5. For the purpose of providing potential board members on a mishap investigation, 35 FW/
        SE will maintain the PACAF distributed list of safety trained individuals and disseminate this list
        to the SFSOs whenever updated by PACAF. When applicable, the SFSOs will identify any safety
        trained individuals in their squadrons not on the PACAF list and forward their names and appro-
        priate information to 35 FW/SE. 35 FW/SE will forward all identified individuals to PACAF to
        ensure timely updating of the list.

17. Mishap Notification.
   17.1. Timely investigation of a mishap depends on prompt notification so perishable evidence can be
   preserved. Report all mishaps, incidents, and/or unusual occurrences to the safety office. The follow-
   ing mishap notification procedures apply:
   17.2. The command post will notify the safety office of any mishaps, incidents, or unusual
   safety-related occurrences. After normal duty hours, command post will notify the standby safety rep-
   resentative IAW the standby duty roster provided by 35 FW/SE.
   17.3. During deployments, the deployed FSO will inform the host safety office, if appropriate, as well
   as the 35 FW/SE, of any mishaps, incidents or unusual occurrences.

     their squadron/unit personnel on these procedures annually.

20. Mishap Data.
     20.1. Any request for mishap data will be made through the 35th Fighter Wing Flight Safety Office.

21. Weapons Safety
     21.1. The Weapons Safety Program Management (WSPM) Book. This book provides unit weapons
     safety personnel with a one-source continuity document for records retention. The book contains the
     Unit Weapons Safety program elements and the Weapons Safety Representative responsibilities. A
     neat, efficient, and functional book is an asset to the unit program and provides for a smooth transition
     between unit safety personnel. The WSPM can be maintained as a hard copy book or electronically.
     They should review the contents of the book periodically to eliminate outdated material. If retention
     of an item is questionable, ask Wing Weapons Safety for guidance. The WSPM book will be orga-
     nized with the following tabs, and contain the identified information:
        21.1.1. TAB A: Appointment Letters; Records of Weapons Safety Representative (WSR) Train-
        ing (conducted by Wing Weapons Safety); Documentation of Initial/Annual Explosive Safety
        Training (for all unit personnel that handle/transport munitions).
        21.1.2. TAB B: AF Form 2047, Explosive Facility license(s): Maintain a copy of all explosives
        facility license(s) in the WSPM book and post a copy of the license at each licensed explosive
        storage location. Make sure the license is current and accurate (Note: licenses expire 12 months
        after approval). The type and/or quantity of stored explosives cannot exceed what is on the license.
        21.1.3. TAB C: Operating Instructions/Checklists (maintain copy of 35 FW/SEW coordination).
        21.1.4. TAB D: Lesson Plan and Tests. Develop lesson plans for explosive/missile safety training.
        Individuals receiving explosive/missile safety training must take a closed book or Air Force
        approved computer-based test at the conclusion of initial and annual training session. Develop two
        “distinctively different” explosive/missile safety tests. All lesson plans and tests must be coordi-
        nated through the 35 FW/SEW prior to use and annually thereafter. Maintain the results of the test
        (by score) for all individuals who require testing. All missed questions must be reviewed and doc-
        umented.
        21.1.5. TAB E: Wing Weapons Safety Annual Inspection Report. Maintain the last two reports on
        file with corrective actions.
        21.1.6. TAB F: Spot Inspection Log. Maintain a record of monthly spot inspections (required one
        per month in each area where explosive operations are conducted).
        21.1.7. TAB G: Mishap reporting procedures and reports. Maintain copies of actual mishaps that
        happen in your unit.
        21.1.8. TAB H: Hazard Reporting Procedures. Maintain copies of AF Form 457, USAF Hazard
        Report here.
        21.1.9. TAB I: 35 FW/SEW Weapons Safety Evaluation Checklist.
35FWI91-201 8 AUGUST 2008                                                                              15


     21.1.10. TAB J: 35 FW/SEW Weapons Safety Program Guide.
     21.1.11. TAB K: General Correspondence and Miscellaneous Information (i.e., newsletters,
     safety flashes, cross-tells, meeting minutes, educational material, etc.).
  21.2. Explosives Loss Prevention. The cardinal principle of explosives safety states, “Expose the
  minimum number of people to the minimum amount of explosives for the minimum amount of time.”
  Exposure is the key. Specifically, by limiting exposure, we minimize the effects of a mishap and pre-
  serve our combat capability. This concept of loss prevention equates to three general precautions:
     21.2.1. Identify explosives by their hazard class/division to aid emergency response personnel.
     21.2.2. Store explosives according to authorized compatibility groups to limit the magnitude of an
     unintended detonation.
     21.2.3. Separate explosives from each other and adjacent areas IAW Quantity-Distance criteria.
     21.2.4. Note: The basis for these precautions is established in DoD Standard 6055.9 and OSHA
     Standard 29 CFR 1910.109. AFMAN 91-201 applies these federal standards to our environment.
  21.3. Weapons Safety Meetings. WSR meetings may be scheduled at the discretion of Wing Weapons
  Safety Manager. Attendance by the primary or alternate unit weapons safety representative is manda-
  tory.
  21.4. Local Directives. Units will forward all operating instructions, local checklists and other local
  directives involving explosives (i.e., storage, handling, inspection, use, etc.) to wing weapons safety
  for coordination prior to use. Annual review is required thereafter (units will forward all local direc-
  tives to the weapons safety office annually or anytime a change is made). Review documentation will
  be maintained in the unit’s program management book.
  21.5. Construction, Modification and Change of Use. Units will coordinate with 35 FW/SEW on all
  plans for construction, modification or change of use of explosives facilities or facilities within the
  clear zones of explosives locations. Coordination must take place before the construction, modifica-
  tion or change of use of the facility (it takes 6-8 months to prepare site plans, submit, and receive
  approval from the Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board).
  21.6. Safety Inspections. The purpose of inspections is to find and eliminate unsafe acts and condi-
  tions. The more successful the inspector is in finding and eliminating hazards, the safer the work envi-
  ronment. WSR will assist Weapons Safety during the annual assessment. WSR will also perform
  monthly spot inspections for the unit IAW AFMAN 91-201and the 35 FW/SEW Weapons Safety
  Evaluation Checklist. The following is a list of recommended inspection points when conducting spot
  inspections:
     21.6.1. Command Support. Mishap notification, unit policy letters and quarterly reviews of the
     management book are obvious indicators of commander involvement.
     21.6.2. Unit Commander Briefing. Brief unit commander periodically on the status of weapons
     safety program management. Include the following: Spot inspection results, changes to weapons
     safety policy, facility compliance to weapons safety standards, identified weapons safety noncom-
     pliance trends and percentage of explosive safety trained personnel (required to be 100% for per-
     sonnel who operate, handle, transport, maintain, load or dispose of missiles or explosives).
16                                                                       35FWI91-201 8 AUGUST 2008


        21.6.3. Education and Training. Compliance with the initial and annual requirements at a mini-
        mum. Documentation of this training will be maintained. An effective training program includes
        videotapes, summaries of recent mishaps and safety periodicals.
        21.6.4. Local Directives. All local operating instructions/directives/lesson plans affecting weap-
        ons operations require 35 FW/SEW coordination before use and annual reviews thereafter.
        21.6.5. Fire Protection. There are many elements to this program including fire symbol posting,
        fire extinguisher availability, pre-fire plans and smoking authorization (see AFMAN 91-201, Sec-
        tion 2B).
        21.6.6. Concurrent Operations/Unrelated Personnel. Limit exposure consistent with operational
        requirements. Supervisors must avoid “unnecessarily” exposing personnel and equipment to
        explosives.
        21.6.7. Housekeeping. Refer to AFMAN 91-201, para 2.10.
        21.6.8. Unserviceable/expended munitions. Segregate these items from serviceable ones and turn
        them in as soon as possible not to exceed 7 days. If this turn-in period is exceeded, the using orga-
        nization must maintain documentation as to why it could not be met (i.e., exercises, munitions
        inventory, etc.). Documentation will be maintained until items are turned-in. Wing weapons safety
        office will coordinate on documentation. Know the difference between unserviceable munitions
        and dangerously unserviceable munitions and apply the appropriate safety requirements.
        21.6.9. T.O. Usage. As with all other operations, individuals performing explosives operations
        must use the appropriate TOs, OIs and checklists. Technical guidance will be available and used at
        the location where munitions operations are being conducted.
        21.6.10. Safety Briefing. Individuals performing explosives operations must be briefed on the
        hazards involved and appropriate emergency procedures before beginning work.
        21.6.11. Transportation. Vehicles used for transporting explosives must have proper placards as
        applicable and equipped with two 2A10BC fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers will be inspected
        daily.
        21.6.12. Spot Inspections. Must be documented to provide a record for periodic review. An entry
        in a logbook is normally sufficient. Local forms or general-purpose forms of the Air Force series
        may be used. Conduct and document a spot inspection of each function within your unit once a
        month as a minimum.
     21.7. Mishap Prevention Data Analysis. A service wing weapons safety can provide your unit is data
     analysis. For example, at a unit’s request 35 FW/SEW review spot inspection logs to determine if the
     unit has any particular violation with any frequency. At the other end of the spectrum, we can study
     reliability of a certain system or the frequency of occurrence. Weapons safety maintains source sup-
     port material for a wide range of topics related to weapons safety. 35 FW/SE is always ready to study
     a specific issue or provide informal evaluations anytime in the interest of mishap prevention.
     21.8. References required for the WSR to perform required duties. AFMAN 91-201, Explosive
     Safety Standards; AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program; AFI 91-204, Safety

   NO.                                                     ITEM                                               YES           NO   N/A
5.3.1.        Do individuals issued PPE perform inspections for defects, cleanliness and sanitation? (AFOSH
              Std 91-501, 14.4.10.3.)
5.4.          Do individuals notify their supervisor about any job-related injury or impaired health that may
              affect their job performance? (AFI 91-202, 1.6.15.5.)
5.5.          Do individuals report any suspected or actual exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials?
              (AFI 91-202, 1.6.15.6.)
6.                                 UNIT LOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROGRAM
6.1.          Are procedures developed and documented for the safe and proper use of locks and tags on
              energy isolating devices? {AFOSH Std 91-501, 21.3.4.}
6.2.          Are procedures utilized during shift or personnel changes to ensure the continuity of lockout or
              tagout protection, (orderly transfer of these devices between off going and on coming
              supervisors)? {AFOSH Std 91-501, 21.6.1.8.}
6.3.          Does the supervisor ensure all other personnel whose duties are or may be in an area where
              lockout and tagout procedures may be utilized are briefed on the program during the initial job
              safety briefing? {AFOSH Std 91-501, 21.6.2.1.2.}
6.4.          Are periodic self-inspections being conducted by the unit to ensure compliance with all program
              elements? As a minimum, are the following areas included in the inspection? {AFOSH Std
              91-501, 21.6.3.2.}
6.5.          The identification of the machines and equipment on which the Lockout and Tagout Program is
              used. {AFSOH Std 91-501, 21.7.2.3.}

6.7.          Has training been conducted and documented? {AFOSH Std 91-501, 21.6.2.4.}
7.                                             UNIT ORM ADVISOR
7.1.          Is there evidence the unit commander is an advocate for the unit ORM program? (AFI 90-901,
              3.4.) Look for minutes of meetings policy letters, and evidence of unit ORM activities not
              possible without unit commander support.
7.2.          Is integration of ORM into planning at all levels supported by the Commander? (AFI 90-901,
              3.4.) Is ORM briefed and/or mandated for all plans, exercises, deployments, etc? As a
              minimum, these should be evident in stall meeting minutes. Copies of briefings containing
              ORM material should be available for review. Operational and support plans should identify
              maximum-performance with minimum-risk options. Also, task planning within functional areas
              should be accomplished using ORM principles.
7.3.          Is implementation of ORM evident throughout the unit? (AFI 90-901, PACAF Sup 1, 6.2.6.)
7.3.1.        Can the ORM Advisor show ORM implementation for the organization in all functional areas
              down to shop level? Look for real-world applications data, risk control charts showing risk
              trends for mission-essential processes, and training data.
7.3.2.        If there are shortfalls in implementation, is there evidence the commander has been informed of
              these shortfalls? Look for items such as meeting minutes, policy letters, databases, and other
              records of activities.
7.4.          Risk Decision-Making. (AFI 90-901, 3.2.)
7.4.1.        Are risk decisions made at the appropriate level? Look for trends of unreasonably elevated or
              delegated decision making.
7.4.2.        Is there a published unit policy for elevating risk decisions? Look in the commander’s ORM
              policy letter. Is the unit policy readily available to all assigned personnel? Look for ORM policy
              in operating instructions, local supplements, etc.

Unit Ground Safety Program Management Checklist                                                  PAGE 5       OF       5    PAGES


   NO.                                                        ITEM                                               YES       NO   N/A
7.5.          Has an ORM Advisor been appointed and properly trained? (AFI 90-901, PACAF Sup 1, 6.1.4.
              and 7.1.3.) As a minimum, documentation should include a letter of appointment signed by the
              commander. The advisor should be at least a SSgt with 12 months retainability at time of
              appointment. If retainability is less than 12 months verify steps are being taken to train a
              replacement.
7.6.          Has the ORM Advisor attended the ORM Applications and Integration Course? (AFI 90-901,
              PACAF Sup 1, 6.2.3.) A copy of the training certificate from the Transportation Safety Institute
              (TSI), a certificate from the WBT, a certificate from VTC training, or a locally developed course
              certificate is acceptable. A memorandum for record (MFR) or e-mail identifying a request fro
              training or a confirmed class date for an advisor who has not yet completed training will also
              meet this requirement.
7.7.          Are personnel completing the ORM Fundamentals Course within 60 days of assignment to a
              unit? (AFI 90-901, PACAF Sup 1, 7.1.1.) Training may have been provided as a briefing,
              classroom instruction, or web based.
7.8.          Have supervisor personnel completed the PACAF Essentials for Leaders Course? (AFI 90-901,
              PACAF Sup 1, 7.1.2.1.) Training may have been provided as a briefing, classroom instruction,
              or web based.
7.9.          Is implementation of ORM in all functional areas evident? (AFI 90-901, 4.1.) Evidence of
              ORM implementation in all functional areas, such as risk control charts showing risk trends for
              work center tasks.
7.10.         Is involvement of all personnel in ORM activities evident? (AFI 90-901, 2.3.) Look for
              personnel participation from all areas. ORM should not be centrally managed; rather
              decentralization is important to allow unique work centers the flexibility to meet their mission
              needs. Informal interviews with unit personnel should provide enough data to indicate
              involvement. Review any documented ORM applications.
7.11.         Do supervisors ensure individuals apply ORM to day-to-day operations or tasks? (AFI 90-901,
              3.4.) Meeting minutes, checklists, job aids, training outlines or plans, visual aids, or any other
              evidence supporting ORM activities.
7.12.         Can personnel assigned identify the ORM 6-step process? (AFI 90-901, 4.5.) Interview a
              random sampling to identify their familiarization with ORM. Wallet-cards, posters or any other
              aid is acceptable. Conceptually accurate responses are preferred over word-for-word recitations
              of text lacking in understanding of the process.
7.13.         Is there evidence that all personnel are applying ORM principles, concepts, and techniques to
              assess the risks associated with their daily activities, both on and off duty? (AFPD 90-9, 5.7.) A
              majority of personnel asked should provide anecdotal information regarding personal
              application of ORM principles.
7.14.         Do commanders/supervisors know the high-risk activities tier personnel participate in, both on-
              and off-duty? (AFI 90-901, PACAF Sup 1, 6.1.5.) The intent is for commanders/ supervisors to
              have the opportunity to intervene with a risk mitigation tools (for example, PACAF
              Comprehensive Assessment of Risk & Evaluation System (CARES)) where they see the need
              and if they think it is appropriate.
7.15.         Has the wing commander determined the high risk activities for their base? (AFI 90-901,
              PACAF Sup 1, 6.1.5.) An example list is available in Attachment 3 of PACAF Sup 1.
