This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8, Environment, Safety, and Occupa-

Occupational Health Councils. It applies to all units assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing. Refer recom-
mended changes and conflicts between this and other publications to 48 CES/CEV, on Air Force (AF)
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of

Section A—How To Use This Instruction

1. ESOH Background. AFPD 90-8 and AFI 90-801 establish, integrate, and structure the Air Force
Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) program. The goals of the program are to sustain,
restore, and modernize natural and workforce infrastructure to ensure operational capability. ESOH
Councils are established at each level of command to support and direct the ESOH program and are an
integral part of the program's management system(s).

2. ESOH Concept. Operational capability is the focus of the ESOH program at Royal Air Force Laken-
heath (RAFL). To underscore this focus consistent with Air Force ESOH policy, senior leadership at
RAFL will pursue a systematic, interdisciplinary, and involved approach to integrated ESOH manage-
ment.

3. ESOHC Purpose. This instruction establishes an ESOH Council (ESOHC) as the primary and top
level forum for senior leadership involvement in ESOH management at RAFL.

       ensure that all matters involving environmental compliance, remediation, pollution prevention,
       and conservation will be included as agenda items in ESOHCs.
       4.2.2. Wing Safety (48 FW/SE). Matters regarding flight safety, ground safety, and weapons
       safety will be addressed during ESOHCs. Wing Safety will coordinate with Environmental to
       ensure that these issues are included as agenda items in ESOHCs.
       4.2.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (48 AMDS/SGPB). Matters regarding threats to
       human health and the environment will be addressed during ESOHCs. Bioenvironmental will
       coordinate with Environmental to ensure that these issues are included as agenda items in ESO-
       HCs.
       4.2.4. Fire Protection Flight (48 CES/CEF). Matters regarding fire safety will be addressed dur-
       ing ESOHCs. Fire Protection will coordinate with Environmental to ensure that these issues are

    Council, group commanders, commanders of each squadron or 2-letter office, and commanders of all
    tenant organizations, or appropriate equivalents, will serve as members of the ESOH Council. IAW
