         10.3.2.4. Unfunded requirements. To properly track all funding requirements, all
         requests for funding presented to the FMB, the 49 WG/CC, or to Headquarters Air
AFI65-601V2_HOLLOMANAFBSUP 19 DECEMBER 2013                                                  3


       Combat Command (HQ ACC) will be coordinated in advance through the Financial
       Analysis Office for analysis and review. All funding requirements must originate
       from the RCM level; lower level requirements (unit/squadron) must be validated by
       the appropriate RCM prior to submission to FWG/FMB for sourcing or inclusion in
       the base unfunded priority list. Unfunded requirements must be reported to the
       Financial Analysis Office as they become known, using the format used for that fiscal
       year. Copies of correct format will be provided each year to all RAs. The Financial
       Analysis Office will validate all requests and present them at the next FWG. The
       FMB will review and prioritize the requirements for submission to HQ ACC/FMA.
       Previously identified unfunded requirements must be updated as changes occur
       (including decreases, items that have become funded, or items that are no longer valid
       requirements).
    10.4.1. Distributing the Approved Operating Budget Authority. Each year
    represents a unique financial opportunity with different challenges and program changes.
    As such the FMB will determine at the onset of each fiscal year the particular policies for
    program control. This will include the revalidation of reprogramming authority and the
    fencing of any particular programs (beyond those fenced by ACC). This should be
    accomplished no later than the approval of the initial distribution.
       10.4.3.1. The authority to redistribute quarterly authority between RCMs is delegated
       to the Financial Analysis Office for needed adjustments thereafter.
