                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. The mission of the 374th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (374
OSS/OSW) is to provide relevant, operational weather support to the 374 AW, and all associate
units assigned to Yokota AB, Japan. This includes weather staff support to Headquarters United
States Forces, Japan (USFJ) and Headquarters, Fifth Air Force (5 AF). This instruction
establishes local weather support requirements and procedures. Agencies requiring routine
weather support not included herein should contact the 374 OSS/OSW to arrange for and
document routine weather support requirements.
1.2. Background.
     1.2.1. The 374 OSS/OSW is focused on providing mission tailored weather information
     needed by assigned and associated units of Yokota AB for mission execution, resource
     protection, and staff support. Support is also provided to the commander of deployed forces
     during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations. The duties of a 374 OSS/OSW are
     generally divided into three areas which will be described in detail in subsequent chapters:
     Airfield Services, Mission Support, and Staff Integration. In this document, the term 374
     OSS/OSW will refer to the 374 OSS/OSW personnel at Yokota AB.
     1.2.2. According to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF)-approved Strategic Plan for
     Air Force Weather (AFW) Reengineering, 8 August 1997, each Weather Flight will maintain
     a support relationship with its regional Operational Weather Squadron (OWS). The 17 OWS
     at Hickam AFB, Hawaii is the servicing OWS for all of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and
     United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). General responsibilities of 17 OWS and 374
     OSS/OSW are outlined in AFI 15-128.
        1.2.2.1. The 17 OWS provides resource protection, terminal aerodrome forecasts (TAF),
        regional and operational-level weather products and information, meteorological watch
        (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) via phone patch, and flight weather
        briefing support for Air Force locations within the Pacific Theater 24 hours a day, 7 days
        a week. Specific responsibilities of the 17 OWS and 374 OSS/OSW are defined in the
        Installation Data Page (IDP) weather support agreement between the 374 OSS and the 17
        OWS as well as in this instruction.
     1.2.3. The 17 OWS and 374 OSS/OSW Back-up Support: The 17 OWS and the 374
     OSS/OSW provide back-up support to each other, as outlined in the 374 OSS and 17 OWS
     IDP. This is a basic outline of back-up support:
        1.2.3.1. Back-up Assistance for the 17 OWS: When weather operations at the 17 OWS
        are interrupted, responsibility for all TAF, weather watches, warnings, and advisories
        (WWA) for Yokota AB are transferred to the 374 OSS/OSW until such time when the 17
        OWS is postured to resume operations. In addition, the 374 OSS/OSW will be
        responsible for resource protection (WWA issuance) for Tama Services Annex.
        Graphical products on Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network
        (JAAWIN) or the Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS) will be utilized by the
        374 OSS/OSW until the OWS is back to normal operations. Also, the 17 OWS hosts a
        minimum amount of data through a back-up website via AFW-WEBS located at
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         7

       3D%3D%23.
       1.2.3.2. Back-up Assistance for the 374 OSS/OSW: For standard weather office
       evacuations, support will resume from the alternate weather operations location with the
       17 OWS assuming responsibilities during the interim period. For longer interruptions,
       the 374 OSS/OSW will coordinate with the 17 OWS or other organizations in the
       production and dissemination of selected tactical-level weather products.
1.3. 374 OSS/OSW Operational Hours. Normal hours are from 0530 JST – 2200 JST (2030
GMT – 1300 GMT) Monday through Thursday and 0530 JST – 1630 JST (2030 GMT – 0730
GMT) or end of 374 AW flying operations on Friday. The 374 OSS/OSW will be closed on
Saturday and Sunday, federal holidays and PACAF Family Days unless supporting 374 AW
flying operations, specific DV missions, or as requested for other mission support. If the 374
AW flies prior to the published hours, the 374 OSS/OSW will be manned at least one hour prior
to the first pilot brief annotated on the daily flying schedule and until after the last sortie lands.
During closed hours, personnel will be on standby. A monthly standby roster will be provided to
the Command Post and 17 OWS. If weather support is required, the stand-by forecaster can be
contacted directly or through the command post. During 374 OSS/OSW standby operations, the
17 OWS continues to issue forecasts and weather watches, warnings, and advisories IAW the
374 OSS – 17 OWS IDP. The Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS) will
continue to record and disseminate hourly and special observations as required per AFMAN 15-
111 and this document.
1.4. 374 OSS/OSW Operating Location. The 374 OSS/OSW performs duties at the locations
shown in Table 1.1.

1.5. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation, weather
operations will be moved to the alternate location as shown in Table 1.2 For flight safety
reasons, the 374 OSS/OSW will not evacuate during exercises. The 374 OSS/OSW will
continue operational support and the “eyes forward” responsibilities for the 17 OWS. Most
services and support will be provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment dependent on
communication line status, equipment status, etc. The Pilot to Metro Service Radio on UHF
344.6 MHz will not be available while operating outside of the primary weather facility. There

1.7. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
   1.7.1. 374 OSS/OSW Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate
   facilities, funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (i.e., power, water,
   etc) are available.
   1.7.2. 17 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the IDP and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources on
   base weather operations and production.
   1.7.3. 374 OSS/OSW Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available (i.e., out of
   station flight weather briefings) due to 374 OSS/OSW staffing, station evacuation, or other
   higher priority missions.
   1.7.4. 374 OSS/OSW Limitations.
       1.7.4.1. Any augmented observations taken from Building 703 do not allow the observer
       to see the entire aerodrome, particularly southwest through northwest. Buildings,
       hangars, and tree lines obstruct the view. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low
       clouds, or poor visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. Note:
       There are no limitations to the airfield weather sensors, such as blocked wind sensors.
       1.7.4.2. Interruption of the normal receipt of alphanumeric and graphic data via various
       interconnected weather data systems, Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network
       (NIPRNET) or Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) can severely
       degrade the forecasting capabilities.
       1.7.4.3. Due to the unpredictability of weather events, forecasts beyond 24 hours will be
       used for planning purposes only.
       1.7.4.4. Many flying areas are over unpopulated regions. Lack of weather data from
       such areas may limit the thorough weather watch capabilities of the weather technician.
       Pilot reports are extremely useful over data sparse areas.
1.8. Weather Equipment and Technical Assistance. The 374 OSS/OSW relies heavily on
various forms of equipment in order to provide weather support. Most noteworthy are the FMQ-
19, TMQ-53, Kestrel, Jet, LAN, phones, and PMSV.
   1.8.1. Equipment Maintenance. The table below lists the organizations responsible for
   preventive maintenance and repairs of meteorological and communication equipment:

   1.8.2. AFWA Fielded Systems Service Center (FSSC) Equipment Technical Assistance.
   The AFWA FSSC is the single point of contact for the 374 OSS/OSW when it requires
   technical assistance with the FMQ-19, TMQ-53, or JET. Service is provided 24-hours a day,
   7 days a week to handle trouble calls. The FSSC will maintain detailed information on all
   outages and will track these outages until successful resolution. Note: The 374 OSS/OSW
   will not contact the contractors directly unless otherwise directed.
       1.8.2.1. The 374 OSS/OSW will conduct basic troubleshooting to determine the nature
       of the equipment outage using system manuals, local troubleshooting guides, or
       instructions available from 2nd Combat Weather Systems Squadron before contacting the
       FSSC. With assistance from the AFWA FSSC, 374 OSS/OSW personnel will generally
       be able to resolve most problems. If the problem cannot be resolved, the FSSC will
       contact the appropriate maintenance agency. In some cases, the FSSC may direct the unit
       to contact their local communication agency.
   1.8.3. Certifying Newly Fielded Systems. The 374 OSS/OSW leadership will be the
   certifying official IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management, for all newly
   fielded information systems. The certifying official will coordinate site certification and
   accreditation efforts of these systems with the Yokota AB Information Assurance office to
   obtain approval from the Designated Approval Authority. An Air Force Command, Control,
   Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Support Plan must accompany new systems.
   The System Program Office (SPO) responsible for the acquisition will provide the AFC4I
   Support Plan. For additional assistance and guidance, contact HQ AFWA/SCMT-I.
1.9. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Most general
weather parameters are available to be given to the general public, such as temperature, winds,
humidity, and sky condition. However, specific weather information will not be released to non-
DoD agencies/non-base agencies without approval from the 374 AW Public Affairs (374
AW/PA) and Legal offices.
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                    11


                                           Chapter 2

                             AIRFIELD SUPPORT FUNCTION

2.1. General. The Airfield Support Function includes those actions that affect the Yokota
aerodrome (defined within 5 nautical miles of the airfield). Examples include Terminal
Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF) support, weather observing, meteorological watch (METWATCH),
and resource protection. Resource protection and emergency actions resulting from weather
events/natural disasters will be described in Chapter 5.
2.2. TAF Support. The Yokota AB TAF is required 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year, unless coordinated otherwise during airfield closures. Issue times are 0600, 1400, and 2000
JST (0500, 1300, and 2100 Zulu). The TAF applies to an area within 5 nautical miles of the
center of the airfield and is valid for 30 hours. TAFs are produced by the 17 OWS and
disseminated through JET or JAAWIN/AFW-WEBS if JET is inoperative.                           TAF
specification/amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 2. TAF format and decoding
instructions can be found in AFMAN 15-124.
2.3. Points of Observation. On Yokota AB, the active FMQ-19 sensor suite is the primary
observing site. There are two sensors (i.e., two sites) with one near each end of the runway. The
active sensor (and active observing site) will correspond to the active runway. When FMQ-19 is
inoperable, observations will be augmented (i.e., taken manually) at the end of the Distinguished
Visitors Garden walkway just east of Building 703 (position is marked with a white arrow
pointing to magnetic north). Refer to paragraph 1.7.4 for augmented observation point
limitations.
2.4. Primary Observation Equipment. All observations will be taken using the FMQ-19
unless the system is inoperative altogether (i.e., communication failure) or in part (i.e., sensor
failure). The system continuously measures wind, visibility, precipitation/obstructions to vision,
cloud height, sky cover, temperature, dew point, altimeter, and lightning. Observations will be
transmitted over the JET automated dissemination system hourly or whenever SPECI/LOCAL
criteria dictate (See Attachment 2).
   2.4.1. FMQ-19 Limitations.
       2.4.1.1. This system is only able to sample atmospheric information in the immediate
       vicinity and may not provide an accurate representation of weather in the entire
       aerodrome complex. Therefore, ceilings and visibility will only be measured and
       reported from or above the official observation site. Differing surrounding weather
       phenomenon will not be measured or reported.
       2.4.1.2. When visibility changes rapidly, the AN/FMQ-19 observation will lag the actual
       weather due to the time-averaged algorithms used by the system.
   2.4.2. FMQ-19 Outage Procedures.
       2.4.2.1. In the case of an FMQ-19 short-term outage, the 374 OSS/OSW will use the
       Kestrel during augmentation to provide limited weather data. The Kestrel is a hand-held
       weather observing device that measures wind speed, temperature, dew point temperature
       and pressure. It does not have the precision of other equipments and will be used as a
       short-term backup device only.
 12                                                        YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013


   2.4.3. In the case of a long-term outage, the TMQ-53 Tactical Meteorological Observation
   System (TMOS) will be used. The TMQ-53 TMOS is a tactical weather observing
   instrument suitable to measure the same weather parameters the FMQ-19 can measure.
2.5. Augmentation of Observation Equipment. Augmentation is the process of weather
technicians’ manually adding or editing data to an observation generated by the FMQ-19. The
two processes of augmentation are backup and supplementing IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface
Weather Observations.
   2.5.1. Backup is the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or dissemination
   of an AMOS observation when the primary automated method is not operational or
   unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure while the airfield is open. With the
   exception of some automated remarks, backup refers to weather technicians providing the
   same reporting capability as that provided by the FMQ-19.
   2.5.2. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an
   automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 to detect and/or report.
   Supplementation is required per AFMAN 15-111. Forecasters will be prepared to
   supplement when the conditions in Table 2.1 are forecasted to occur within 2 hours and the
   weather station is open.

Table 2.1. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions
                       Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions
Tornado (+FC)
Funnel Cloud (FC)
Waterspout (+FC)
Hail (GR) (any size)
Volcanic Ash (VA)
Snow Depth (only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been
issued and snowfall is occurring)

       2.5.2.1. During airfield closure the only element required to be supplemented is tornadic
       activity. When the environment is favorable for tornadic activity, Severe Weather Action
       Procedures (SWAP) will be initiated (see Chapter 5 for SWAP procedures) and the 374
       OSS/OSW will ensure supplementation occurs as outlined in its SWAP procedures.
2.6. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). 374 OSS/OSW personnel conduct a BWW IAW AFMAN
15-111 when backup augmentation is required. Weather conditions will be reevaluated at
intervals not to exceed 20 minutes and when conditions in Table 2.2 are observed or are forecast
to occur within 60 minutes.
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       13


Table 2.2. Increased Weather Check/Observation Frequency
                        Increase Frequency of Observation Thresholds
Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1500 feet.
Ceiling dissipates or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
Visibility decreases to less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
Precipitation (any form).
Thunderstorms.
Fog or mist.
Special Weather Observation (SPECI) or LOCAL thresholds are met (if augmenting).

2.7. Cooperative Weather Watch. Cooperative Weather Watch is the process whereby ATC
personnel, flying units, and Security Forces personnel notify the 374 OSS/OSW of any
occurrence of weather conditions which could affect flight safety or resource protection. This
process is primarily concerned with reports of tower visibility different from prevailing visibility,
local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions.
   2.7.1. ATC task certified personnel will notify the 374 OSS/OSW when any of the following
   occur:
       2.7.1.1. Tower prevailing visibility is evaluated to be less than 4 statute miles (6000
       meters) and is different from the surface prevailing visibility.
       2.7.1.2. Tornadoes or funnel clouds.
       2.7.1.3. Thunder is heard and/or lightning is seen.
       2.7.1.4. Precipitation begins or ends.
       2.7.1.5. Any other meteorological condition that could impact flight safety or be critical
       to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources (hail, wind damage,
       etc).
       2.7.1.6. Any weather information received from pilots for inclusion into a PIREP and/or
       surface observation will be relayed to 374 OSS/OSW within 5 minutes, or as soon as
       possible, after receipt for dissemination.
   2.7.2. 374 OSS/OSW will reevaluate weather conditions and the accuracy of the AMOS
   when information reported from a reliable source differs from the last disseminated
   observation. If the information is determined to be accurate and the AMOS is determined to
   be malfunctioning, the 374 OSS/OSW will follow established augmentation procedures.
2.8. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH is a deliberate process for
monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a
METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from
forecast conditions and determining courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or
 14                                                        YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013


group of products and designated agencies notified. It is a collaborative process performed by
and collaborated on between the 374 OSS/OSW and the 17 OWS.
   2.8.1. METWATCH by the 374 OSS/OSW. The 374 OSS/OSW will review and analyze
   regional data to determine how weather conditions may change at the installation. The 374
   OSS/OSW will keep Airfield Management, ATC, 374 AW/CP and RAPCON fully aware of
   current and expected weather conditions. 374 OSS/OSW personnel will integrate anticipated
   changes into the Yokota MEF product and collaborate with the 17 OWS on TAFs and/or
   watch, warning, and advisories for Yokota AB.
   2.8.2. METWATCH by the 17 OWS. The 17 OWS performs a continuous terminal
   METWATCH for Yokota AB (to include the Tama Services Annex). The METWATCH is
   in support of the Yokota TAF and in support of 17 OWS issued weather watches, warnings,
   and advisories for Yokota AB and Tama Services Annex.
2.9. “Eyes Forward” Process/Procedure. 374 OSS/OSW technicians will relay significant,
time-sensitive meteorological information to the forecasters conducting resource protection and
METWATCH operations at the 17 OWS. “Eyes Forward” provides an organized approach for
weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of the current and future meteorological
situation within a designated area.
2.10. PMSV Support. The 374 OSS/OSW will monitor UHF 344.6 MHz during its operational
hours and will solicit aircrews to provide PIREPs of weather conditions over this frequency.
Aircrews will be provided current weather conditions and will be warned of weather hazards
along their flight route; however, the 374 OSS/OSW will not vector aircrews around hazards
(only ATC facilities can vector aircraft).
   2.10.1. Limitations. The PMSV operating range is restricted to line-of-sight transmissions
   between the aircraft and the ground at Yokota AB. The range is approximately 200 nautical
   miles (NM) at normal operating altitudes. Local terrain range restrictions exist from the
   southwest (SW) to the northwest (NW).
   2.10.2. PMSV Outages. 374 OSS/OSW personnel will:
       2.10.2.1. Notify ATC and Airfield Operations of any PMSV outage. ATC and Airfield
       Operations will monitor UHF 344.6 MHz and advise aircrew attempting to contact
       Yokota METRO to contact the Command Post (frequency UHF 349.4MHz or VHF
       128.0MHz, DSN 225-2536/225-2537) for a phone patch to the 374 OSS/OSW (DSN
       225-7213/225-9004). For additional PMSV services aircrews can find information in the
       Flight Information Publication.
       2.10.2.2. Contact Airfield Management and ensure information on PMSV outages is
       included in local Airfield Advisories and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs).
       2.10.2.3. Notify ATC, Airfield Operations, and Command Post when the equipment has
       been restored to operational status.
2.11. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). PIREPs are reports of in-flight weather made by aircrews.
PIREPs will be relayed to the 374 OSS/OSW via PMSV, phone-patch, ATC/RAPCON, or the
Command Post. ATC/RAPCON and Command Post will relay all PIREPs and pertinent weather
information to the weather technician within 5 minutes, or as soon as possible, after receipt for
dissemination. Any 374 AW aircrew encountering hazardous weather conditions which

   Other useful weather data for inclusion into a PIREP includes, but not limited to: flight level
   winds, bases/tops of clouds (approach ceilings), visibility (approach visibility), turbulence,
   icing, thunderstorms, hail, or low level wind shear.
   2.11.2. Any PIREPs significant to local flying will be disseminated locally using JET. All
   other PIREPs deemed as not significant will be relayed to the 17 OWS. At a minimum, all
   urgent (UUA) PIREPs will be disseminated long-line and locally via the approved local
   dissemination system. Urgent PIREPS are those which include any of the elements listed in
   Table 2.3.

Table 2.3. Urgent PIREP Weather Conditions
                              Urgent PIREP Weather Conditions

Any condition that, in the judgment of the person entering the PIREP into the system, would
present an extreme hazard to flight
Note 1: Only report as severe if thunderstorms are in an area of widespread activity, along a line
with little or no space between individual storms, or embedded in cloud layers or concealed in
2.11.3. If JET is not operational, the 374 OSS/OSW will attempt to disseminate PIREP
information via JAAWIN/AFW-WEBS prior to contacting the 17 OWS to disseminate.

2.12. Yokota Extended Outlook Forecast. A 5-day weather forecast product will be produced
during duty days. The product will include at a minimum: sky conditions, expected weather,
wind direction and speed, high and low temperatures, sunrise and sunset times.

                             MISSION WEATHER SERVICES

3.1. General. The Mission Weather Element (MWE) will use the Mission Execution Forecast
(MEF) process to tailor weather products and provide decision-quality environmental
information for mission planning and execution for the 374 AW. The TAF and the MEF for
Yokota AB are the primary weather tools used in supporting 374 AW flying missions. While the
TAF is a standardized product for airfields worldwide, the MEF is a mission weather product
(MWP) tailored to specific customer requirements and specific missions. As a customized
product, a MEF can be in almost any format. A local area weather sheet, a verbal flight weather
briefing, and a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, are all MEF examples.
3.2. 374 OSS/OSW Mission Details. The 374 OSS/OSW supports many different
organizations, weapons systems, and missions which are limited by various weather parameters.
   3.2.1. The 374 OSS/OSW provides tailored weather support to its primary flying customers
   with the accompanying missions and requirements which are listed in Table 3.1
       3.2.1.1. Increased awareness of mission limitations is necessary for properly tailored
       briefings and daily weather discussions. It is the responsibility of the flying units to
       notify the 374 OSS/OSW if a new weather limitation poses an impact to missions.

Table 3.1. Yokota AB Organizations, Missions, and Requirements
   Organization                          Mission                           Requirements
                     Prepares for, and when tasked conducts            -see Attachment 3

 (C-12 and UH-1)     missions across the Kanto Plain and throughout
                     the Western Pacific

   3.2.2. Due to the size of the training areas, there are very few instances when weather will
   make an operating area completely unusable. Pilot discretion is used to determine mission
   go/no-go criteria regardless of the weather phenomena listed in the Mission Execution
   Forecast (MEF) or the briefing provided. Routinely used training areas are depicted in
   Attachment 5.
3.3. Airframe Specific Weather Limitations. Weather limitations for resident and common
airframes are listed in Attachment 3. The tables provide the general airframe weather
limitations based on 11-series AFIs and 11-series PACAF Supplements. Weather limitations for
other aircraft can be obtained by visiting the 17 OWS website at
https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/tech_ref/OWL/index.cfm?BW=H&UF=M&AOR=2&sc=00142

YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        17


3.4. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The MEF is mission tailored environmental
information describing a specific impact to an operational mission using the MEF process. The
374 OSS/OSW follows the AFMAN 15-129V2 administrative MEF process to conduct
deliberate forecast processes while developing, delivering, monitoring, and amending MEFs by
fusing perishable data with operational and strategic level weather forecast products into decision
quality information for an operational end user. The result is a briefing tool designed to provide
timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various customers. It is designed to
provide critical go/no-go weather information for all phases of the mission. The MEF must be
horizontally consistent with products issued by the 17 OWS, to include the TAF and flight
hazards. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions
threaten resource protection, the 374 OSS/OSW will amend the MEF to reflect the conditions
and brief the 17 OWS as time permits.
    3.4.1. The MEF will be issued during 374 AW flying days by 2030Z (0530 JST) or not later
    than two hours prior to the first takeoff, whichever is earlier.
    3.4.2. The Yokota MEF Contents: The following data are included in the MEF: take-
    off/recovery, WWA/TCCOR status, space weather, route weather/hazards, flight level winds
    and temperatures over Yokota AB and Camp Fuji, and solar and lunar data. See Attachment
    4 for a MEF sample.
        3.4.2.1. The MEF applies 36 AS and 459 AS aircraft and mission sensitivities and
        requirements. Listings of these impacts are included on Attachment 3.
        3.4.2.2. The 374 OSS/OSW will use the 17 OWS graphical and alphanumeric analysis
        and forecast products, TAF, Watches, Warnings (WW), and Forecast Weather Advisories
        (FWA) in developing the MEF, as well as for updating supported unit(s) decision-makers
        on environmental impacts to operations.
    3.4.3. MEF Amendment Criteria: Amendments will be issued based on the discretion of the
    374 OSS/OSW and per the amendment criteria listed in the table below.

Table 3.2. MEF Amendment Criteria
MEF Amendment Criteria
If ceiling, visibilities, and cross winds cross aircraft sensitivities as listed in Attachment 3
If altimeter is off +/- 0.08.
If wind direction and speed differ from TAF amendment criteria per AFMAN 15-124
If temperature is off +/- 4 °C
If any weather occurring was not originally forecasted
Issuance or change of TCCOR conditions or current tropical forecast
Issuance or change of any WWA

    3.4.4. MEF Dissemination.
        3.4.4.1. The Yokota AB MEF will be available on the 374 OSS/OSW SharePoint site at
        https://yokota.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/OG_Wx/default.aspx.

      3.4.4.2. If LAN support is not available, the 374 OSS/OSW will disseminate the
      information to the 36 AS and 459 AS via fax.
      3.4.4.3. MEF Amendment Dissemination. Amended MEFs will be disseminated utilizing
      the same dissemination means as those listed above.
3.5. MISSIONWATCH. Process which describes how the 374 OSS/OSW monitors the
weather for all missions through the use of the ORM MISSIONWATCH process (Figure 4.1). It
is the primary responsibility of the duty forecaster to use all on-site meteorological and
commercial data sources to accomplish this task. It is through this method that MEF
amendments or updates are accomplished.

Figure 3.1. ORM MISSIONWATCH Process




   3.5.1. The 374 OSS/OSW has established MISSIONWATCH procedures that aid forecasters
   in determining if the weather conditions will have a high or low risk impact on missions, to
   include those critical points in missions (i.e., takeoff, landing, airdrop, low level route
   entrance, etc).
      3.5.1.1. If the weather conditions are determined to have little risk to a mission the
      forecaster will reassess the weather conditions at least once an hour during the mission.
      3.5.1.2. Weather conditions for high risk missions will be reviewed every 20 minutes
      during the mission and 15 minutes prior to mission critical points.
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                    19


   3.5.2. If any mission crosses one of the mission limiting thresholds the 374 OSS/OSW will
   perform the following as required:
       3.5.2.1. Notify 36 AS/459 AS Operations Desk(s), Air Traffic Control Tower, and
       Command Post in order to get the weather information to the aircrew(s).
       3.5.2.2. Amend/update the Mission Execution Forecast
       3.5.2.3. Coordinate changes to the TAF and hazard charts with the 17 OWS
   3.5.3. The 374 OSS/OSW will monitor weather conditions for missions until they are
   complete.
       3.5.3.1. If an aircraft is off-station overnight or for a long off-station mission, the 374
       OSS/OSW will perform MISSIONWATCH until the aircraft lands at the first mission
       destination.
3.6. Aircrew Briefing Support. The 374 OSS/OSW will provide briefing support to 374 AW
missions as requested either via email, over the phone, or in person. 374 OSS/OSW requests any
374 AW 175-1 briefs be requested at least two hours in advance of the requested departure time.
Formal briefing requests involving two or more C-130 aircraft are required no later than noon the
duty day prior. Missions that are AMD/IFM will receive their briefing support from AMD.
   3.6.1. Transient Support. The 374 OSS/OSW will provide weather support to transient
   aircrews during normal duty hours while manning or operations tempo permits. In the event
   that the 374 OSS/OSW cannot assist, they will provide/arrange for weather support with the
   17 OWS or appropriate OWS.
3.7. Mission Planning Weather Outlook. The 374 OSS/OSW produces and provides the 36
AS and the 459 AS Mission Planning Weather Outlook products by 0700L during duty days.
These products are tailored for the flying squadrons based on their routine flying operations. See
Attachment 4 for sample planning weather outlook products.
   3.7.1. Mission Planning Weather Outlook will be available on the 374 OSS/OSW SharePoint
   site at https://yokota.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/OG_Wx/default.aspx.
       3.7.1.1. If LAN support is not available, the 374 OSS/OSW will disseminate the
       information to the 36 AS and 459 AS via fax.
3.8. Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs). Target Acquisition Weapons Software (TAWS) is only
used to gather solar and lunar data.
3.9. Space Weather. The 374 OSS/OSW will utilize the current suite of global and regional
scale products provided by AFWA and the 17 OWS to relay relevant data and information and
apply it for the 5 AF, USFJ, and 374 AWs operations as needed.
   3.9.1. The 36 AS and 459 AS use communication systems that include HF, VHF, UHF,
   GPS, TACAN and SATCOM which could be inhibited by increased solar activity. Space
   weather impacts are included in the MEF process.
   3.9.2. The 374 OSS/OSW will coordinate with the 5 AF and USFJ as needed to determine
   space weather thresholds and requirements in order to provide the most value in supporting
   their operations.

3.10. National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) Support. NAOC support is detailed in
374 AW Plan 553. If the NAOC is to arrive at Yokota AB, the 374 OSS/OSW will provide
environmental data for the aircrew as requested. A NAOC watch officer will be identified
through the 374 AW/CP. The 374 OSS/OSW will notify the watch officer of all Yokota AB
weather watches, warnings, and advisories to include those additionally required advisories
needed in support of the NAOC mission. NAOC support advisories are listed in Table 3.3

                            STAFF INTEGRATION FUNCTION

4.1. General. Staff services are those briefings or support provided primarily by the 374
OSS/OSW leadership. These unit members will function as a direct interface with the 374 AW
commander and staff, and provide direct support to command, control, and planning functions.
Weather technicians will be integrated into the staff weather element as needed.
4.2. Staff Weather Briefings. Weather is briefed at several organizational staff meetings.
Briefing times, content, and delivery method are tailored to the customer’s situational
requirements and can change at any time. Generalized descriptions of the briefings are below:
   4.2.1. 374 AW Staff Meetings. For briefings at the 374 AW or 374 OG level, the weather
   data presented usually consists of a 5-day outlook of forecasted weather limitations to
   operations at major AOR installations and the Yokota Extended Outlook forecast product.
   Also included are off-station operations, weather forecasts for upcoming events, and
   significant weather phenomena such as natural disasters. Tropical cyclone forecasts and
   analysis are included when tropical cyclones are in the AOR.
   4.2.2. USFJ and 5 AF Staff Meetings. Briefing content is similar to that for the 374 AW
   weather briefs. For USFJ briefings, an equal focus is placed on non-AF installations.
   Weather data for operations and upcoming events are tailored to each organization.
   4.2.3. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The 374 OSS/OSW supports EOC exercises
   and real-world events with atmospheric/environmental data as requested.
4.3. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Briefings. In person briefings will be
provided to the DTRA team as requested. At a minimum, those briefs will consist of flight
weather (take-off, en-route, and destination weather), inspection location(s) forecasted weather,
and forecasted return flight weather.
4.4. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). The 374 OSS/OSW will participate in area
indoctrination and IRC briefings upon request. The 374 AW dictates the frequency and seasonal
content of the briefings. Weather information presented at IRCs includes items such as lightning
avoidance, microburst and wind shear, monthly/seasonal climatology, seasonal severe weather
events, airfield/flight weather hazards, etc. Additionally, IRCs provide an excellent forum to
educate the customer on latest space weather forecast products and how space weather may
potentially impact their operations. The 374 OSS/OSW will work with the Yokota AB IRC
Point of Contact to finalize the weather agenda for IRC briefings. FYI 42, Instrument Refresher
Course, provides a guide to IRC procedures and can be located on the AFWA Training Division
(AFWA/DNT) web site. See AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program (IRP), for
information on the Air Force IRC program. The 374 OSS Training Flight (374 OSS/OST) will
coordinate with the 374 OSS/OSW on IRC dates/times for weather briefings.
4.5. ATC Limited Observation Program. The 374 OSS/OSW will provide initial observation
training for ATC personnel in a Limited Observation Training Program. This training is
designed to enable the Cooperative Weather Watch program and provide better “eyes forward”
for the 17 OWS. New ATC personnel who have not been trained will call the 374 OSS/OSW
and schedule an appointment with the 374 OSS/OSW Training Manager. At the end of training,
 22                                                        YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013


ATC personnel are tested for qualification and will receive a familiarization tour of the weather
station.
4.6. Climatology Briefings. The 374 OSS/OSW provides climatology information during the
374 AW Quarterly Safety Briefings. All other climatology support is provided when requested.
4.7. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The 374 OSS/OSW will
provide information to the Airfield Manager for FLIP entries. Data includes, but is not limited
to, 374 OSS/OSW operating hours, PMSV frequency, Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) contact
information, and 17 OWS contact information. Upon notification from the Airfield Manager that
new FLIPs have been published and/or on the FLIP expiration date, the 374 OSS/OSW will
validate the accuracy of the new FLIP information and take immediate steps to correct erroneous
data. In addition, the FLIPs will be reviewed for changes to SPECI criteria and the 374
OSS/OSW will take actions to update SPECI observation criteria.
4.8. Pre-Deployment Planning. The 374 AW will make every effort to include the 374
OSS/OSW in planning and operations for war, contingency and military operations other than
war. The 374 OSS/OSW leadership will do the following:
   4.8.1. Will provide pre-deployment planning briefings when requested for deploying units.
   The briefings will contain current and forecast weather, climatology for deployed location
   and other previously coordinated weather data as requested. Requirements for pre-
   deployment briefings should be identified as far in advance as possible.
       4.8.1.1. Participate in pre-deployment planning to ensure theater-specific environmental
       impacts are properly factored in the 374 AW deployment activities.
   4.8.2. Ensure personnel who are AEF deployable are prepared to successfully perform their
   duties in an austere environment with limited communication and weather data access.
   4.8.3. Verify Go/No-Go thresholds for deploying aircraft. If required, modify weather
   thresholds for the deployed locations using deployed mission and operational requirements,
   rules of engagement, and theater specific environmental impacts of the supported unit.
   4.8.4. Coordinate reach-back support from the 17 OWS if needed.
   4.8.5. Develop tactical SOPs and weather products if needed by modifying the 374
   OSS/OSW standard set of SOPs and products to incorporate major functions of tactical
   support activities (i.e., duty priorities, manual observing and augmentation of automated
   sensors). Duty priorities should be coordinated with the 374 AW.
   4.8.6. Perform operational checks on TMQ-53 and other tactical weather equipment.
   4.8.7. Ensure 374 OSS/OSW members deploying to a contingency theater follow reporting
   instructions listed on their orders, and other applicable guidance provided by the Joint
   Meteorological and Oceanographic Officer (JMO) Meteorological and Oceanographic
   (METOC) Letter of Instruction (LOI) or Expeditionary Weather Squadron/ Expeditionary
   Operations Support Squadron.
4.9. USFJ/5 AF Contingency and Exercise Support. 374 OSS/OSW personnel will be
available to provide operational support for exercises and contingencies involving USFJ or 5 AF
assets or interests as long if manning is adequate. The 374 OSS/OSW will rely on reach-back
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                               23


support from the 17 OWS which is in direct support of PAOC. This relationship ensures unified
support through the theater of weather operations.

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

5.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories (WWAs). Resource protection is
accomplished through a joint effort between the 17 OWS and the 374 OSS/OSW. The 17 OWS
is responsible for issuing all forecast products including weather watches and warnings via JET.
The 17 OWS will make contact the 374 OSS/OSW prior to issuing, extending, or cancelling a
WWA when time permits. If differences arise in the issuance, extension, or cancellation of a
WWA between the 17 OWS and the 374 OSS/OSW that cannot be resolved, the 17 OWS will be
the final issue authority. The 374 OSS/OSW acts as the “eyes forward” for 17 OWS and is
responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories during operational hours. The 374
OSS/OSW can issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property.
In this case, the 374 OSS/OSW will back brief the 17 OWS when time permits and will also be
responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the 374 OSS/OSW will
act as the alternate dissemination and notification source for the 17 OWS. The goal is to provide
the best possible resource protection to Yokota Air Base. Weather WWAs are documented in
the 374 OSS/OSW-17 OWS IDP. See Attachment 5 for customer weather limitations and
sensitivities.
   5.1.1. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to Yokota AB agencies
   indicating that conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather
   phenomena of such intensity to pose a hazard to life or property for which protective
   measures should be considered. Watches are issued for a 5 nautical mile radius of the center
   point of the Yokota runway complex. Each watch will be assigned a number following the
   two-digit number of the current month (i.e. 06-001 would be the first watch of June). Table
   5.1. contains all of the weather watches and desired lead times issued for Yokota AB.
   Forecast weather watches are issued IAW AFI 10-229, AFMAN 15-129V1, and local
   requirements.

   5.1.2. Weather Warnings. Weather Warnings (WW) are special notices provided to an
   installation personnel/operational user to notify them when an established weather condition
   of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is occurring or is expected to occur.
   Weather warnings provide concise information outlining environmental threats and are used
   by the 374 AW to make resource protection decisions. Warnings are issued for a 5 nautical
   mile radius of the center-point of the Yokota AB runway complex. Each warning will be
   assigned a number following the two-digit number of the current month (i.e., 06-001 would
   be the first warning of June). Forecast warnings and desired lead times are contained in
   Table 5.3. Forecast weather warnings are issued IAW AFI 10-229, AFMAN 15-129V1, and
   local requirements.
      5.1.2.1. Observed Lightning WWs. Lightning Warnings are issued when lightning is
      observed or detected within 5 nautical miles of the airfield IAW AFI 91-203, Air Force
      Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction.
      5.1.2.2. The 374 OSS/OSW will issue and cancel observed lightning WWs during duty
      hours. When issuing or canceling an observed lightning WW, the 374 OSS/OSW will
      provide timely notification to supported units IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66, General
      Industrial Operations, and 91-100 and the 17 OWS IAW the 17 OWS – 374 OSS/OSW
      IDP.
      5.1.2.3. The 374 OSS/OSW will issue observed lightning warnings separately from, and
      at times, concurrent with a 17 OWS issued warning for any other criteria. The observed
      lightning and tornado WW is the only warning that may be issued separately from
      warnings for other criteria.
      5.1.2.4. The 374 OSS/OSW will include a statement in the lightning and tornado WW
      cancellation message indicating the effect on any previously issued warnings.
      5.1.2.5. During non-duty hours, the 17 OWS may issue and cancel observed lightning
      warnings IAW the 17 OWS – 374 OSS/OSW IDP. The 17 OWS will issue observed
      WW for hazards that affect airfield operations during 374 OSS/OSW non-duty hours
      when the airfield is open.

        5.1.2.6. For the Tama Service Annex, the warning for lightning within 5 nautical miles
        will be issued anytime the phenomenon is occurring. The 17 OWS will utilize AFW-
        WEBS/JET to METWATCH for lightning impacts to the Tama Service Annex. If the
        web based tools are indicating lightning the 17 OWS will call personnel at the annex to
        verify that lightning is occurring. The 17 OWS will then contact the 374 AW/CP with
        specifics on the lightning watch, and the 374 AW/CP will notify the Tama Service
        Annex.

   5.1.4. WWA Upgrades and Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e.
   winds increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet
   the desired lead-times specified above. Only one forecast warning may be in effect at a
   time except when observed lightning has been issued.
   5.1.5. WWA Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be
   issued to change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning
   expires. New warnings and watches will be issued for any changes in weather criteria.
   5.1.6. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be cancelled when the weather
   phenomena are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not cancelled, they
   will expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be cancelled when the
   criteria is no longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour.
   5.1.7. WWA Dissemination. The primary mode of dissemination is through JET. If it is out
   of service, the 17 OWS and/or 374 OSS/OSW will call each agency as indicated in the
   notification trees in Attachment 6.
5.2. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). SWAP is in place to ensure that the 374
OSS/OSW has sufficient personnel available during potential/actual severe weather or natural
disaster events which may have significant impacts on operations and/or personnel. See Table

   5.2.1. SWAP Activation. SWAP can be activated by either the 374 OSS/OSW or the 17
   OWS. When the 17 OWS issues a WWA that meets SWAP criteria, the 17 OWS will notify,
   the duty forecaster or the stand-by forecaster to start the SWAP procedures. If unable to
   reach the primary stand-by forecaster, 17 OWS will notify the 374 CP who will then contact
   the 374 OSS/OSW leadership. Whoever is notified first will assume SWAP team lead
   responsibilities and will implement SWAP procedures.
   5.2.2. SWAP Initiation. The SWAP team lead will do the following:
       5.2.2.1. Notify OIC, NCOIC or WWO of SWAP implementation and assess the need for
       additional personnel.
       5.2.2.2. Increase METWATCH/MISSIONWATCH using available tools (i.e., radar,
       METSAT, lightning surveillance, etc.)
       5.2.2.3. Relay vital weather information to the 374 AW/CP in a timely manner. Prepare
       and/or coordinate WWA issuance with 17 OWS
       5.2.2.4. Augment observing equipment as required (“Eyes Forward” support to the 17
       OWS).
       5.2.2.5. Ensure meteorological discussions coordinated with the 17 OWS.
       5.2.2.6. Verify horizontal consistency with WWA’s, MWP, and TAF.
       5.2.2.7. Document all actions in the shift log.
       5.2.2.8. Update unit and wing leadership as required.
       5.2.2.9. Ensure proper OPREP-3 information is passed to 374 CP, PACAF A3TX & 17
       OWS following the occurrence of severe weather.
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                   29


       5.2.2.10. Archive local data for future review and sharing with the 17 OWS.
5.3. Tropical Cyclone Procedures. The 374 OSS/OSW will monitor all tropical storms or
typhoons that are forecasted to track within 300nm of a USFJ installation as forecasted by the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). They will keep 374 AW, USJF, and 5 AF leadership
informed of the current situation and forecast track of the storm. No deviation from the official
forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity trend is authorized;
however, 374 OSS/OSW will also stress that the accuracy of the forecasts beyond 72 hours is
subject to a wide margin of error.
   5.3.1. The 374 OSS/OSW will provide tropical cyclone briefings as requested by the 374
   AW, USFJ, and 5 AF leadership. Briefings are typically conducted through 374 OG
   meetings, verbally with 374 AW leadership, at Stand-up Briefings and/or Crisis Action Team
   (CAT) meetings, and/or through tropical cyclone update emails.
       5.3.1.1. In the event the 374 AW decides to evacuate aircraft, the 374 OSS/OSW will
       provide mass weather briefings at both squadron locations as needed.
   5.3.2. TCCOR levels are conditions of readiness designed to guide personnel in preparations
   for a tropical cyclone impact. Per USFJI 15-4001, TCCOR level(s) are issued for the Kanto
   Plain. The TCCOR authority is COMUSFJ and authority is normally delegated to the
   USFJ/J3. The OSS/OSW is responsible for providing USFJ/J3 with TCCOR
   recommendations as outlined in USFJ Instruction 15-4001, Tropical Cyclone Conditions of
   Readiness (TCCOR) for all installations within the Kanto Plain (Yokota AB, NAF Atsugi,
   Camp Zama, and Camp Fuji) as well as 374 AW leadership TCCOR recommendations for
   Yokota AB (see Table 5.7.).
       5.3.2.1. If the Kanto Plain is expected to be impacted by a tropical storm, the 374
       OSS/OSW will convene and facilitate a tropical cyclone conference call for bases located
       in the Kanto Plain to discuss the forecasted storm effects across the region and potential
       TCCOR recommendations. Forecasters from JTWC, 17 OWS, Camp Zama, Atsugi
       NAS, and Yokosuka will be invited to attend.
       5.3.2.2. Once the TCCOR authority has declared a change in levels, the 374 OSS/OSW
       will assist in dissemination of the TCCOR announcement to numerous agencies
       throughout the Kanto Plain.
       5.3.2.3. Tropical cyclone update emails will be provided every 12 hours until TCCOR 4
       has been declared for the Kanto Plain. When TCCOR 4 has been declared for the Kanto
       Plain, email updates will be provided every six hours and the 374 OSS/OSW will
       implement SWAP.

Table 5.7. TCCOR Criteria and Destructive Winds
Destructive Winds is defined as 50 knots sustained or greater.
TCCOR 4                 Destructive winds are possible within 72 hours.
TCCOR 3                 Destructive winds are possible within 48 hours.
TCCOR 2                 Destructive winds anticipated within 24 hours.
TCCOR 1                 Destructive winds anticipated within 12 hours.
TCCOR 1 Caution*        Winds of 35-49 knots sustained are occurring on the installation.
TCCOR 1                 Winds 50 knots sustained or greater are occurring on the installation.
Emergency
TCCOR Recovery*         After the passage of a TC when destructive winds have subsided, work
                        and survey crews are sent out to determine the extent of damage and to
                        establish safe zones around hazards. Until the recovery process is
                        declared complete (TCCOR All Clear), the general base population
                        would normally be asked to remain indoors.
TCCOR All Clear*        The storm is over and not forecast to return and recovery efforts are
                        considered complete by the installation commander.
TCCOR Storm             The storm is over and not forecast to return (declared by the TCCOR
Clear                   Authority).
TCCOR Storm             The winds are not forecast to exceed 50 knots but there still exists a
Watch                   probability of high winds due to the proximity of the storm. The storm is
                        also close enough to the area that a heightened alert status is necessary
                        in order to rapidly establish regular TCCOR condition should the storm
                        deviate from the forecast track. Personnel should follow Standard
                        Operation Procedures for TCCOR Storm Watch and stay alert for any
                        changes to TCCOR status
* Note: For Yokota AB, the TCCOR Authority is the USFJ J3; however, TCCOR 1
Caution/Emergency/Recovery/All Clear is delegated to the Installation Commander by the
TCCOR Authority.

   5.3.3. 17 OWS Support. The 17 OWS will perform the METWATCH and serve as the
   primary liaison between JTWC and the 374 OSS/OSW.
       5.3.3.1. When tropical storms are forecasted to impact USJF installations within 96
       hours, the 17 OWS will generate a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-
       TAP) bulletin for tropical cyclone support as outlined in PACAFI 15-101. Every effort
       will be made to have a fully coordinated TC-TAP in effect NLT 90 minutes after the
       latest JTWC warning posted and the 374 OSS/OSW will utilize the information when
       making TCCOR recommendations.
YOKOTAABI15-101 6 JUNE 2013                                                                  31


       5.3.3.2. The TC-TAP bulletin produced for Yokota AB will include all mandatory items
       highlighted in PACAFI 15-101 and in the 374 OSS/OSW-17 OWS IDP. These items
       include the operationally significant parameters listed in Table 5.8

   Amount of heavy precipitation expected

       5.3.3.3. WWAs will be issued until Yokota AB is directed to implement TCCOR 1.
       Although individual watches and warnings will not be issued, all WWA (with the
       exception of frozen precipitation due to the nature of tropical cyclones), are considered
       possible after such time that Yokota AB assumes TCCOR 1. WWA issuance will resume
       after TCCOR All Clear has been declared.
5.4. Emergency/Crisis Action Response. In the event of an aircraft or ground mishap, the 374
OSS/OSW will do the following:
   5.4.1. Make a log of the incident to include as much known data about the incident.
   5.4.2. Increase METWATCH.
       5.4.2.1. When the FMQ-19 is in automated observing mode, forecasters will reassess the
       weather conditions from the official observation point to ensure the FMQ-19 is reporting
       correctly and supplement weather conditions if needed.
       5.4.2.2. If the FMQ-19 is in augmentation back-up mode, forecasters will take and
       disseminate a SPECI observation.
   5.4.3. Inform 374 OSS/OSW flight leadership of the incident.
   5.4.4. Inform the 17 OWS of the incident and request a data save be completed by the 17
   OWS (or the appropriate servicing OWS if the mission crossed AORs).
   5.4.5. Create a mishap folder and save the following weather data and products produced at
   least 12 hours prior to the incident thru 2 hours after the incident: radar images, METSAT
   imagery, JET incident archive, upper air and surface analysis package, hazard charts, JMA
   PIREP and SIGMET chart(s), TAFs and observations (departure point, destination, and
   alternates), WWAs, nearest upper air sounding, copies of briefing material (DD Form 175-1,
   MEF, Verbal Brief Log, etc), form 3813 and/or 3803, current/previous forecasts and surface
   observations near the location of the incident.

     5.4.6. Save all weather data/products to a CD, deliver to the Airfield Manager OIC for
     inclusion into their mishap archive and inform Wing Safety that the weather archive is
     complete and with airfield management.
5.5. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPs. The 374 OSS/OSW leadership will submit
OPREP-3 data IAW AFMAN 15-129, Air and Space Weather Operations- Exploitation, AFI 10-
229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, and AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, when one
of the following occurs:
     5.5.1. A severe weather event. A severe weather event is defined as winds greater than or
     equal to 50kts, hail greater than or equal to ¾ inch, and/or a tornado.
     5.5.2. When the 374 CP requests weather information due to damage/mishap report(s) or
     significant impacts on operations. Typically these requests are a result of winds greater than
     or equal to 50kts, hail greater than or equal to ¾ inch, tornadoes, lightning strikes, snow
     storm, heavy rain, tropical cyclone, TCCOR declaration/changes.
     5.5.3. The 374 OSS/OSW will provide the information listed in Table 5.9. to the 374 CP,
     PACAF A3TX, and the 17 OWS.
        5.5.3.1. Should the 374 CP submit an OPREP-3 report, they will provide a copy to the
        374 OSS/OSW. The 374 OSS/OSW will then forward that report to PACAF A3TX and
        the 17 OWS.
