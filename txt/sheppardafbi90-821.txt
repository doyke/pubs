        accordance with AFI 90-821.
2.5. Employee Information and Training:
     2.5.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors and employees of work areas using
     hazardous materials receive training.
     2.5.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained on the AF HAZCOM program
     before the workers handle or are occupationally exposed to hazardous materials. The
     supervisor, the organization occupational health coordinator, or other formal organization
     training structure may provide this training. Supervisors will supplement this training to
     provide information on work area specific chemical hazards. Training for newly assigned
     personnel will normally be completed within 15 days of assignment.
     2.5.3. In conjunction with the industrial hygiene survey, BE will identify shop-specific items
     requiring training (i.e., OSHA Expanded Standards). Supervisors will develop lesson plans
     covering the training items with help from PH and BE. Supervisors will conduct annual
     occupational health training for all workers using the latest BE industrial hygiene/special
     survey reports.
     2.5.4. All training will be documented on AF Form 55 or equivalent.
     2.5.5. Computer-based HAZCOM Training is available on the AETC Environmental Safety
     and Occupational Health Training Network (ESOHTN) website: https://aetc.esohtn.com/.
     This training may be used for initial training or to supplement shop-specific training. A
     certificate is awarded upon completion of the training.
2.6. Hazardous Chemical Inventory:
     2.6.1. The work area supervisor will develop the Hazardous Chemical Inventory. BE will
     review this inventory during periodic surveys.
     2.6.2. The supervisors will maintain the Hazardous Chemical Inventory in Tab C of their
     HAZCOM binder and update it as necessary.
     2.6.3. As a minimum, the inventory will include the identity of each hazardous chemical
     used in the work area, as it appears on the SDS or as cross-referenced by national stock
     number. The inventory may be compiled from EESOHMIS. Proprietary information will not
     be included on the Hazardous Chemical Inventory. This inventory must include all materials
     used for all tasks within the workplace even if purchased with IMPAC card.
2.7. Contractor Operations.
     2.7.1. The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM information
     for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
SHEPPARDAFBI90-821 18 JUNE 2014                                                                7


   program. MSDS’s may be used until an approved SDS is available or current stock is
   exhausted.
   2.7.2. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), (82 CONS/LGCB, 676-5185), with
   assistance from BE (82 AMDS/SGPB, 676-3080), and work area supervisor, if requested,
   will advise contractors of hazardous chemicals they may encounter and protective measures
   needed in the normal course of their work in this work area. The ACO will also inform the
   contractor that SDS information is available through the HAZMAT Pharmacy (82
   LRS/LGSSDH, 676-6333), Environmental (PAE, 676-7842) and/or BE (82 AMDS/SGPB,
   676-3080) and provide information on the labeling system.
   2.7.3. Non-resident contractors will provide the ACO/QAE current and correct SDSs for all
   hazardous materials they intend to bring on base in performance of their contract.
   2.7.4. At the pre-performance conference, and subsequently during the contract performance
   period, the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator will advise work area supervisors
   and AF employees monitoring the performance of contractors of hazardous chemicals
   introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on the use of
   hazardous materials according to FAR clause 5352.223.9002, Hazardous Material
   Identification and Material Safety Data, or a subsequently adopted equivalent provision to
   CE Environmental (PAE, 676-7842).
2.8. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials:
   2.8.1. Non-routine tasks are:
      2.8.1.1. Those tasks included with a work area’s activities but performed infrequently;
      for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent or cleaning up spills.
      2.8.1.2. Temporary duties performed outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty
      Code (AFSC) or job series.
   2.8.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in the work area
   which involve hazardous materials. This list will be maintained in Tab F of the HAZCOM
   book and updates to the list will be sent to BE. The supervisor will ensure work area OIs
   thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards and controls for the infrequent
   tasks performed in the work area. Operating instructions do not need to be prepared if
   technical orders or other official documents adequately describe these tasks and the
   protective measures. Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before
   performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.8.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the activity will ensure these workers have received the following training prior to beginning
   the activity:
      2.8.3.1. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area-specific chemical hazards and
      associated controls.
      2.8.3.2. The supervisor of the non-routine task will forward training documentation to
      the worker’s regular supervisor describing the training conducted.
2.9. Ordering, Handling or Using Potentially Hazardous Materials:
8                                                    SHEPPARDAFBI90-821 18 JUNE 2014


    2.9.1. AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, establishes procedures and
    standards for all hazardous materials except munitions, medical supply items and hazardous
    waste. The base HAZMART (784-7981) manages hazardous material procurement on
    Cannon AFB.
    2.9.2. Anyone ordering hazardous materials must enter a request into EESOHMIS and
    provide a copy of the manufacturer-specific SDS to the base HAZMART. Personnel will not
    borrow chemicals from other work areas.
    2.9.3. A joint review by the supervisor and BE will precede all newly planned uses of
    potentially hazardous materials. Tech data, hazardous material information, SDS and other
    BE resources shall be carefully reviewed to properly identify any hazards and to assign
    necessary controls. Items especially critical in this review include labeling of containers
    (especially proper labeling of in-shop containers), ventilation, fire protection, personal
    protective and first-aid equipment, training (general hazard familiarization), chemical
    disposal, and written procedures.
