This interim change corrects administrative errors and omissions and clarifies select areas of the original
document. All items in this change will be incorporated in the next revision of this document. This
change consolidates Air Force pre-launch mishap investigation guidance and implements Air Force Pol-
icy Directive 91-2, Safety Programs. Major Commands (MAJCOM) may supplement this standard when
additional or more stringent safety criteria are required. Lower-level organizations, installation and
above, may also supplement this standard. MAJCOMs will approve these supplements. Report conflicts
in guidance between this standard, federal standards, or other Air Force directive in writing through MAJ-
COM space safety offices to Headquarters Air Force Safety Center, Space Safety Division, Space Safety
Branch (HQ AFSC/SESS), 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 120B, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670. Ensure that

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This INTERIM CHANGE (IC 2005-1) documents, correct administrative errors, and clarifies references
to standards and other portions of this document. Guidance in this change takes precedence over the basic
document. Paragraphs listed below replace similarly numbered paragraphs in the basic document, unless
otherwise noted. This IC also updates the address list in Table A3.2. of AFMAN 91-222 to more accu-
rately reflect the appropriate space organizations and remove addresses not related to space operations for
mishap reporting and prevention purposes. In addition, it clarifies the definition of primary and secondary
mission. Finally, it identifies the class of mishap for tertiary missions since new technology allows
numerous missions to be located on one satellite.
POSTING INSTRUCTIONS: Include a copy of this change with any printed copy of AFMAN 91-222.

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General Information: This manual, in conjunction with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
Reports, provides guidance for investigating and reporting Air Force space mishaps. The sole purpose of
these safety investigations is to prevent future mishaps. Space mishaps do not generally involve DoD air-
craft, weapons (conventional, nuclear or directed energy), or nuclear reactors. In special circumstances
(i.e. a nuclear reactor aboard a satellite), cross-category involvement may occur. When reporting multiple
categories refer to the appropriate AFMANs for additional guidance. Investigations to gather evidence for
claims, litigation, disciplinary and adverse administrative actions, and for all purposes other than mishap
prevention are not covered by this manual.

1.2. Space Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
   1.2.1. Report any unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences that meets the definition of a space
   mishap and can be classified IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 1.
   1.2.2. Investigate and report damage, injury or illness to Air Force space resources as a space mishap.
   This includes, but is not limited to, the following specific situations:
       1.2.2.1. The loss or damage of Air Force space systems during launch or processing on commer-
       cially procured launch systems or services.
       1.2.2.2. Damage, injury or illness to Air Force space resources that results from government con-
       tractor operations. Refer to AFI 91-204 Chapter 4 for additional guidance.
       1.2.2.3. The loss or damage of a system that a DoD Component has development and/or procure-
       ment responsibility.
       1.2.2.4. Injury, illness, or physiological episodes during space system operation or space system
       processing.
       1.2.2.5. Damage or loss of space vehicles in space when caused by natural phenomena for which
       it was designed to withstand. Don’t report the damage or loss if it is the result of unexpected and
       unavoidable natural phenomena. For example, the loss of a space vehicle due to collision with a
       large, previously undetected meteoroid would not be reportable.
       1.2.2.6. Do not report normal residual damage as the result of a space launch.
   1.2.3. Investigate and report damage, injury or illness caused by Air Force space resources as a space
   mishap. This includes, but is not limited to, the following specific situations:
       1.2.3.1. The impact of a space system and its associated debris or hazardous effects outside pre-
       dicted limit parameters.
       1.2.3.2. A non-DoD launch that is adversely affected in any way by Air Force space range person-
       nel or equipment (does not include normal authorized destruct).
       1.2.3.3. The failure of Air Force space range safety procedures or processes to adequately protect
       the public or DoD operations from damage or injury (e.g. loading fuel, testing high pressure
       equipment).

    1.2.4. In the event a space mishap results in a radiological mishap, as defined by AFMAN 91-221,
    Weapons and Nuclear Safety Investigations and Reports, comply with the additional guidance in
    AFMAN 91-221. Ensure OPREP reports are sent and attach the appropriate flagword to all mishap
    messages. Continue to investigate and report the space mishap per the instructions in this manual.
    Additionally, ensure that the investigation and report addresses the radiological mishap.
    1.2.5. (Added-AFSPC) Spacecraft bus system anomalies which do not meet any of the above crite-
    ria, will be reviewed by Wing Safety to determine if they shall be investigated as Class E events and
    reported as High Accident Potential (HAP) based on their potential of causing mission failures in
    future occurrences on similar operational capabilities and systems.

1.3. Space Mishap Categories. Categorize space mishaps using one of the following:
    1.3.1. Space, Pre-Launch: Space mishaps occurring during ground handling, processing and transpor-
    tation operations.
       1.3.1.1. Mishaps limited to components or equipment commonly used in non-space applications,
       and not specifically configured for space related use, are not space mishaps. Categorize these mis-
       haps as ground and industrial, industrial space IAW AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety Investiga-
       tions and Reports.
    1.3.2. Space, Launch: Space mishaps occurring during launch vehicle operations, including upper
    stages. This includes payloads that do not obtain orbit and range safety system failures.
    1.3.3. Space, Orbit: Space mishaps occurring during spacecraft operations after separation from all
    launch vehicle components, including upper stages and transfer motors.
    1.3.4. Categorize mishaps involving more than one category IAW AFI 91-204 and ensure that the
    proper cross-category involvement is used from the look-up tables in Attachment 6.
    1.3.5. (Added-AFSPC) Mishaps dealing with Unique Space Support Equipment shall be investi-
    gated as Space Mishaps. This category will be used on space systems that are ground based unique not
    directly related to space launch and not directly used in support of orbital operations, such as satellite
    command and control operations. Examples include warning, surveillance, space control, and system
    integration.

1.4. Space Mishap and Event Classifications.
    1.4.1. Mishaps. Classify space mishaps according to the total direct mishap cost, the severity of injury
    and/or the loss of mission capability by an on-orbit asset. Use the definitions in AFI 91-204, Chapter
    1, to classify space mishaps as Class A, B, C or D. Use AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, to classify Class E
    events.
    1.4.2. Additionally, for orbital mishaps prior to the end of the design life, use the mishap’s effect on
    primary or secondary mission capability (MC) to classify the mishap as Class A or B. Primary does
    not necessarily mean just one mission. Satellites could have more than one primary mission as defined
    by an Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Secondary missions also could include more than
    one mission as defined by the ORD.
       1.4.2.1. Classify permanent loss of primary MC as a Class A mishap.
       1.4.2.2. Classify permanent loss of a secondary MC as a Class B mishap.
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                      7


     1.4.2.3. Classify the permanent degradation of primary or secondary MC as a Class B mishap.
     1.4.2.4. In general, a part or system failure that does not affect primary, secondary, or tertiary MC
     is not a mishap per AFI 91-204.
     1.4.2.5. Tertiary mission failures include all missions not listed in the ORD as either primary or
     secondary mission categories. Any permanent failure/degradation of a tertiary mission is classi-
     fied as a Class C mishap.
     1.4.2.5. (AFSPC) Includes a ride-along system that is not part of the primary or secondary mis-
     sions. Its failure will not impact primary or secondary missions.
     1.4.2.6. (Added-AFSPC) Additionally, report Space Class, B, and C Mishaps and Class E Events
     as follows:
     Class B - Permanent Degradation of a Mission Capability, payload becomes non MC
     Class C - Permanent Degradation of a Mission Capability, payload remains MC
     Class E - Preventable temporary Degradation of a Mission Capability.
     Class E - Permanent loss of mission data
         1.4.2.6.1. (Added-AFSPC) Class B - Permanent Degradation of a primary or secondary Mis-
         sion Capability and the (primary or secondary) payload becomes non Mission Capable. Exam-
         ples: Class B - Permanent loss of Crosslinks, but alternate path remains. Class B - loss of
         ability to control antennas, alternate path function remains; but is severely degraded.
         1.4.2.6.2. (Added-AFSPC) Class C - Permanent Degradation of a Mission Capability, (pri-
         mary or secondary) but the payload remains Mission Capable. Examples: Class C - Permanent
         degradation of primary or secondary mission capability, but the payload remains mission
         capable since “back-up” components are available on the satellite. Class C - Loss of Nuller
         capability. Alternate path, Crosslinks, and Reportback missions remain functional. Add "Pay-
         load has switched to a redundant system." after "…remains Mission Capable."
         1.4.2.6.3. (Added-AFSPC) Class C - Permanent Failure or Degradation of a tertiary Mission.
         Example: Loss of Reportback function. Alternate path and Crosslinks remain functional.
         1.4.2.6.4. (Added-AFSPC) Class E - Temporary Degradation of any Mission Capability in
         excess of ORD threshold.
         1.4.2.6.5. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC units will treat "failing to function properly" in the solar
         environment as follows:
             1.4.2.6.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) Satellites bus or payloads that fail to operate in their design
             environment constitute a mishap or Class E event.
             1.4.2.6.5.2. (Added-AFSPC) Satellites that fail to operate in environments exceeding
             their design environments do not constitute mishaps or events.
  1.4.3. Events. Classify any hazardous event that has a high potential for becoming a mishap as Class
  E. These events do not meet other reportable mishap classification criteria. They are deemed impor-
  tant to investigate/report for mishap prevention. As a minimum, report the following:
     1.4.3.1. An unplanned creation of orbital debris by an Air Force space system.
8                                                       AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


       1.4.3.2. An unplanned temporary loss or degradation of primary, secondary, or tertiary MC of an
       on-orbit asset for greater than 48 hours (see AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Rule 1R).
           1.4.3.2.1. If the loss or degradation is later deemed permanent, upgrade the mishap to the
           appropriate Class A or B using AFI 91-204, Chapter 1.
           1.4.3.2.2. Do not report a temporary loss or degradation of MC due to a component failure
           after end of design life.
       1.4.3.3. A collision avoidance maneuver by an on-orbit Air Force spacecraft. Include the miss
       distance and time until predicted collision at the point when the maneuver was performed.
           1.4.3.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Normal, scheduled station keeping maneuvers by an on-orbit Air
           Force spacecraft that increase the miss distance are smart operations and not reportable.
           1.4.3.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) A collision avoidance maneuver by an on-orbit Air Force space-
           craft that is necessary to increase the miss distance by burning fuel “down-hill” are reportable
           as Class E Events.
       1.4.3.4. The accidental escape or spillage of dangerous (toxic, caustic, or corrosive) material that
       results in an individual receiving a precautionary checkup.
       1.4.3.5. A failure of a commercial space system also commonly used by the Air Force to capture
       information on lessons learned.
    1.4.4. If required, change mishap classifications IAW AFI 91-204.

1.5. Space Mishap Costs.
    1.5.1. Determine mishap costs IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 1.
    1.5.2. Contacting the single manager (SM) is generally the most useful place to start for space mis-
    haps. Cost models available from the SAF/FMC web site, http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil (AFCaa Tab,
    Cost Tools button) may be useful.

gation board (SIB) presidents and single investigating officers (SIO) to facilitate effective safety investi-
gations. Ideally, individuals should be identified prior to each launch.

2.3. Commanders of Air Force Space Launch Ranges.
2.3. (AFSPC) Commanders of Air Force Space Launch Ranges. In AFSPC, the range commanders
are the 30 SW Commander and the 45 SW Commander or their designated representative.
   2.3.1. Prior to each launch from their range, commanders of Air Force space launch ranges must:
       2.3.1.1. Identify and notify organizations that will incur investigation responsibility in the event a
       mishap were to occur.
       2.3.1.2. Identify an Interim Safety Board (ISB) President (regardless of who is conducting the
       launch).
       2.3.1.3. (Added-AFSPC) Identify ISB members by name.
   2.3.2. Range commanders must notify HQ AFSC/SES and FAA/AST (FAA Combined Operations
   Center, (202) 267-3333) if a commercial space vehicle is involved in a mishap on their installation.
   2.3.2. (AFSPC) During launch of a commercial space vehicle from an Air Force facility, the on-site
   FAA/AST representative will normally fulfill this notification requirement.
   2.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Investigating Mishaps Involving Joint National Aeronautical and Space
   Administration (NASA) and Air Force operations or use of AFSPC ranges. A joint mishap investiga-
   tion plan will be developed prior to any NASA operation that involves an AFSPC launch facility. HQ
   AFSPC/SE in conjunction with Space and Missile Center (SMC)/SE or NAF/SE will ensure the plan
   assigns responsibilities and interfaces with any Memorandum of Agreements (MOA) should a mishap
   investigation be required. Space Wing Commanders will notify HQ AFSPC/SE through SMC or
   NAF/SE of any proposed operation that will involve NASA from an AFSPC range.
       2.3.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) A mishap involving a NASA payload aboard a commercial rocket

2.4. Unit Commanders: The commander of the first Air Force organization to become aware of a space
mishap will notify the organization with control authority over the affected space system.

2.5. Interim Safety Board (ISB) President. The ISB President, under certain circumstances, may have
to interface with non-Air Force organizations (NRO, FAA, NTSB, NASA commercial vendors) when a
mishap occurs on an Air Force space launch range. Whenever possible, agreements should be put into
place before such a launch to define the ISB President’s role with respect to wreckage and evidence
owned by non-Air Force organizations. As an example, the NTSB will normally not wish for the ISB
President to conduct interviews. See AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigation,
Chapter 2, for a discussion of ISB responsibilities.
     2.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) This requirement also applies to the SIDC and SMC, and to Space Wings
     with either on-orbit or ground based space system missions.
     2.5.2. (Added-AFSPC) The requirement for the ISB president to interact with non-Air Force agen-
     cies also applies to Space Wings with space missions, SIDC and SMC when a mishap occurs within
     these space operations/tests/development missions areas. Whenever possible, agreements should be
     put into place before the space event occurs to define the ISB President’s role with respect to data,
     wreckage, evidence, etc owned by non-Air Force organizations. As an example, the NTSB or FAA
     will normally not wish for the ISB President to conduct interviews if the mishap was caused by a com-
     mercial FAA/FCC licensed satellite or launch vehicle.

2.6. 30SW and 45SW Safety Staffs.
     2.6.1. For FAA licensed launches from Air Force ranges, safety staffs will ensure mishap investiga-
     tion and reporting agreements specify that the Air Force will be invited to participate as an observer
     on the space system owner’s investigation board.
     2.6.2. For Air Force launches, safety staffs will ensure contracts specify the requirement to notify the
     Air Force when Air Force property damage occurs and furnish investigation results and report to the
     Air Force in the event of a mishap. Additionally, contracts must allow for an Air Force representative
     to observe the contractor mishap investigation.

                                                Chapter 4

                      DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. General Information. Unless otherwise stated, the mishap owner (as determined IAW AFI 91-204,
chapter 4) has investigative responsibility for the mishap. Determine the convening authority IAW AFI
91-204, Chapter 4.

4.2. Determining Space Mishap Ownership. Assign ownership of the mishap to the MAJCOM respon-
sible for the space system at the time of the mishap.
     4.2.1. For satellites, assign mishap ownership to the MAJCOM with control authority.
        4.2.1.1. Control authority for an on-orbit space system, or the debris associated with it, does not
        end until: reentry and touchdown on Earth; transfer of responsibility to an agency outside of the
        Air Force; or injection into an Earth-escape trajectory (unless required for mission). Control
        authority does not end when a space system is placed into a non-operational orbit.
        4.2.1.2. For satellites that are no longer functional, the last organization with control authority
        still owns the mishap.
     4.2.2. For launch vehicles, including upper stages, the launch operator is assigned “ownership” for
     the mishap unless an HQ AFSC approved memorandum of agreement (MOA) is in place specifying
     transfer of ownership to another agency.

4.3. Mishaps Involving Commercial Spacelift. When an Air Force mishap occurs as the result of com-
mercial launch services, assign mishap ownership to the organization owning the damaged Air Force
equipment or injured personnel. Refer to AFI 91-204 Chapter 4 for additional guidance.
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                     13


                                               Chapter 5

                                    SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. Conduct space mishap investigations using a Safety Investigation Board
(SIB) or a Single Investigating Officer (SIO). Conduct these investigations IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 5,
and the following space-specific guidance.
   5.1.1. For Class A Space Mishaps, investigate using a SIB. When the mishap is limited to Air Force
   property damage caused solely by a commercial space system or service a SIO may be used. The
   investigation must be conducted according to the appropriate mishap investigation and reporting
   agreements. Contact MAJCOM safety offices for guidance on agreements with the FAA, NTSB,
   NASA, and the responsible commercial entity.
   5.1.2. For Class B and C Space Mishaps, use a SIB or an SIO as appropriate.
   5.1.3. For Class E Space Events use an SIO, supported by any accepted anomaly resolution process
   when factual analysis is required.
   5.1.4. Initially investigate orbit mishaps using an anomaly resolution process. When enough informa-
   tion is gathered to classify the event as a mishap, transition to a mishap investigation.
   5.1.5. When the primary investigation is conducted by another organization (FAA, NTSB, NASA,
   space system owner) send an Air Force observer to monitor the investigation.
   5.1.6. To ensure the investigation considers all areas, consult AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Avia-
   tion Safety Investigation.

5.2. Space Mishap Investigation Timelines.
   5.2.1. All timeline milestones start from the day a mishap is declared. This is normally the same time
   that the mishap occurs. However, especially for on-orbit systems, there may be a delay between the
   actual mishap and the determination that a mishap has occurred.
   5.2.1. (AFSPC) The wing/center commander advises the AFSPC/CC on when to declare a mishap
   for all on-orbit mishaps.
   5.2.2. The SIB investigation should be completed in less than 90 days for Class A mishaps and 45
   days for all other mishaps. This is longer than the time for other mishaps due to the complexity of the
   data recovery and engineering analysis process of space mishaps. Refer to Table A3.1. for reporting
   and routing requirements.
   5.2.3. If circumstances prevent the SIB from meeting this timeline, the board president may request
   up to a 90-day extension from the convening authority (IAW AFI 91-204 paragraph 1.2.). If granted
   the convening authority must notify HQ AFSC/SES. If unique circumstances prevent the SIB from
   finishing within this timeframe, the convening authority must request a waiver, with an estimated
   completion date, from HQ USAF/SE.

5.3. Investigation Funding for Space Mishaps.
   5.3.1. Follow the funding guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, for most space mishaps.
   5.3.2. Funding for Space, Commercial Mishaps.
14                                                       AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


        5.3.2.1. In general, if the commercial launch occurs at a commercial facility that is not located on
        an Air Force installation, then the host-installation is the home base of the investigating organiza-
        tion and it is responsible for providing and funding local support.
        5.3.2.2. Multiple host-installations may be needed to properly investigate these mishaps. The
        closest Air Force bases to the mishap site, to the contractor’s investigation location and to the
        investigation organization’s home location should be prepared to fund and provide in-house sup-
        port at the request of the board president.
        5.3.2.3. MAJCOMs shall provide a fund cite with the orders forming an SIB to expedite the
        investigation.
        5.3.2.4. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 5 (Other Support and Cost Overruns), for expenses that exceed
        the resources of the host installation.

5.4. Space Mishap Investigation Elements.
     5.4.1. Safety Investigation Board (SIB): Primary vehicle for conducting a formal safety investigation.
     See Chapter 5 of AFI 91-204 for specific membership requirements and responsibilities. It may be tai-
     lored as appropriate by the convening authority. Refer to AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, for additional guid-
     ance.
     5.4.2. Engineering Analysis Group (EAG): Acts as the engineering authority for the mishap and con-
     ducts a technical examination of mishap data. It provides important factual (non-privileged) analysis
     to the SIB and the AIB and assures that factual information is released as soon as possible to the Com-
     mercial Space Industry. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and
     Laboratory Analysis, for additional guidance.
     5.4.3. Anomaly Resolution Process: Conducted to investigate problems associated with an on-orbit
     space system by the squadron operating the space vehicle. Follow the guidance for conducting an
     engineering analysis, Chapter 5 of AFI 91-204 to prevent the results of the process from becoming
     privileged. See paragraph 5.9.1.1. and Figure 5.2. for details on how anomaly resolution interfaces
     with safety investigations.
     5.4.4. Accident Investigation Board (AIB): Convened to gather and preserve evidence for claims, lit-
     igation, disciplinary and adverse administrative actions, and for all purposes other than mishap pre-
     vention. The safety investigation has priority over the accident investigation. The AIB also functions
     as a doorway for releasing information to the EAG and the public IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace Acci-
     dent Investigations.

5.5. Space Mishap Investigation Composition, Qualifications and Key Responsibilities. T h e s i z e
and membership of the SIB depend on the category of mishap being investigated and its complexity. As a
minimum, the investigation must have an SIO. If a board is convened it must have a Board President (BP)
and will include primary and non-primary members.
5.5. (AFSPC) Space Mishap Investigation Composition, Qualifications and Key Responsibilities.
HQ AFSPC/SES will advise space mishap SIB President to consider adding Space System Safety Engi-
neer to SIB as a primary board member for mishaps with systems engineering implications.
     5.5.1. Board President or SIO Qualifications and Responsibilities:
        5.5.1.1. For Class A Space mishaps:

        Wing government safety personnel and any direct support contractors performing these analyses
        will be considered a temporary SIB subgroup while performing this analysis. The subgroup must
        not serve as an alternate path for the release of information.
        5.5.3.6. Additional members as desired

5.6. Using an Engineering Analysis Group (EAG).
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                       17


   5.6.1. The contractor providing the launch will lead the analysis, in accordance with contractual
   requirements. The SIB may observe and other government-sponsored entities, such as the System
   Program Office (SPO) or contractors, may participate based on contractual agreements.
   5.6.2. Factual mishap data will be passed from the SIB to the AIB and then to the EAG. The EAG
   will pass the results of its engineering analysis to both the SIB and the AIB as soon as it is available.
   5.6.3. Factual information concerning the mishap, including non-privileged engineering analysis
   results, will be released to the Commercial Space Industry through the AIB as soon as possible.
   5.6.4. The engineering analysis if conducted IAW paragraph 5.6. is not privileged. However, it may
   only be released through the AIB. If the engineering analysis contains classified or proprietary infor-
   mation, it must be clearly marked and controlled appropriately.
   5.6.5. The EAG should provide periodic updates to SIB members on the status of the engineering
   analysis. SIB members may monitor the EAG but will NOT direct or provide input to the EAG.
   5.6.6. The EAG will not be used if the convening authority determines that a promise of confidential-
   ity is needed to obtain information for or from the EAG.

5.7. Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. When the investigation is
beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO, request technical assistance/laboratory analysis in accordance with
AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, and the following guidance.
   5.7.1. If contractor representatives will only produce a report for Part 2 of a formal report, the SIB
   president should ask them for a factual, releasable version or ask a government specialist to provide a
   comparable report for Part 1.
   5.7.2. Use the suggested format as specified in AFI 91-204, Figure 5.1.
   5.7.3. (Added-AFSPC) Technical assistance beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO can include a sys-
   tem safety engineer.

5.8. Creating Deficiency Reports
   5.8.1. When the SIB and team members determine through their own teardown that a part is deficient,
   the SIB will ensure that a deficiency report (DR) is submitted IAW T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency
   Reporting and Investigating System.
   5.8.2. Instead of performing equipment teardown themselves, the SIB may request priority Teardown
   Deficiency Reports (TDR) through the SM by submitting a DR.
       5.8.2.1. If a TDR is requested, do not attempt field disassembly of the exhibit.
       5.8.2.2. Handle and ship exhibits for TDR according to T.O. 00-35D-54.
   5.8.3. The SIB or SIO initiates Category I DRs for suspect items involved in Class A and B mishaps.
   5.8.4. The investigator initiates Category II DRs for suspect items involved in Class C or E mishaps.
   5.8.5. Ensure the mishap event number is referenced in the DR Report Control Number (RCN) line.
   5.8.6. Take follow-up action to ensure exhibits were received and TDRs are in progress.
18                                                        AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


     5.8.7. The investigating MAJCOM takes follow-up action if the final safety report was sent before
     receipt of all TDRs. If final exhibit disposition instructions were not included in the original request
     for TDR, the MAJCOM will provide them to the SM.
     5.8.8. AFMC responds to requests for priority TDRs as required by T.O. 00-35D-54 and command
     directives.
     5.8.9. Do not dispose of Class A exhibits sent for priority TDR without concurrence of AIB president
     and written approval of AFSLA/JACT. Requests for disposal should be sent through the convening
     authority SJA IAW AFI 51-503, Chapter 10.7.
     5.8.10. All other exhibits (i.e. those from non-Class A mishaps) should be held for a minimum of
     1-year following TDR before disposal.
     5.8.11. Furnish a preliminary report of priority TDR findings to the field investigator as soon as pos-
     sible to help with compiling the final safety report.
        5.8.11.1. Include the mishap event number in TDRs related to Air Force mishaps.
        5.8.11.2. Distribute TDRs as follows:
            5.8.11.2.1. One copy to HQ AFSC/SES.
                5.8.11.2.1.1. Attach all supporting documents (such as metallurgical analyses, photo-
                graphs, and test reports) to this copy.
                5.8.11.2.1.2. For Class A and B space mishaps, provide the documents as soon as they are
                available. If the TDR and supporting documents were not previously sent, they may be
                attached to the Air Logistics Center (ALC) or Product Center endorsement.
                5.8.11.2.1.3. For Class E events, send the TDR upon completion. Include the mishap
                event number from the safety message.
            5.8.11.2.2. One copy to the SIB or investigator requesting the TDR. If the SIB has forwarded
            its final report, send this copy to the investigating MAJCOM safety office.
            5.8.11.2.3. One copy to the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA possessing (or gaining) the space system.
            5.8.11.2.4. One copy to the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/AXZ, 2420 Vela Way,
            Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659, if the mishap involved a system or component used
            by a space system launch vehicle.
            5.8.11.2.5. One copy to the SPD with engineering authority for the system or item in question.
            5.8.11.2.6. One copy to HQ AFMC/SE for all Class A and B mishaps.

5.9. Space Mishap Investigation Process. (See Figure 5.1. & Figure 5.2.)
     5.9.1. Following a mishap, the convening authority will appoint, on special orders, an SIB or SIO,
     sanction an EAG (in accordance with contractual provisions) and appoint an AIB president (if
     required). The host installation of the AIB shall be the installation where the SIB or SIO took place.
     See Figure A5.2. for an example SIB appointment message template.
        5.9.1.1. For an on-orbit space mishap, it is often more difficult to determine whether a mishap has
        occurred. Generally, analysis results from an anomaly resolution process, or equivalent, provide
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                        19


       the information needed to make the determination. Figure 5.2. shows how this process interacts
       with the safety investigation process.
   5.9.2. Once formed, the SIB will relieve the interim safety board (ISB) as soon as possible, take con-
   trol of the investigation and accept custody of all impounded evidence, lists of potential witnesses, etc.
   5.9.3. The SIB must maintain a good working relationship with the AIB and the EAG to assure a
   thorough safety investigation. The SIB will provide timely and incremental release of necessary fac-
   tual information through the AIB to the public and commercial space industry manufacturers.
   5.9.4. The SIB president, and anyone on the board he believes is relevant, should formally meet with
   the AB and the EAG at the beginning of the investigation to establish a good working relationship. Do
   not meet unless the lawyer assigned to the AIB is present. As a minimum, the meeting should:
       5.9.4.1. Review the responsibilities of the SIB, the AIB, and the EAG.
       5.9.4.2. Review privileged information criteria but do not discuss privileged information with the
       AIB or the EAG.
       5.9.4.3. Determine debris recovery strategy.
       5.9.4.4. Review the process for planning, coordinating, approving, and executing tests that may
       alter or destroy evidence.
       5.9.4.5. Review the processes for control of information in order to:
           5.9.4.5.1. Protect information from unauthorized release and release appropriate information
           as soon as feasible.
           5.9.4.5.2. Maintain separation of nonprivileged and privileged information.
           5.9.4.5.3. Control information access to those with approved access and a valid need.
           5.9.4.5.4. Release impounded information and evidence for investigation purposes.
       5.9.4.6. Review the process for prioritizing, examining, exonerating, and if cleared, releasing sys-
       tems and facilities (to minimize impact to day-to-day operations).
   5.9.5. The process ends with the completion of a final message and, for Class A and B mishaps, a for-
   mal report (Chapter 6). Once accepted by the convening authority the investigation is complete and
   the final message should be released (Chapter 6). After a review process, the AFSC reviews the
   report, places it in the permanent files and for Class A and B mishaps, issues a Memorandum of Final
   Evaluation (Chapter 7).

5.10. Investigating Space Mishaps. While the Air Force is always responsible for determining the
cause of Air Force mishaps, in certain situations the Air Force may accept the results of a non-Air Force
investigation to satisfy Air Force mishap prevention requirements IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 4. The
NTSB, the FAA or the space system owner will usually investigate commercial space mishaps. When
possible, the Air Force should make use of these investigations and limit duplicative investigations. How-
ever, the Air Force always retains the right to conduct a separate Air Force investigation.
   5.10.1. Multiple organizations will have an interest in these mishap investigations. In general, the Air
   Force, FAA, NTSB and space system owners should cooperate as much as possible with each other to
   achieve the shared goal of determination of cause and mishap prevention.
20                                                       AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


     5.10.2. An NTSB investigation will have priority over all evidence.
     5.10.3. The Air Force should observe all investigations related to the mishap.
     5.10.4. When the convening authority determines that a non-Air Force (commercial) investigation
     has the potential to prevent future mishaps that would pertain to the Air Force, the convening author-
     ity will use an Air Force observer (usually a trained SIO) to monitor the non-Air Force mishap inves-
     tigation (NTSB, FAA/AST, space system owner).
        5.10.4.1. The Air Force observer reports to the convening authority on the adequacy of the inves-
        tigation, the validity of the conclusions, and advises on whether the Air Force’s mishap prevention
        needs have been satisfied.
        5.10.4.2. Based on the Air Force observer’s assessment on the adequacy of the non-Air Force
        investigation report, the convening authority may accept it with a cover letter from the Air Force
        observer stating acceptance of findings and submit this report as the Air Force final report. The
        Air Force Observer will ensure the prepared report and cover letter contains nonprivileged infor-
        mation. Alternately, the convening authority may appoint another safety investigation officer to
        evaluate the report and deliver a full, 2-part Air Force mishap report. In this case, the non-Air
        Force report should be included in the Air Force report.
        5.10.4.3. Air Force observers are required to provide 30-day status messages to the convening
        authority and HQ AFSC. The convening authority, using Table A3.2. as a guide, should determine
        additional distribution for these messages. Proprietary information may greatly limit the distribu-
        tion.
        5.10.4.4. Observers are not formal Air Force safety investigators and are not authorized to offer
        promises of confidentiality per AFI 91-204, Chapter 3.
        5.10.4.5. Air Force observers may participate but may not interfere with the investigation they are
        observing. Air Force observers will refrain from making judgment calls, providing opinions or
        analysis, or writing any part of the report.
        5.10.4.6. Air Force observers may not observe multiple investigations simultaneously nor may
        they participate in any other investigations while still an observer. Observers may transition from
        an Air Force observer to an Air Force SIB to provide the SIB with continuity, however, once
        transferred they may no longer serve as an Air Force observer or transfer back to observer status.
        5.10.4.7. Air Force observers must have mishap investigation training or experience and should
        have completed the HQ AFSC Board President Course.
        5.10.4.7. (AFSPC) System Safety training is highly encouraged.
        5.10.4.8. Air Force observers will contact the appropriate MAJCOM Safety office or HQ AFSC/
        SES for guidance on current agreements with FAA/AST and the responsible commercial entity.
     5.10.5. If the convening authority determines that the NTSB, FAA/AST and/or contractor investiga-
     tion will not satisfy or is not satisfying the Air Force’s mishap prevention needs then the Air Force
     must conduct its own investigation within the terms of applicable contracts and agreements.
        5.10.5.1. MAJCOMs may develop and use tailored investigation processes when Commercial
        mishaps result in damage to Air Force property and when no Air Force personnel or processes are
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                              21


     involved in the mishap. These tailored processes must meet the requirements for mishap preven-
     tion and must be approved by HQ AFSC/SES.
  5.10.6. Refer to all applicable MOAs and contracts for additional guidance.
22                                                AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007

     5.10.7. The Air Force will maintain a lessons learned database for the space community for
     pre-launch space system mishaps.
     5.10.8. The Air Force will crossflow sanitized lessons learned information to the participating space
     community.
     5.10.9. All space launch contracts shall stipulate that properly designated and trained government
     officials may lead an investigation or participate in a contractor-led investigation of a pre-launch mis-
     hap if Air Force officials determine the need to do so. The need to conduct an investigation is based
     in part on future mishap prevention and the impact on current and future Eastern and Western range
     space launch requirements. As prescribed in AFFARS 5223.9001, the contracting officer shall insert
     the clause at 5352.223-9001, Health and Safety on Government Installations, in solicitations and con-
     tracts for space launch contracts which require performance on a Government installation, other than
     installations under the contractor’s sole control. For operations at contractor locations and prior to
     launch, the Program Manager, in conjunction with contracting personnel, will ensure safety mishap
     investigation requirements are included in these contracts and stipulate that properly designated and
     trained officials may investigate or participate in a contractor-led investigation of a pre-launch mis-
     hap. The safety requirements may be reflected in a Safety Plan, Appendix C, etc., as appropriate in
     the contract.

                                       REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Report space mishaps in accordance with AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, and the fol-
lowing space-specific guidance:
     6.1.1. Safety reports include both message reports and formal reports.
     6.1.2. Class A and B Space Mishaps require both message reports and formal reports.
     6.1.3. Report Class C, D, and E Mishaps by message report only.
     For the Class E mishaps specified in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, use a copy of the OPREP-3, required by
     AFI 10-206, to accomplish preliminary reporting. This is the only situation where an OPREP message
     satisfies the requirements for preliminary reporting.
     6.1.4. When a non-Air Force organization report exists that fulfills the requirements of an Air Force
     final report, it may be used by the convening authority as the official final mishap investigation report.
     6.1.5. Determining Mishap Event Number (MEN) for Space Mishaps. The MEN is the mishap’s sin-
     gle common worldwide identifier. Include the mishap event number in the subject line of all messages
     and refer to it in all related correspondence. Prepare the MEN IAW the following space specific guid-
     ance.
        6.1.5.1. Date of Mishap [eight digits (YYYYMMDD)]. Use the local date, not the Zulu or Coor-
        dinated Universal Time (CUT) day.
        6.1.5.2. Installation Code [four digits].
            6.1.5.2.1. For launch mishaps, use the base where the vehicle was launched.
            6.1.5.2.2. For orbital mishaps, use the base from which the satellite was controlled.
            6.1.5.2.3. For mishaps that did not occur on a military base or property, use the base of the
            unit that experienced the loss.
        6.1.5.3. Unit Control Number [four digits]. Use separate sets of four-character combinations
        (three digits and one letter) for unit control numbers. Assign the numbers consecutively for each
        mishap for each fiscal year. MAJCOMs may assign block numbers for those disciplines requiring
        them.
     6.1.6. (Added-AFSPC) Forward copies of anomaly investigation results to HQ AFSPC/SEC for
     incorporation in the Space Safety database and lessons-learned dissemination.
     6.1.7. (Added-AFSPC) Use HQ AFSPC/SE Safety Guide SE-001 as a guide for reporting space
     launch mishaps.

6.2. Marking Messages, Reports, Documents, and Other Safety Materials.
     6.2.1. Space mishap messages and safety reports are subject to limited distribution, may contain priv-
     ileged, classified, FOUO, or proprietary information and must be controlled appropriately.
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                        27


   6.2.2. Mark classified pages in messages, reports, or other safety documents with the proper security
   classification marking from AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, and omit the
   notation “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.”
   6.2.3. For materials containing privileged information follow the guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3.
   Place the Privilege Warning statement IAW AFI 91-204, Figure A3.1, at the foot of each page that
   contains privileged information. Don’t place the Privilege Warning on unclassified, non-privileged
   pages, on preliminary messages, or on other factual-only material.
   6.2.4. The contractor must place an appropriate proprietary information warning at the foot of each
   page that contains proprietary information. This warning must identify the extent of the protection
   required (i.e. Government only, Air Force only, etc.).

6.3. Guidance for Space Mishap Safety Messages. Prepare messages IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, and
the following space specific guidance.
   6.3.1. Route messages to the addressees listed in Table A3.2. and IAW the schedule in Table A3.1.
   The convening authority will release the final message unless this responsibility is delegated to the BP
   or SIO.
   6.3.2. Prepare preliminary messages in the format shown in Figure A2.1.
   6.3.3. Prepare Class E final messages in the format shown in Figure A2.3.
   6.3.4. Prepare all other status and final message reports in the format shown in Figure A2.2.
   6.3.5. Addressees are listed in Table A3.2. based on their need to know. Use of Table A3.2. helps to
   prevent inadvertent release of privileged safety information outside the Air Force.
      6.3.5.1. Commands may supplement this instruction by adding internal organizations, with a need
      to know, to the addressee list.
      6.3.5.2. Use Address Indicator Groups (AIG) to include addressees within the command as recip-
      ients of selected safety messages.
          6.3.5.2.1. When using AIGs, list the addressees in Table A3.2. first, followed by the appropri-
          ate space system AIG.
          6.3.5.2.2. Do not place addressees outside the command on command AIG listings without
          HQ AFSC/JA approval.
      6.3.5.3. Ensure all Department of the Air Force agencies identified as OPRs for mishap recom-
      mendations are included in the addressee list. For OPRs outside the Air Force, MAJCOM safety
      offices should consult with HQ AFSC/JA on the appropriate means of conveying the tasking.

6.4. Guidance for Space Mishap Formal Reports.
   6.4.1. Formal safety reports present detailed information, both factual and analytical, about mishaps.
   Prepare them IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, and the following guidance.
   6.4.2. Format formal reports IAW Attachment 4. Privileged reports should include all tabs. If certain
   Tabs do not add to the report due to the mishap’s circumstances, insert a page at the tab that states “Tab
   Not Used.”
   6.4.3. The SIB or SIO is responsible for writing the following areas of the formal report:
28                                                      AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


        6.4.3.1. Executive Overview.
        6.4.3.2. Mishap Sequence.
        6.4.3.3. Investigation and Analysis.
        6.4.3.4. Findings and Causes.
        6.4.3.5. Recommendations
        6.4.3.6. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance.
     6.4.4. Distribute space mishap formal reports IAW Table A3.3. and AFI 91-204, Chapter 6.
        6.4.4.1. Minimize the number of hard copies. As a minimum, create two: one for the convening
        authority and one, the master copy, for HQ AFSC/SES. Prepare all other copies electronically
        (CD-R or diskette).
        6.4.4.2. Distribution of privileged safety reports is generally restricted to Air Force personnel
        with appropriate access and a need to know. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 3 for guidance and a list of
        persons authorized access.
        6.4.4.3. Use the distribution memorandum, Figure A5.1., to list all addressees receiving copies,
        extracts or attachments to the report. See Attachment 4 for details.
        6.4.4.4. Send copies of the formal report to all Air Force agencies or organizations tasked in the
        recommendations.

6.5. Authenticating Formal Reports
     6.5.1. Type each primary SIB member’s name, grade, and position on the last page of the tab contain-
     ing board analysis and conclusions.
     6.5.2. Have each concurring member, including Primary Members from other services on Joint
     Investigations, sign above it for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report.
     6.5.3. If the formal SIB report needs to be changed after it is authenticated, all primary members of
     the SIB shall be physically reconvened and the authentication updated.

6.6. Briefing the Investigation Results. When the formal report is complete and the final message has
been drafted, brief the results to the convening authority IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6.
     6.6.1. (Added-AFSPC) SMC/CC will attend the briefing along with the SMC program manager and
     system safety manager if the mishap involved a SMC procured system. SIDC/CC will attend the brief-
     ing along with the SIDC program manager if the mishap involved a SIDC system in test. Schedule
     mishap briefings with HQ AFSPC/SE based on an estimated completion date of the formal report.

6.7. Accepting the Final Report. The convening authority (CA) validates and accepts the final report.
The CA accepts the report IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6. Once accepted by the CA, the SIB or investigat-
ing officer sends the final message and the investigation is considered complete. Before accepting the
final report and releasing the final message, the CA, with the help of their safety staff, should:
     6.7.1. Ensure the investigators’ conclusions are included in the final message and that enough infor-
     mation is presented to reasonably lead to the conclusions presented.
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                              29


   6.7.2. Validate the recommendations and verify the correct action agencies are designated.

Terms
AERO CLUB AIRCRAFT—These are all aircraft assigned to the respective Aero Club. The Aero Club
through, purchase, lease, or loan from the government may have acquired these aircraft. Aero Clubs are
authorized excess DOD and General Service Administration (GSA) aircraft on a loan basis.
AEROSPACE VEHICLES—DOD aircraft, UAVs, missiles, and space vehicles.
40                                                       AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007


AFLOAT MISHAP—An Air Force mishap occurring on board, or as the result of, a DOD vessel. This
also includes DOD diving or swimmer operations. This term includes mishaps occurring while loading
and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and mishaps occurring up to the high water mark
during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It applies also to all injuries to DOD personnel
occurring on board, whether or not job-related. Fatalities and/or injuries occurring on board that result
from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are not afloat mishaps.
AIRFIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL—Air traffic control (ATC) and airfield management (AM)
personnel.
AIR FORCE AT LARGE—Used for recording losses. Mishaps involving exchange students, military
members in a non-pay status while waiting for appellate review if they have no written or verbal orders to
return to an Air Force installation, prior service personnel on leave before reporting to initial permanent
duty assignment, etc., are recorded to the Air Force at large. Also used for recording losses of
non-accepted Air Force aerospace vehicles (paragraph 4.9.2.) and aerospace vehicles leased to a
non-DOD organization for modification, maintenance, repair, test, contract training, or experimental
project for a DOD component, when the Government has assumed ground and flight risk (paragraph
4.9.3.).
AIR FORCE LAUNCH—Any space launch operation conducted with significant oversight or insight
by the Air Force and not subject to licensing requirements of 14 CFR Part 415. The Air Force may or may
not be the space system owner.
AIR RESERVE COMPONENTS (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the ANG and
AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG and AFRC
technicians; include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Military status starts upon beginning duty
for military pay and ends when duty stops. All references to Air Force military personnel and property
also apply to ARC military personnel and property.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable damage
to a DOD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause damage in excess
of $20,000 to a DOD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft flight mishaps to avoid dual
reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that contributes to the flight mishap rate.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT-RELATED MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and no
reportable damage to the DOD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality, reportable injury, or
reportable property damage. A missile or UAV that is launched from a DOD aircraft, departs without
damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DOD mishap is reportable as a guided missile
mishap or UAV, respectively.
AIRCRAFT GROUND OPERATIONS MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is no intent for flight
and which results in damage to a DOD aircraft, a fatality, reportable injury, or reportable property
damage. Damage to an aircraft when it is being handled as cargo or as aircraft components when not
attached to the airframe is a ground and industrial, industrial aviation mishap.
AVIATION MISHAP—An Air Force mishap involving a DOD aircraft or DOD UAV.
BROKEN ARROW—Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained events and the following: accidental or
unauthorized launching, firing, or use by US forces or US supported allied forces of a nuclear capable
weapons system; an accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained nuclear detonation; non-nuclear detonation
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                        41


(no nuclear yield) or burning of a nuclear weapon or nuclear component; radioactive contamination;
public hazard, actual or perceived; jettisoning of a nuclear weapon or nuclear component.
CAUSAL FINDING—Causal findings are those, which, singly or in combination with other causal
findings, logically result in damage or injury. They are identified with the word “CAUSE” at the start of
the text of the finding.
CAUSE—A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have
prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury.
CHEMICAL AGENTS—A chemical compound intended for use in military operations to kill, seriously
injure, or incapacitate persons through its chemical properties. Excluded are riot control agents, chemical
herbicides, smoke, and flame producing devices. Pesticides, insecticides, and industrial chemicals, unless
selected by the D0D Components for chemical warfare purposes, are also excluded.
CHEMICAL AGENT MISHAP—Any unintentional or uncontrolled release of a chemical agent when:
reportable damage to property from contamination or costs are incurred for decontamination; or
individuals exhibit physiological symptoms of agent exposure; or the agent quantity released to the
atmosphere is such that a serious potential for exposure is created by exceeding the applicable maximum
allowable concentration-time levels for exposure of unprotected workers or the general population or

DIRECTED ENERGY—An umbrella term covering technologies that relate to the production of a beam
of concentrated electromagnetic energy or atomic or subatomic particles.
DIRECTED ENERGY DEVICE—A system using directed energy primarily for a purpose other than as
a weapon. Directed-energy devices may produce effects that could allow the device to be used as a
weapon against certain threats; for example, laser rangefinders and designators used against sensors that
are sensitive to light. In this instance, characterize the mishap as a Directed Energy Device since the
primary purpose of the mishap object was NOT as a weapon.
DIRECTED ENERGY DEVICE MISHAP—A mishap involving a directed energy device. An
example would be damage to an optical device by an aircraft laser range finder.
DIRECTED ENERGY MISHAP—A directed energy weapon mishap or a directed energy device
mishap.

module.
ENGINE-CONFINED MISHAP—Applies when an aircraft or UAV turbine engine experiences
reportable damage ($20,000 or more), and damage is confined to the engine and integral engine
components. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than $20,000 damage external to
the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine exceeds $20,000, then the mishap is not
Engine-Confined, regardless of the comparative extent of engine damage cost.
ENGINE FOD MISHAP—When objects external to the engine cause damage, the mishap is an Engine
FOD mishap. When the damage is caused by an internal engine failure (including liberation of internal
engine components such as bolts, rivets, bonded coatings, blades, vanes, abradable coatings, honeycomb

  1. Orbital mishap timing starts the day the MAJCOM Commander declares a mishap—see AFI
     91-204, Chapter 2.
     2. Include new information discovered since the preliminary report and identify SIB members.
        Remember to place the safety privilege statement at the beginning of the message.
     3. Include information not previously reported in the initial or preliminary report. It is not necessary
        to use the entire Figure A2.2. format for subsequent status reports. Only add information not pre-
        viously reported. Use Figure A2.2. format when modifying a previously transmitted initial, sta-
        tus, or final report.

  4. Do not delay final reports awaiting testing results. If the results from testing significantly change
     the outcome of a final report, reconvene the SIB (if necessary) and send a status report describing
     the changes.
  5. The convening authority may approve up to a 90-day extension of the due date. HQ AFSC must
     approve subsequent extensions.
  6. For Class E events as defined in AFI 91-204 Chapter 1 use the required OPREP-3 (AFI 10-206)
     as the preliminary report by forwarding a copy to HQ AFSC/SES.

                                               Attachment 4

                                     FORMAL SAFETY REPORTS

A4.1. General Information. This attachment contains instructions for completing formal reports and
provides general briefing guidelines. Formal safety reports and briefings present detailed information,
both factual and analytical, about mishaps.

A4.2. General Composition of Formal Reports. The formal report may have one or two parts. All for-
mal privileged safety reports must have two parts: Part 1, Factual Information and Releasable Material;
and Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material. Results of Follow-up Actions, even if filed
with the formal report, are not part of the formal report.
     A4.2.1. Part 1 contains factual information and non-privileged information. Create a Part 1 classified
     annex for classified non-privileged information as needed.
     A4.2.2. Part 2 contains the privileged portions of the formal report.
     A4.2.3. Both one and two-part reports must use the appropriate AF Form 711 (Tab B). All forms in
     the AF Form 711-series are licensed as "Safety Investigation Reports" (RCS: HAF-SE(AR) 9404).
     A4.2.4. Only include information and exhibits if they add to the report.

A4.3. General Guidance for the Narrative Portion.
     A4.3.1. Clearly show the scope of the investigation (evidence examined) and analyze the evidence
     presented (thought process and conclusions).
     A4.3.2. Explain why certain possibilities are eliminated, but others are retained.
     A4.3.3. Do not identify involved personnel by name, classified or personal call sign in the narrative.
     “Involved personnel” are those personnel who had an active role in the mishap, were injured in it, or
     whose actions or inactions initiated or sustained the mishap sequence.
     A4.3.4. When a formal report includes supporting documents (records, photos, statements, technical
     reports, and the like), consider referring to the tabs and page numbers of the exhibits rather than
     repeating the supporting material in the narrative portion.
     A4.3.5. The investigation and analysis should be written so the reader clearly understands the rela-
     tionship of how the findings and causes were determined.
     A4.3.6. Discuss the logic used to choose the recommendations.
     A4.3.7. Analyze data collected from witness statements, testimony, technical evaluations, and other
     information.
     A4.3.8. Describe each area investigated and discuss its significance.
     A4.3.9. Extensively analyze areas important in explaining the mishap.
     A4.3.10. Omit factors not applicable and add others as necessary to analyze the mishap.
     A4.3.11. Documenting Human Factors.
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                       73


   A4.3.12. Consider human factors from both individual human performance and from environmental,
   mission, and supervisory influence perspectives (to include training and work practices).
   A4.3.13. When human action or inaction contributed to the mishap sequence, medical members,
   drawing heavily on each SIB member’s individual area of expertise, accomplish the human perfor-
   mance narrative. Terminology should be consistent with the Human Factors taxonomy as presented in
   AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigation, Attachment 8.
   A4.3.14. The SIB or SIO must rate the identified human factors by the degree of their contribution to
   the mishap sequence: 4 - causal contributing factor; 3 - major contributing factor; 2 - minor contribut-
   ing factor; 1 - minimal contributing factor; 0 - present but did not play a role in the mishap sequence.
   A4.3.15. Summarize conclusions at the end of this section before going on to the findings.

A4.4. Distribution Memorandum. The Distribution Memorandum lists all addressees receiving copies
of, or extracts from, or attachments to, the report.
   A4.4.1. Number and account for all copies of privileged reports by listing each addressee (see Table
   A3.3.), including office symbol and copy number, in the "Distribution List" attachment to the Distri-
   bution Memorandum.
      A4.4.1.1. If the SIB president keeps a copy of the formal report (for briefing purposes) list this
      copy on the memorandum.
   A4.4.2. Include a statement, signed by the SIB president, certifying that the number of copies listed
   are the only copies of the SIB report produced.
   A4.4.3. The Distribution Memorandum goes before all Tabs in Part 1 of the report.

A4.5. AF Form 711A, USAF Safety Report Checklist and Index. Use this form to ensure reports are
uniform and complete. Place an "X" for each item in the columns "Not Applicable," "Applicable Not
Attached," or "Attached."
   A4.5.1. When checking the "Applicable Not Attached" block, explain why in the "Remarks" section.
   Estimate the date the missing attachment will be sent for inclusion in the report.
   A4.5.2. If an attachment will be sent later, insert a page with the proper lettered tab in the report.
   When the attachment is sent to recipients of the report, they can put it in the report at the proper tab.
   A4.5.3. Place AF Form 711A between the Distribution Memorandum and Tab A.

A4.6. PART 1—FACTUAL INFORMATION & RELEASABLE MATERIAL :
   A4.6.1. TAB A : Distribution Memorandum and Safety Investigator Information. Include the follow-
   ing:
      A4.6.1.1. Orders: Include one copy of the orders appointing the SIB or investigating officer. The
      orders must contain the full name; rank/grade, organization, and complete official mailing address
      for each appointed person. Unless required for safety purposes, do not include SSNs on a docu-
      ment that is provided to the AIB.
      A4.6.1.2. Include contact information for all investigation members.

     A4.6.2. TAB B : USAF Mishap Report (AF Form 711B). Complete an AF Form 711B for each
     Space mishap requiring a formal report and place it here. In most cases, the instructions on the form
     explain the required entries.
     A4.6.3. TAB C : Preliminary Message Report. Include the fully releasable preliminary message.
     Place the Final Report message in Tab Z. All other message traffic should be placed at the end of Tab
     W.
     A4.6.4. TAB D : Maintenance Report, Records, and Data.
        A4.6.4.1. Include copies of space system maintenance forms, if they add to the report.
        A4.6.4.2. Include copies of AFTO 781 Forms (if applicable).
            A4.6.4.2.1. AFTO 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.

        A4.6.4.3. Include records from pre-flight checkout.
        A4.6.4.4. Include records and data from launch processing.
        A4.6.4.5. If these forms and records are not included the Investigation Officer or Maintenance
        Member will provide a summary of the information contained in them.
     A4.6.5. TAB E : Reserved. For space safety use this tab for:
        A4.6.5.1. Flight Termination System Performance Assessment. For space launch mishaps occur-
        ring at an Air Force space launch range, the wing safety office will assess the performance of the
        flight termination system and evaluate the effectiveness of debris prediction models and toxics
        dispersion models. Include their report here.
        A4.6.5.2. The SIB may use this tab for other special interest items which are pertinent to the mis-
        hap but don’t fit under any other tabs.

     A4.8.3.2. Select “Mirror Margins” and set “inside” to 1.5 inches, “outside” to 1.0 inch. Set “gut-
     ter” to zero. (If you do not have a duplex printer, this will set the margins correctly for front-back
     reproduction. If you have a duplex printer this is the same as setting the left margin to 1.5 inches
     and deselecting “Mirror Margins”).
  A4.8.4. Set header margin to .5 inches, set font to 10 point, Times New Roman italics and center the
  following on each page of the report in the header block: “Space System or Type, mission or identify-
  ing number and mishap event number” (e.g. Titan IVB-32, 19990430DBEH003A or GPS-IIA, SVN

                              IC 2005-1 TO AFMAN 91-222,
                SPACE SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS, 6 JUL 2004
9 August 2005


This interim change corrects administrative errors and omissions and clarifies select areas of the original
document. All items in this change will be incorporated in the next revision of this document. This
change consolidates Air Force pre-launch mishap investigation guidance and implements Air Force Pol-
icy Directive 91-2, Safety Programs. Major Commands (MAJCOM) may supplement this standard when
additional or more stringent safety criteria are required. Lower-level organizations, installation and
above, may also supplement this standard. MAJCOMs will approve these supplements. Report conflicts
in guidance between this standard, federal standards, or other Air Force directive in writing through MAJ-
COM space safety offices to Headquarters Air Force Safety Center, Space Safety Division, Space Safety
Branch (HQ AFSC/SESS), 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 120B, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670. Ensure that
all records created by this AFMAN are maintained and disposed of IAW AFMAN 37-139, “Records Dis-
position Schedule.” Requirements in this publication are mandatory, unless indicated otherwise, and
apply to all US Air Force organizations, US Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and all Air
National Guard (ANG) personnel, with the exception of state employees.


 No AFMAN, T.O., or Operating Instruction can possibly address every hazard or potential hazard that
may arise from a specific task or combination of tasks. Where situations exist that are not covered by
existing directives, use an Operational Risk Management (ORM) process to assess risk associated with
those situations and determine adequate safeguards or procedures to manage the risk. Refer to AFPAM
90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools, for guidance on using the ORM
process. NOTE: The ORM process may not be used to violate directives or other regulatory guidance.
Normal waiver or variance procedures must be followed in all cases (refer to AFI 91-301).


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This INTERIM CHANGE (IC 2005-1) documents, correct administrative errors, and clarifies references
to standards and other portions of this document. Guidance in this change takes precedence over the basic
document. Paragraphs listed below replace similarly numbered paragraphs in the basic document, unless
otherwise noted. This IC also updates the address list in Table A3.2. of AFMAN 91-222 to more accu-
rately reflect the appropriate space organizations and remove addresses not related to space operations for
mishap reporting and prevention purposes. In addition, it clarifies the definition of primary and secondary
mission. Finally, it identifies the class of mishap for tertiary missions since new technology allows
numerous missions to be located on one satellite.


POSTING INSTRUCTIONS: Include a copy of this change with any printed copy of AFMAN 91-222.
Ensure review of this change prior to referencing any portion of AFMAN 91-222.

1.4.2. Additionally, for orbital mishaps prior to the end of the design life, use the mishap’s effect on pri-
mary or secondary mission capability (MC) to classify the mishap as Class A or B. Primary does not nec-
essarily mean just one mission. Satellites could have more than one primary mission as defined by an
Operational Requirements Document (ORD). Secondary missions also could include more than one mis-
sion as defined by the ORD.


1.4.2.4. In general, a part or system failure that does not affect primary, secondary, or tertiary MC is not
a mishap per AFI 91-204.


1.4.2.5. Tertiary mission failures include all missions not listed in the ORD as either primary or second-
ary mission categories. Any permanent failure/degradation of a tertiary mission is classified as a Class C
mishap.


1.4.3.2. An unplanned temporary loss or degradation of primary, secondary, or tertiary MC of an on-orbit
asset for greater than 48 hours (see AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Rule 1R).


1.5.2. Contacting the single manager (SM) is generally the most useful place to start for space mishaps.
Cost models available from the SAF/FMC web site, http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil (AFCaa Tab, Cost
Tools button) may be useful.


5.10. Investigating Space Mishaps. While the Air Force is always responsible for determining the cause
of Air Force mishaps, in certain situations the Air Force may accept the results of a non-Air Force inves-
tigation to satisfy Air Force mishap prevention requirements IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 4. The NTSB, the
FAA or the space system owner will usually investigate commercial space mishaps. When possible, the
Air Force should make use of these investigations and limit duplicative investigations. However, the Air
Force always retains the right to conduct a separate Air Force investigation.


5.10.7. The Air Force will maintain a lessons learned database for the space community for pre-launch
space system mishaps.


5.10.8. The Air Force will crossflow sanitized lessons learned information to the participating space com-
munity.


5.10.9. All space launch contracts shall stipulate that properly designated and trained government offi-
cials may lead an investigation or participate in a contractor-led investigation of a pre-launch mishap if
Air Force officials determine the need to do so. The need to conduct an investigation is based in part on
AFMAN91-222_AFSPC_I 2 JANUARY 2007                                                                      93


future mishap prevention and the impact on current and future Eastern and Western range space launch
requirements. As prescribed in AFFARS 5223.9001, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at
5352.223-9001, Health and Safety on Government Installations, in solicitations and contracts for space
launch contracts which require performance on a Government installation, other than installations under
the contractor’s sole control. For operations at contractor locations and prior to launch, the Program Man-
ager, in conjunction with contracting personnel, will ensure safety mishap investigation requirements are
included in these contracts and stipulate that properly designated and trained officials may investigate or
participate in a contractor-led investigation of a pre-launch mishap. The safety requirements may be
reflected in a Safety Plan, Appendix C, etc., as appropriate in the contract.
