This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 51-10, Making Military
Personnel, Employees, and Dependents Available to Civilian Authorities. It establishes policies
and procedures governing instances of civilian misconduct for Spangdahlem Air Base (AB) and
all its geographically separated units (GSU), as well as Eifel West, hereafter referred to as the
Spangdahlem Community. The 52d Mission Support Group (52 MSG) Commander (CC) is
responsible for ensuring administration of this program. This instruction applies to all
Department of Defense (DoD) civilians assigned to, attached to, employed by, under the
supervision or control of any organization in the Spangdahlem Community, as well as civilians
allowed to enter the Spangdahlem Community. This includes those family members eligible to
attend Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) regardless of their sponsor’s
affiliation with DoD. The Civilian Misconduct Program is designed to assist the 52d Fighter
Wing (52 FW) in redirecting civilian misconduct, providing appropriate rehabilitative services,
and modifying inappropriate behavior of the military community, the organization, the sponsor,
the family, retirees, and the individual. The intent of the Civilian Misconduct Program is to
provide an opportunity to rehabilitate civilians and divert their energies away from self
destructive, inappropriate activities. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF
847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision is a completely rewritten publication which must be carefully reviewed. Major
changes include clarifying that 52 MSG Deputy Commander (52 MSG/CD) has the authority to
impose sanctions on civilians who engage in misconduct in the Spangdahlem Community.
Appeals, when allowed, are to 52 MSG/CC. This revision clarifies that civilian employee
misconduct on the job need not be handled through the Civilian Misconduct Program. This
publication reorganizes how adverse administrative actions are described and discussed by
including with each adverse action a separate discussion of appeal rights and authorities. This
revision establishes the “Rehabilitation and Restitution Opportunity Program ” and clarifies the
intent of that program. It also establishes recordkeeping and legal-review procedures and
provides samples of notification letters to respondents. Finally, it includes the Misconduct by
Civilians timeline, which provides general guidance on how long each step should take.

  actually executed. DoDDS officials will cooperate with base personnel to inspect for and
  remove contraband or when evidence of misconduct exists on school premises or in DoDDS
  facilities.
  1.4.7. University and College Officials. Officials of universities and colleges operating in
  the European theater will take administrative action to address violations of school rules and
  regulations. Whenever a student is suspended, expelled, or involved in criminal conduct,
  university and college officials will notify commander of the student’s sponsor and the 52
  SFS. Criminal conduct should be reported to the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) or 52
  SFS.
  1.4.8. Legal Liaison Authority (LLA). Only the LLA (the servicing Judge Advocate (JA)
  via the host nation Legal Advisor) may communicate with German judicial authorities
  (prosecutors and court officials) and prison officials. Chapter 11 describes procedures for
  seeking criminal prosecution in Germany. The 52 SFS/CC, 52 MSG/CC, 52 FW/CC, and
  anyone who is contacted by German judicial authorities or prison officials about prosecution
  or possible prosecution of U.S. personnel will notify and refer to the local LLA the German
  authorities or officials and any written communication.

     1.4.9. Commanders. Commanders at all levels will support 52 MSG/CD actions.
     Regulations that prescribe a commander’s authority to take certain administrative actions
     must be followed. If a sponsor’s commander refuses to impose a sanction requested by the 52
     MSG/CD, the 52 MSG/CD will refer the matter through the sponsor’s chain of command to
     the next higher commander.
     1.4.10. All Personnel. All personnel will:
        1.4.10.1. Avoid misconduct.
        1.4.10.2. Promote good conduct.
        1.4.10.3. Cooperate fully with 52 FW, military, school, and host-nation authorities.
        1.4.10.4. Present proper identification when requested by military or civilian law
        enforcement officials, commissioned officers, and noncommissioned officers in the rank
        of Master Sergeant or higher who are enforcing order, discipline, or security affecting the
        U.S. Forces, civilian components, or family members.
     1.4.11. Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). The SJA will:
        1.4.11.1. Provide technical assistance to help the 52 MSG/CD develop administrative
        procedures for operating a civilian misconduct action program.
        1.4.11.2. Review the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative program procedures.
        These informal reviews will be conducted with the 52 MSG/CD and 52 SFS. The results
        of the review will provide the basis for program modifications. If the review results in
        significant observations or recommendations, the SJA will assist in making changes to
        the program.
        1.4.11.3. Provide training for the 52 MSG/CD and 52 SFS. Training will be structured to
        meet the specific needs of individual 52 MSG/CD and 52 SFS.
1.5. Policy.
     1.5.1. Authority to Suspend or Revoke ILS. 52 FW/CC allows ILS to civilians who
     accompany the U.S. Forces on the condition of good behavior. 52 FW/CC has authority to
     revoke or permanently suspend ILS by barment of personnel from entry to installations
     housing areas, lands, buildings, and other structures and places under both Spangdahlem AB
     and European Command (EUCOM) control or jurisdiction.
        1.5.1.1. There is no authority to revoke or suspend access to medical facilities if such
        services are authorized or to impede the access of school-aged children to DoDDS
        schools.
        1.5.1.2. The SJA will provide assistance with ILS and barment issues.
     1.5.2. Authority to Bar Personnel from Installation Access. The 52 FW/CC has the
     authority to bar an individual from the Spangdahlem Community. This authority cannot be
     delegated.
     1.5.3. Application of Procedures and Sanctions. The Civilian Misconduct Program is
     most effective when procedures and sanctions are applied consistently.
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                          9


     1.5.3.1. Attachment 5 provides guidance to help 52 MSG/CD select and effectively use
     administrative procedures for the program. Failure to follow the guidance in Attachment
     5 does not constitute grounds to appeal or seek reconsideration of the 52 MSG/CD’s
     action or recommendation. 52 MSG/CD has the express authority to exceed or use lesser
     sanctions than those listed in Attachments.
     1.5.3.2. Incidents of misconduct will be resolved as quickly and informally as possible.
     Commanders, staffs, and investigating officers (IO) will process actions quickly,
     thoroughly, and fairly. The procedures in this regulation, along with recommendations
     from the 52 SFS, law-enforcement officials, the SJA, DoDDS officials, and any other
     competent source that has an interest in the matter, will help the 52 MSG/CD establish
     facts and determine appropriate administrative actions. The 52 MSG/CD determines
     which procedures to use and which actions to take. 52 MSG/CD actions should be
     coordinated as much as possible with other organizations or agencies (for example,
     DoDDS or case-review committees) to ensure they do not interfere with the missions of
     those organizations or agencies.
  1.5.4. Host-Nation Jurisdiction. In peacetime, host-nation authorities have exclusive
  criminal jurisdiction over U.S. civilians in the host country. The 52 MSG/CD may request
  local host-nation authorities to waive criminal jurisdiction over individuals when the 52
  MSG/CD believes suitable corrective administrative action is available. 52 MSG/CD will
  make requests through the local LLA in Germany.
  1.5.5. Criminal Prosecution. When the 52 MSG/CD believes criminal prosecution is
  appropriate and the misconduct is a serious criminal offense, he or she should consult the
  servicing SJA about the prosecution by U.S. authorities pursuant to the Military
  Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (18 United States Code (USC) 3261 et seq.) before
  requesting that host-nation authorities exercise criminal jurisdiction. The 52 MSG/CD will
  make such requests through the local LLA in Germany. Under German law, some acts will
  not be prosecuted unless the victim initiates a criminal complaint. For cases in which the U.S.
  Government is the victim and military authorities determine that a criminal complaint should
  be filed, the 52 MSG/CD must consult with the servicing LLA. The LLA will be the liaison
  between the complainant (the U.S. Government) and German prosecutorial officials.
  1.5.6. Prosecution by Host-Nation Authorities. Prosecution by host-nation authorities
  does not prevent and should not delay the 52 MSG/CD from taking appropriate
  administrative action (see Chapter 11). However, when a violation of host-nation law is
  involved, the offender may not be granted early return to the United States before host-nation
  authorities give permission through the local LLA. Furthermore, any administrative action
  that could affect host-nation prosecution (such as barment actions, which may induce a
  subject to leave the jurisdiction) must be coordinated with the LLA.

                                           Chapter 2

                                       PROCEDURES

2.1. Reporting Misconduct.
   2.1.1. The 52 SFS is responsible for tracking potential cases of criminal civilian misconduct.
   52 SFS prepares and has access to daily blotters. DoDDS school administrators will report to
   the 52 SFS all cases of misconduct that warrant suspension or expulsion from school, even if
   such punishment is not actually executed. The 52 SFS will have access to case files and
   status reports from law-enforcement officials to monitor the progress of criminal
   investigations when the subjects are either civilians subject to this regulation or unknown but
   could possibly be civilians subject to this regulation. The 52 SFS must not interfere with OSI
   or host-nation investigations in any way.
      2.1.1.1. 52 MSG/CD will track other than criminal misconduct by civilians if not tracked
      by 52 SFS, Army Customs, OSI or other law enforcement agency.
   2.1.2. When the approved findings of an investigation establish that one or more individuals
   have engaged in criminal misconduct, the 52 SFS will provide a copy of the report of
   investigation (ROI) to 52 MSG/CD. However, if the misconduct is committed by one or
   more civilian employees while performing their civilian employment duties, 52 SFS will not
   to send a copy of the ROI to 52 MSG/CD for action IAW the Civilian Misconduct Program
   purposes if the recommendations include only employee discipline under Federal
   employment regulations. Rather, when the misconduct is work related, 52 SFS will send the
   ROI to the employing agency. Misconduct committed entirely within the context of an
   individual’s employment will generally be handled by the employing agency and will not
   require further 52 MSG/CD action unless community interests are directly affected.
   2.1.3. Local LLAs or other persons who receive official information that host-nation law-
   enforcement or social-services authorities suspect a civilian of an offense under German law
   will notify the 52 SFS.
   2.1.4. 52 MSG/CD will establish a separate case file for each civilian respondent. As long
   as the case file is open, additional instances of misconduct may be added.
2.2. Investigating Misconduct.
   2.2.1. The 52 SFS will normally investigate alleged criminal civilian misconduct and/or
   prepare incident reports.
      2.2.1.1. Serious civilian misconduct may be investigated by OSI. Army Customs will
      normally investigate allegations of German tax evasion.
      2.2.1.2. In instances of alleged civilian misconduct outside of normal law enforcement
      investigations, 52 MSG/CD may appoint an IO to prepare a Commander Directed
      Investigation (CDI) ROI. 52 FW/JA will advise and assist any investigator as required.
   2.2.2. As the “owning commander” of civilians who engage in misconduct, 52 MSG/CD
   will review each completed investigation, incident report, DoDDS report, or ROI to
   determine whether the available information establishes by a “preponderance of the
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                          11


   evidence” that the civilian respondent committed the alleged misconduct. 52 FW/JA will
   advise and assist any investigator as required.
      2.2.2.1. A preponderance of the evidence means that the greater weight of credible
      evidence supports a finding rather than an opposite finding. The 52 MSG/CD may ask 52
      FW/JA for advice on whether the facts support the finding that a respondent committed
      the misconduct.
   2.2.3. When reviewing the available information, 52 MSG/CD and/or 52 FW/JA should
   consider whether there are any unanswered questions that, if answered, would help determine
   if an act of misconduct occurred and, if so, if the respondent (or someone else) committed it.
   2.2.4. If there are additional items of information that would help determine if an act of
   misconduct occurred and if the respondent committed it, the 52 SFS or someone tasked by
   the 52 MSG will further investigate to uncover this information. If much of the information is
   unknown, the 52 MSG should initiate a CDI. Otherwise, to expedite the case, the 52 SFS
   may contact witnesses or investigators to obtain the missing information.
   2.2.5. Once the 52 MSG/CD is confident that all available information has been collected,
   52 MSG/CD will proceed as follows:
      2.2.5.1. If available information shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a
      respondent committed the misconduct, the 52 MSG/CD will determine what proper
      minor administrative or adverse actions to propose, and, as appropriate, either a draft
      letter of counseling or warning (Attachment 2) or a draft notice of intent (NOI)
      (Attachment 3) to the respondent.
      2.2.5.2. If the 52 MSG/CD feels there is not enough information to show by a
      preponderance of the evidence that a respondent engaged in misconduct, the 52 MSG/CD
      will prepare a memorandum or a staff summary sheet that includes:
          2.2.5.2.1. A summary of the facts of the case and the information that is lacking.
          2.2.5.2.2. A statement that further investigation is unlikely to uncover the missing
          information.
          2.2.5.2.3. 52 MSG/CD will close the case file with no action taken.
2.3. Notice to Respondent. 52 MSG/CD will prepare and sign notices.
   2.3.1. Letter of Counseling or Warning. Letters of counseling or warning do not require
   an NOI and are not appealable (paragraph 12). They require no further action, but are simply
   issued to a subject under general 52 MSG/CD authority to address an incident of misconduct.
   If the respondent submits a reply, it will be included in the case file. Unless the 52 MSG/CD
   chooses to reconsider his or her decision, the case file will be closed. Attachment 2 shows a
   sample letter of counseling or warning.
   2.3.2. NOI.
      2.3.2.1. Using the template in Attachment 3 as a sample, the notice to the respondent
      will identify the essential facts of his or her alleged misconduct and the action the 52
      MSG/CD intends to take in response. The NOI will be addressed to the respondent and
      his or her sponsor or to the respondent’s parent or guardian if the respondent is a minor.
12                                     SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


     A copy will be provided to the sponsor’s commander or commander-equivalent civilian
     supervisor.
     2.3.2.2. The NOI will inform the respondent of the right to:
         2.3.2.2.1. Submit a written reply to the 52 MSG/CD, which must be received within
         3 workdays from the date of the notice. The response may include letters or
         statements from other people and any other material the respondent believes the 52
         MSG/CD should have before taking final action.
         2.3.2.2.2. Review the evidence in the case file, except for parts that may be withheld
         for good cause as explained in paragraph 2.3.2.4 below. The 3-day response period
         will not be extended to accommodate the review of the case file unless the respondent
         makes a reasonable request and the 52 MSG/CD cannot make the file available in
         sufficient time to meet the deadline.
         2.3.2.2.3. Request an opportunity to appear before the 52 MSG/CD to present matters
         orally. However, there is no right to a hearing or appearance before the 52 MSG/CD.
     2.3.2.3. If the 52 MSG/CD intends to offer a R&RO, the NOI will explain the proposed
     R&RO and the terms and conditions that apply if the respondent accepts it. The NOI will
     also inform the respondent that if he or she declines the offer to volunteer for the R&RO,
     other adverse actions may be imposed. The notice will inform the respondent that he or
     she must accept or reject the R&RO offer within the 3-day response period (Attachment
     3, figure A3.3).
     2.3.2.4. Normally, the respondent and, in case of a minor, the parent or guardian will be
     provided an opportunity to examine the evidence in the 52 SFS case file or other
     investigative file held by 52 MSG/CD. They are not entitled to obtain copies of this
     information through 52 MSG/CD channels except for copies of their own statements that
     they provided to law-enforcement or investigating officers. Information in the case file
     may be withheld for good cause (for example, classified documents, investigative files
     that would endanger the life or physical safety of witnesses or law-enforcement
     personnel, certain medical files, and Privacy Act (PA)/Freedom of Information Act
     (FOIA) exempt information). 52 MSG/CD will coordinate with the SJA before
     withholding case-file material.
     2.3.2.5. The respondent may waive the 3-day response period. In this situation, the 52
     MSG/CD may immediately take the next step in the process.
     2.3.2.6. The 52 MSG/CD will consider any response submitted and will take appropriate
     action at the end of the 3-day response period. The 52 MSG/CD may consult with
     interested parties (for example, supervisors, sponsors, school officials, medical and
     behavioral-health personnel) about the appropriateness of adverse actions that are being
     considered. In deciding what final action to take, 52 MSG/CD should consider the
     responses submitted or any other consideration.
  2.3.3. Notice of Adverse Action (NAA). The 52 MSG/CD will issue an NAA to the
  respondent and his or her sponsor, or to the respondent’s parent or guardian of record if the
  respondent is a minor. A copy will be provided to the sponsor’s commander or commander-
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                      13


  equivalent civilian supervisor. The NAA will be prepared according to the sample in
  Attachment 4, figure A4.1
     2.3.3.1. When it includes an R&RO, the NAA must be prepared in accordance with the
     requirements in paragraph 5.1.14. of this instruction. The NAA will repeat the terms and
     conditions stated in the offer of R&RO, and a statement of acceptance to be signed by the
     respondent will be enclosed with the NAA.
     2.3.3.2. The NAA will explain what the respondent is required to do as a result of the
     adverse action or actions imposed, such as obtaining a new ID or ration card or
     relinquishing a United States Army Europe (USAREUR) driver’s license.
     2.3.3.3. The NAA will explain what appeal right is available, if any, who the appellate
     authority is, and that the respondent has 5 calendar days to submit the appeal to the 52
     MSG/CC through 52 MSG/CD (see Chapter 7).
  2.3.4. Processing Timeline. Timely discipline is imperative to maintain good order and
  discipline. Every attempt shall be made to complete the disciplinary process within 30 days
  of the misconduct, unless a CDI is required, or the matter is appealable to 52 FW/CC.
  Timely completion of any required investigation and getting all pertinent information to 52
  MSG/CD is critical.
     2.3.4.1. Steps in processing civilian misconduct cases are as follows:
         2.3.4.1.1. SFS or other criminal investigative agency is notified of the misconduct.
         52 MSG/CD is notified of noncriminal misconduct.
         2.3.4.1.2. The alleged misconduct is investigated. If criminal, SFS, OSI Army
         Customs, or German criminal investigators investigate the misconduct. If non
         criminal, 52 MSG/CD investigates or appoints Investigating Officer (OI) to prepare a
         Command Directed Investigation (CDI). If a CDI is involved, allow three weeks to
         complete.
         2.3.4.1.3. Investigation is completed.
         2.3.4.1.4. 52 MSG/CD drafts and signs NOI.
         2.3.4.1.5. The NOI is served as detailed in paragraph 2.3.3. above.
         2.3.4.1.6. The respondent has three workdays to respond.
         2.3.4.1.7. 52 MSG/CD considers the response and makes a decision within two
         workdays. If legal review required, add five workdays. The NAA is issued to
         respondent and adverse action is implemented.
         2.3.4.1.8. If appealable to 52 MSG/CC, the respondent has five workdays to appeal.
         2.3.4.1.9. 52 MSG/CC considers the appeal, if any, within three workdays. 52
         MSG/CC directs implementation of adverse action, or 52 MSG/CC submits to 52
         FW/CC if the adverse action is one that only 52 FW/CC can affect, such as a barment.
         2.3.4.1.10. Respondent is notified of appellate authority’s decision.
         2.3.4.1.11. If not appealed, is not appealable, or the appellate authority decides, 2
         MSG/CD monitors R&RO, suspends actions, and closes the file.

                                          Chapter 3

             GENERAL GUIDANCE ON SELECTING ADVERSE ACTIONS

3.1. The 52 MSG/CD will consider the following factors when selecting responses to
civilian misconduct:
   3.1.1. Seriousness of the Misconduct.
   3.1.2. Relationship of the Sanction to the Offense. The administrative action imposed
   should bear a rational relationship to the offense committed (for example, suspension of
   driving privileges for misconduct involving a privately owned vehicle, but not for shoplifting
   at an Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) store).
   3.1.3. The Offender’s Prior Record. The 52 MSG/CD should take progressively stronger
   action against persons who have previously been involved in misconduct.
   3.1.4. Age and Maturity of the Offender. The 52 MSDG/CD should handle vandalism
   committed by a 10-year-old child differently than vandalism committed by a teenager or
   adult.
   3.1.5. Compensation for Victims. The 52 MSG/CD will consider actions the offender has
   taken to rectify the effects of his or her misconduct. The 52 MSG/CC or 52 MSG/CD cannot
   force offenders (or their military or civilian sponsors) to compensate victims for loss or
   damage. However, restitution by offenders for damaged property (including Government
   property) is one indication of the willingness to live responsibly in the community in the
   future. Compensation for victims need not be monetary. In determining appropriate
   sanctions, the 52 MSG/CD may consider any type of compensation acceptable to the victim
   (for example, running errands, mowing the lawn).
3.2. Guidelines for 52 MSG/CD. Attachment 5 lists factors to consider when determining
which administrative actions are appropriate. The list only suggests administrative actions for
cases without aggravating factors that would compel a more severe action. It is not intended to
impose mandatory limitations on 52 MSG/CD. Failure to follow the list is not grounds for
overturning the 52 MSG/CD’s decision.
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                       15


                                         Chapter 4

                                NONADVERSE ACTIONS

4.1. Minor administrative actions are 52 MSG/CD responses to civilian misconduct that do
not impose a loss of a benefit or an obligation to perform some act. When the 52 MSG/CD
determines a minor administrative action is warranted, the initial notice should include that
action and conclude the case without further process.
4.2. Minor administrative actions are not appealable, although the respondent may submit
rebuttal matters, which will be included in the case file before closure.
4.3. The following are minor administrative actions:
   4.3.1. Counseling. 52 MSG/CD may counsel the offender, orally or in writing, on the
   nature of the misconduct committed and the basis for concluding that the respondent was the
   one who committed it, why the misconduct is improper and unacceptable in the military
   community, what the consequences will be if the respondent continues to engage in that
   misconduct, and recommendations on ways to avoid misbehavior or improve behavior. If the
   offender is a juvenile, the parents or sponsor will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
   present at an oral counseling.
   4.3.2. Letter of Warning. The 52 MSG/CD may issue a letter of warning to the offender.
   The letter will explain the nature of the misconduct committed and the basis for concluding
   that the respondent was the one who committed it, why it is improper and unacceptable in the
   military community, and that future acts of misconduct will not be tolerated and may lead to
   serious adverse actions. If the offender is:
       4.3.2.1. A family member or a member of household, the letter should be sent through
       the sponsor’s commander or supervisor. A copy of the letter will be provided to the
       sponsor.
       4.3.2.2. An adult civilian employee, the letter should be sent through his or her
       supervisor. This channel of notification applies to appropriated fund (APF),
       nonappropriated fund (NAF), and local national employees.
       4.3.2.3. An employee of a Government contractor, the letter should be sent through the
       contracting officer or contracting officer’s representative (COR).

                                          Chapter 5

                                    ADVERSE ACTIONS

5.1. R&RO. The R&RO program offers an effective way to determine whether or not an
offender is willing to be a responsible member of the community. Normally, an R&RO is offered
instead of a more severe action. An R&RO should be tailored to the offense and to the offender.
Examples include requiring the offender to:
   5.1.1. Make payments to or perform services for victims, including the section, office or
   other units affected by the misconduct, to reimburse or compensate them for damages or
   losses.
   5.1.2. Perform voluntary services in the community. Those community services may not
   involve services or activities that are currently covered by APF or contractor positions.
   Ideally, the services performed should have a direct relationship to the nature of the
   misconduct. Persons performing services under the R&RO program are not statutory
   volunteers as defined in 10 USC 1588, Authority to accept certain voluntary services.
   5.1.3. Attend and participate in social welfare services, medical programs, or community
   education or counseling programs intended to identify, diagnose, or treat underlying social or
   psycho-social disorders that affect an individual’s behavior or to educate respondents in
   better ways to manage their personal lives (for example, anger-management training,
   marriage or family counseling, alcohol- or substance-abuse programs, personal finance
   education, parenting skills training).
   5.1.4. Remain at home during specified hours of the day.
   5.1.5. Receive periodic home visits from 52 MSG/CD or an appropriate designee
   supervising respondent’s rehabilitation.
   5.1.6. Periodically report in person to 52 MSG/CD or an appropriate designee supervising
   respondent’s rehabilitation.
   5.1.7. 52 MSG/CD will stay informed of the range of rehabilitative programs and
   opportunities available in the community. They will maintain contacts with points of contact
   (POCs) in social work services, the Airmen and Family readiness Center, 52d Force Support
   Squadron (52 FSS), Red Cross, and other activities that can be used for rehabilitation or
   restitution.
   5.1.8. An R&RO will not normally be offered to repeat offenders. It should, however, be
   considered in almost every case involving a first-time offender instead of other
   administrative action.
   5.1.9. If the rehabilitation program requires the participation of the sponsor or other family
   members to be effective (for example, marriage and family counseling), the 52 MSG/CD
   may include a term or condition in the R&RO offer stating that all necessary parties must
   agree to participate.
   5.1.10. The NOI to the respondent will offer an R&RO in appropriate cases. The NOI will
   explain:
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                         17


     5.1.10.1. The specific rehabilitation or restitution opportunity.
     5.1.10.2. That the respondent or guardian must voluntarily agree to the offer.
     5.1.10.3. How the respondent’s failure to agree to or successfully complete the program
     will affect the 52 MSG/CD’s decision on other adverse actions (for example, by
     including a statement saying “If you agree to the R&RO, I will suspend the other
     intended adverse actions.”).
     5.1.10.4. The NOI will include an endorsement to be signed by the respondent or
     guardian that states whether he or she agrees to undertake the rehabilitation or restitution
     duty. A sample NOI with an R&RO program offer is at Attachment 3, figure A3.3.
  5.1.11. If the respondent or guardian consents to the R&RO by signing the NOI
  endorsement, the 52 MSG/CD will prepare an agreement stating the terms and conditions of
  the R&RO (figure A3.3). The agreement will specify the following:
     5.1.11.1. That the respondent or guardian is entering the program voluntarily and
     willfully.
     5.1.11.2. The factors that constitute satisfactory compliance with the program (for
     example, regular attendance at weekly meetings, biweekly reporting to a community
     supervision officer).
     5.1.11.3. The factors that constitute successful completion of the program.
     5.1.11.4. The consequences of the failure to consent to or to satisfactorily participate in
     an R&RO in terms of the 52 MSG/CD adverse action.
     5.1.11.5. The consequences of successfully completing the program.
     5.1.11.6. That the respondent or guardian must agree to the following:
         5.1.11.6.1. Grant the 52 MSG/CD or an appropriate designee access to any records
         maintained by the unit or agency conducting the rehabilitation program.
         5.1.11.6.2. Permit the unit or agency to discuss the respondent’s progress with the 52
         MSG/CD or an appropriate designee.
     5.1.11.7. Some method of verifying the completion of the project if the agreement
     includes a community service project. At his or her discretion, the 52 MSG/CD may
     allow a parent or guardian to provide such verification if they have overseen a juvenile
     offender during the course of the community service project.
  5.1.12. Each respondent will sign a separate agreement even if all respondents share the
  same terms and conditions of an R&RO.
  5.1.13. At the 52 MSG/CD’s discretion, the agreement may be provided as an attachment to
  the NAA or presented to the respondent or guardian separately before the NAA is issued.
  However, 52 MSG/CD is not obligated to delay issuing the NAA to await the results of the
  R&RO.
  5.1.14. The NAA will state the adverse actions imposed, including the R&RO, and clearly
  state the consequences of failing to complete the R&RO duty.
 18                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


   5.1.15. The respondent may not appeal the imposition of an R&RO duty, whereas other
   adverse actions imposed at the same time may be appealed. The respondent may, however,
   request a specific form of R&RO as a form of relief in any appeal. In this case, the 52
   MSG/CD will include in his or her written comments to the 52 MSG/CC on the appeal
   (paragraph 7.5.) a statement as to whether such R&RO or a similar form of it is available in
   the community, the respondent’s eligibility for it, and an assessment as to whether or not the
   respondent might be a good candidate for the program requested. If the appellate authority
   grants relief in the form of an R&RO, the respondent or guardian must voluntarily enter into
   an agreement (paragraph 5.1.11.).
   5.1.16. When the 52 MSG/CD decides to take other appropriate action against the offender,
   he or she should consider the respondent’s failure to agree to or successfully complete an
   R&RO duty.
5.2. Suspension or Revocation of Logistic-Support Privileges. By a variety of methods, 52
MSG/CD may effectively suspend or revoke privileges to use the following facilities and
services:
   5.2.1. AAFES Facilities. Unless otherwise specified, revocation or suspension of AAFES
   privileges will include check-cashing privileges. In case of shoplifting, employee pilferage,
   or intentional presentation of dishonored checks, exchange privileges will be revoked for a
   minimum period of 6 months. The NOI and NAA must specify the facilities to which the
   revocation or suspension applies.
   5.2.2. Commissary. The 52 MSG/CD may suspend or revoke commissary privileges if
   those privileges are abused. If the decision to suspend or revoke commissary privileges is
   made by 52 MSG/CD, the respondent may appeal that decision to 52 MSG/CC.
   5.2.3. Rations. The 52 MSG/CD may suspend or revoke ration privileges if they are
   abused. Decisions are final and not subject to appeal.
   5.2.4. Class VI. Class-VI privileges may be suspended or revoked if abused or if the
   misconduct is alcohol-related. Decisions are final and not subject to appeal.
   5.2.5. Nonappropriated Fund Facilities or Activities, also known as Morale, Welfare,
   and Recreation (MWR) Facilities or Activities.
      5.2.5.1. Access to MWR/non appropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI), facilities and
      services and participation in MWR activities, individually or collectively, may be
      suspended or revoked. Services that may be denied include:
          5.2.5.1.1. Participation in youth sports; child, youth, and school services; and other
          youth programs.
          5.2.5.1.2. Check-cashing privileges.
          5.2.5.1.3. Patronage at lounges, bars, and other facilities that serve food and
          beverages.
      5.2.5.2. The 52 MSG/CD will furnish lists of individuals to whom entry to community
      facilities was denied to respective local facility managers to implement the preclusion for
      the duration specified. Individuals listed who enter facilities to which they have lost
      access will be treated as trespassers. Sponsors and local or host-nation law-enforcement
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                            19


     authorities may be asked to remove them. 52 MSG/CD will keep a master list of
     individuals denied access to various community facilities.
     5.2.5.3. The decision to deny access to MWR facilities or services or participation in
     MWR activities may be appealed to 52 MSG/CC.
  5.2.6. Government Housing.
     5.2.6.1. Assignment to Government housing may be terminated by 52 FW/CC if a
     sponsor or family member is involved in an illegal use of the premises or in misconduct
     that threatens the safety, health, or welfare of neighbors. Termination procedures will be
     conducted      in    accordance       with    Air     Force    Instruction   (AFI)     32-
     6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP, Family Housing Management.
     5.2.6.2. 52 FW/CC’s decision to terminate Government housing because of misconduct
     is not appealable. If 52 MSG/CC recommends termination of Government housing to 52
     FW/CC, that recommendation may be appealed 52 FW/CC who will decide if
     termination of housing is appropriate.
  5.2.7. Installation Driving Privileges.
     5.2.7.1. 52 FW/CC, who is responsible for the safety and welfare of the Spangdahlem
     community, grants the authorization to drive a motor vehicle of any type on the
     installation. This privilege is not considered logistic support, nor is it automatically linked
     to the possession of a USAREUR driver’s license (paragraph 5.2.8). 52 MSG/CD has the
     authority under the AFI 31-204_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMBSUP, Air Force Motor
     Vehicle Supervision, to suspend or revoke a respondent’s driving privileges for the
     installation. Note: The underlying AFI and Spangdahlem supplement are under revision
     and expected to change, but 52 MSG/CD will retain the authority to suspend or revoke
     installation driving privileges.
     5.2.7.2. Decisions to suspend or revoke installation driving privileges are final and not
     subject to appeal.
     5.2.7.3. SFS initiates actions to suspend or revoke installation driving privileges.
  5.2.8. USAREUR Driving Privileges.
     5.2.8.1. Mandatory revocations and suspensions of USAREUR driving privileges are
     governed     solely    by    Joint    AFI     31-218_USAFESUP      To   AFI     31-
     204_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUPAit Force Motor Vehicle Supervision. .
     Suspension and revocation authority has been given to 52 MSG/CD by AFI 31-
     204_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP. 52 MSG/CC and 52 FW/CC may also
     suspend or revoke driving privileges. Note: The citations to the above guidance are
     expected to change, but the authority of the 52 FW/CC, 52 MSG/CC and 52 MSG/CD
     will remain as stated.
     5.2.8.2. If a 52 MSG/CD or 52 MSG/CC determines that civilian misconduct warrants a
     discretionary revocation or suspension of USAREUR driving privileges, he or she may
     exercise his or her discretion and suspend or revoke USAREUR driving privileges.
 20                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


      5.2.8.3. The appeal of the actual suspension or revocation will be based on AFI 31-
      204_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP, or its successor and will not be part of the
      Misconduct by Civilians Program.
      5.2.8.4. 52 SFS, the individual’s commander or first sergeant is responsible for the
      physical confiscation of an Army Europe (AE) Form 190-1F, USAREUR Driver’s
      License.
      5.2.8.5. SFS initiates actions to suspend or revoke USAREUR Drivers Licenses.
5.3. Barment Orders.
   5.3.1. General. 18 USC section 1382, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5200.08, Security DoD
   Installations and Resources and the Physical Security Review Board (PSRB), German
   Criminal Trespass law, and AFI 31-101, Security, govern the authority, penalties, policy, and
   procedures for barment actions. 52 FW/CC may bar offenders from all areas and facilities
   under his or her responsibility and control, i.e. the entire installation and its annexes. This
   authority is not delegated any further. A barment order may be permanent or temporary, but
   should be reasonable under the circumstances. 52 MSG/CC or 52 MSG/CC may only
   recommend to his or her FW/CC that a respondent be prohibited from entering an installation
   as a response to misconduct. Note: Subordinate commanders may restrict offenders from
   facilities under their control.
   5.3.2. Appeals. Barment orders are not subject to appeal, but a respondent may submit a
   request for reconsideration or revocation to 52 FW/CC. 52 MSG/CC’s recommendation to
   52 FW/CC to impose a barment order may be appealed to the 52 FW/CC.
   5.3.3. Theater-Wide Barment Orders.
      5.3.3.1. 52 FW/CC has authority to impose a theater-wide bar on respondents. A 52
      MSG/CC’s or 52 MSG/CD’s recommendation to impose a theater-wide bar on a
      respondent must be forwarded through the 52 MSG/CD’s chain of command.
      5.3.3.2. Attachment 6, Figure A6.1 is an interservice memorandum of agreement
      (MOA) on the acknowledgment, enforcement, and issuance of reciprocal installation bar-
      to-entry orders among and between the Services in the European theater, which became
      effective on 26 April 2002. This MOA gives rise to a presumption of reciprocity between
      the Services when one Service imposes a theater-wide bar. For a theater-wide barment
      order to become subject to the terms of the MOA, the imposing commander or designee
      must submit the order to a designated office. The Theater Personnel Services Support
      Branch, Host Nation Liaison Field Operating Activity (HNLFOA), Installation
      Management Command (IMCOM)-Europe, is the successor to the office indicated in the
      MOA. The imposing commander or designee must submit the barment order and a
      summary of the circumstances of the barment, if not included in the barment order itself,
      to IMCOM-Europe (IMEU-HB), Unit 29055, APO AE 09081-9055.
      5.3.3.3. 52 FW/CC should notify the respondent of the interservice applicability of the
      barment order by including the following statement in the body of the order: “Pursuant to
      the interservice memorandum of agreement for installation bars, effective 26 April 2002,
      this action will bar your entry into all facilities under the operational control of the U.S.
      Armed Forces in Europe. ”
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                         21


     5.3.3.4. 52 FW/CC may issue a barment order that limits its applicability to
     Spangdahlem AB, or United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) installations.
     5.3.3.5. 52 SFS will ensure that the Theater Personnel Services Support Branch,
     HNLFOA, is notified when an interservice theater-wide barment is lifted or modified by
     52 FW/CC. Note: The rescission or modification of a theater-wide barment order by the
     imposing commander does not force commanders of the other Services to allow the
     respondent to enter their facilities and installations. Such determinations remain matters
     of individual command discretion.
  5.3.4. APF and NAF Employee Barments. 52 FW/CC must coordinate barment orders for
  current APF and NAF employees with the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) for APF
  employees, and the NAF Human Resources Office for NAF employees and legal office
  before issuing them. It may be necessary to delay imposition of the barment until disciplinary
  action has been completed or to modify the terms of the barment order to allow an employee
  access for employment purposes. Barments against DoDDS or AAFES employees must be
  coordinated with the respective employing agencies.
     5.3.4.1. Generally, APF employees have statutory due-process rights that must be
     observed in employment-related adverse actions. A bar from a place of employment may
     constitute a constructive termination triggering such rights. This usually means that if the
     barment is served before the employee’s removal by the traditional removal method, the
     employee must be paid until removed from employment, even if the employee is barred
     from coming onto the base for work. Therefore, before imposing a bar from a place of
     employment, the evidence should be sufficient to support a traditional removal action,
     and any applicable statutory processes surrounding a removal action should be followed
     prior to implementing the bar.
     5.3.4.2. All individuals, regardless of their present employment status, will be notified of
     the following in their barment orders:
         5.3.4.2.1. Respondents must disclose the fact of this barment order on applications
         for employment with U.S. Forces installations in the areas covered by the order for
         the duration of the barment.
         5.3.4.2.2. Failure to comply constitutes misconduct that may warrant removal from
         Federal service should the barred individual secure Federal employment in affected
         areas during the period of the barment. Note: Selecting officials may consider the
         reasons for an employee’s inability to lawfully enter prospective places of
         employment. Applicants for competitive-service positions may have appeal rights
         when agencies deny them employment based on conduct-related reasons. (5 CFR 731
         shows an example.) If such a barred applicant is selected as the best qualified,
         management should consult the servicing CPO and legal office to determine whether
         a suitability determination is appropriate. The inability to gain lawful access to a
         prospective place of employment may be considered as a factor in the selection
         process. Note: APF employees who are erroneously hired after a bar has been issued
         and before the bar is successfully appealed must still receive statutory due process
         based on their status. In such cases, the imposing authority should consult with the
         servicing SJA and may consider minimally amending the bar to allow the barred
 22                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


          employee access to the place of employment in exchange for the employee’s entry
          into a “Last Chance” or “Alternative to Traditional Discipline” agreement.
      5.3.4.3. A barred NAF employee may be separated as disqualified in accordance with
      AFMAN 34-310, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Program Management
      Administration. Consequently, bars that prevent a NAF employee’s entry into places of
      employment must be based on circumstances that ordinarily would support separation
      under NAF regulations.
   5.3.5. Contractor Employees. Contractor employees are not Federal employees. Before
   imposing a barment action, 52 SFS will coordinate with the appropriate 52d Contracting
   Squadron (52 CONS) or the servicing Contracting Officer to ensure that the Government’s
   refusal to allow a contractor employee entry does not interfere with the contractor’s
   performance, as required by the contract terms, and does not cause the Government to
   terminate the contract or incur liability in favor of the contractor.
   5.3.6. Limitations on Barment Authority. Barment may not prohibit a minor enrolled in a
   DoDDS school from accessing the education facility, nor may it prohibit an offender from
   receiving military medical attention if entitled to it.
   5.3.7. Legal Coordination. All bars from entry must be coordinated with 52 FW/JA before
   they are imposed.
   5.3.8. Early Departure of an Offender. If an offender departs a command before a bar
   action is initiated or concluded, the action may be held pending the return of the individual or
   processed by forwarding the barment letter to the offender at his or her forwarding address.
   Underlying information may be forwarded to the gaining commander for consideration.
   Certified mail with return receipt, or its equivalent, will be used to accomplish and record
   proper delivery. If possible, 52 MSG/CC, 52 MSG/CD, and 52 SFS should determine the
   departure status of an offender when they learn of misconduct and attempt to conclude
   necessary actions before the offender departs.
5.4. Early Return of Dependents (ERD). This policy is based on Joint Travel Regulations
(JTR) and Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Paragraphs 5900 to 5920.
   5.4.1. General. 52 MSG/CC has the authority to grant voluntary ERDs. 52 MSG/CC will
   consider an early return of family members or other civilian offenders to the continental
   United States when other administrative measures are not expected to be effective. However,
   if host-nation authorities indicate the intent to prosecute the offender or are likely to do so, an
   ERD will not be affected without host-nation approval, coordinated through the local LLA
   (paragraph 1.4.10.).
   5.4.2. Voluntary ERD. In cases where the 52 MSG/CC notifies the respondent and his or
   her sponsor that an ERD is being considered as an adverse action in response to the alleged
   misconduct, the NOI will include a statement encouraging the sponsor to consider requesting
   a voluntary ERD. The NOI will also inform the sponsor that he or she must include such a
   request, if desired, in any response to that NOI. If the sponsor requests a voluntary ERD, the
   request will be forwarded to the sponsor’s unit to be processed in accordance with the
   controlling regulations. The 52 MSG/CC may consider the request in his or her decision as to
   what adverse actions to impose. He or she may, but is not required to, suspend other adverse
   actions pending completion of the voluntary ERD process.
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                         23


   5.4.3. Involuntary ERD. An involuntary ERD may be imposed only when the sponsor is a
   military member. It is not an available adverse action for a dependent of a civilian employee.
   In cases where the 52 MSG/CC determines that an ERD is in the best interest of the
   community and the sponsor has not requested an ERD for his or her dependent, the 52
   MSG/CC will recommend to the 52 FW/CC, the approval authority per JFTR U5900 B.2.b.,
   that the offender be subjected to an involuntary ERD.
5.5. Curtailment of Tour.
   5.5.1. Military Sponsors. In appropriate cases, the 52 MSG/CC may request a curtailment
   of an overseas tour of a military sponsor. 52 MSG/CC’s recommendation for curtailment of
   a sponsor’s tour is not appealable. The respondent will have an opportunity to be heard in
   the curtailment process.
   5.5.2. Civilian Sponsors. A family member’s inability to adapt to the overseas environment
   may be an indication that the employee is unable to adapt completely. This may be a factor in
   any decision on extending the sponsor’s tour beyond 3 years and every 2 years thereafter. If
   an employee’s reassignment involves an abridgment of the employee’s initial overseas or
   renewal tour, curtailment rules in applicable travel and transportation regulations must also
   be observed. Managers should consult CPO and SJA before they make such decisions.

                                   SUSPENDED ACTIONS

6.1. The 52 MSG/CD may suspend one or more administrative actions on the condition of
good behavior by the offender or based on an agreement to perform R&RO duties as
described in paragraph 5. 1. Suspension means that the imposition of the adverse action is
delayed for the period or purpose described in the NAA or a subsequent notice to the respondent.
Administrative actions may not be suspended for periods longer than those specified in the
underlying regulation, and ordinarily the suspension should not exceed one (1) year. If the
respondent complies with the conditions of the suspension, the adverse action will be terminated.
SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                         25


                                           Chapter 7

                                          APPEALS

7.1. Chapter 5 includes appeal options on individual adverse actions.
   7.1.1. Appeals of suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges and USAREUR
   Drivers Licenses, see paragraphs 5.7. and 5.8. supra, are controlled by other guidance and not
   this Civilian Misconduct Program instruction. Appeals of suspension or revocation of
   installation driving privileges and USAREUR Drivers Licenses are submitted to SFS.
   7.1.2. Appeals of barment reconsideration, revocation or modification are submitted to SFS
   at any time.
7.2. When an adverse action is subject to appeal, the appeal may be presented by the
respondent or his or her sponsor. The appeal must be submitted to the 52 MSG/CC within
five (5) calendar days after the NAA has been received and should be addressed to the appellate
authority as identified in Chapter 5. It should state why the respondent considers the appealed
action inappropriate and the relief he or she is requesting. The respondent may include character
statements and other material, but the 52 MSG/CC will normally not grant extensions to the
appeal period for the respondent to get character references.
7.3. The 52 MSG/CC may delay the effective date of adverse actions pending an appeal.
7.4. The 52 MSG/CC will review the submitted appeal. The 52 MSG/CC may grant the full
relief requested by the respondent, notify the respondent of the decision, and consequently close
the case without further opportunity for an appeal. If the 52 MSG/CC does not grant the full
relief requested, he or she will forward the appeal within three (3) workdays to 52 MSG/CD,
including the completed case file with a summary of the facts of the case, a summary of the
information submitted and the relief requested by the respondent, and information on any relief

                    NOTIFICATION OF U.S. HIRING AUTHORITIES

10.1. If the offender is a Federal (APF or NAF) or contractor employee , the 52 MSG/CD

SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                                29


                                             Chapter 11

                      CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN HOST NATIONS

11.1. This chapter provides guidance and procedures for U.S. military authorities to follow
when criminal complaints are filed against civilians for offenses committed against the U.S.
Government. The 52 MSG/CD may take action against an offender even when host-nation judicial
or administrative authorities are taking action against the offender, provided that the proposed actions
do not adversely affect any host-nation interest in the case or the individual. Such actions must be
coordinated with the local LLA.
11.2. Initiation of Criminal Complaints in Germany. U.S. military authorities may file
criminal complaints with the local German police or with the appropriate local German
prosecutor’s office on behalf of the U.S. military agency that is the victim of an offense.
   11.2.1. Criminal complaints may be filed against U.S. civilians and German or third-country
   national personnel suspected of having committed the offense. The following are examples of
   offenses:
       11.2.1.1. Criminal trespassing on a fenced installation made available to the U.S.
       military for its exclusive use.
       11.2.1.2. Larceny or destruction of U.S. Government property.
       11.2.1.3. Fraud or embezzlement of U.S. Government property.
       11.2.1.4. Offenses listed under Article 7 of the Fourth Law to Amend the German Criminal
       Law of 11 June 1957, as amended, when an agency of the U.S. Forces is the victim.
   11.2.2. The military authority determining whether or not a complaint should be filed must
   consult the servicing SJA. The SJA will refer the matter to the appropriate LLA. The LLA
   will be the only POC between the military authority filing the complaint and German
   prosecutorial officials.
   11.2.3. When the U.S. Government rather than a private individual is the victim of an
   offense, the agency that has control over or responsibility for the property should file the
   complaint. The authority, responsibility, and procedures for filing criminal complaints
   through the LLA are as follows:
       11.2.3.1. When criminal trespassing has occurred in, on, or against a fenced U.S. Forces-
       controlled installation, the 52 FW/CC should file the complaint.
       11.2.3.2. When larceny of Government-owned property other than money has occurred,
       the complaint should be filed by the following:
           11.2.3.2.1. The property book officer responsible for the property (APF property).
           11.2.3.2.2. The fund custodian (NAF property).
       11.2.3.3. When larceny or embezzlement of Government funds (APF or NAF) has
       occurred, the person responsible for the funds involved should file the complaint (for
       example: finance officer, commissary officer, fund custodian).
30                                       SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


     11.2.3.4. When an offense is against the security of the U.S. Forces or installation other
     than Spangdahlem and its annexes or GSUs, the matter should be referred to the
     commander who has jurisdiction over the area where the offense occurred should file the
     complaint. Commanders should make these requests for prosecution, since these offenses
     are politically sensitive. The Federal prosecutor general (Generalbundesanwalt) or the
     State prosecutor general (Generalstaatsanwalt) at the applicable superior State court
     (Oberlandesgericht) normally prosecutes.
     11.2.3.5. LLAs should submit a complaint either by a notification of offense
     (Strafanzeige) or a request for prosecution (Strafantrag). No standard format exists for
     the notice or request. LLAs will submit enough factual information with the complaint to
     indicate that an offense has been committed. Except for those offenses described in
     paragraph 11.2.3.4 above, the LLA should submit the notice or request either to the local
     police or to the office of the public prosecutor (Staatsanwaltschaft) who has jurisdiction
     for the area in which the offense occurred.
     11.2.3.6. Most offenses will be prosecuted without a request for prosecution when there
     is a firm suspicion that an offense has occurred. Certain offenses (for example:
     trespassing, larceny of property with little value) may be prosecuted only on request of
     the property holder. An exception is when the prosecutor determines that prosecution is
     required in the public interest. When requests for prosecution are necessary, the victim
     must submit the request for prosecution (not the notification of offense) within 3 months
     after he or she suspects the offense occurred. When a request for prosecution is
     submitted, the complainant becomes entitled to certain rights including the right to:
        11.2.3.6.1. Be notified if the charges are dismissed and to file objections to such a
        disposition.
        11.2.3.6.2. Take part in the criminal proceedings as an intervener (Nebenkläger).
        11.2.3.6.3. Be informed of the results of the prosecution.
  11.2.4. When determining the propriety of filing a complaint, military authorities must
  consider the following possibilities:
     11.2.4.1. If the court determines that a false complaint was filed intentionally or frivolously
     (leichtfertig), the court must assess against the complainant the costs of the proceedings and
     the necessary expenditures (including attorney fees) of the person against whom the
     complaint was filed (German Code of Criminal Procedure, sec 469).
     11.2.4.2. If the complaint is withdrawn, the complainant may under certain circumstances be
     required to pay the costs and expenditures described above (German Code of Criminal
     Procedure, sec 470). Because APFs may not be available to pay such costs and expenditures,
     the person who knowingly or frivolously files a false complaint or withdraws a complaint
     (even when the complaint is valid) may be personally liable for payment of the costs and
     expenditures.

                                           Attachment 5
       GUIDELINES FOR CIVILIAN MISCONDUCT ACTION AUTHORITIES

A5.1. Purpose. This appendix provides guidance for the civilian misconduct action authority
(52 MSG/CD) on selecting and effectively using administrative procedures to handle cases of
civilian misconduct. It also provides guidance on using administrative sanctions that are
available to the 52 MSG/CD.
A5.2. Establishing Civilian Misconduct Program and Procedures. This regulation provides
52 MSG/CD great flexibility in structuring his or her individual program, subject to specified
minimum due-process requirements. With the help of 52 FW/JA, 52 MSG/CD should evaluate
his or her community needs and organize the program accordingly.
   A5.2.1. Due-process requirements mandate certain procedural steps. 52 MSG/CD will do the
   following in every 52 MSG/CD case:
       A5.2.1.1. Notify and coordinate with the local LLA for the types of cases described in
       paragraph 1.5.6 of this instruction
       A5.2.1.2. Review available facts.
       A5.2.1.3. Take the following actions after determining that sanctions beyond minor
       administrative action (see paragraph 4.3) are appropriate:
          A5.2.1.3.1. Notify the offender, sponsor, parents, or guardian of intended
          administrative actions when the information establishes that pertinent facts and
          sanctions are appropriate.
          A5.2.1.3.2. Provide the offender an opportunity to respond in writing within 3
          workdays (see paragraph 2.3.2.2.1.).
          A5.2.1.3.3. Provide the offender an opportunity to examine the file (see paragraph
          2.3.2.2.2).
          A5.2.1.3.4. After reviewing responses to notifications, provide the offender a written
          notice of the decision, administrative sanctions (if any), and the opportunity to submit
          a written appeal within 5 calendar days (see paragraph 2.3.3.3).
          A5.2.1.3.5. Forward appeals to the appellate authority (see paragraph 7.4).
   A5.2.2. Other actions may be adopted to help the 52 MSG/CD in the fact-finding or
   adjudication process. Although not required, these measures may be particularly helpful in
   resolving cases of civilian misconduct by adding clarity and consistency to the process.
   Additional measures may include the following:
       A5.2.2.1. Immediately suspending ILS privileges to prevent further misconduct until the
       case is decided (paragraph 5.2.).
       A5.2.2.2. Conducting a preliminary inquiry to collect more information (paragraph 2.2).
       A5.2.2.3. Appointing an IO.
       A5.2.2.4. Conducting hearings. This may include personal appearances by the offender,
       witnesses, or interested parties.
 44                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI51-1001 3 DECEMBER 2013


       A5.2.2.5. Delaying the effective date of sanctions pending an appeal (paragraph 7.3.).
A5.3. Selecting the Best Method for Disposition of the Case.
   A5.3.1. No further inquiry is necessary when an offender admits misconduct or when
   pertinent facts are otherwise established. When the 52 SFS is unsure about the sufficiency of
   the evidence, he or she should refer the available evidence to 52 FW/JA for review.
   A5.3.2. In most cases, the 52 SFS or other agency report will include enough information to
   establish facts needed to determine whether minor administrative action or adverse
   administrative action should be taken. Notice and appeal rights do not apply when minor
   administrative actions are taken.
       A5.3.2.1. Reports from initial 52 SFS investigations may provide enough information to
       determine whether a person committed the offense.
       A5.3.2.2. 52 MSG/CD should not conduct formal investigations. 52 SFS will conduct
       normal law enforcement investigations. When additional investigation is necessary, the
       affected commander should appoint an IO. Appointing an IO should be a last resort.
   A5.3.3. Hearings or board proceedings are not required or recommended. Such procedures
   are at the 52 MSG/CD’s discretion and should be applied only in cases involving serious
   criminal misconduct, in cases where a hearing would have an attention getting/deterrent
   purpose, or when the 52 MSG/CD is considering severe adverse administrative action.
   Severe adverse administrative actions may include:
       A5.3.3.1. Revoking logistic support privileges.
       A5.3.3.2. Terminating access to Government housing facilities.
       A5.3.3.3. Barring entry into an area of responsibility (for example, base installations).
       A5.3.3.4. An early return of family members.
       A5.3.3.5. Curtailing a tour.
   A5.3.4. When the person is not affiliated with the military or civilian workforce, the
   administrative due-process procedures in this instruction do not apply. For example, if the
   offender is not an employee of the U.S. Forces, a U.S. Forces family member, or a contractor
   employee, 52 FW/CC may bar the person from the area (when the offense warrants such
   action) without advance notice and without allowing an opportunity to respond or appeal.
A5.4. Additional Guidance for Selecting Appropriate Administrative Actions (Sanctions).
   A5.4.1. Chapter 5 of this instruction describes the factors that the 52 MSG/CD should
   consider when determining which administrative actions are appropriate in response to
   civilian misconduct.
   A5.4.2. Table A5.1. suggests penalties to help 52 MSG/CD select an appropriate
   administrative action for a particular act of misconduct. 52 MSG/CD is not limited to taking
   only the actions listed in this table. Taking an action that is not suggested in this table is not a
   basis for appealing the 52 MSG/CD action or recommendation.

NOTE: A particular adverse administrative action is not mandatory solely because it is listed in
this table. The selection of an appropriate administrative action requires balancing relevant
factors in each case.

       A5.4.2.1. Table A5.1 does not list every act of misconduct. When an act of misconduct is
       committed that is not listed, 52 MSG/CD may determine an appropriate administrative
       action by comparing the misconduct with other acts of misconduct listed.
       A5.4.2.2. A particular adverse administrative action is not mandatory solely because it is
       listed in table A5.1. Selecting an appropriate administrative action requires balancing the
       relevant factors in each case. For example, even for acts of misconduct for which an early
       return of family members or a curtailment of tour is not listed for a first offense, an early
       return or a curtailment for a first offense may be appropriate for an aggravated offense or
       multiple offenses.
   A5.4.3. In determining the appropriate administrative action for subsequent acts of
   misconduct, the 52 MSG/CD should consider how much time has passed since the previous
   offense or offenses in relation to the most recent act of misconduct.
       A5.4.3.1. Previous acts of misconduct may form the basis for proposing a more severe
       administrative action. Although counseling and letters of warning are not considered
       adverse administrative actions, they may be considered when determining an appropriate
       administrative action for a subsequent act of misconduct.
       A5.4.3.2. Aggravating factors that the 52 MSG/CD intends to consider (for example:
       previous acts of misconduct, the severity of the current misconduct) should be included in
       the notice of the proposed administrative action provided to the offender. The offender
       should have an opportunity to respond to those factors.

  A5.4.4. The 52 MSG/CD should also consider the offender’s willingness to take part in a
  community supervision program voluntarily when determining the appropriate administrative
  action or penalty (paragraph 5.1). The 52 MSG/CD may allow the offender to perform
  community service instead of imposing an administrative sanction or penalty.
