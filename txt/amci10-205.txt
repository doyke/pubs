                                             CHAPTER 1

                                    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. Large Package Week (LPW) is a training exercise specifically designed to continuously
improve our joint airborne war-fighting capability. Additionally, LPW is used to validate the combat
readiness of leadership, planning staff, and aircrews through the employment of theater combat aerial
delivery doctrine. Air Force Mission Commanders (AFMCs) should use LPW to train themselves, their
staffs, and the crews to operate effectively in the joint arena, using many forms of tactical employment.
LPW is scheduled to coincide with the Army’s 8-week brigade training cycle, and is used by their leader-
ship to validate the combat readiness of their Strategic Brigade (the next in line for national alert).
   1.1.1. This instruction describes Large Package Week concepts, planning considerations, and execu-
   tion, as well as the standard process for debriefing the week’s activities. AFMCs comply with AMC
   OPORD 17-76 (as applicable) and host unit directives. Specifically, for operations in and around Pope
   AFB NC, AFMCs must comply with Pope AFB Instruction 11-105 and any other published guidance,
   and must coordinate with 43 OG/OGJ En route Operations. Contact 43 OG/OGJ for assistance in
   obtaining these specific publications. The host unit must approve deviations from local instructions.
   Additional information describing Large Package Week concepts, planning considerations, and exe-
   cution can be found in 82D ABN DIV ASOP, Chapter 4.

                                               CHAPTER 2

                              CONCEPT OF LARGE PACKAGE WEEK

2.1. Training Concept. LPW helps meet some very basic training needs to ensure our nation has a
fully-ready airborne capability. On very few other occasions are large numbers of aircraft dedicated to
large-scale airborne training. This routine exercise, by focusing large numbers of airdrop-capable aircraft
and crews on a single training event, provides:
    2.1.1. Air Force training for Air Force Mission Commanders, operational staffs, and crews on situa-
    tions where the Army requires Air Force support to rapidly put mass troops into an objective area.
    2.1.2. Army large unit training and stability to their training schedule that is difficult to achieve with
    small numbers of aircraft.
    2.1.3. Joint training for all players, to include command relationships, planning, and communica-
    tions.

2.2. Planning/Scheduling. To realize the most benefits from this training, planning must begin 4 to 6
months ahead of the individual LPW. Although the exact mix of aircraft is not identified until the JA/ATT
conference, the LPW schedule and mission command units are coordinated many months ahead of the
event. Mission command units are encouraged to develop the types of challenging, multiplayer scenarios
they could face in actual contingency operations. The AFMC should review the sample LPW Planning
Schedule (Attachment 3) and tailor, as needed, to the specific exercise.

Figure 2.1. LPW Organizational Flow Chart




2.3. Command Relations. Air Force Mission Commanders are responsible for execution of all LPW
missions. The AFMC reports directly to 21 AF/CC, who maintains operational oversight through 21 AF/
DO. AFMCs remain responsible for normal mission reporting requirements to AMC TACC/CC. While
conducting flight operations from Pope AFB, AFMCs are obliged to follow local guidance concerning
operation in the Pope AFB AOR, Restricted Area R-5311, and any Pope AFB Letters of Agreement.
Local area procedures are available to mission planners from 43 OSS/OSK or can be found on the 21 AF/
DOT web page.
    2.3.1. 43 OG/CC directs flying activities at Pope AFB to include providing en route support for LPW
    missions. The 43 OG/CC as the executive agent for 43 AW/CC is responsible for the investigation of
AMCI10-205 1 JANUARY 2002                                                                                 5


   aircraft/aircrew incidents, off-DZ drops, load malfunctions, etc. He will make determinations as to air-
   craft and aircrew status in conjunction and coordination with the AFMC and deployed unit’s OG
   Commander.

2.4. Air Force Mission Commanders. AFMC schedule is coordinated by TACC/XOBC and published
on the JA/ATT web site. The mission command wing/group will assign a colonel, normally the operations
group commander, to be the LPW AFMC (see HQ AMC OPORD 17-76, Annex C, para 4.12.). This
AFMC is responsible for conduct of the Air Force portion of the operation, to include a scenario/schedule
that best meets training needs for all participants, selection/training of appropriate staff, execution, and
after-action reports/briefings. The AFMC will have observed at least one previous LPW. The AFMC will
attend the VTC for the previous LPW’s post-mission briefing to gain an understanding of lessons learned.
The AFMC will also review AMC OPORD 17-76 and the LPW section of the 21 AF/DOT web page
http://www.mcguire.af.mil/21af/do/dot/lpw.htm) prior to beginning the planning process. The AFMC
will provide detailed logistics package to the 743 MX/LGM. The AFMC will, in coordination with other
participants, endeavor to build the exercise as a joint operation, complete with command structure and
communications formats. Normally, the AFMC designates a field grade deputy AFMC to conduct much
of the pre-coordination and lay the groundwork for a successful LPW.

2.5. MDS Considerations. Normally, 6 C-17 and 5 C-130 equivalents should be dedicated to LPW. One
spare should be planned if available. Multiple MDSs are encouraged; exact mix of aircraft will be deter-
mined by TACC. During multiple MDS participation each MDS will have a dedicated mission planner to
the AFMC. The MDS mission planner (wing/group) will be determined at the JA/ATT conference. Spares
should be provided if possible, but, aircraft/aircrew commitments to higher priority missions may pre-
clude spares and, in extreme circumstances, the full complement of C-17 and C-130 equivalents.

2.6. NAF Oversight. HQ 21 AF personnel will periodically observe LPW planning and execution; inter-
est areas will include maximizing training for all participants and maintaining a realistic focus.

2.7. LPW Guidance. The 21 AF/DO staff will maintain an LPW section on the 21 AF web site
(http://www.mcguire.af.mil/21af/do/dot/lpw.htm). This web site will include this instruction, the LPW
schedule (including AFMCs), after-action reports, slides and minutes of outbriefs, daily SITREP format,
and a place for AFMCs to pass on lessons learned to future mission commanders.
   2.7.1. Situation Reports (SITREPs). The AFMC will provide daily SITREPs, via Pope AFB Com-
   mand Post (or host base command post), to TACC/XOZ, TACC/XOBC, participating units, HQ
   AMC/DOK, HQ AMC/LGM, 15 AF/DO, and 21 AF/CC/CV/DO/DOT/LG/LGM.

                                              CHAPTER 3

                                          PLANNING STAGE

3.1. Objective. The main objectives for Large Package Week (LPW) are outlined in Attachment 2 of
this instruction. Although each LPW provides the airlift for the 82d Airborne Division’s Readiness Bri-
gade Intensive Training Cycle, the AFMC should consider enhancing training and inter-wing cooperation
through the use of non-AMC assets (i.e., J-STARS, AWACS, CAS, etc.). Airland missions should be
scheduled to increase realism in the joint operation, including assault landing zone (ALZ) operations for
participating C-17s and C-130s. Tactical deception plans, fighter aircraft and airborne command and con-
trol platforms may be used to provide realism to the exercise. Non-AMC assets need to be coordinated as
far in advance as possible, thus an initial joint planning conference should be planned prior to the JA/ATT
conference in which airlift assets are assigned.

3.2. Scheduling. Large Package Week long-term scheduling will be performed by TACC, with the active
involvement of individual unit current operations and logistics staffs. To maximize training for all
involved, a mix of crews (to include AFRC and ANG units) should be built into the plan.
    3.2.1. Prior to LPW, a strategic inter-theater deployment (SID) may be scheduled, IAW an agreement
    between the Air Force and the Army, prior to implementing the LPW rotation of once every 8 weeks.
    The SID mission should be conducted 2 working days prior to LPW to give both the Air Force and the
    Army a train-up period.
    3.2.2. Other than CAPSTONE, exercises, studies, visits, and inspections will not normally be sched-
    uled in conjunction with LPW without 21 AF approval to ensure the integrity, intent, and training
    focus of LPW is not compromised. However, short-notice changes may be necessary due to HQ AMC
    requirements, real-world taskings, or unit requests. Additionally, 15 AF and 21 AF will not normally
    schedule in-flight evaluations for units involved with LPW during the scheduled time frame. Sched-
    ules will be updated as required and sent to affected units.
    3.2.3. Airframes committed to LPW are a significant percentage of the nation’s airlift capability.
    LPW scenarios must provide sufficient flying time and aircrew training events to fully exercise the
    significant capability allocated.
    3.2.4. To maximize the training time available during LPW, additional training items will be added to
    aircrew profiles when possible. These events should include, but are not limited to, airland missions,
    including C-130 and C-17 ALZ operations, tactical arrivals/departures, low-level training, strange
    routes, and formation air refueling.

3.3. Staff Selection. AFMCs should ensure their staff is balanced with enough experienced operations
and logistics planners, MDS and subject area experts, and trainees to meet the objectives of the exercise.
Experience has shown the need for experienced planners and experts from each MDS while building the
plan-any qualified aircrew or jumper should be able to execute a good plan, but even the most experienced
professional can’t always save a bad plan.
    3.3.1. WIC Graduates. AFMCs will have at least one graduate of the USAF Weapons Instructor
    Course on their staff to assist in scenario planning. At the time AFMCs are identified, specific units
    will be tasked by AMC to provide a WIC graduate.
AMCI10-205 1 JANUARY 2002                                                                                     7


   3.3.2. TACC, in coordination with the mission command unit, will make every attempt to decrease
   other missions that need experienced crews during LPW.

3.4. Logistics. The LPW plan must include solid logistics planning, to include options when problems
arise. Planning must include the development or incorporation of the OPLAN/OPORD being exercised or
executed and take into consideration aircraft maintenance, ground equipment, spare parts, ground trans-
portation, fuel availability, logistics command and control, and spare aircraft availability. Compliance
with AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and the use of Integrated Deployment Modules
with the use of tailored unit type codes (UTCs) for tasking purposes will have a positive training impact
and ensure completeness. Using these codes is the preferred method.
   3.4.1. Planners and support personnel involved with LPW should be familiar with AMC OPORD
   17-76, Annex D, Logistics, Appendix 1, Logistics Personnel Augmentation, and Appendix 9, Aerial
   Port Personnel/Equipment Augmentation.
   3.4.2. The AFMC will coordinate with host base maintenance to include the following data in the
   daily SITREP: A summary of maintenance cancellations, by aircraft system (i.e., engines, hydraulics,
   fuel, etc.), to include a further breakdown for engine cancellations (i.e., starter valve, etc.); air aborts,
   by system, resulting in lost chutes and/or loads; and maintenance delays, by system, and resulting
   number of lost chutes and/or loads.

3.5. Special Tactics. 720 STG has functional control over all special tactics forces. The 21 STS has unit
affiliation with the XVIII Airborne Corps and primary responsibility for DZ/LZ coverage during LPW
operations. Contact 21 STS/DOX via telephone or e-mail (mailto:21sts.do@pope.af.mil) to coordinate
LPW operations, including any nonstandard DZ/LZ operations or markings. A special tactics mission
commander will normally be designated NLT 4 weeks prior to any LPW and can be contacted through 21
STS/DOX.

3.6. Static Displays and Unplanned Events. LPW AFMCs and planning staff will make every reason-
able attempt to minimize the geographical separation of LPW aircraft on the airfield; this includes static
displays for other exercises (CAPSTONE, etc.). This dispersal can unnecessarily complicate mainte-
nance, loading, and aircraft launch.
   3.6.1. LPW requirements should take priority over other exercise requirements for aircraft placement.
   LPW AFMCs should approve movement of all aircraft and personnel. Aircraft commanders will
   ensure incentive riders understand the ROE and their priority.

3.7. Joint Planning. The LPW schedule is published several months in advance, in conjunction with the
JA/ATT buy process cycle. With this much lead time, units should be able to begin joint planning of each
LPW months prior to execution. Because major changes to training events by one player can significantly
affect training for others, it is imperative that planning sessions be joint and include as many LPW plan-
ners as possible, including host base support. Air Force Mission Commanders will coordinate logistics
support requirements through the wing logistics plans office and Installation Deployment Officer (IDO),
who will employ local deployment processes to task requirements to the logistics group’s unit deployment
managers.
   3.7.1. LPW AFMCs and planning staff should use the planning schedule (Attachment 3) provided in
   this instruction. This schedule is provided as a planning guide only and can be altered by the LPW
8                                                                         AMCI10-205 1 JANUARY 2002


    AFMC and planning staff to reflect individual unit needs. However, it is essential to conduct a joint
    planning session (including functional area planners from Operations, Logistics Plans, Maintenance,
    Vehicles and Supply, Communications, Intel, etc.) as early as possible to allow for individual unit
    needs.
    3.7.2. A daily pre-outload meeting is conducted by the AFMC prior to the joint outload brief. The
    pre-outload will consist of, but not limited to, AFMCs support staff, all MDS planners, 43 En route
    Operation, and 743 MXS. This meeting will allow AFMC to make final coordination and to assure
    that all support personnel are aware of AFMCs plan of operation for that day’s lift. The pre-outload
    brief is followed by the joint outload brief chaired by the Army G-3 Air 5 hours prior to takeoff. The
    brief will cover load and bump plans, the aircraft parking plan, aircraft status, abort criteria, and final-
    ization of the timeline. This is a critical brief for it allows both the Army and Air Force to make any
    last-minute face-to-face changes prior to finalization of the mission.

3.8. Communications. Communications difficulties with conflicting or incompatible nets/equipment
can adversely affect LPW execution and must be considered thoroughly with the host base and all players
during the planning stage. LPW AFMC and planning staff will provide centralized communications plan-
ning functions for all LPWs and coordinate all requirements with necessary players/users. When JACC/
CP is included, planners should incorporate the onboard G3 Air representative into the communications
plan. The 82d Airborne Division needs takeoff status, en route status, and an alibi count sent to the JACC/
CP.

3.9. Transportation and Lodging. The AFMC and staff will coordinate all transportation and lodging
requirements through 43 OG/OGJX En route Ops as early as possible, but NLT 30 days prior to the mis-
sion. Due to the number of personnel deployed during LPW, transportation and lodging is a key issue.
Participating units will coordinate for rental vehicles with the use of AF Form 616 and submit total num-

                                              CHAPTER 4

                      PRE-/POST-EXERCISE BRIEFINGS AND REPORTS

4.1. Briefings. Twenty-First Air Force will perform oversight of LPW planning and operations. The fol-
lowing briefing requirements will allow adequate oversight, strengthen the coordination process among
operating units, and provide a forum for LPW process improvement. The LPW AFMC’s unit is responsi-
ble for scheduling the pre-exercise and post-exercise briefings. Example pre- and post-exercise briefing
slides are available at http://www.mcguire.af.mil/21af/do/dot/lpw.htm.
   4.1.1. Pre-exercise Briefing. 21 AF and 15 AF LPW AFMCs and planning staff will provide LPW
   JRTX/CAPSTONE brief to 21 AF/DOT by FAX or e-mail (mailto:21af.dot@mcguire.af.mil) 1
   week prior to exercise start date. The brief should include (but is not limited to) a description (as
   detailed as possible) of the LPW plan, to include an overview of planned operations, tactical scenario,
   locations, units and aircraft involved, joint and individual unit training requirements, AF unit training
   objectives, limiting factors, and potential work-arounds/solutions.
   4.1.2. HHQ Briefings During Execution. TACC/XOBC will provide mission briefing slides to
   TACC/XON for briefing CINCTRANS or his designated AMC representative on the Friday prior to
   mission execution. The brief should include AFMC, units participating, and timeline of exercise
   events. TACC/XOBC will also prepare event recap shells to TACC/XOCE. TACC/XOCE will com-
   plete these slides with information in the daily LPW SITREP and provide to TACC/XON for daily
   TACC briefing.
   4.1.3. Post-exercise Briefing. AFMCs and planning staff will conduct a post mission briefing to the
   21 AF/CC (CV or DO if CC is unavailable) as soon as practical following the execution of LPW oper-
   ations. This briefing will include the mission commander of the next LPW and should include a rep-
   resentative from each unit involved in LPW activities. This formal briefing will normally be a VTC
   coordinated with 21 AF/DOT, conducted by the AFMC and chaired by 21 AF/CC/CV. If schedules
   permit, a face-to-face briefing can be conducted at Pope AFB. Regardless of the forum used, this
   briefing should include (but is not limited to) a review of actual vs. planned events, actual vs. planned
   joint/unit training objectives, actual vs. planned AF-specific individual and unit training events, limit-
   ing factors, and potential solutions. Facilitators will use this forum to emphasize the “continual
   improvement” objective of this briefing and strive for input/suggestions from all units involved. For-
   ward the briefing (or briefing minutes) to 21 AF/DOT (mailto:21af.dot@mcguire.af.mil or FAX).

4.2. LPW/AFMC Continuity Guidance. LPW AFMCs and planning staff will submit suggestions and
“lessons learned” for the 21 AF/DOT LPW web page following the after-action VTC. These changes are
intended to assist future LPW AFMCs and their planning staffs in the completion of planning, execution,
and after-action duties. Additionally, LPW AFMCs and planning staffs are encouraged to provide sug-
gested changes to this instruction to the 21 AF LPW POC (21 AF/DOT).

                   LARGE PACKAGE WEEK (LPW) TRAINING OBJECTIVES

A2.1. AIR FORCE LARGE PACKAGE WEEK MISSION OBJECTIVE. The overall Air Force
objective for LPW is to provide the airlift capability to the 82d Airborne Division’s 8-week brigade train-
ing cycle exercise while at the same time preparing our mobility forces for joint airborne war-fighting

A2.2. AIR FORCE MISSION COMMANDER (AFMC) TRAINING OBJECTIVES. Early AFMC
involvement is important to ensure complex USAF training objectives can be incorporated into LPW
plans. The AFMC or representative should contact each USAF unit participating in the LPW to ascertain
their training goals and objectives for the deployment. Once USAF training objectives are determined,
participate in the US Army Initial Planning Conference (IPC) providing the lead-time to affect scenarios.
Current operations and wing tactics must be involved prior to JA/ATT conferences so sufficient airframes,
airspace reservations for AR tracks, restricted areas, etc., are requested as early as possible at the appro-
priate conference.
