This instruction implements AFPD 65-6, Budget. The purpose of this instruction is to establish consistent
application of the AFMC reimbursement policy for intracommand relationships within AFMC. It
excludes interservice agreements covered in AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements/AFI 25-201, Support
Agreements Procedures. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force
Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision gives new guidance on supplier-receiver funding responsibilities and flexibility in cost allo-
cation methods.


1. General Information. AFMC has a multitude of diverse mission responsibilities. In many cases,
these responsibilities are funded with different appropriations/fund types based on the nature of work per-
formed. In order to ensure proper cost accounting of required program costs, this instruction requires all
AFMC supplier activities (i.e., air base wing, product/logistic/test center staff functions, etc.) to establish
a support agreement with other intracommand activities, including single manager program offices, at
every AFMC installation, when above standard support is rendered and reimbursement is required. How-
ever, it does not include customer orders covered by AFMCI 65-602, Uniform Reimbursement and Pric-
ing Procedures. Further, this instruction determines supplier-receiver funding responsibility and
distinguishes reimbursable versus nonreimbursable support services. Appropriations that fund reimburs-
able agreements must comply with propriety of funds rules with respect to time, purpose and amount.
   1.1. The following instructions and directives establish the authority and procedures for establishing
   support agreements:
2                                                                             AFMCI65-601 8 MAY 1995


       1.1.1. DoDI 4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental and Interagency Support, provides policies
       and procedures for interservice support and cooperation between Department of Defense (DoD)
       components and between DoD components and other Federal agencies.
       1.1.2. AFPD 25-2 implements DoDI 4000.19 to include intraservice application and directs that
       support agreements be prepared by supplying activities to formally identify recurring support
       requirements based on specific support functions, related responsibilities, and reimbursement cost
       performed by the supplier for the receiver.
       1.1.3. AFI 25-201 implements AFPD 25-2 by providing procedures and responsibilities for pre-
       paring support agreements.
       1.1.4. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 7, contains general
       financial management policies and responsibilities that apply to support functions involving trans-
       actions between component organizations of the Air Force, component organizations of other
       departments and agencies with DoD, and component organizations of the Air Force and other
       departments and agencies of the government outside DoD.

2. Terms Explained:
    2.1. Supplier/Supplier Activity. A unit or activity that has management control of AFMC facilities or
    resources, and provides services to another unit or activity, referred to as a receiver. The term host has
    been replaced or updated with the term supplier or supplier activity throughout this instruction
    2.2. Receiver/Receiver Activity. A unit or activity that receives support services from another unit or
    activity, referred to as a supplier. Formerly known as tenant, this term is replaced with the term
    receiver or receiver activity.
    2.3. Service/Support. The act or occupation of performing work that fulfills a mission related require-
    ment or provides necessary services that benefit a receiver.
       2.3.1. Standard Support. The level of support provided to all receivers of a particular service des-
       ignated by authority as the standard expectation. Standard support is understood to be sufficiently
       flexible to permit acceptable levels of receiver satisfaction, as determined through standard quality
       measures, but not enough to permit abuse by either the supplier or receiver. Standard support
       encompasses common services provided in support of many or all programs at a center versus
       specified, peculiar, or unique services directly associated with the needs of an individual program.
       Standard support services are categorized as indirect costs or typically considered "open the door"
       costs of base or a center's operations and are essential infrastructure functions (e.g., fire protection,
       base-wide security police, personnel, comptroller, safety, legal, etc.) not directly associated to a
       program/ activity's mission requirement, but nevertheless specifically required for AFMC activi-
       ties to operate from a given location.
       2.3.2. Above Standard Support. A level of support service that exceeds the standard support ser-
       vices established by the supplier. These services are typically those services required by an activ-
       ity to achieve its specific mission objectives in a more efficient, or cost effective manner and can
       be established as directly attributed or benefiting the requester. These requirements can be either
       for a peculiar/unique type of service or for increased quantity or frequency of common services. In
       many cases, above standard support services will be acquired through a center/base supplier for
       reasons of efficiency, timeliness, economies of scale, or due to established suppliers.
AFMCI65-601 8 MAY 1995                                                                                    3


   2.4. Intracommand Receiver. Any AFMC activity that establishes a support agreement with an
   AFMC supplier activity. This could include any subelement of an AFMC direct reporting unit, such as
   a single manager, product/mission directorate, program office, laboratory or test unit.
   2.5. Intracommand Support Agreement. A DD Form 1144, Support Agreement, between two units
   of the same major command (MAJCOM) (the AFMC supplier and AFMC receiver). A support agree-
   ment is an authorized process for enhancing the level of support to a receiver when the established
   standard level of support will not meet the receiver's needs.
   2.6. Direct Costs. Expenses that can reasonably, economically, and consistently be identified
   immedi-ately and directly to a customer (user) program, project or a final cost objective and that are
   documented. "Immediately" and "directly" mean at the time the expense is incurred.
   2.7. Indirect/General and Administrative (G&A) Overhead Costs. Indirect costs are 100 percent
   attributable to the support of a mission, but above the first level of supervision. They do not produce
   the primary product or service, and are within a direct reporting cost center that cannot be identified
   specifically to a single final cost objective. G&A overhead costs are less than 100 percent attributable
   to a specific mission and support the facility as a whole and are therefore allocated to all func-tions/
   outputs. Both types of costs include institutionally-funded operating costs for an AFMC activity not
   reimbursed under the direct cost funding policy.

3. Supplier-Receiver Responsibility:
   3.1. Each AFMC center/base will establish a standard support level of service applicable/available to
   all AFMC intracommand activities they are responsible for supporting, consistent with all the follow-
   ing:
      3.1.1. The direct budget authority available to the supplier in providing baseline support and
      organic capabilities.
      3.1.2. Definitions within this instruction.
      3.1.3. AFMC Supplier-Receiver Funding Responsi-bility by Type of Service (Attachment 1),
      provided in this instruction, except as otherwise provided for in a DD Form 1144.
   3.2. Upon request of the receiver, the supplier renders support services to the receiver as prescribed in
   the supplier-receiver support agreement. All AFMC supplying activities will prepare DD Forms 1144
   (Attachment 2), that document recurring support based on specific support functions, related respon-
   sibilities and reimbursement services performed by the supplier and reimbursed by the receiver. Pro-
   cedures for completing DD Forms 1144 are contained in AFI 25-201. Categories and levels of service
   provided will be defined as either standard or above standard support by AFMC activities. A DD
   Form 1144 is not required when only standard support is provided to an intracommand receiver or
   there is no request to provide above standard support on a reimbursable basis to the receiver, unless
   specifically required by HQ USAF/LG.
   3.3. When support service is above standard, an essential element in establishing a support
   agree-ment is the recognition and acceptance by the receiver of the services received and the cost
   associated with the supplier providing the service. Completion of DD Form 1144 is required to sub-
   stantiate this agreement. A support agreement is not an authorized process for supplementing the sup-
   plier's base operating O&M type funds, or to alleviate current year shortfalls experienced by the
   supplier in providing standard level services. The supplier must resolve funding shortfalls through the
4                                                                            AFMCI65-601 8 MAY 1995


    reduction of standard level of service provided all activities, or the unfunded requirements process. If,
    however, the established standard level of support does not meet, or should fall below a receivers'
    needs, they may at their discretion request above standard support via the support agreement process.
    3.4. Changes to support agreements should be coordinated and implemented budget leadtime away to
    minimize the impact of unfunded requirements in either organization. The supplier/receiver should
    periodically review support agreements according to AFI 25-201 to evaluate standard level service
    and above standard, peculiar, or unique requirements to ensure proper assignment of responsibility
    between the supplier and receiver for budgeting and funding.

4. Budgeting and Funding Responsibilities of the Receiver and Supplier:
    4.1. The policies and procedures established in AFI 25-201 and AFI 65-601 for support agreements
    are to be followed as the basic framework for negotiating and delineating funding responsibilities,
    unless otherwise provided for in this section.
    4.2. The supplier will provide a standard level of common support without reimbursement from all
    intracommand receivers, except to AFMC receivers who are part of the Defense Business Operations
    Fund (DBOF), since they are required by DoD direction and AFI 65-601 to reimburse full cost to sup-
    pliers. However, beginning FY 96, Program Budget Decision (PBD) 419 directed Defense Commis-
    sary Agency (DeCA) to reimburse only identifiable and measurable incremental cost instead of full
    costs to suppliers. Intracommand receivers will be responsible for funding above standard, peculiar or
    unique support services. The baseline to delineate AFMC supplier versus receiver funding responsi-
    bilities of support services are shown in AFMC Supplier-Receiver Funding Responsibility by Type of
    Service (Attachment 1). Deviations from this baseline are authorized only to the extent they are doc-
    umented in a DD Form 1144 and are coordinated with the center FM to ensure fiscal law principles are
    not circumvented (e.g., funding propriety, and augmentation of appropriations).
    4.3. Areas of Special Interest:
       4.3.1. Civilian Personnel Costs. All DoD civilian personnel costs are budgeted and funded from
       the program element and appropriation in which they are authorized. Overtime, which is directly
       attributed to a receiver requirement, should be considered for reimbursement to the supplier.
       4.3.2. Real Property Maintenance Activity (RPMA). Use criteria established in Attachment 1.
       However, if maintenance and repair (M&R) work (EEIC 521/522) is not within the capability of
       the supplier, and is performed to meet what the base civil engineer and intracommand receiver
       agrees constitutes a peculiar/unique requirement of the intracommand receiver, the project cost
       could be considered for reimbursement from the intra-command receiver. Reimbursable M&R
       work must receive prior coordination by the center comptroller or his or her designee. The intrac-
       ommand receiver has the authority and responsibility to determine that:
           4.3.2.1. M&R projects are essential to the overall program's mission success or in special cir-
           cum-stances to maintain or increase personnel effective-ness or efficiency within the work
           place of the organization, to warrant use of program mission funds.
           4.3.2.2. Funds provided meet all fiscal law requirements.
           4.3.2.3. Discretion must be exercised in applying this authority so as to not abrogate the base
           civil engineer's responsibility to fund essential M&R requirements to keep the basic infrastruc-
           ture at an acceptable level to sustain mission operation or meet health, safety or environmental
AFMCI65-601 8 MAY 1995                                                                                       5


          requirements of AFMC activities.
      4.3.3. Reimbursable support costs should include costs to restore facilities or equipment to the
      original configuration when modification has been previously made by the receiver and restora-
      tion is deemed necessary.
      4.3.4. Items of technical equipment procured by receiver activity's program funds for direct sup-
      port, but no longer needed by the activity, will stay at the facility site for use by the supplier activ-
      ity or disposed of by the receiver, at the supplier's option.

5. Cost Allocation Method:
   5.1. The cost allocation method of providing support services should be based on measurable deter-
   minants (e.g., hours, computer time, personnel serviced, square footage, etc.) or a prorated share of
   contract services based on direct benefit received by each intracommand receiver. Allocation based on
   a percentage of the intracommand activity's obligation authority is not an appropriate cost allocation
   method, when it does not relate to the direct benefit received by the receiver. However, it may be used
   only if this is the most appropriate method available. Documentation must be maintained to support
   justification for using this method over others available. Also, documentation must be maintained by
   the intracommand supplier to support costs charged to intracommand receivers and provide for an
   adequate audit trail so that the accuracy of these costs can be verified.
   5.2. "Basket" Intracommand Activities. The basket program manager manages several small (nonma-
   jor) similar projects/programs that share management and technical support. He or she must determine
   the appropriate cost allocation method among the various elements of the program office to reimburse
   the supplier for above standard services for which the program receives a direct benefit. The supplier
   activity and the basket program manager must agree on the fair share allocation based on a cost allo-
   cation method consistent with the benefit received from the services for each of the elements of the
   basket program office.
