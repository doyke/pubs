18.24.2. Cargo Movement, 20 LRS/LGRDDC, will update CMOS with the shipping action.
18.25. Reject Conditions. The respective warehouse will work and reprocess all SSC rejects.
18.27.1. Document Control will be the manager of the R40, Delinquent Shipping Listing, Part
Vand VI and will suspense the Equipment Accountability Element, Flight Service Center,
Aircraft Parts Store (APS), and Surface Cargo each week. These sections will take appropriate
action, annotate the listing, obtain the respective Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)
signature on the R40 and return the signed listings to Document Control within two (2) duty
days. Document control will review the listing and complete the required transactions. The

forward the letter to Document Control.
18.27.6.5. Cargo Movement will forward a final signed copy of the R40, Part VI, to Document
Control within two (2) duty days.
18.34.11. (Added) The following procedures will be used to work the daily R59:
18.34.11.1. (Added) Documents brought to Document Control after the 1300 meeting will not
be cleared until the next duty day.
18.34.11.2. (Added) MSIs will be charged according to the MRSP or supply point detail it is
being pulled from in ES-S.
18.34.11.3. (Added) When RVP action is accomplished, annotate the front of the document

respective element processing the transaction will move the original transaction for the RVP.
Document Control will clear both the Document Control Record (DCR) images for the original
and RVP transactions with one document after verification of AMS data. If the 735 Supply
Chain Operations Group (SCOG) processes the RVP, Document Control will be responsible for
acquiring the document and clearing the associated DCR image. Paper documents should not be
used if AMS is available. EXCEPTION: For extended system problems (more than one duty
day), a paper document can be used. However, it must have a clear explanation written on the
front of the document stating why AMS was not used and must also be signed by the issuing
element chief before submitting to Document Control (this will be used to help monitor system
or user problems).
18.34.11.4. (Added) The R59 will determine if an item processed through AMS or ES-S. A
document that is processed through AMS will have function number 803 on the R59. If not, the
item processed through ES-S.
18.34.11.5. (Added) When using AMS all processes should be accomplished from start to
finish clearing a document automatically from the R59. Transactions signed for by a customer in
AMS create a 1SI image, which will clear the DCR image. EXCEPTION: A Bench Stock Issue
(BSU) will clear the DCR when the pull action is completed.
18.34.12. (Added) The following are the procedures to clear delinquent documents.

18.34.12.1. (Added) 1SI. If the transaction is in AMS, signed for by the customer, but is still
on the R59, Document Control will be responsible for researching to determine the cause of the
1SI not processing correctly, correct it (if applicable), and resend the 1SI. If it still does not clear
after the 1SI is reprocessed or cannot be fixed to clear the DCR, Document Control will
manually clear the document.
18.34.12.2. (Added) Destroyable/fileable documents will be re-scanned for signature through
AMS to clear the DCR image.
18.34.12.3. (Added) Equipment Turn-ins. Document Control will inquire AMS to verify that
the transaction was processed and check for the date it was processed to verify that the correct
document is in AMS. If it is in AMS, they will clear the document. If it is not in AMS, they will
notify the responsible element to take action by inputting the transaction in AMS.
