AFMAN23-220, 1 July 1996, is supplemented as follows: The purpose of this supplement is to
provide for proper delegation in reference to the $500 waiver on ROSs and the delegation of
approving authority down to appointing authorities. This supplement will also restrict the
assignment of appointing authority responsibilities to all Group Commanders and verifies the
appropriate approval cost limitations that may be delegated down to that level. The final
addition is the establishment of a timeline and process flow for all ROS waivers to include local
limitations and requirements for them. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/.        Additionally, if the publication generates a
report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all applicable Reports Control Numbers in
accordance with AFI 33-324. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s
chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision added paragraph 7.1.3, the Investigating Officer is required to be briefed by the
Staff Judge Advocate prior to beginning the investigation.
2.3.18. (Added) If a squadron or unit commander would like to pursue a waiver for an ROS
and the item(s) is/are below the $500 total cost limit (use depreciated or repair cost) or $100 unit
cost for hand tools, they will provide supporting documentation in the form of an MFR with
attachments to the appointing authority. The appointing authority must sign the MFR for the
waiver to process correctly—guidance on completing the MFR is in 2.3.18.1 and 2.3.18.2.
Restrictions for waiver eligibility are defined in 2.3.18.3. This documentation is critical for the
proper accountable officials to be able to correct their inventories without the processing of an
ROS. Documentation will be maintained by the ROS program manager.
2.3.18.1. (Added) The ROS waiver will contain the following information addressed to the
accountable official and ROS program manager: NSN(s) and names of the lost or damaged
items, a brief description of the circumstances involved, a determination whether or not the
responsible member will voluntarily pay back the cost for the item(s), and have a depreciation
worksheet or AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement attached.
2.3.18.2. (Added) If the member will be voluntarily reimbursing the cost of the item, the
procedures under 16.1.4 through 16.1.6 must be followed. A DD Form 1131 will be attached
with the MFR waiver along with a signed voluntary payment statement (provided by ROS
program monitor). If member decides not to voluntarily reimburse, either an ROS must be
completed for involuntary collection or the appointing authority may still sign a waiver if there is
no negligence.
2.3.18.3. (Added) Waiver Restrictions. Due to guidance laid out in AFMAN 23-110, a waiver
may not be utilized to take equipment items off of the CA/CRL. Either a ROS or a DD Form
1131 (voluntary reimbursement) must be accomplished to update the accounts. Waivers may not
be accomplished for highly pilfer able electronic equipment such as laptop computers, cellular
telephones, pagers and personal data assistants (e.g. palm pilots).
5.5. ROS Under $500 Waiver Processing Times.
5.5.1. (Added) Fifteen days from the date of discovery of the loss for the responsible official to
notify the ROS program manager on the need for a waiver and provide proper costing data (AF
Form 20 or depreciation information). ROS program manager will also return a depreciation
worksheet or confirm the reparable costing data in this time frame.
5.5.2. (Added) Ten days for the responsible official to contact the member at fault and
determine whether there will be voluntary repayment to the government. If voluntary
reimbursement will occur, provisions under 2.3.18.2 must also be completed.
5.5.3. (Added) Fifteen days for the responsible official to complete ROS waiver MFR along
with supporting documentation and forward to the appointing authority.
5.5.4. (Added) Five days for the appointing authority to review and sign the ROS MFR waiver
and forward on to the ROS program manager.
5.5.5. (Added) Five days for the ROS program manager to file waiver and provide a copy to
the proper accountable official to allow for removal from inventory.

7.1.3. (Added) The Commander appointing the Investigating Officer (IO) will direct the IO to
contact the Civil Law Section of the 35th Fighter Wing, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, for
guidance and assistance in completing their investigation and drafting their report. The IO
should schedule an appointment for a briefing concerning their duties prior to initiating their
investigation.
8.4.1. (Added) The 35 FW Commander has delegated ROS approving authority down to
Group Commanders. Group Commanders will be the final approvers on all ROSs less than
$2,000 with the exception of ROSs for flying leather jackets. Factors under 10.2.2.4 still apply.
Under this structure, the 35 FW Vice Commander will be the appointing/approving authority for
the Fighter Wing Staff Agencies up to the delegated limit. The 35 FW Commander will then be
the final approval authority on all ROSs between $2,000 and $9,999 and reports for flying
leather jackets as well as the first level appellate authority for all ROSs under $2,000. Any ROSs
between $10,000 and $25,000 will be submitted on to 5 AF for approval and any greater than
$25,000 will be submitted to HQ PACAF for final action.
8.4.4. (Added) This supplement will serve as the written delegation of authority for the ROS
program manager/appointing official to approve not processing an ROS for items under $500
($100 per unit for hand tools). All limitations described in 2.3.18 still apply and documentation
must be provided by the appointing authority to the proper responsible official and ROS program
manager.
9.2.6. (Added) Appointing authority responsibility will still be at the Group Commander level
even though the final approving authority is delegated as described in 8.4.1. Unit or Squadron
Commanders may make suggestions for financial liability officer appointments, but the Group
Commander has the authority to assign personnel from different units and squadrons within the
group and must make the official appointment.
10.2.2.4. (Added) Group Commanders may not delegate the authority to approve final action
on ROSs down to Unit or Squadron commanders, even though the approving authority is
delegated down by the Wing Commander per 8.4.1.
