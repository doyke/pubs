CHAPTER 4

SECTION A
 2                                   AFMAN23-110V2PT13CH4_45SWSUP 21 APRIL 2010


4.2.1.1. Contractors who have their own plant clearance function will report excess items
through plant clearance. Disposition of assets will be according to the instructions of the plant
clearance officer (PCO). Excess lists of serviceable and unserviceable reparable property will be
sent to Base Supply by the PCO for screening against Base Supply requirements.
Attachment 4B-1, para 4B1.3. Pick-up periods are not formally prescribed. The property will
be picked up during normal delivery trips to the activity and returned to the Receiving office. If
bins are full and a pick-up is desired, the activity may call 494-6926.

Attachment 4B-3, para 4B3.3.9. (Added) The following guidelines are provided for
contractors to ensure that all Government Furnished Property (GFP) is properly controlled and
distributed.

4B3.3.9.1. (Added) All GFP serviceable items that are identified to a National Stock Number
(NSN) will be processed through Base Supply.

4B3.3.9.2. (Added) Base Supply Pick-up and Delivery office will only pick up material during
their normal delivery route/runs or when called by customers. Contractors may use this
procedure when authorized in their contract. Down range stations will process all DRMO items
to a R920 detail pending the scheduled visit by DRMO. The A5J will be processed prior to the
visit to preclude creating documents, which would become delinquent. Ships are authorized to
process DRMO materials to the nearest DRMO facility.

4B3.3.9.2. (Added) All GFP unserviceable/unidentifiable items turned in by a contractor will be
processed through their plant clearance function as outlined in their contract.

4B3.3.10. (Added) Ensure all self-propelled ground vehicles, powered ground equipment,
internal combustion engines or motors, fuel devices, fuel assemblies, and fuel cells or tanks are
prepared for storage and shipment in accordance with applicable technical directives. They must
be completely drained, purged and sealed with appropriate pressure seal type metal plugs and
caps with gasket and "O" rings. Include any written certification as necessary.

4B3.3.11. (Added) All equipment that contains Freon, i.e. air conditioners, refrigerators, ice
machines, etc, must have the Freon purged prior to turn in to Base Supply. In addition, the
activity will attach a placard to the equipment identifying the shop that purged the Freon, the
phone number of the shop, and the date purged. To comply with federal environmental
regulations, this equipment can only be purged by an authorized shop.

Attachment 4B-4, para 4B3.2.1.7. Base Supply will issue organizations their own block of
unique serial numbers. See Table 4-1 for a list of the blocks of serial numbers that have been
issued to customers. Contractors will use the processes stated in their contract or as directed by
their Government Property Administrator. Contractor excess property should be processed
through Base Supply.
