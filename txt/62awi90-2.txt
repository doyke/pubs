    2.1. Well-developed checklists and continuing self-inspection programs are valuable management
    tools, which serve to maintain an internal quality control check on the unit’s effectiveness. The 62 AW
    Self-Inspection Program (WSIP) has four main goals, which all working levels should meet:
       2.1.1. Provide early detection of deviations from established procedures.
       2.1.2. Determine adequacy and effectiveness of internal control.
       2.1.3. Identify weaknesses and problems for management action.
       2.1.4. Employ a process to track corrective actions.

3. Terms Explained.
    3.1. Checklist. A self-inspection guide used as a management tool. It is developed from applicable
    sources. Use UCI, SII, and By Law Compliance Area checklists available on the AMC/IG website and
    from HQ AMC Functional Managers. If none of the mentioned checklists are applicable, develop
    your own using AFI requirements that govern the area (see paragraph 5.7.1.1.). Unit self-inspection
    monitors should use the guide to ensure the work center is performing to standards.
    3.2. Self-Inspection Program Management Levels.
       3.2.1. The 62 AW/CV is the highest management level in the self-inspection program. The Chief,
       Wing Plans and Programs (62 AW/XP), is the overall manager of the WSIP. Individual units will
       provide an updated briefing to the wing commander when directed.
       3.2.2. The 62 AW Group Commanders comprise an intermediate program management level. The
       principle function of this level is to monitor subordinate unit self-inspection programs (USIP) and
       elevate major unit discrepancies to 62 AW/XP and wing staff/HHQ.
       3.2.3. Work center level is the lowest level of management requiring checklists (i.e., section,
       branch, etc., as determined by the unit commander).

4. Schedule of Inspections.
    4.1. Self-Inspections (SI) will be conducted semi-annually (Mar and Sep) and within 6 months of
    assignment of a new wing commander.
    4.2. Units that receive HHQ inspections (UCI, LSEP, ASEV, etc.) within 60 days of a scheduled SI
    may use those results for their SI.
    4.3. Self-Inspections will include AMC and Air Force Special Interest Items (SII) that are still in
    effect when the SI is conducted (list of SIIs are located at AMC/IG website).

5. Responsibilities.
    5.1. Vice Commander will:
       5.1.1. Appoint 62 AW/XP as the Wing Inspection Review Manager (IRM).
