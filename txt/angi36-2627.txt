SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Rater and Ratee
roles defined as well as a clarification of feedback process.
1. INTRODUCTION.
   1.1. Feedback. Feedback is a form of communication that should explain duty performance
   requirements and responsibilities, establish expectations, and tell the ratee if they are
   performing as expected. Feedback is essential in the growth of our subordinates, no matter
   what their rank. Formal feedback does not take the place of informal daily conversation on
   how an individual is performing. In addition to the evaluation provided on the Performance
 2                                                               ANGI36-2627 24 MARCH 2011


     Feedback Form, two-way feedback of the following should be discussed during the face to
     face meeting of the rater and ratee:
        1.1.1. Performance.
            1.1.1.1. Evaluation of training provided.
        1.1.2. Expectations.
            1.1.2.1. Short and long term Professional Military Education goals.
            1.1.2.2. Short and long term military goals.
        1.1.3. Career development.
            1.1.3.1. AFSC progression plan.
            1.1.3.2. Promotion opportunities.
     1.2. Career Development. Career development is of primary importance. Without
     developing a plan to assist the ratee, meeting the expectations will be difficult, or may not be
     completed in a timely manner.
2. PROCEDURE: ANG personnel will use latest edition of AF Form 931, Performance
Feedback Worksheet (AB thru TSgt), and AF Form 932, Performance Feedback Worksheet
(MSgt thru CMSgt), as the documentation media.
     2.1. Formal Feedback. Formal Feedback will be completed on an annual basis as a
     minimum. The rater will determine the schedule. For instance, the schedule could be birth
     month or expiration term of service (ETS) month. The rater or ratee can request more
     frequent feedback sessions to address areas of concern. Rater should be lowest level of
     military supervision; example: Staff Sergeant rating Senior Airmen continuing up the chain
     of command. Each rater should rate the immediate level below them. Every effort should be
     made to complete the scheduled session in a timely manner that does not conflict with
     deployed personnel.
     2.2. Self Evaluation. The appropriate worksheet will be given to the ratee on the Unit
     Training Assembly (UTA) prior to their scheduled formal feedback session. The ratee
     should be tasked to evaluate themselves and return the completed form on the next UTA.
     Evaluation check boxes should not be filled in by the ratee; instead ratee should write in the
     space provided for self evaluation below the check boxes. At the formal feedback session the
     rater will use the check boxes and the back page to provide his/her evaluation after a
     discussion with the ratee.
     2.3. Maintenance for Performance Feedback Worksheet. The rater will maintain the
     worksheet in a personnel file; a copy will be given to the ratee. The worksheet will be
     maintained until the next Performance Feedback session is held then it will replace the old
     sheet; which will be given to the ratee or destroyed.
     2.4. Use of Performance Feedback Worksheet by Chain of Command. Performance
     Feedback forms can be used by the ratee’s chain of command to make decisions affecting
     their AFSC upgrading or military promotions.
3. EFFECTIVE FEEDBACK SESSIONS. Additional information for preparing, conducting
and closing of a Formal Feedback Session can be found in AFPAM 36-2627.
