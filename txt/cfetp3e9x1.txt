                CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

PART I

Preface

1. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document identifying life-cycle
education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements
for an Air Force specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success
and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training and serves as the “Contract for Training”
between Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and a career field.

NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II as a guide to support duty
position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control training within
their specialty using both parts of the plan.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career-field
progression information, duties and responsibilities, training decisions, and career field path;
Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
experience, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints; and Section E
identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard
(STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, AETC conducted
training, wartime course and core task, and correspondence course requirements. Section B
contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if
Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C identifies available support materials. An
example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) which may be developed to support
proficiency training). Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to
determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and
optional courses, as well as exportable courseware. Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique
training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the
associated qualification needs. Section F identifies home station training references and
course material required for this specialty in support of contingency and wartime training.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable
us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.




                                                4
Section A – General Information

4.    Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air
Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Area Managers (FAM),
commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers, to plan, develop, manage, and
conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. This plan outlines the
training individuals require in this Air Force Specialty (AFS) in order to develop and
progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification,
advanced, and proficiency training and serves as the contract between Air Education and
Training Command (AETC) and a Functional Community. Initial skills training is the AFS
specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into
this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at
one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses,
task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for
award of the 3, 5, 7, and 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task
performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training
program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide
the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal
specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either
in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to
personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.
The CFETP has several purposes some of which are:

4.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career-field
training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate
point in an individual’s career.

4.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty
and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

4.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and
training delivery methods.

4.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired
career field training process.

5.    Uses of the CFETP. The plan will be used by MAJCOM FAMs and supervisors at all
levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each
individual in the specialty.

5.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and
exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II
of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM, Air Force Civil Engineer Support
Agency Training Division (HQ AFCESA/CEOF) to develop acquisition strategies for
obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.




                                               5
5.2. MAJCOM FAMs ensure all training programs at the MAJCOM level complement the
CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training,
contract training, CerTest, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.
MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the
plan.

5.3. Unit Training Managers (UTM) and supervisors must ensure each individual completes
the mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental requirements) for
the upgrade training specified in the training plan.

5.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this
plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

6.   Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the final approval
authority for any official change(s) made to the CFETP. Also, the AFCFM will initiate an
annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives
and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.
Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

9. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Emergency Management
career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training
requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training
and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The following chart depicts the building
block approach.

9.1. Initial Skills Training.
The 3-level apprentice course                                              9-Level

information was added.

9.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. The 7-level craftsman course
requirements were reviewed. It was determined that an in-residence course was still a
necessity.

9.4. Proficiency Training. A common issue demonstrated during Operation DESERT
STORM and most recently with Operation IRAQI FREEDOM was the lack of consistent
proficiency throughout the 3E9 rank structure. Therefore, Emergency Management Career
Field Manager has established a minimum standard set of reoccurring proficiency tasks at
three different levels, on which Emergency management personnel must be proficient in
order to meet deployment challenges. These levels use a building block approach. This
requires that personnel must be proficient at the lower levels before they can advance to the
higher levels. A number of the tasks identified as proficiency requirements have been
identified as Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reportable requirements.

9.4.1. MAJCOMS and/or flight management has the flexibility to determine who is best
suited as the certifier. Individual(s) identified by the commander as on-the-job training
(OJT) certifiers also may serve as certifiers for the Emergency Management Proficiency
Program. Another option is to utilize the Emergency management individual(s) who the
commander has appointed as Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) representatives for evaluation
purposes.

9.4.2. Emergency management personnel have a number of avenues/opportunities to
complete the proficiency requirements. Requirements can be made part of the in-house
training program, be evaluated as part of an EET exercise, part of the CE Prime BEEF Day
(where it occurs), or part of the annual CE bivouac requirement. At the lower level
certification is tied heavily to task performance while at the EM Manager level certification
is relies more on knowledge, analysis, application, and proficiency.

9.4.3. This graphic represents the proficiency building block approach. Regardless if you
are active duty, Guard or Reserve, the levels represent the standard you should strive to
achieve. Ranks displayed in the chart demonstrate what is expected through a normal career
path. That does not mean that a Master Sergeant cannot be certified at the Readiness and
Emergency Management Flight Task & CBRN Reconnaissance Team Operations level. This
is especially true of personnel who retrain into Emergency Management. Regardless of the
trainee’s rank, emphasis should be placed on meeting proficiency that is commensurate to
their rank. Conversely, a sharp Senior Airman should be allowed to advance to the EM
Operations Planning & Directing level.

9.4.4. The Emergency Management Proficiency Program serves as both a career field wide
set of standards and provides the force with a career path to demonstrate where they should
be in regards to their duties. The program also serves as incentive for those who want to
advance personally and professionally and should be considered for inclusion into
performance reports, awards programs, and for promotion considerations. It also provides an
avenue to de-certify an individual if they cannot meet the standards. Failure or refusal to
progress and maintain individual proficiency commensurate with rank may also be grounds
for reduction in grade.

9.4.5. There are three AF Form 1098s tabs as part of AFTR that are designed to be utilized
in identifying required Emergency Management Proficiency Program tasks:

 AF Form 1098:        Established by:        Mandatory for:                Remarks:
      Tab-1        Career Field Manager    all 3E9X1 personnel      Sets tasks at minimum

      Tab-2        MAJCOM Functional       3E9X1 personnel          Sets additional tasks above
                   Area Manger             assigned to respective   minimum standard

                                           unit                     standards

9.4.6. Items identified with an asterisk are deemed critical tasks. If a member fails to
demonstrate proficiency in any critical area, he/she cannot be considered proficient at that
level. Other tasks are important enough that they are required to be part of the program; but
if an individual were unable to demonstrate proficiency in one of these areas, this does not
automatically prevent him/her from being considered proficient at that level. It will be the
judgment of the certifying official to determine if the individual were to fail more than one
non-critical item as to whether that individual can still perform the duties required to meet
the intent of the proficiency program.

10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon
award of primary AFSC. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of Applied
Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:

10.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. The instructor must be a full-time instructor
teaching a CCAF course at an affiliated school at the time of nomination. Additionally,
instructors should: Hold an associate or higher degree from an accredited institution.
Complete a Teaching Internship of 12 semester hours. Complete an Instructor Methodology
course of at least three semester hours. Have two years teaching experience as a CCAF
instructor from the date assigned instructor duties. Hold the journeyman (5-skill level) or
higher (or fully qualified equivalent) in an AFS and be recommended for certification by the
affiliate school commander, commandant, or Professional Military Education (PME) flight
chief.

10.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a
competency based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency
levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager).
All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

      12.1. Enlisted Career Path. The Air Force Certified Emergency Manager Program
      (AFCEMP) is comparable to the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM)
      “Certified Emergency Manager.” This three-step building block program is internationally
      recognized and provides increased credibility, professional identity, career recognition, and
      enhanced career planning. The AFCEMP will help advance the Emergency Management
      profession through the development of partnerships and networks with other professional
      emergency responders. For specific AFCEMP requirements refer to the Readiness and
      Emergency Management Flight Community of Practice.

12.2. CE Occupational Badge. The Civil Engineer occupational badge reflects a great
history and tradition. By wearing it, you will be recognized by your fellow Airmen as
having achieved an expected level of competence. The multitude of engineers before you
established this expectation through excellent service in both peace and war. Eligibility
criteria for award and wear of AF occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2923,
Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational Badges.

                                      CE Badge Heraldry
 The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to represent the engineering
 profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents the essence of
 engineering: applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To Air Force
 engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that meshes
 with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to
 perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in
 designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together
 symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force Civil Engineer. Finally, the wings
 help to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components;
 and that the built environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people.




12.3. Emergency Management Career Field History. The history of the Air Force’s
Emergency Management program can be traced back through the people and the events
that created the morphing effect resulting in the program as it exists today. When we
discuss AF Emergency Management there are two aspects that are both separate and
integrated simultaneously 1) the Emergency Management career field (the people) and 2)
the Emergency Management program itself (the policies, equipment, and training
aspects) that affect the entire Air Force. However, AF EM can be linked early on to the
Army’ Chemical Warfare Service in WW1 to counter the use of chemicals in the trenches
of France. Congress made the CWS a permanent branch of the Army in 1920. Prior to


                                                   19
WWII the CWS became the Army’s Chemical Corp. At the end of World War II, the US
Army’s Bomber Command was redesignated as the U.S. Army Strategic Air Command
(SAC) and the Army’s Chemical Corp units were assigned within SAC. Then in 1947,
when the US Air Force became its own Service, the Air Force adopted
chemical/biological units throughout the Air Force. Radiological was added later to
ensure programs were established to protect against radiological effects.
        The evolution from a managed program to an actual career field occurred when
the Passive Defense career field was established in the 1950s assuming the ABC
program. Each installation normally had one company grade officers and two or three
Junior NCOs to ensure the base populace was prepared for nuclear attacks and forces
were trained in chemical warfare defense. Within a few years, the program was renamed
to the Disaster Control career field and picked up more responsibilities in the areas of
natural disasters and major accident planning and response. In the 1960’s the career field
was again renamed, this time to Disaster Preparedness until the early 1990’s when it was
aligned under Civil Engineering and the enlisted AFSC was designated as 3E9X1,
Readiness. The officer career field was dissolved and duties picked up by Civil Engineer
Readiness Officers. The duties and responsibilities have changed and evolved somewhat;
however, the most basic responsibility has remained focused on consolidating a single
program, whether at the installation level, MAJCOM, or Air Staff, to prepare, plan, train,
and equip personnel to respond to, maintain mission capability, and recover from
contingencies worldwide.
        Although the career field remained as Readiness, in 2003, the Disaster
Preparedness Program was changed to Full Spectrum Threat Response program or FSTR.
FSTR was defined as the single, integrated Air Force program to coordinate and organize
efforts to manage, prepare for, respond to and recover from the direct and indirect
consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions of the Air Force FSTR
Program are to 1) save lives, 2) minimize the loss or degradation of resources and 3)
continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational capability in an “all
hazards” physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the FSTR Program are to support homeland security operations and to
provide support to civil and host-nation authorities in accordance with DoD directives
and through the appropriate Combatant Command.
       On 19 Apr 2007, Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-02 was signed by the
CSAF implementing a number of Air Force Smart Operations (AFSO) 21 initiatives. In
addition to the many changes directed by the PAD, the Civil Engineer Readiness Flight
was redesignated as the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. This action was
followed with a change to AFSC 3E9X1 from “Readiness” to “Emergency
Management”.

12.4. Readiness Occupational Badge. The Readiness Occupational Badge reflects the
achievements and laurels gained by our professionalism in Emergency Management,
including CBRN defense, in peace and war. The threat of terrorist use of CBRN material
has continued to increase throughout the world. In critical, life-threatening situations,
any delay in conducting an efficient response could result in major loss of life or mass
casualties. As readiness professionals, we work closely with other DoD, civil, and
international CBRN specialists who recognize this insignia as a universal identifier.
During Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM, the US Air Force
recognized the need for a means to identify the Emergency Management career field’s
unique capability and lobbied for adoption of the insignia. The Chief of Staff, Air Force
approved the Readiness Occupational Badge on 7 February 2006. Wearing the badge in
conjunction with the CE Occupational Badge shows our ties to CE and provides
recognition for possessing distinctive, highly technical, and specialized CBRN defense
capabilities.

12.4.1. Readiness Occupational Badge Heraldry. The Readiness Occupational Badge
was officially introduced by the CSAF in Feb 06 with an official wear date of 1 Oct 06.
Although the name of the AFS was changed from CE Readiness to Emergency
Management in late 2007, the badge retains the designation of Readiness Occupational
Badge. The badge uses the Air Force wreaths combined with basic insignia first adopted
by the U.S. Army Chemical Service in 1917: two crossed retorts -- glass laboratory
vessels used for hundreds of years -- placed behind a benzene ring, the molecular
building block of many organic chemicals. The benzene ring signifies the molecular
composition of the chemical benzene. It has six points for each atom of carbon and
hydrogen, representing the basic elements of chemistry. These elements of design allude
to our chemical-related functions and our deeply rooted history in the U.S. Army Air
Corps to today’s modern Air Force, The new badge has been in the works for four years
and will help other services identify the readiness Airmen as CBRN defense experts.
There are three levels of the badge -- basic, senior and master -- that represent increasing
levels of time and expertise in the career field. Throughout history, there has been no
way to identify United States Air Force CBRN defense technicians in a joint, combined
or civil environment. The new Readiness Occupational Badge is similar to the badge
used by the Army: It contains a retort, an emblem used by the U.S. government since
World War I to symbolize chemical readiness. Wearing the chemical retort immediately
identifies Emergency Management personnel as CBRN specialists and bridges the gap
between joint, combined and civil operations, to facilitate operational effectiveness in an
increasingly interoperable environment.



                                            21
12.4.2. Readiness Occupational Badge Wear Criteria:

12.4.2.1. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of the
USAF Emergency Management Apprentice and CBRN Responder Courses at Ft Leonard
Wood MO.

12.4.2.2. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star above the basic badge. It is
awarded after the member successfully completes all 7-level requirements.

12.4.2.3. Master Badge. The master badge adds a wreath and a star above the basic
badge. It is awarded to master sergeants or above with 5 years in the specialty from
award of the 7-skill level.

                                         PART II

Section A – Specialty Training Standard

17. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC
for the 3-level course with the class beginning 5 October 2009 and graduating 23 January
2010 and the 7-level course with the class beginning 12 April 2010 and graduating 23
April 2010.

18. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Air Force Training Program,
Career Field Education and Training, this STS:

18.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most
common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to
perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level.

18.2. Lists in Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training
requirements) by an asterisk (*). As a minimum, trainees must complete all core and
critical tasks for skill level upgrade.

18.2.1. Tasks identified by a diamond () are considered contingency/war tasks for
both the 5- and 7-skill level and are extremely important to the career field. Equipment
shortfalls at most locations however, have created problems with the actual hands-on
certification of these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not available for
instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP and passing the corresponding CerTest (if
developed) is all that is required for upgrade and qualification training.

18.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks
and knowledge training requirements. If available, use automated training management
systems to document technician qualifications. Task certification of core and critical
tasks require a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier.
All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer
only.

18.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4
shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training
on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by formal courses, CDCs,
ADLS, and AFQTPs.

18.5. Identifies qualitative requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency
code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by ADLS,
resident training, and career development courses.

18.6. Is used to document task when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training
Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program, On
The Job Training Administration.



                                             33
18.7. Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed
in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. For
OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for
accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be
used to identify Air Force standardized procedures. When used as a JQS, the following
documentation applies:

18.7.1.   Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

18.7.1.1. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph
number or letter next to the task statement. Additionally, all core and diamond ()
identified tasks should be circled. Document task completion by annotating columns
3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D, as appropriate. Note: All entries shall be made in pencil.

18.7.1.2. Enter the start date of the AFQTP on the AFQTP documentation record. Once
completed enter the completion date. When hands-on training is started and/or
completed annotate the STS accordingly.

18.7.1.3. Transcribing from old document to CFETP. Use the new STS to identify
and certify all current and past task qualifications.

18.7.1.4. For tasks previously certified and still required in the current duty
position:

18.7.1.4.1. For core and critical tasks, the trainer and certifier evaluates airman’s
current qualifications and validates airman’s ability to complete the task. The certifier
and trainee then enter their initials and new certified date.

18.7.1.4.2. For non-core duty position tasks, the trainer evaluates the airman’s current
qualifications and validates the airman’s ability to complete the task. The current date is
entered in column 3B and the trainee and trainer enter their initials in columns 3C and
3D, respectively.

18.7.1.4.3. Annotate the AF Form 623a, (for example, "I certify the information
contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the
trainee was given the superseded CFETP." Supervisor and trainee sign and date the
statement).

18.7.1.5. To transcribe previous certifications for tasks not required in the current
duty position, carry forward only the previous completion dates (not the initials of
another person). If and when these tasks become a duty position requirement, recertify
with current date and trainee, trainer and certifier initials.

18.7.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the
supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career
knowledge IAW 36-2201 Vol 3 and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all
mandatory items specified in, Enlisted Classification Directory. For two-time CDC exam


                                            34
failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201 Vol 3.
NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.

18.7.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be
unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall erase previous certification and enter airman
into qualification training. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, On-
The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification. The
individual is recertified using the normal certification process.

18.8. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted
Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed
at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive
practical experience in their career field. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject
matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for
promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the
WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1of AFI 36-2605, Air Force
Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or
Air Reserve Forces.

19. Recommendations. AETC welcomes comments and recommendations concerning
the quality of training AETC graduates receive. Reference specific STS paragraphs and
address correspondence regarding changes to 782 TRG/TGAV, 620 9th Avenue, Suite 3,
Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2268. For supervisors' convenience a Customer Service
Information Line (CSIL) has been installed to expedite feedback on graduates who may
have received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in this training
standard. For a quick response to problems, call our CSIL at DSN 736-2574 or email

                      D      Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject. (Evaluation)
 Explanations
 * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
 specific task. (Example: “b” and “1b”)

 ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task,
 or for a subject common to several tasks.

 - This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

 /X This mark is used in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to resource constraints (Example “3c/X”).
 / Lower code (3c/2b) indicates that a task is being trained to a level that is lower than required.
 The triangle symbol indicates that a QTP is available for the given task.

Note 1: Task Knowledge gained at Basic Military Training will not be repeated during resident technical training.

Note 2: Underlined training references are commercial publications or other publications essential for enlisted specialty training and mission
accomplishment.

Note 3: Items located in column 4 of the STS that list a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) standard as a technical reference, the supporting
knowledge/tasks, and their associated behaviors are found in the referenced NFPA standard. These items will not include a proficiency code, but
will be trained in the resident J9ABA3E931 00RA Emergency Management Apprentice 4K-F24/494-F29 follow on ITRO Consolidated CBRN
Responder Course taught at the Army Chemical School, Fort Leonard Wood, MO, to a level that meets minimum requirements as defined by HQ
AFCESA/CEXR. Note 3 is referenced as N3 in the STS.

Note 4: Items located in column 4 of the STS referenced as N4 are required for 5 skill level and are accessed through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) Independent Study Program website.

Note 5: Items located in column 4 of the STS referenced as N5 are required for 7 skill level and are accessed through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) Independent Study Program website.

Note 6: Trainers are responsible for annotating references to identify current sources pending STS revision.

Note 7: AFQTPs are provided through multiple delivery systems (paper-based, computer-based, web-based, and/or video). Completion is required
for upgrade or qualification. Access the Air Force Portal [My Workspace; Emergency Management] for the most current AFQTPs.

Note 8: Annotate AFQTP completion on the AFQTP Documentation Record (attachment 2 of Part II of the CFETP) and maintain the completed
documentation form in the trainee's records.

Section B – Course Objective List (COL)

                      (This section used when developing lesson plans)


20. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

20.1. Written Test (W) - used to sample each knowledge objective and the knowledge
components of performance objectives.

20.2. Performance Test (P) - used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to
measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning
activity has been completed.

20.3. Progress Checks (PC) - administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory
instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or performance
objectives.

21. Standard. Standards for written and performance measurement are indicated in the
objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is
provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or
parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

22. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts
of the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for
doing the task.

23. COL. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by block of instruction.


23.1. Initial Skills Course. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be
obtained by written request to 366 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-

Section C – Support Materials

24. Purpose. The following list of support materials is not all-inclusive; however, it covers
the most frequently referenced areas.

24.1. Certification Testing (CerTest)

24.1.1. CerTest is a program that uses computer-based evaluation to ensure skilled
craftsmen are available to meet the Air Force's changing needs. It enhances upgrade and
qualification training by testing and evaluating an individual's knowledge of the principles
and procedures in each specialty.

24.1.1.1. The program contains tests used to evaluate task knowledge received through
different media such as paper products (text), videotapes, and computer–based programs.

24.1.1.2. CerTest is also a powerful training management tool. It can be used to find the
strengths and weaknesses in an individual's training and experience. CerTest automatically
records and updates all test results. The training manager can copy records to a disk so that
an individual can bring current, accurate training information to a new unit; thereby helping
the gaining supervisor evaluate the trainee's knowledge and experience.

24.1.2. CerTest enables unit personnel to develop site-specific tests. These custom made
tests standardize testing on tasks unique to a specific duty station and/or assignment. The
program contains a graphics library that may be used along with a menu driven test editor to
develop these site-specific tests.

24.1.3. CerTest also contains optional CDC pre-evaluation tools. Volume review exercises
are available for progress checks after each volume is completed. After all volumes are
completed in a set, the trainee may take the course review exercise before taking the final end
of course exam at the base training office. Commanders are encouraged to integrate these
tools in their unit’s OJT program.

24.1.4. CerTest has been adopted as the Air Force platform for future electronic CDC
testing. The Air Force Institute for Distributive Learning (A46) began using CerTest on 1
June 2000. Currently, all CE AFSs are allowed to use A4L’s CerTest on installations where
Base Test Control Facilities (TCFs) are equipped. See your UETM for further information.

24.1.5. CerTests for Emergency Management. For guidance and a complete list of up-
to-date CerTests applicable to the 3E9X1 AFS, contact your UTM.

Section E – MAJCOM Unique Requirements

26. There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements. This area is reserved.




                                          66
Section F – Home Station Training (HST)

27. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and
training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces
will train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training
ranges from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom (Category [CAT] I), to task-
oriented hands-on (CAT II) training conducted in the field. These training requirements,
frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force
(BEEF) Program.

27.1. HST Definition. HST is training that is conducted at the individual’s home station for
contingency operations. The CE commander ensures training is provided and documented
and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. HST requirements
fall into two categories, CAT I and CAT II.

27.1.1. CAT I Training. Personnel assigned to base level CE units will receive initial and
refresher training in all CAT I (knowledge-based) topics identified in AFI 10-210. Units will
use Demonstration Performance Packages, Qualification Training Packages (QTPs), web-
based training products, other multimedia training packages, and AF CE standardized lesson
plans to present the material. MAJCOMs may develop and require other training materials to
accomplish knowledge-based training.

27.1.2. CAT-II Training. CAT II training is primarily hands-on training as outlined in
AFI 10-210. Units must make every effort to incorporate realism into their respective CAT
II training programs. Field gear (to include primary weapons) will be used during training
requirements such as, personal/work party security, convoy operations, defensive fighting
positions, etc.

27.1.2.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an integral part
of any CAT II HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM
have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although
the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel
to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance CAT II training will
help elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in
low to medium risk combat environments.

27.1.2.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or contingency
environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment
that civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost and
complexity, mission essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly
found at Continental United States (CONUS) installations. Personnel must be hands-on
certified and the certification documented in their CFEPT. AFI 10-210 identifies minimum
personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and locations of training sites.
Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force
contingency operations.




                                             67
27.1.3. CAT III Training. CAT III is primarily a team training venue. Silver Flag
Exercise Site training is CAT III training. Silver Flag Exercise Sites are located at Tyndall
AFB FL; Ramstein AB Germany; and Kadena AB Japan. They conduct CAT III training
with their major focus on students being able to perform critical contingency task in a team
environment. The training focuses on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using
hands-on training with basic expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) equipment in a realistic
beddown environment. Where possible, combat skills training has been added to the
curriculum to ensure realism and help fortify combat skills mentality amongst teams. All CE
personnel who fill Unit Type Code (UTC) positions will receive team training at Silver Flag
Exercise Sites with the exception of members on headquarters staff augmentation UTCs,
pavement evaluation UTCs, and generator repair and maintenance UTCs.

27.2. HST Training References.

27.2.1. AFI 10-210. AFI 10-210 identifies the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements.
You can review this document by going to the Air Force publications web site.

27.2.2. AFPAM 10-219 Series. These publications assist in home station training and
contingency responses.

27.2.3. AFH 10-222 Series. These publications provide expeditionary engineer craftsmen
“how to” operating and maintenance procedures.

27.2.4. AETC Courses. AETC conducts formal contingency training courses on subjects
such as bare base equipment, air base combat engineering, and readiness and emergency
management.         For course descriptions, refer to the ETCA website:
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.

27.2.5. Web-based Products. Web-based products are available on the CE Virtual
Learning Center (VLC) website at: https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp.
Personnel completing these courses can receive credit for CAT I training. CBT products can
be used in a classroom setting to train as many personnel as possible. Attendance must be
documented on a sign-in roster. The sign-in roster must be maintained IAW AFI 10-210.

27.2.6. HQ AFCESA/CEX. Maintains a comprehensive listing of training products that
support the contingency training program.

27.2.7. Ancillary Training. AFI 36-2201, Volume 1, Training, Development, Delivery,
and Evaluation, describes ancillary training as guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment. For a full list of mandatory ancillary training requirements go to
the ETCA website (see paragraph 26.2.4).

27.2.8. Deployment Support Training. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution,
describes deployment support training requirements. Deployment support training is
mandatory training that will aid a unit in preparing to deploy/redeploy.
