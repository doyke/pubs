1. General: The intent of the Contractor Verification System (CVS) is to create a secure, on-
line, streamlined application process for requesting and approving the issuance of Common
Access Cards (CAC) to contractor personnel while simultaneously eliminating undue
government paperwork and complying with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)
12. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) manages and provides oversight for the CVS.
     1.1. HSPD 12, signed by the President on August 27, 2004, established the requirements for
     a common identification standard for identification credentials issued by Federal departments
     and agencies to Federal employees and contractors (including contractor employees) for
     gaining physical access to federally controlled facilities and logical access to federally
     controlled information systems. The CVS supports HSPD-12’s requirements by facilitating
     issuance of a CAC for logical access to federally controlled information systems.
     1.2. Additionally, HSPD-12 established control objectives for secure and reliable
     identification of Federal employees and contractors. The CVS meets these control objectives
     through the following procedures.
        1.2.1. Common Access Cards (CAC) are issued:
              1.2.1.1. To individuals whose true identity has been verified.
HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                       3


           1.2.1.2. After proper authority has authorized issuance of the credential.
       1.2.2. Only an individual with a background investigation on record is issued a
       credential.
       1.2.3. An individual is issued a credential only after presenting two identity source
       documents, at least one of which is a valid Federal or State government issued picture
       identification (ID).
       1.2.4. Fraudulent identity source documents are not accepted as genuine and unaltered.
       1.2.5. A person suspected or known to the government as being a terrorist is not issued a
       credential.
       1.2.6. No substitution occurs in the identity proofing process. More specifically, the
       individual who appears for identity proofing, and whose fingerprints are checked against
       databases, is the person to whom the credential is issued.
       1.2.7. No credential is issued unless requested by proper authority. See Paragraph 7 of
       this instruction.
       1.2.8. A credential remains serviceable only up to its expiration date. More precisely, a
       revocation process exists such that expired or invalidated credentials are swiftly revoked.
       1.2.9. A single corrupt official in the process may not issue a credential with an incorrect
       identity or to a person not entitled to the credential. This means there will be more than
       one government official/agency involved in the issue process so that one individual
       cannot request, process, clear, approve and issue an identification credential.
       1.2.10. An issued credential is not modified, duplicated, or forged.
   1.3. The procedures, requirements and processes in this instruction are designed to ensure
   the above mentioned federally mandated control objectives are met consistently. All persons
   appointed to positions responsible for meeting these control objectives must comply with this
   instruction or military or civilian punitive actions shall be taken, as appropriate.
   1.4. It is not the intent of this instruction to duplicate the efforts of other trusted agencies that
   are following the approved DoD process for vetting an employee. For example, contractors
   who employ Facility Security Officers (FSO) with appropriate clearances and access to the
   Joint Personnel Access System (JPAS) are assumed to have identity proofed employees prior
   to creating records for them in JPAS.
2. Commanders/Directors Responsibilities.
   2.1. Appoint Trusted Agents (TA) for his/her unit utilizing a DD Form 2875, System
   Authorization Access Request (SAAR). Affected commanders and directors must appoint
   sufficient TAs to prevent any single TA from having to manage more than 100 active
   applicants/cardholders. NOTE: DMDC requires that TAs not manage more than 100 active
   applicants/cardholders per TA. However, exceptions can be applied for to the Service Point
   of Contact (SPOC) through the Installation Point of Contact (IPOC).
   2.2. Reverify TA appointment status/eligibility every 2-years with a newly executed DD
   Form 2875.
 4                                                        HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


     2.3. Forward a memorandum or e-mail to the Trusted Agent Security Manager (TASM)
     revoking a TA’s appointment anytime the TA:
        2.3.1. Is under investigation (or has been convicted) for any offense punishable by the
        Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or equivalent civilian law.
        2.3.2. Has been relieved of duty.
        2.3.3. Has left the military or civil service or has otherwise become disassociated with
        the USAF.
        2.3.4. Has transferred out of the organization.
3. Service Point of Contact (SPOC) Responsibilities.
     3.1. The SPOC for Hill AFB is the AF CVS Program Manager, Headquarters, Air Force

      training is not already addressed on the CVS website.
      4.2.5. Coordinate the TASM’s appointment with CVS program managers. Use the

 6                                                    HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


            5.2.6.1. The DMDC requires that TAs not manage more than 100 active
            applicants/cardholders per TA. Waivers to this limit must be requested through the
            IPOC to the SPOC.
            5.2.6.2. The DMDC recommends that TASMs control no more than 200 TAs per
            site.
        5.2.7. Provide TAs with all the required information in order to have his/her account
        activated by the DMDC Support Center.
        5.2.8. Transfer applicants/cardholders between TAs within the TASM’s assigned site
        (Hill AFB), when appropriate. Appropriate reasons for transfer include:
            5.2.8.1. Oversight of a specific contract permanently transfers outside of the TA’s
            purview. In this case the TASM should wait to receive acknowledgement from the
            original TA prior to making the change. Regardless, the CVS will generate an
            automatic notice to ensure the gaining, original, and applicants/cardholders are aware
            of the change.
            5.2.8.2. One TA is willing to temporarily cover for another TA who is not available
            (sick, temporary duty (TDY), leave, etc.). The key concern in this situation is
            whether the gaining TA is willing to accept responsibility. The TAs need not
            necessarily belong to the same organization. But if not, the applicants/cardholders
            should be transferred back to the appropriate TA upon their return. The CVS will
            generate an automatic notice to ensure the gaining TA, original TA, and
            applicants/cardholders are aware of the change.
            5.2.8.3. A TA no longer works in a TA capacity.
            5.2.8.4. A TA has an unmanageable number of applicants/cardholders. The DMDC
            requires that TAs not manage more than 100 active applicants/cardholders. See
            paragraph 5.2.6.1 of this instruction for waiver process.
            5.2.8.5. The TASM will contact the SPOC                   to   request   transfer   of
            applicants/cardholders outside of the TASM’s site.
        5.2.9. Verify through a security manager or other individual with JPAS access that
        mandated investigative requirements have been completed before loading personnel into
        CVS to act as TAs.
6. Trusted Agent (TA).
     6.1. A TA shall be a uniformed service member or civil servant (TA cannot be contractor).
     Additionally, a TA:
        6.1.1. Must be a U.S. Citizen.
        6.1.2. Must be in possession of a valid operational CAC.
        6.1.3. Must complete the on-line TASM/TA CVS Certification Training at
        http://learning.dmdc.osd.mil within 3-months of appointment.
        6.1.4. Must not have been convicted of a felony.

                Instruction 36-812,‖ will be typed in block 13. Also in block 13, type the
                TA’s Social Security Account Number (SSAN). The SSAN is required to
                initiate the User Account.

                Trusted Agent‖ in the blank following.
            6.1.6.1.3. After completion of Part II, the DD Form 2875 will be electronically
            forwarded via encrypted email to the 75 SFS Security Manager (75 SFS/S1S).
            6.1.6.1.4. Part III, blocks 28-32 will be completed by 75 SFS/S1S.

     not received, the TASM will revoke the TAs access to CVS.
  6.2. TA Responsibilities:
     6.2.1. Create contractor accounts in CVS.
     6.2.2. Provide contractors with account information to log into the CVS.
     6.2.3. Review completed contractor applications.
     6.2.4. Approve, return (for modification), or reject the CAC ID application, as
     applicable.
     6.2.5. Before approving a CAC application, the TA shall:
         6.2.5.1. Establish the validity of the application.
         6.2.5.2. Ensure accuracy of the application.
         6.2.5.3. Verify, through the PM, the individual’s affiliation with DoD through
         contract requirements.
         6.2.5.4. Verify, through the PM, an established requirement to access military
         facilities and installations in execution of the contract.
         6.2.5.5. Verify, through the PM, the need for the contractor to access DoD networks
         and information systems. NOTE: Possession of a CAC does not constitute authority
 8                                                  HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


         to access DoD networks or information systems. A CAC is a tool for accessing them,
         when authorized. Authorization for access to DoD networks or information systems
         is a separate process and must not be confused with this process or used in lieu of this
         process to issue a CAC.
         6.2.5.6. If access is only needed to military facilities or installations, and not to
         networks and information systems, a CAC will not be issued. Contractors who do not
         require access to DoD networks or information systems will be issued a Defense
         Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) credential. Contact 75 SFS Pass and
         Registration (75 SFS/S5P) for instructions on applying for a DBIDS credential.
      6.2.6. Conduct six month contractor reverifications as prompted by CVS.
      6.2.7. Revoke CAC identifications as appropriate.
      6.2.8. Approve, return or reject applications as quickly as possible; recommend this be
      completed within five (5) business days. The TA may approve exceptions. NOTE: The
      CVS will reject the application if not completed with 90 days.
      6.2.9. Act as the unit focal point for all matters pertaining to issuance of contractor
      CACs and the Contractor Verification System.
      6.2.10. Immediately bring any security issues or CVS access matters to the TASM’s
      attention.
      6.2.11. After being entered into the CVS as a TA, the TA shall contact the DMDC
      Support Center at 1-800-372-7437 and have his/her account activated and anytime
      thereafter when his/her account is suspended due to inactivity.
      6.2.12. Ensure only contractor personnel are entered into the CVS. Separate policies,
      procedures and systems exist for the issuance of ID cards to civil servants, military
      personnel, retirees, etc. This does not preclude an individual with an additional status in
      DEERS from being entered into CVS as a contractor, for example a military retiree with
      a job as a contractor. However, never use the CVS to issue a CAC to an individual who
      is not a contractor.
      6.2.13. All TAs shall immediately notify the TASM of any suspected compromise with
      the TA’s account. The TASM will immediately disable the TA’s account and notify the
      IPOC.
      6.2.14. All TA accounts go inactive after 45 days of no activity. After this point, the TA
      will need to contact the DMDC Support Center to re-activate the TA’s account.
      6.2.15. All TAs shall comply with any additional Military Personnel Element (MPE),
      formerly known as Military Personnel Flight, requirements insofar as they do not violate
      existing higher echelon instructions.
      6.2.16. A TA is frequently also the unit Security Manager (SM). In those cases where
      the TA is not the SM, the TA must develop a close working relationship with the SM to
      ensure information regarding contractor CAC holders is shared appropriately.
7. Government Program Manager/Contracting Officer Representative (PM/COR).

                                         Attachment 2
             CONTRACTOR COMMON ACCESS CARD ISSUE PROCESS

A2.1. General: The following process is a role based model for issuance of a Common Access
Card (CAC) to a contractor whose duties require access to government information systems at
Hill AFB. This process is based on the model provided in Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) Publication (PUB) 201-1, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal
Employees and Contractors, Appendix A.
A2.2. Roles and Responsibilities: The critical roles associated with the CAC identity proofing,
registration and issuance process are defined below. These roles may be additional duties
assigned to personnel who have other primary duties. The following roles shall be employed for
identity proofing and CAC issuance:
   A2.2.1. Contractor – The individual to whom a CAC needs to be issued. Also referred to as
   applicant(s) and cardholder(s).
   A2.2.2. Government’s Program Manager (PM)/Contracting Officer (CO) – The individual
   who substantiates the need for a CAC to be issued to the Contractor. The PM/CO requests
   the issuance of a CAC to the Contractor. These duties can be delegated.
   A2.2.3. Trusted Agent (TA) – The entity responsible for identity proofing of the Contractor
   and ensuring the successful completion of the background checks. The TA provides the final
   approval for the issuance of a CAC to the Contractor.
   A2.2.4. CAC Issuer – The entity that performs credential personalization operations and
   issues the CAC to the Contractor after all identity proofing, background checks, and related
   approvals have been completed. The CAC Issuer is also responsible for maintaining records.
A2.3. Identity Proofing and Vetting of Contractors
   A2.3.1. The PM/CO shall request CAC issuance to a contractor via email or memorandum to
   the TA. This can be delegated. The request for issuance shall include the following:
       A2.3.1.1. Name, date of birth, position, and contact information of the applicant, contract
       number, contract expiration, and projected CAC expiration date.
       A2.3.1.2. Signature of the PM/CO (digitally signed email or memorandum acceptable).
   A2.3.2. The TA, through the SM or FSO, will check JPAS to determine if a record already
   exists for the applicant. If a record exists, the applicant can be considered identity proofed.
   A2.3.3. If no JPAS record exists, it is the TA’s responsibility to ensure the applicant is
   identity proofed. The importance of this step cannot be overstated.
       A2.3.3.1. If the contract has an assigned FSO, the TA may contact them to initiate
       identity proofing. It can be assumed that an FSO is properly completing this process.
       A2.3.3.2. If there is no record of the applicant in JPAS, the TA or FSO must take the
       following steps:
          A2.3.3.2.1. Meet with the applicant in person, who will produce two forms of
          identity in original form. At least one shall be valid state or federal government-
          issued picture ID. The other must be one of the forms listed at Attachment 3.
16                                                   HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


         Additionally, the TA must verify applicant’s SSAN and citizenship via originally
         issued SSAN card and birth certificate, or some other assured source. The purpose of
         SSAN and citizenship verification is to facilitate creating a record of the applicant in
         JPAS. NOTE: The list at Attachment 3 comes from the list of acceptable
         documents included in Form I-9, OMB No. 1115-0136, Employment Eligibility
         Verification, as required by FIPS PUB 201-1.
         A2.3.3.2.2. The TA shall visually inspect the identification documents and
         authenticate them as being genuine and unaltered.
         A2.3.3.2.3. The TA shall electronically verify the authenticity of the source
         document where possible.
         A2.3.3.2.4. If electronic verification is not possible or available, the TA shall use
         other available tools, such as the U.S. Identification Manual, to verify the integrity of
         the identity source documents.
         A2.3.3.2.5. The TA shall compare the picture on the identity source document with
         the applicant.
     A2.3.3.3. If the TA cannot meet with the applicant in person due to geographic
     separation, seek to make arrangements with an authorized TA, SM, or IP office in
     proximity to the applicant. Coordinate this attempt with the internal SM, as the SM will
     ultimately need to be satisfied that the ID, SSAN, and citizenship verifications were
     properly completed by a trustworthy source in order to create a JPAS record of the
     applicant.
     A2.3.3.4. If the above checks are successful, the SM will record the following data for
     each of the two identity source documents presented, to include the documentation used
     to verify citizenship in the remarks block on the AF IMT 2583, Request for Personnel
     Security Action, and sign it: The AF IMT 2583s will be retained on file for the length of
     the contract.
         A2.3.3.4.1. Document Title.
         A2.3.3.4.2. Document issuing authority.
         A2.3.3.4.3. Document number.
         A2.3.3.4.4. Document expiration date (if any).
         A2.3.3.4.5. Any other information used to confirm the identity of the applicant.
         A2.3.3.4.6. When verification is not completed by the SM (in most cases the TA and
         SM are the same person), record the name of the person who verified they completed
         the above requirements on behalf of the SM, i.e. the local TA or the
         name/organization of the person at a remote location as described in paragraph
         A2.3.3.3
  A2.3.4. The TA shall compare the applicant’s information contained in the CAC request
  (i.e., full name, date of birth, contact information) with the corresponding information
  provided by the applicant.
  A2.3.5. Favorably Adjudicated or Submitted National Agency Check (NACI) or higher.
HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                            17


     A2.3.5.1. The TA, through the SM or FSO, shall verify a favorably adjudicated NACI or
     higher investigation is recorded in JPAS.
     A2.3.5.2. To verify favorable NACI through JPAS, contact the SM, who will:
         A2.3.5.2.1. Review the ―Adjudication Summary‖ section in JPAS.
         A2.3.5.2.2. If eligibility states ―No Determination Made,‖ verify if ―IT‖ or ―Public
         Trust‖ is marked ―Yes‖ or ―IT 3‖ under the ―Suitability and Trustworthiness‖
         section.‖ If so, the NACI is favorable based on the unit commander’s suitability
         determination.
         A2.3.5.2.3. If the ―Public Trust‖ and ―IT‖ links are marked ―N/A‖, contact 75
         ABW/IP for further guidance. The 75 ABW/IP office will send a Contractor
         Suitability package to the applicable commander/civilian leader for review and
         suitability determination. The Contractor Suitability package includes detailed
         actions to be taken by unit Commanders/Directors in making suitability assessments
         and provides instructions for maintaining required suitability documentation.
     A2.3.5.3. If favorable adjudication cannot be verified, the SM or FSO must initiate the
     process by submitting an AF IMT 2583 on the applicant following applicable Personnel
     Security procedures.
         A2.3.5.3.1. Once the investigation package is initiated, a CAC cannot be issued until
         JPAS reflects verified submission of the NACI. Verified submission means 75
         ABW/IP has forwarded the Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) to the Office of
         Personnel Management (OPM). The SM must monitor the investigation to ensure it
         opens at OPM.
         A2.3.5.3.2. There are three fields within the JPAS Person Summary which can be
         used to verify the NACI was submitted: PSQ Sent, Open Investigation, and
         Adjudication Summary.
            A2.3.5.3.2.1. PSQ Sent Date: This field verifies the NACI was submitted when
            75 ABW/IPP or another authorized submitter has populated it with the date the
            investigation was sent to OPM.
            A2.3.5.3.2.2. Open Investigation: This field verifies the NACI was submitted
            when OPM has populated it with the date the investigation was opened.
            A2.3.5.3.2.3. Adjudication Summary:      This field verifies the NACI was
            submitted when the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) populates it
            with an entry indicating the NACI is pending adjudication, or adjudication of
            ―favorable‖ or higher is provided.
  A2.3.6. Favorable Fingerprinting.
     A2.3.6.1. If a favorable adjudicated NACI is verified through JPAS, the assumption can
     be made that fingerprints have been submitted with no issues noted.
     A2.3.6.2. If this cannot be verified, the TA, through the SM or FSO, shall either:
 18                                                 HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


          A2.3.6.2.1. Direct the applicant to schedule an appointment for fingerprinting
          through the 75th Air Base Wing Information Protection, Personnel Security office (75
          ABW/IPP).
          A2.3.6.2.2. Or, provide the applicant a blank FD 258, Applicant Fingerprint Card,
          and have the fingerprinting completed at75 SFS/S5P or their local police department.
      A2.3.6.3. Verification of favorable fingerprint results must be made before initiation of
      the CVS application process. To meet this requirement, the 75 ABW/IP will:
          A2.3.6.3.1. Provide a list of favorable fingerprint results as retrieved from the CATS
          to SMs weekly when possible.
          A2.3.6.3.2. The list will include the names of individuals who have been cleared in
          CATS for CAC issuance.
          A2.3.6.3.3. The SM will be responsible for searching the list for applicant’s names to
          ensure a issuance of an interim CAC is authorized, pending final adjudication of the
          NACI (or higher).
          A2.3.6.3.4. The 75 ABW/IP is not authorized to release unfavorable results or
          determine why an individual is not showing up on the list.
   A2.3.7. If the TA cannot verify favorable NACI submission and favorable fingerprint
   results, the CAC cannot be issued prior to favorable adjudication of the NACI as verified in
   JPAS.
   A2.3.8. Once identity proofing and vetting (submitted or favorably adjudicated NACI or
   higher) is complete, the TA will initiate the CAC application process in CVS.
A2.4. Contractor Verification System (CVS) Application Process
   A2.4.1. The TA will ensure the applicant is not registered as a CVS TASM or TA.
   A2.4.2. The TA will complete the CAC application process following the on-screen prompts
   in the CVS system. Refer to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) CVS Trusted
   Agent User Guide.
   A2.4.3. Once the application is completed, the TA uses a secure means to provide the
   applicant his or her user ID and temporary password and the CVS weblink Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL).
      A2.4.3.1. Full information can be sent via encrypted email or United States Postal
      Service (USPS) mail to the applicant, FSO, or the PM. The PM must provide the
      information to the applicant via a secure means or in person.
      A2.4.3.2. If other means are not practical, the weblink URL and user ID can be sent via
      unencrypted email. The applicant will be contacted and provided the temporary
      password telephonically or in person.
   A2.4.4. The applicant logs on to CVS and completes his or her portion of the application
   following the on-screen prompts. Upon completion, the CVS will automatically notify the
   TA.
HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               19


      A2.4.4.1. As a general rule, applicants have seven (7) days to log into CVS from the date
      the TA creates the contractor’s account. Unit TAs can require contractors to log in
      sooner, however the system will automatically disable the application after seven days.
      A2.4.4.2. Once an initial logon is successful, the applicant must complete the application
      within seven (7) business days. The TA may approve exceptions. The applicant can
      logon and off the system as many times as necessary during this time limit. NOTE: The
      CVS will lock the applicant out if not completed in 30 days.
      A2.4.4.3. If changes are needed once the applicant submits the completed application,
      the applicant must request the TA return the application.
   A2.4.5. The TA will review the application in CVS. The TA can reset the password,
   approve the application, return it to the applicant for changes, reject, or disable it.
   A2.4.6. If the TA approves the application, the CVS will automatically notify the applicant
   to report to the nearest RAPIDS. The notification includes a URL to find the nearest
   RAPIDS.
      A2.4.6.1. Applicants using the Hill AFB RAPIDS (75 FSS/FSMPS) should use the
      following URL to schedule an appointment to avoid a potential long wait for issue: .
A2.5. CAC Issuance Process
   A2.5.1. The applicant will present two forms of identification in their original form to the
   CAC Issuing Official to verify identity. The identity source document must come from the
   list of acceptable documents included in Form I-9, OMB No. 115-0136, ―Employment
   Eligibility Verification.‖ At least one document from the Form I-9 list shall be a valid
   (unexpired) State or Federal Government-issued picture identification. The identity
   documents will be inspected for authenticity and scanned and stored in the DEERS.
   A2.5.2. The CAC Issuing Official will verify the applicant’s personnel status in DEERS and
   issue the CAC to the expiration date established by the verified CVS record.
   A2.5.3. Renewals. A CAC holder shall be allowed to apply for a renewal starting 90 days
   prior to the expiration of the current CAC provided a new CAC expiration date was
   established. The CAC Issuing Official will verify the cardholder’s identity against the
   biometric information stored in DEERS. The applicant is required to provide two forms of
   identity source documents in original form as noted in Paragraph A2.5.1
   A2.5.4. Reissuance. A CAC will be reissued when:
      A2.5.4.1. Printed information requires change or when any of the media (including
      printed data, magnetic stripe, bar codes, chip, or contactless chip) becomes illegible or
      inoperable. The CAC Issuing Official will verify the cardholder’s identity against the
      biometric information stored in DEERS. The applicant is required to provide two forms
      of identity source documents in original form as noted in paragraph A2.5.1.
      A2.5.4.2. The CAC is reported lost or stolen. (Refer to Paragraph A2.9)
   A2.5.5. Multiple Cards. There are individuals within the DoD who have multiple personnel
   category codes in DEERS (e.g., an individual that is both a reservist and a contractor). These
   individuals shall be issued a separate CAC for each personnel category for which they are
 20                                                   HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


   eligible. Multiple CACs will not be issued for an individual under a single personnel
   category code.
   A2.5.6. Retrieval. Unauthorized possession of a CAC can be prosecuted criminally under
   section 701 of Title 18, United States Code, which prohibits photographing or otherwise
   reproducing or possessing DoD identification cards in an unauthorized manner, under penalty
   of fine, imprisonment, or both. Invalid, inaccurate, inoperative, terminated, or expired CACs
   shall be returned to the CAC Issuer for disposition. The CAC is the property of the U.S.
   Government and shall not be retained by the cardholder upon expiration, replacement, or
   when the DoD affiliation of the employee has been terminated.
   A2.5.7. Restrictions. The CAC shall not be amended, modified, or overprinted by any
   means. No stickers or other adhesive materials are to be placed on either side of the CAC.
   Holes shall not be punched into the CAC. The chip or laminate shall not be removed from
   the CAC.
A2.6. Applicant Reverification
   A2.6.1. The CVS will automatically notify the TA and CAC holder when reverification is
   due. The TA can also check the ―Reverification‖ tab in CVS. Reverification is directed by
   CVS every 180 days.
   A2.6.2. The TA must contact the PM/COR or FSO and verify the contractor is still working
   on the contract and still requires a CAC.
   A2.6.3. If the PM/COR does not verify the contractor still requires a CAC, the TA must
   revoke the credential.
   A2.6.4. If the PM/COR verifies the contractor still requires CAC access, the TA must
   double-check the cardholder’s favorable or higher adjudication. If all is in order, the TA
   follows on-screen prompts in CVS to reverify.
A2.7. Card Expiration
   A2.7.1. As the card expiration date approaches and continued CAC requirement exists, the
   contractor must contact the government PM/CO to initiate the reissue process.
   A2.7.2. Before the TA initiates the process for a new CAC to be issued, the PM/CO must
   verify the applicant’s continued employment under the contract and valid requirement for a
   new CAC.
A2.8. Revocation
A2.8.1. The CAC is the property of the U.S. Government and as such the contract employee
(cardholder) has no rights to retain the CAC when not required to perform on a Government
contract or the U.S. Government requests its return. Hence once the U.S. Government requests
the CAC be returned (through the PM/CO/COR, TA, contracting officer, or other appropriate
agent) the CAC can be seized by military or civilian police, the employer, TA, PM/CO/COR, or
contracting officer. However, these entities must fully understand the limitations of their legal
authority in cases where the cardholder refuses or resists verbal instructions during attempts to
seize the CAC. Such cases will normally be turned over to Security Forces and/or other law
enforcement agencies to be resolved.
HILLAFBI36-812 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               21


   A2.8.2. The cardholder must return the government credential to the issuing agency within
   seven working days of one of the following: Completion or termination of employment,
   completion or termination of the contract, when the credential is no longer needed for
   contract performance, or when directed to return the CAC.
      A2.8.2.1. The normal and preferred method of returning the CAC to the U.S.
      Government is for the cardholder to personally turn it into a RAPIDS. At Hill AFB other
      options include:
          A2.8.2.1.1. Collection by the company and returned within seven days to the
          RAPIDS, PM/CO/COR, or TA. The PM/CO/COR or TA will ensure the CAC(s) are
          subsequently provided to the RAPIDS.
          A2.8.2.1.2. The contractor can turn in the CAC(s) to the Visitor Centers located at
          South and West Gates, who will ensure CAC(s) are forwarded to the RAPIDS.
          A2.8.2.1.3. The contractor can turn in the CAC(s) to any Security Forces post or
          patrol, who will ensure CAC(s) are forwarded to the RAPIDS.
          A2.8.2.1.4. Upon seizure, whoever possesses the CAC will ensure it is forwarded to
          the RAPIDS.
   A2.8.3. Contractors must notify the PM/CO/COR if a cardholder fails to comply with these
   requirements. In cases where the PM/CO/COR is not immediately available or situations
   involving misuse, refusal to return the CAC, violence, or criminal behavior, the company
   must also notify the TA directly. In extreme cases the company must also notify Security
   Forces.
   A2.8.4. The PM notifies the TA and the appropriate contracting officer who is authorized to
   delay final payment under the contract if the contractor fails to comply with these
   requirements.
   A2.8.5. Upon notification that a contractor has failed to comply with these requirements, the
   TA must:
      A2.8.5.1. Immediately revoke the CAC in CVS. This triggers a series of events which
      include updating the DEERS to indicate the cardholder is no longer authorized and
      terminating the cardholder’s certificates associated with electronic systems access and
      verification.
      A2.8.5.2. Notify Security Forces so they can notify posts and patrols as well as mark the
      CAC in DBIDS to be seized upon contact.
A2.9. Lost CAC Procedures
   A2.9.1. Operational security is every cardholder’s responsibility. To prevent potential
   misuse or criminal activity, the following specific actions are required in order to replace a
   lost or stolen CAC.
   A2.9.2. The cardholder must immediately report the incident to their supervisor. They must
   also report to their sponsoring agency security manager to complete an AF Information
   Management Tool (IMT) 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness Complainant, or a
   memorandum that explains when and where the cardholder believes they lost their CAC and
   what actions were taken to find the card and rectify the situation.

  A2.9.3. The AF IMT 1168 or memorandum must be presented to the CAC Issuing Official
  before the individual will be issued a new CAC.
  A2.9.4. Applicants should use the following URL to schedule an appointment to avoid a
  potential long wait for replacement: .
  A2.9.5. The CAC Issuing Official will verify the cardholder’s identity against the biometric
  information stored in DEERS and confirm the expiration date of the missing CAC. The
  applicant is required to provide two forms of identity source documents in original form as
  noted in paragraph A2.5.1.
  A2.9.6. The replacement CAC will have the same expiration date as the lost or stolen CAC.
  A2.9.7. If no identity documentation is available but the picture and biometric data stored in
  the DEERS database can be verified by the CAC Issuing Official, a CAC can be re-issued
  upon additional approval of the DEERS Site Security Manager (SSM). The SSM’s approval
  may only be given for reissuance of a lost or stolen CAC. If the picture and biometric data
  cannot be verified, the requirements for initial issuance apply.
  A2.9.8. The CAC Issuer is responsible for keeping a copy of all lost/stolen CAC reports.
