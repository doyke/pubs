     are incorporated in the appropriate paragraph of this instruction.
     1.5.3. Local Supplement Coordination. Units send proposed Local Supplement to
     MAJCOM Stan/Eval for coordination, then MAJCOM/A3 for approval. When published,
     provide a final copy to HQ AMC/A3V and MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
1.6. Requisition and Distribution Procedures. Unit commanders provide copies for all
aircrew members and associated support personnel, through local publications distribution
offices.
1.7. Improvement Recommendations. Send comments and suggested improvements to this
instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through Stan/Eval
channels to HQ AMC/A3V, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5302 according to
AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Programs (FMP), and MAJCOM Supplement.
1.8. Evaluations. This instruction establishes standardized instrument, qualification, mission,
and instructor evaluation criteria. It also establishes the areas/subareas necessary for the
successful completion of evaluations, and which required areas will be considered critical and/or
non-critical. Evaluations shall be administered by a USAF flight examiner in appropriate aircraft
or Aircrew Training Device (ATD).
     1.8.1. AMC Pyramid Evaluation Program. Pyramid evaluation program will be IAW AFI
     11-202V2, AMCSUP1, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. If no MDS-qualified
     evaluator is on staff at AMC/A3V, AMC will designate the senior MDS flight examiner to
     evaluate the top of the pyramid. PAG/CC will designate the senior flight examiners to
     evaluate within the PAG.
     1.8.2. To the maximum extent possible, evaluations should be accomplished in an approved
     ATD . Evaluations will consist of areas/subareas that have fidelity in the ATD and are ATD-
     creditable IAW AFI 11-2VIPV1, VIP Aircrew Training.
     1.8.3. Evaluators should not conduct evaluations when scheduled as a primary crewmember.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. See the appropriate crew chapters for evaluation requirements.
Accomplish a combined evaluation (one flight evaluation) concurrently, whenever practical.
Aircrews will complete the INSTM, QUAL, MSN and INSTR evaluations (as appropriate), at
17-month intervals according to AFI 11-202V2. Align dates, if possible, to minimize operational
impacts and ensure requisites are met.
     1.9.1. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All crewmembers will successfully complete an
     initial (INIT) and periodic qualification (QUAL) evaluation. Requisites include Open Book,
     Closed Book, Boldface/Critical Actions Procedures (CAPs) exams (if applicable),
     Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE), and an evaluation in the aircraft or simulator.
     1.9.2. Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation. All pilots will successfully complete a periodic
     instrument (INSTM) evaluation. Requisites include Open Book written instrument
     examination according to AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program, and an
     evaluation in the aircraft or simulator.
     1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluation. All crewmembers will successfully complete an initial
     and periodic mission evaluation (MSN) according to AFI 11-202V2 in the aircraft or
     simulator.
AFI11-2VIP V2 17 JUNE 2010                                                                      7


     1.9.3.1. Enroute (OME). Prior to certification to act as Pilot-in-Command (PIC) on any
     VIP mission, all pilots must complete an operational mission evaluation (OME). The
     OME is the culmination of aircraft commander (MP) upgrade training. Refer to Chapter
     2 of this instruction for further guidance.
  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in an MDS, all
  crewmembers will successfully complete an initial instructor (INSTR) evaluation in that
  MDS. The initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation will include all areas under
  GENERAL, INSTRUCTOR, and selected QUALIFICATION/MISSION areas as determined
  by the evaluator. At unit commander’s discretion, a crewmember that is fully mission
  qualified in primary and secondary platform, may upgrade to instructor on both platforms
  simultaneously with accomplishment of all prerequisites (only one evaluation in either
  aircraft is required). Evaluate crewmembers designated as instructors on their ability to
  instruct during all periodic QUAL or INSTM evaluations. NOTE: Pilots may complete
  periodic INSTR evaluations in the simulator. NOTE: Crewmembers who desire to align
  their qualification evaluation during an initial instructor evaluation must demonstrate all
  required areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/MISSION, and INSTRUCTOR.
  1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. SPOT evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, and
  associated MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. To align and/or be credited as recurring
  INSTM, QUAL, MSN or INSTR, all requisites for the desired evaluations must be met. In
  this case, the evaluator must be qualified in the MDS and crew position.
  1.9.6. Combined Evaluations. QUAL, INSTM, MSN and INSTR evaluations should be
  combined to balance resources and mission taskings. All requirements for combined
  evaluations must be met. Limit verbal evaluation on requirements to the maximum extent
  possible. EXCEPTION: Combined evaluations are not authorized for OMEs.
  1.9.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Evaluate a crewmember’s knowledge of
  emergency procedures and systems knowledge for all initial (INIT), requalification (RQ),
  qualification (QUAL) and mission (MSN) evaluations. If able, conduct EPE prior to mission
  execution to prevent mission scheduling impacts in the event of deficiency. The EPE will
  include areas commensurate with the examinee’s graduated training or as specified in AFI
  11-202V2 and MAJCOM and unit local supplements. EPE should be accomplished in ATD
  when available. See AFI 11-202V2 for further guidance.
     1.9.7.1. Unit OGV will publish, in a local supplement to this instruction, EPE guidelines
     and requirements to ensure adequacy and standardization. An EPE guide for each crew
     position will be developed detailing the evaluation areas and conduct of the EPE.
     1.9.7.2. Examinees may use publications which are available in-flight.
     1.9.7.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified (U) will be placed in
     supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
     If failure is due to unsatisfactory Boldface/CAPs accomplishment, examinee will not be
     permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a successful re-evaluation is accomplished.
     1.9.7.4. See respective crewmember chapters in this instruction for additional guidance.

     1.9.8. No-Notice Evaluations (N/N). Evaluate aircrew on any mission, local training sortie,
     or ATD sortie. Evaluatee will be notified of the evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Publish
     additional unit-specific N/N notification requirements in the local supplement.
     1.9.9. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes (e.g. INIT, RQ) for AF
     Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
        1.9.9.1. Identify unique mission-type evaluation (ones that do not have a specific prefix
        associated with them) descriptions on AF Form 8, Examiner’s Remarks, A. Mission
        Description. See respective crewmember chapters in this instruction for further guidance.
1.10. Grading Policies.
     1.10.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on performance
     during both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all
     evaluation requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
     1.10.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
     criteria set forth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or
     equipment safely and effectively during all phases of the evaluation.
     1.10.3. Use the grading criteria in this instruction to grade areas/subareas accomplished
     during an evaluation.
        1.10.3.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
        general and specific evaluation sections of this instruction.
        1.10.3.2. The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an
        evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
        accomplished or flight safety.
     1.10.4. When flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight
     before resorting to this provision. See the appropriate chapter for areas prohibited from
     verbal or ATD evaluation.
     1.10.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. Minor
     momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective
     action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations
     when determining the overall grade.
        1.10.5.1. If the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for performance of a
        maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lower limits
        of that range.
        1.10.5.2. Flight examiners will use the grading criteria in this instruction to assist in
        determining proper grades, not to replace flight examiner judgment.
1.11. Grading System. Refer to AFI 11-202V2 for specific guidance.
     1.11.1. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
     also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the areas’ title and
AFI11-2VIP V2 17 JUNE 2010                                                                      9


   shading of Q- block on AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet, (see examples at
   Attachment 2, Attachment 3, Attachment 4, Attachment 5, and Attachment 6).
1.12. Conduct of Evaluations.
   1.12.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
   of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
   the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
      1.12.1.1. Flight examiners should not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained or
      recommended for upgrade evaluation.
   1.12.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew
   position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
   performance.
   1.12.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
      1.12.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
      substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
      1.12.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
      this Instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall grade. The flight
      examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the flight
      examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area/subarea
      grades assigned, and any additional training required.
      1.12.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
      additional training requirements. Additional training should not be accomplished on the
      same flight. EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is acceptable when, in
      the evaluator’s judgment, unique situations presenting training opportunities exist. This
      option requires the flight examiner’s judicious application. When used, the examinee
      will be informed of exactly when the additional training begins and ends.
   1.12.4. A flight examiner other than the one who administered the original evaluation should
   administer any re-evaluations.
   1.12.5. ATD may be used to accomplish additional training and re-evaluations. Areas for
   additional training and re-evaluation should be limited to those areas/subareas that can be
   realistically accomplished in the ATD.
1.13. Unsatisfactory Performance.
   1.13.1. Conduct a thorough post-mission debriefing to the examinee and applicable aircrew
   members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   1.13.2. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline. When an examinee
   jeopardizes safety of flight, the evaluator may assume the duties of that aircrew member.
   This does not mean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time
   unsatisfactory performance is observed.
 10                                                              AFI11-2VIP V2 17 JUNE 2010


   1.13.3. Assign a qualification level of Q-3 for unsatisfactory performance in any critical
   area/subarea or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties.
   1.13.4. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander or operations officer when
   less than Q-1 performance is observed.
   1.13.5. Unsatisfactory performance in a non-critical area/subarea will result in no higher
   than a qualification level Q-2.
   1.13.6. Flight examiners observing unsatisfactory performance by a crewmember other than
   the examinee (including one in a different crew position) will comply with the requirements
   in AFI 11-202V2.
1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint AF Form 3862, using the examples at Attachment 2, Attachment 3, Attachment 4,
Attachment 5, and Attachment 6, for use as an evaluation worksheet. Copy each title, area
number and text (in the order illustrated), and shading to the appropriate blocks. Units may add
special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements. In-flight, use the worksheet to ensure
all required areas are evaluated. Record all positive and negative trend information and aircrew
member’s performance. Sign and file the worksheet or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the
aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation as a
temporary record of the evaluation. Maintain until the completed AF Form 8 is added to the
FEF.
   1.14.1. Evaluation worksheets produced using approved computer-based stan/eval programs
   in lieu of AF Form 3862 are authorized.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the
following:
   1.15.1. Open Book Exam. Requisite for QUAL evaluations.
   1.15.2. Closed Book Exam. Requisite for QUAL evaluations.
   1.15.3. Instrument Exam. Requisite for INSTM evaluations.
   1.15.4. Instructor Exam. Requisite for all INSTR evaluations. A portion of the open book
   examination administered to flight instructors will include instructor related questions. A
   separate instructor open book examination is not required for periodic evaluations. For
   difference-/multiple-qualified crewmembers, INSTR evaluations in additional MDS aircraft
   do not require an additional instructor exam for current qualified instructors.
   1.15.5. Boldface/CAPs. Requisite for QUAL evaluations (if applicable).
1.16. Evaluation Profiles. Evaluators will complete all required areas of the flight evaluation
worksheet in addition to the areas required for a specific MDS.
   1.16.1. Unit OGV will ensure simulator profiles include all areas/subareas; annotate those
   areas that are ATD creditable. Profiles shall limit verbal evaluation of subareas as much as
   possible.
1.17. Difference Certification.
   1.17.1. Difference. The term ―difference‖ describes the certification of one or more unique
   areas to meet the qualification requirements of the different model aircraft within the same
AFI11-2VIP V2 17 JUNE 2010                                                                   11


   series MDS (e.g., C-40B and C-40C or C-37A and C-37B). As a minimum, include all areas
   that are different between aircraft models, systems and/or operations.
   1.17.2. Crewmembers qualified in one MDS may be certified and thus qualified in another
   series of the same design aircraft (e.g., C-40B and C-40C). Certification requires completion
   of MAJCOM/A3T approved difference training IAW AFI 11-2VIPV1, VIP Aircrew
   Training.
   1.17.3. Certification will be documented IAW AFI 11-202V2 and associated MAJCOM
   supplements upon training completion for specific aircraft model.
   1.17.4. See respective crewmember chapters in this instruction for additional guidance.
1.18. Multiple Qualifications. Approval authority for multiple qualifications in two or more
different MDS aircraft (e.g., C-37A and C-40B or C-32A and C-40B) is IAW AFI 11-202V1 and
associated MAJCOM supplements.
   1.18.1. Multiple-qualified crewmembers will complete all training requirements and
   initial/periodic evaluations in each aircraft (except for Communication Systems Operators
   and Flight Attendants as noted in their respective chapters).
   1.18.2. See respective crewmember chapters in this instruction for additional guidance.
1.19. Senior Officer Requirements. See AFI 11-401, AFI 11-202V1, and AFI 11-2VIPV1.
   1.19.1. Senior Officer Course (SOC). Completion of Senior Officer Course (SOC) requires
   successful accomplishment of a qualification evaluation in the aircraft or ATD.
   1.19.2. Senior Officer Familiarization. Senior Officer Familiarization training (typically
   some combination of ground and simulator training) does not result in an AF Form 8.

                           FLIGHT ENGINEER EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and requalification evaluation
requirements for second (FF) and first (MF) flight engineer qualification. VC-25, C-20 and C-37
flight engineers may qualify initially as FF. USAFE C-20H flight engineers normally qualify
initially as MF. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all engineer
duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW
applicable flight manuals and Air Force Instructions (AFIs).
4.2. C-20/C-37 QUAL/MSN Evaluations.
   4.2.1. Overview. Initial evaluation will be to MF position.
       4.2.1.1. Initial. Conduct the initial QUAL/MSN evaluation on an operational or training
       mission consisting of at least 2 mission legs with the DV/VIP onboard (if possible) and
       monitor at least one instrument approach and landing. Include all areas under
       GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/MISSION and requisite exams. Upon successful
       completion of the evaluation, annotate AF Form 8 as crew position MF. Annotate any
       restrictions on AF Form 8.
   4.2.2. Periodic. Include all areas under GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/MISSION. Use
   MF designated criteria. Complete the evaluation on one mission, if possible.
   4.2.3. Qualification and Difference Certification.
       4.2.3.1. C-20B, C-20H, C-37A and C-37B Qualification and Certification. C-20B, C-
       20H, C-37A and C-37B are considered the same type MDS for qualification and
       evaluation purposes following an initial evaluation in the primary type MDS and a SPOT
       evaluation in each additional type MDS.
           4.2.3.1.1. Qualification. Qualification evaluations are conducted in approved ATD
           and/or aircraft. After completion of an evaluation in each type MDS, FEs may
           complete recurring periodic evaluations in any type MDS qualified. FEs should
           alternate successive recurring periodic evaluations between MDS types.
           4.2.3.1.2. Certification. Transition between MDS types will be accomplished via
           MAJCOM/A3T approved difference training. Certification will be documented IAW
           AFI 11-202V2 and associated MAJCOM supplements.
4.3. VC-25 QUAL/MSN Evaluations.
   4.3.1. Overview: VC-25 flight engineers initially upgrade to second engineer by combined
   INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation with a crew position identifier of FF. Unsupervised, VC-25
   second engineers are limited to performing scanners duties. Second engineers upgrade to
   first engineer by combined INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation with a crew position identifier of
   MF.
   4.3.2. Evaluation Requirements:
       4.3.2.1. All initial, periodic, and requalification evaluations include (as a minimum) the
       following required areas:

        4.3.2.3. All items under QUALIFICATION. Those areas specifically required for MF
        evaluations only are identified ―MF Only‖.
4.4. INSTR Evaluations. Flight examiners will place emphasis on the examinee’s ability to
recognize student difficulties and provide corrective action. Evaluate instructor candidate
demonstrating and instructing a variety of FE tasks during instrument/visual approaches,
departures and arrivals. Initial or requalification instructor evaluations may be with a qualified
engineer occupying the engineer seat. The examiner may occupy the engineer seat and play role
of student.

     criteria), and INSTRUCTOR. NOTE: Flight engineers who desire to realign their
     QUAL/MSN evaluation during the initial instructor evaluation (update qualification
     expiration date) must ―demonstrate‖ all areas under QUALIFICATION/MISSION and
     complete all required written examinations.
     4.4.2. Periodic. Evaluate all areas under INSTRUCTOR during all flight evaluations.
4.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Evaluate a crewmember’s knowledge of
emergency procedures and systems knowledge during all initial, requalification and periodic
evaluations.
4.6. Taxi Evaluation. IAW AFI 11-218, flight engineers qualified to perform taxi operations
will complete a periodic taxi evaluation administered by a pilot flight examiner.
     4.6.1. Evaluate the flight engineer’s ability to taxi the aircraft under its own power while in
     the pilot’s seat. The evaluation should include proper use of normal and emergency braking
     systems, throttles, aircraft controls, checklists, radios, egress systems, fire extinguishing

  COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OPERATOR (CSO) / DATA SYSTEM OPERATOR
                      (DSO) EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and requalification evaluations
including requirements for CSO/DSO qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations. The
examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all CSO/DSO duties safely and
effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable flight
manuals and Air Force Instructions (AFIs).
5.2. QUAL/MSN Evaluations. Log mission evaluation with qualification/requalification
requirements (e.g. INIT QUAL/MSN).      Include all areas under GENERAL and
QUALIFICATION/MISSION and complete all requisite testing. This evaluation leads to
unsupervised   MK     qualification.   For    VC-25,    PAG     determines    which
QUALIFICATION/MISSION areas apply for FK and MK qualifications.
   5.2.1. Qualification evaluations should be conducted and completed on one continuous
   mission. Upon successful completion of evaluation, document the crew position as MK.
   5.2.2. Multiple Qualification and Difference Certification.
       5.2.2.1. Multiple Qualification.
          5.2.2.1.1. CSOs may obtain additional qualification in MDS-aircraft with a
          designated crew complement for the CSO position.
          5.2.2.1.2. Multiple qualification is only available to CSOs after they are qualified in
          their primary aircraft.
          5.2.2.1.3. Complete an initial QUAL/MSN evaluation in each type MDS. Annotate a
          separate AF Form 8 as a QUAL/MSN evaluation (in the flight phase) for each initial
          evaluation.
          5.2.2.1.4. Recurring evaluations may be accomplished in any type MDS qualified.
          CSOs should alternate successive recurring periodic evaluations between MDS types.
          Annotate the crew position as MK and add the appropriate MDS description remarks
          on the AF Form 8 (e.g., ―This also satisfies qualification in xx MDS.‖)
          5.2.2.1.5. CSOs who desire to align their qualifications during a subsequent MDS
          evaluation must demonstrate all required areas under GENERAL and
          QUALIFIATION/MISSION. Add the appropriate MDS description remarks on the
          AF Form 8 (e.g., ―This also satisfies qualification in xx MDS.‖)
          5.2.2.1.6. The C-32A and C-40B are considered the same type MDS for qualification
          and evaluation purposes.
       5.2.2.2. Difference Certification.
          5.2.2.2.1. CSOs require difference certification for significant communication
          equipment modifications accomplished on same type MDS. See paragraph 1.17. for
          further guidance.

           5.2.2.2.2. C-20B, C-20H, C-37A and C-37B Qualification and Certification. C-20B,
           C-20H, C-37A and C-37B are considered the same type MDS for qualification and
           evaluation purposes following an initial evaluation in the primary type MDS and a
           SPOT evaluation in each additional type MDS.
               5.2.2.2.2.1. Qualification. Initial qualification evaluation is conducted in the
               aircraft. An initial evaluation is only required in one type MDS. For each
               additional type MDS, a SPOT evaluation will be accomplished. CSOs should
               alternate successive recurring periodic evaluations between MDS types.
               5.2.2.2.2.2. Certification. Transition between MDS types will be accomplished
               via MAJCOM/A3T approved difference training.            Certification will be
               documented IAW AFI 11-202V2 and associated MAJCOM supplements.
5.3. INSTR Evaluations. CSO flight examiners will place particular emphasis on the
examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide corrective action. Initial
instructor CSO evaluations will include instructing a CSO. Furthermore, CSOs may qualify
directly to the highest qualification they hold in their primary aircraft. If the CSO will upgrade
from UK to anything other than MK, then it shall be so noted under examiner’s remarks on the
AF FORM 8 (e.g. ―Individual is C-32A/IK qualified and is being qualified to IK on this MDS‖).

                       FLIGHT ATTENDANT (FA) EVALUATIONS

6.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic and requalification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission, difference and instructor evaluations. The
examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all FA duties safely and
effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable flight
manuals and Air Force Instructions (AFIs).
6.2. QUAL/MSN Evaluations. FAs normally receive a combined initial QUAL/MSN
evaluation. This evaluation leads to unsupervised FT qualification (C-9, C-32 and C-40) or MT
qualification (C-20, C-37 and VC-25). A follow-on QUAL/MSN evaluation upgrades an FT to
MT (C-9, C-32 and C-40).
   6.2.1. Conduct evaluation on an operational mission. The squadron commander may
   approve an FT evaluation on a training flight. For initial FT and MT evaluations, include all
   areas under GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/MISSION and complete all requisite testing.
   Upon successful completion of the evaluation indicate the crew position as FT (C9, C-32 or
   C-40) or as MT (C-20, C-37 and VC-25). Upon successful completion of the follow-on
   QUAL/MSN evaluation indicate the crew position as MT (C-9, C-32 or C-40).
   6.2.2. Multiple Qualification and Difference Certification.
       6.2.2.1. Multiple Qualification.
          6.2.2.1.1. FAs may obtain additional qualification in MDS-aircraft with a designated
          crew complement for the FA position.
          6.2.2.1.2. Multiple qualification is only available to FAs after they are qualified in
          their primary aircraft.
          6.2.2.1.3. Complete an initial QUAL/MSN evaluation in each type MDS. Annotate a
          separate AF Form 8 as a QUAL/MSN evaluation (in the flight phase) for each initial
          evaluation.
          6.2.2.1.4. Recurring evaluations may be accomplished in any type MDS qualified.
          FAs should alternate successive recurring periodic evaluations between MDS types.
          Annotate the crew position as MT and add the appropriate MDS description remarks
          on the AF Form 8 (e.g., ―This also satisfies qualification in xx MDS.‖)
          6.2.2.1.5. FAs who desire to align their qualifications during a subsequent MDS
          evaluation must demonstrate all required areas under GENERAL and
          QUALIFIATION/MISSION. Add the appropriate MDS description remarks on the
          AF Form 8 (e.g., ―This also satisfies qualification in xx MDS.‖)
       6.2.2.2. Difference Certification.
          6.2.2.2.1. C-20B, C-20H, C-37A and C-37B Qualification and Certification. C-20B,
          C-20H, C-37A and C-37B are considered the same type MDS for qualification and
          evaluation purposes following an initial evaluation in the primary aircraft type.
              6.2.2.2.1.1. Qualification.   Initial qualification evaluation is conducted in the
 86                                                                 AFI11-2VIP V2 17 JUNE 2010


                aircraft. An initial evaluation is only required in one type MDS. FAs should
                alternate successive recurring periodic evaluations between aircraft types.
                6.2.2.2.1.2. Certification. Transition between MDS types will be accomplished
                via MAJCOM/A3T approved difference training.            Certification will be
                documented IAW AFI 11-202V2 and associated MAJCOM supplements.
6.3. INSTR Evaluations. Flight Examiners will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s
ability to recognize student difficulties and provide corrective action.
     6.3.1. Initial and requalification INSTR evaluations should be administered with examinee
     instructing a qualified FA. See paragraph 1.9.4 in this Instruction for further guidance.
     6.3.2. Periodic INSTR evaluations will be administered in conjunction with QUAL/MSN
     evaluations and require all areas/subareas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/MISSION
     and INSTRUCTOR and complete requisite testing.
     6.3.3. Instructor upgrade in secondary aircraft. The squadron commander may approve an
     initial instructor evaluation in a secondary aircraft during a flight or ground evaluation (flight
     evaluation can be accomplished on an operational mission or OST). The squadron
     commander may approve this provision for multiple-qualified FAs who hold IT status in
     their primary aircraft. Add the appropriate MDS description remarks on Form 8 (e.g., This
     also satisfies qualification in xx aircraft).
     6.3.4. Initial Instructor upgrade for multiple qualification. See paragraph 1.9.4. for further
     guidance. Add appropriate MDS description remarks on Form 8 (e.g., This Initial Instructor
     Evaluation upgrades examinee to IT on primary (xx) and secondary (xx) MDSs).
