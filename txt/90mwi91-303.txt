1. Purpose. To safeguard Air Force assets and personnel by providing medically based cold-
weather risk management guidance for all Francis E. Warren (FEW) AFB units.
2. Responsibilities. Unit commanders are ultimately responsible for maintaining a safe work
environment. As weather conditions warrant, commanders may impose greater chill temperature
restrictions than those outlined in the base matrix and group attachments. Commanders,
functional managers, and supervisors will:
     2.1. Provide Guidance. Ensure applicable guidance for the workplace and operations are
     available to all personnel.
     2.2. Perform a Job Safety Analysis. Conduct a job safety analysis for each work task not
     governed by technical order, other definitive guidance, or anytime a new work task or
     process is introduced to determine potential cold-weather hazards.
3. Definitions.
     3.1. Actions: Steps directed and taken to mitigate the effects of cold weather on personnel
     working in severe weather conditions.
     3.2. Buddy System. When implemented, a minimum of two persons must be present during
     the performance of each outdoor task. Each individual will monitor the other for symptoms
     of frostbite, hypothermia, or other cold-related injuries.
     3.3. Cold-related Injuries. Frostnip, frostbite, hypothermia, chilblain, or trench foot. Refer
     to Attachment 8: Cold Weather Medical Reference for details.
     3.4. Emergency Work Only. This encompasses work performed in support of peacetime or
     wartime contingencies that must be accomplished to support national objectives or local
     needs. This includes ambulance, police, and fire response. The 90 MW/CC is the waiver
     authority for deviations.
     3.5. Essential Mission Work Only. Work performed in support of critical operational or
     training needs as defined by the appropriate group commander. This work will have
     restrictions and may be modified in action. A waiver authority will be required for
     deviations.
90MWI91-303 7 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   3


   3.6. Mission Critical. Those missions supporting critical operational/training needs as
   defined by the 90 MW/CC. This includes any mission designated as “higher headquarters
   directed” (HHD) or missions generated to support national emergencies or peacetime
   contingencies.
   3.7. Equivalent Chill Temperature (ECT). A composite apparent temperature that includes
   both ambient air temperature and wind speed considerations. The ECT will be used for
   defining restrictions and actions on work performed by FEW AFB units.
   3.8. No Mission Restrictions. All mission work will be conducted in adherence to
   established work/rest cycles. Minimize all outdoor non-mission related activity.
   3.9. No Restrictions. Equivalent chill temperatures in this category require no additional
   guidance, actions, or waivers.
   3.10. Priority Maintenance. Activity required to safeguard assets or support mission critical
   tasks.
   3.11. Restrictions. Leadership directs limits governing the type and duration of work
   accomplished in a particular cold weather category.
   3.12. Some Mission Work Restrictions. Some mission work may have restrictions or need
   to be modified in action. A waiver authority will be required for deviations.
   3.13. Waiver Authority. The command level authorized to allow for deviations from this
   instruction for a particular chill weather category. Refer to applicable Table/Attachment for
   specific level of waiver authority required.
   3.14. Warm-up Break. A specified period of time in a heated shelter or vehicle.
4. Equivalent Wind Chill Advisories. 90 OSS/OSW will issue an advisory when the ECT
reaches -20 degrees Fahrenheit. A new advisory will be issued and the old one rescinded when
the ECT reaches -40 and -65 degrees Fahrenheit.
   4.1. Primary Notifications. The wing Command Post will make primary notifications by
   telephone to group commanders. All control centers (e.g., Wing Security Control,
   Maintenance Operations Center, Transportation Control Center, Communications Job
   Control, CE Control Center, etc.) will be notified via the Local Weather Notification System
   (LWNS).
   4.2. Chill advisories will be disseminated in accordance with 90 MW Plan 15-1. No Title
   4.3. Affairs, upon notification from Command Post, will post wind chill restrictions and
   corresponding actions on the Base Electronic Marquee. No Title
5. Procedures. Table 1 lists the FEW AFB chill restrictions matrix. All values are based on a
moderate work or activity level while wearing appropriate gear. All temperatures are listed in
degrees Fahrenheit. Actions and restrictions are cumulative and will incorporate requirements in
warmer ECT categories. After receiving an advisory, units will refer to the applicable group
attachment for more specific guidance.

                               ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES

A8.1. Cold Injuries. Recognition & Treatment. Contributing factors for increased risk to cold
injuries include fatigue, dehydration, nutrition, alcohol, medications (consult your primary care
manager), and improper clothing (tight footwear).
   A8.1.1. Hypothermia. Hypothermia occurs when the core temperature falls below 95
   degrees and develops as the rate of heat loss exceeds heat production. The symptoms to look
   for can be remembered as Grumble, Mumble, Fumble, and Stumble. Move to a warm,
   sheltered area gently to avoid triggering a cardiac arrest. Remove wet clothing and place
   layers of insulating materials on casualty’s clothing, including the head. Have casualty
   transported to medical treatment facility.
   A8.1.2. Frostnip is when the painful exposed skin blanches (turns pale or white) and loses
   sensation but remains pliable. This is usually found on facial skin, like the tips of the nose
   and ears. Move to a warm area and re-warm by placing fingers in the armpit or blowing
   warm air over the frozen surfaces. Do not rub affected area. Recovery is usually prompt
   and medical attention is not necessary.
   A8.1.3. Frostbite is a localized lesion caused by freezing, usually affecting the feet, hands,
   ears, nose, and cheeks but can affect any exposed skin. The tissues are hard, insensitive, and
   white or mottled. Move to a warm area and remove clothing gently and begin external
   warming (warm water). Provide warm, sweet fluids if conscious. No attempt should be
   made to thaw if there is any chance of the affected area becoming refrozen. Treat as a
   burn--do not rub affected areas. Have casualty transported to nearest hospital.
   A8.1.4. Chilblain is a mild form of non-freezing cold injury occurring in damp, cold
   environments identified by recurrent, localized itching, and painful inflammation. Move to a
   warm area and allow affected body part to re-warm spontaneously. Provide adequate
   protective clothing before resuming normal duties. Seeking medical attention in a medical
   treatment facility is not necessary.
   A8.1.5. Trench foot is a non-freezing cold injury identified by severe pain, tingling, itching,
   reddening of skin, blisters, and numbness. Although “trench foot” suggests lower extremities
   as the most common site, other body parts can be affected. Move to a warm and dry area and
   allow affected body part to re-warm spontaneously. Have casualty transported to medical
   treatment facility.
A8.2. Recommended Controls for Preventing Cold Injuries.
   A8.2.1. Engineering Controls. Engineering controls attempt to reduce heat loss from the
   person as a whole and from exposed skin. Engineering controls include the following:
       A8.2.1.1. Providing for general or spot heating including hand warming.
       A8.2.1.2. Providing shielding from wind.
       A8.2.1.3. Reducing conductive heat transfer (avoid use of metal chairs or tools that are
       not insulated.
       A8.2.1.4. Providing warming shelters.

  A8.2.2. Administrative controls attempt to reduce the exposure time, allow individual
  control over the work, and provide for mutual observation. Administrative controls include
  the following:
     A8.2.2.1. Setting up work-warming regimen cycles.
     A8.2.2.2. Schedule work at warmest times.
     A8.2.2.3. Move work to warmer areas.
     A8.2.2.4. Assign additional workers to reduce time on completing task.
     A8.2.2.5. Establish a buddy system, emphasizing mutual observation.
     A8.2.2.6. Avoid long periods of sedentary effort.
     A8.2.2.7. Inform personnel of cold stress hazards and what proper clothing is.
     A8.2.2.8. Provide an adjustment or conditioning period for new employees.
     A8.2.2.9. Provide warm, sweet, non-caffeinated fluids.
  A8.2.3. Personal protection or personal protective equipment (PPE) is fundamental in
  managing cold stress. Employees need to be educated on the roles of clothing items and
  what compromises their effectiveness. PPE includes the following:
     A8.2.3.1. Properly selected insulated clothing to provide wind and moisture barriers.
     A8.2.3.2. Special attention paid to feet, fingers, ears, nose, and face.
     A8.2.3.3. Gloves/mittens based on task being performed and ambient temperature.
     A8.2.3.4. Water barriers to external liquids.
     A8.2.3.5. Appropriate active warming systems such as circulating air or liquids, electric
     heaters or chemical heating pads.
     A8.2.3.6. Appropriate eye protection for snow or ice-covered terrain.
