SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Minor changes were made to this instruction during its conversion from AFI21-101_86AWGM2
to this instruction. Recent changes in AFI 21-101 are covered in this instruction to include
guidance on in flight emergency (IFE) coverage.
1. FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
     1.1. This instruction governs the 86 AW’s responsibilities in the response to Crashed,
     Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR). The CDDAR program is established to
     recover damaged or disabled aircraft in minimum time to return Ramstein Air Base to
     operational status as soon as practical after a mishap.
     1.2. The CDDAR program is delegated to the 86th Maintenance Squadron (MXS). The
     operation and management will be consistent with the following considerations:
        1.2.1. The requirement to reopen the runway for operational use.
        1.2.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
        1.2.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigation in accordance with
        (IAW) AFI 91-202 and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
        1.2.4. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operations.
        1.2.5. If requested CDDAR team will assist Safety Investigation Board/Flight Safety/
        Incident Commander (IC) in the search for or preservation of Cockpit Voice
        Recorder/Flight Data recorder data.
        1.2.6. IAW AFI 91-204, when an aircraft is under investigation by the Interim Safety
        Investigation Board, recovery operations will not proceed until the board president
        releases the aircraft. Personnel who are not engaged in the investigation will remain
        outside of the recovery area. The crash recovery team may be called upon to perform
        tasks as required by the investigation team.
        1.2.7. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and will not take precedence over
        aircraft specific technical data in recovery of crashed, damaged, or disabled aircraft.
     1.3. 86 MXS Maintenance Flight will:
        1.3.1. Maintain crash recovery equipment with an inventory of specialized crash
        recovery tools, equipment, and current technical orders to meet expected crash recovery
        operations. CDDAR equipment is stored in building 2217.
        1.3.2. Provide personnel required to perform CDDAR operations.
        1.3.3. Provide primary and alternate Crash Recovery Team Chiefs (CRTC).
        1.3.4. Respond to IFEs by assembling a tow team and pre-position the tow team.
        Depending on runway the IFE aircraft is landing, the following locations will be used for
        pre-positioning the tow team:
           1.3.4.1. Runway 09-27 – North Crash Access Road at taxiway Echo outside the
           controlled movement area (CMA)
           1.3.4.2. Runway 08-26 – Southside of airfield, Ramp 8 area outside the CMA

        and broken and fire-damaged composite material containment, handling, and
        disposal.
        1.3.5.3. Establish a crash recovery and composite material handling training
        program. CDDAR personnel will accomplish annual training on Ramstein AB
        assigned mission design series (MDS) aircraft. Actual aircraft emergencies can be
        substituted for the required training.

        Engineering (BIO) and receive annual recertification.
        1.3.5.5. Maintain a current recall roster of all CRT personnel.
        1.3.5.6. Provide a CRT as required to conduct CDDAR operations IAW applicable
        aircraft technical orders and local checklists.
        1.3.5.7. Respond to all aircraft barrier engagements with the assistance of 86 MXS
        Transient Alert.
     1.3.6. The CRTC will:
        1.3.6.1. Provide the IC with a roster of CRT personnel.

        1.3.6.7. Be prepared to provide equipment or personnel to assist with emergency
        tows.
        1.3.6.8. Ensure applicable 86 AW organizations and tenant units participate in
