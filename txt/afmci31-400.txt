1. BACKGROUND:
   1.1. Security is a key enabler to sustaining air, space and cyberspace dominance. To address
   the diverse security issues across the Air Force, Headquarters United States Air Force (HAF)
   formed the Air Force Security Policy and Oversight Board (AFSPOB) to align the multiple
   functional activities having responsibility for the varied aspects of security. The Secretary of
   the Air Force (SECAF) appointed SAF/AA as the Air Force Senior Administrative Security
   Official to chair this board.
   1.2. The AFSPOB recommended to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) that each
   MAJCOM mirror the efforts of HAF by creating a structure to implement information
2                                                            AFMCI31-400 24 AUGUST 2009


    protection policy and procedures within the MAJCOMs to better coordinate and focus on
    security as well as improve coordination at all levels.
    1.3. The Vice Commanders at the MAJCOMs serve the role of the Command’s senior
    security official. The HQ AFMC Information Protection office (HQ AFMC/IP) serves as the
    single focal point to converge multifunctional security issues and lead the Command’s
    information protection efforts. HQ AFMC/IP office unifies the restructured Information,
    Personnel, Industrial and Operations Security (OPSEC)/Military Deception staff.
    1.4. The Chief of Information Protection chairs the AFMC MAJCOM Security Advisory
    Group (MSAG) comprised of functionally designated subject matter experts/representatives.
    The MSAG membership includes, but is not limited to, information security, personnel
    security, industrial security, physical security, OPSEC, information assurance, information
    management, public affairs, program protection, special access, Sensitive Compartmented
    Information (SCI), international affairs and foreign disclosure.
    1.5. The Vice Commanders at each air base wing serve the role of the Installation’s senior
    security official. The installations will establish an ABW/Information Protection office
    (ABW/IP). The ABW/IP office serves as the single focal point to converge multifunctional
    security issues and lead the Installation’s information protection efforts. The ABW/IP
    offices will report directly to the ABW/CV.
2. SCOPE: This AFMCI applies to all AFMC IP Offices. It specifies primary roles and
responsibilities of the HQ AFMC/IP and ABW/IP offices. This AFMCI provides for the orderly
transition of all aspects of the IP offices and a management structure to ensure the uninterrupted
collection, processing and dissemination of information. ABW/CCs may augment this
instruction to detail their specific implementation needs.
3. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES:
    3.1. Initial Operational Capability (IOC):
       3.1.1. HQ AFMC created an Information Protection office (HQ AFMC/IP) reporting to
       the AFMC Vice Commander. Installations must create an ABW/Information Protection
       office (ABW/IP) reporting directly to the ABW/CV. The manpower positions for the HQ
       AFMC/IP and ABW/IP offices were resourced from existing information, personnel and
       industrial security billets.
       3.1.2. HQ USAF identified the billets/position numbers.
       3.1.3. While the new IP offices must include Information, Personnel and Industrial
       Security Programs as a minimum for IOC, there is no prohibition against including other
       related security programs such as Operations Security, Military Deception, Program
       Protection, Foreign Disclosure, Special Access Programs, Antiterrorism or Scientific and
       Technical Information under the IP umbrella. However, these programs will not transfer
       or fall under the Installation IP offices without submitting an approval request from the
       wing installation commander to HQ AFMC/IP. HQ AFMC/IP will coordinate with the
       MSAG and the appropriate HQ functionals prior to submitting to AFMC/CV for
       approval. For example, security of special access programs may be included as part of IP
       as long as it has been approved by the AFMC Special Access Program Management
AFMCI31-400 24 AUGUST 2009                                                                   3


     Office, HQ AFMC/A5J. IP offices that had other disciplines under their umbrella prior to
     10 Nov 08 are exempt from this requirement to send a request for transfer approval.
     3.1.4. HQ AFMC/IP and ABW/IP will ensure all publications/forms are
     transferred/updated, as appropriate, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and
     Forms Management.
  3.2. Full Operational Capability (FOC) is defined by AFMC as:
     3.2.1. Creation of MAJCOM and Installation IP Offices.
     3.2.2. Realignment of manpower positions from SF to IP.
     3.2.3. Realignment of military positions to civilian positions. Note: for military billets
     performing IP duties, installations will realign vacant civilian Security Forces
     authorizations in lieu of military to the installation IP offices and retain military
     authorizations for deployment taskings. Military authorizations that initially cannot be
     exchanged with vacant civilian authorizations will remain in Security Forces units and
     the personnel detailed to installation IP offices. HQ AFMC/IP will work with SAF/AAP
     and AF/A7S to develop a plan to identify tradeoffs and return detailed military personnel
     back to Security Forces units.

     3.2.5. Establishment of the MAJCOM and base Security Advisory Groups.

    coordinating and networking security issues with the MAJCOMs and installations through
    their respective SAGs.
    5.3. The AFMC MSAG works issues that cut across security functional lines. The MSAG
    takes a Command approach to solve security issues as well as deliberate and prepare any
    issues that may have an AF impact and forward to the AFSAG.
    5.4. ISAGs work issues that cut across security functional lines. The ISAG takes an
    installation approach to solve security issues as well as deliberate and prepare any issues that
    may have an AFMC impact and forward to the MSAG.
