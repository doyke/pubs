                                          Chapter 1

                         AIR FORCE MOBILIZATION POLICY

1.1. The decision to activate RC forces: Will adhere to the judicious and prudent use
principles outlined within DoDD 1235.10. In compliance with this directive, all Air Force
Components, MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs will maintain the following standards when
ordering ARC members to active duty.
   1.1.1. Involuntary activation/mobilization (Title 10 U.S.C. § 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304)
   of ARC forces will be for a maximum of one (1) year at any one time (alternative constructs
   require approval from the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) or designated representative,
   the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R), or SecDef)). This
   period will include pre-deployment administrative actions, deployment-specific pre-
   deployment training, deployment, any administrative absence days accrued under Post-
   Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA), in accordance with AFI 36-3003,
   Military Leave Program, reconstitution time, and post mobilization leave.
      1.1.1.1. Deployment-specific training includes training stipulated within the Line
      Remarks section of the Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD), as required by
      supported command reporting instructions and AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
      Program. Training not specified within the line remarks, and/or post deployment
      reconstitution time, requires advanced approval via the HQ AF Mobilization Staffing
      Process.
      1.1.1.2. Ancillary training (to include Tier 1 and Tier 2a training) shall be completed
      prior to postured AEF vulnerability periods as required by AFI 36-2201.
   1.1.2. Units and individuals of the Ready Reserve that are involuntarily activated/ mobilized
   shall be kept on active duty no longer than absolutely necessary.
   1.1.3. A force generation construct should encompass a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell ratio as a
   planning objective. ARC force predictability is maximized through the use of defined
   operational cycles and utilization of force generation plans to provide advanced notification.
      1.1.3.1. Every effort shall be made to reduce or eliminate the use of unnecessary
      mobilization days to promote efficient utilization of limited mobilization days and human
      resources, thereby increasing ARC ability to support future mobilization requirements.
      1.1.3.2. In accordance with (IAW) DoDI 1235.12, mobilization/pre-mobilization training
      for reservists shall avoid being scheduled if a suspension of training at a temporary duty
      location of at least 5-days is anticipated to occur during any portion of such mobilization
      or pre-mobilization training.
   1.1.4. The approval of involuntary activation (mobilization) orders to support combatant
   commander (CCDR) requirements shall be completed in a timely manner that affords ARC
   members the opportunity to receive orders at least 180-days prior to the mobilization start
   date. Figures 4.2. and 4.3. depict current HQ AF Mobilization Staffing Process guidance for
   rotational and emergent requirements; providing detailed timeline guidance to support AF
   mobilization.
6                                                                      AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


    1.1.5. ARC members who are involuntarily activated/mobilized to support a contingency
    operation for a period of more than 30 days, and their eligible family members, are
    authorized by Title 10, U.S.C. Sec 1074(d)(1) as eligible to receive TRICARE benefits up to
    180-days prior to the active duty order start date.
       1.1.5.1. Commanders are authorized to produce mobilization orders immediately upon
       receipt of the MAJCOM execution message, unless specified otherwise.
       1.1.5.2. Effective date of early TRICARE benefits is the date member orders are issued
       or 180-days prior to active duty order start date, whichever is later.
       1.1.5.3. If an ARC member is issued delayed-effective-date active duty orders (for more
       than 30 days in support of a contingency operation) that are subsequently cancelled prior
       to the member reporting to active duty, TRICARE coverage (eligibility) for the member
       and eligible family members terminates on the effective date the orders are cancelled.
       1.1.5.4. At no time will the early TRICARE entitlement be greater than 180-days.
    1.1.6. Involuntary activation/mobilization orders in support of rotational contingency
    operations shall be provided to the member at least 180-days prior to the mobilization start
    date, or no later than 30-days after transmission of the mobilization message from
    AF/A5XW, whichever is later. The Unit Commander may issue involuntary
    activation/mobilization orders to a replacement member inside this timeline if the approved
    member becomes non-deployable in accordance with AFI 10-403.
       1.1.6.1. AFRC and ANG will provide metric reports to SAF/MR identifying timeliness
       of the publication date of involuntary mobilization orders and start date of mobilization
       (OPR: SAF/MR).
    1.1.7. The decision to involuntarily activate/mobilize ARC forces is made only after
    determining that it is both judicious and prudent to do so. Therefore, involuntary activation/
    mobilization (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12302 or 12304) of ARC forces should be considered only
    when CCDR requirements exceed Active Component (AC) capacity and the ―ARC volunteer
    pool‖ (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d)).
    1.1.8. AC functional area’s warfighting capabilities shall be at, or below, a 1:2 deployment-
    to-dwell ratio prior to involuntarily activating/mobilizing ARC forces.
    1.1.9. To the maximum extent possible given operational considerations and involuntary
    mobilization timelines, ARC forces shall be activated under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d).
    1.1.10. Deployment, or time-in-theater tour lengths for involuntarily activated/mobilized
    ARC, shall be consistent with similar AC forces (alternative rotational constructs require
    approval by AF/A3/5).
    1.1.11. To the extent possible, and to maximize unit cohesiveness, involuntarily activate/
    mobilize entire Unit Type Codes (UTC) and/or mission sets assigned to the same Unit
    Identification Code (UIC).
    1.1.12. Traditional unit reservists should be considered for involuntarily activation/
    mobilization prior to an Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) unless the support is for
    the IMA’s unit of assignment. IMAs are primarily activated to support their unit of
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                               7


  assignment. IMA support outside their unit of assignment must be approved by and through
  the IMA’s unit of assignment.
  1.1.13. Involuntarily activate/mobilize individuals with at least a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell
  ratio in order to comply with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy regarding
  judicious and prudent use of the Reserve Component (DoDD 1235.10). Individuals being
  mobilized with less than a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell ratio require endorsed justification from
  the first general officer in the chain, verifying that no other qualified individuals with suitable
  dwell periods (at least a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell ratio), or individuals who have never been
  mobilized, exist within the applicable unit. The general officer endorsed justification shall be
  included as a tab in the involuntary mobilization request submitted to AF/A5XW.
  1.1.14. AC members who transfer to the ARC will assume a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell ratio
  based on their last deployment return date. Members being considered for a subsequent
  mobilization should have at least 12-months of dwell. Members having less than 12-months
  of dwell must sign a waiver letter acknowledging the shortfall or they will be exempt from
  consideration.
  1.1.15. The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) will be screened, maintained, and individually
  prepared for activation as a pre-trained manpower pool to ensure the total force is completely
  resourced in the event of a contingency operation, national emergency, or war.

              LAWS, AUTHORITIES, AND LEVELS OF MOBILIZATION

3.1. Laws, Authorities, and Levels of Mobilization. Mobilization provides political,
economic, military, and legal options for consideration by the President throughout the range of
military operations (Figure 3.1.). Authority to activate ARC forces stems from United States
Code (U.S.C.) and Public Law. Title 10 of the U.S.C. contains the statutes governing manpower
mobilization. Emergency actions are governed by Congressional action, Executive Orders,
Federal, DoD and Service policies. The supported commanders, in consultation with assigned
legal counsel, will consider emergency authorities during planning for response options and
include them in Operation Plan(s) (OPLAN).

Figure 3.1. Level of Response




3.2. Authorities for Activation. Table 3.1. contains a partial list of authorities for activation
available in various scenarios. There is no set or chronological sequence to these levels of
activation; each depends on the nature of the contingency, its imminence, and the threat to U.S.
National Security. The requirement to initiate any level of activation usually will compel a
review at all management levels to consider escalating the level of access to the ARC forces.
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                           13


These authorities remain in effect until rescinded by the President or Congress, or expire by law.
There are seven major authorities for activation:
   3.2.1. Volunteerism (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d)). This flexible authority can be utilized by
   C-MAJCOM/C-NAF/FOA/DRUs to bring Selected Reserve (SelRes), Individual Ready
   Reserve (IRR) Airmen, and Guardsmen (with consent from the respective Governor or other
   appropriate authority) to active duty on a voluntary basis during domestic or international
   emergencies and other contingency operations. This authority can be used as a bridge to
   quickly expand active force capabilities, while awaiting legal authority to proceed with
   involuntary activation actions. Further, it can also be used selectively throughout a
   contingency and beyond. The number of personnel activated is determined and managed by
   C-MAJCOM/C-NAF/FOA/DRUs and based on the availability of funding.
   3.2.2. Retired Airmen (Title 10 U.S.C. § 688). Eligible retired Airmen may be involuntarily
   assigned to such duties as the SECAF considers necessary in the interests of National
   Security. Under Title 10 U.S.C. and regulations prescribed by the SecDef, a retired member
   of the Active Component (Section 688(b)(1)) or a member of the Retired Reserve who retired
   with an Active Duty (AD) retirement (Section 688(b)(2)), may be ordered to AD by the
   SECAF at any time. There is no specified period in this section of law for an Airman to be
   called to duty, except as noted below. Most Airmen ordered to AD under Title 10 U.S.C. §
   688(a) may not serve on AD pursuant to orders under that subsection for more than 12
   months within the 24 months following the first day of AD served under that subsection.
   However, this time limit is not applicable during war or national emergency.
   3.2.3. Selective Mobilization for a domestic emergency (Title 10 U.S.C. § 332, 333, and
   12406). Active Armed Forces may be expanded as a result of action by Congress and/or the
   President to mobilize Air Reserve Component units, certain IRR, and the resources needed
   for their support to meet the requirements of a domestic emergency that is not the result of an
   enemy attack.
   3.2.4. Presidential Reserve Call-Up (PRC) (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12304). The President,
   without declaration of national emergency, may authorize the SecDef to augment the active
   Armed Forces by a call-up of ARC units and for certain individuals for not more than 365
   days to meet the requirements of an operational mission or certain emergencies. The
   President must notify the Congress and state reasons for this action. PRC is limited to not
   more than 200,000 Ready Reservists (of which 30,000 may be from the IRR) from all
   Services. PRC authority may be operationally or geographically specific, based on the
   executive order for each occurrence.
   3.2.5. Partial Mobilization (PM) (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12302). The Active Armed Forces may
   be expanded as a result of action by the President (not more than 1,000,000 for not more than
   24 consecutive months) to mobilize Ready Reserve Component units, individual reservists,
   and the resources needed for their support to meet the requirements of a war or other national
   emergency involving an external threat to the national security.
   3.2.6. Full Mobilization (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(a)). Active Armed Forces may be
   expanded as a result of action by Congress and the President to mobilize all Reserve
   Component units and individuals in the existing approved force structure, as well as all
   retired military personnel, and the resources needed for their support to meet the
   requirements of a war or other national emergency involving an external threat to the national
 14                                                                    AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


   security. ARC personnel, for instance, can be placed involuntarily on active duty for the
   duration of the emergency plus six months.
   3.2.7. Total Mobilization (Title 10 U.S.C § 12301 and the additional Titles 10 and 50
   Emergency Authorities). The Active Armed Forces may be expanded as a result of action by
   Congress and the President to organize and/or generate additional units or personnel beyond
   the existing force structure, and the resources needed for their support, to meet the total
   requirements of a war or other national emergency involving an external threat to the national
   security.
3.3. Stop–Loss (Title 10 U. S.C § 12305). Stop-Loss can be a prudent crisis preparation
action. Any time ARC personnel are serving on active duty pursuant to an order to active duty
under 10 U.S.C. § 12301, 12302, or 12304, the President may suspend any provision of law
relating to promotions, retirements and separations for ARC and AD personnel. Under this
section, the President may prevent members of the ARC from being reassigned to a resource
pool of lesser availability (e.g., SelRes to IRR, IRR to Standby Reserve (active status), Standby
Reserve (active status) to Standby Reserve (inactive status)).

                                MOBILIZATION PROCESS

4.1. Mobilization Process. Listed below, and in Figure 4.1. are the various steps involved in
the mobilization process.
4.2. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. CJCS, as advised by JS, recommends to the
SecDef the assets that are to be called up, and their planned use, when Reserve Component (RC)
forces are to be involuntarily activated/mobilized to augment the Active Component. In
preparing mobilization recommendations, the following is considered: assessments of the
Services, CCMDs, and Service component commanders input from JS; and technical advice,
legal opinions, and policy considerations from OSD.
4.3. SecDef and SECAF. If certain conditions are met (see Table 3.1.), the appropriate
authority of SecDef or SECAF makes the decision to initiate involuntary activation/mobilization.
Note: Mobilization actions may require the President and/or SecDef to notify Congress as noted
in Table 3.1.
4.4. Mobilization Cap (MOBCAP) Management. The President, in consultation with the
SecDef and with input from the USD (P&R) and the Secretaries of the military departments, will
establish an RC forces MOBCAP, when appropriate. The MOBCAP establishes a limit of how
many RC personnel can be involuntarily activated/mobilized at one time. The Secretaries of the
military departments will provide justification for RC force requirements while applying policies
and procedures regarding judicious and prudent use of these forces. The USD (P&R), in
coordination with CJCS, will establish authorization levels for each Secretary of the military
departments within the approved total MOBCAP.
4.5. During an emerging crisis or contingency. The air component of the supported CCDR
will analyze requirements, review and/or modify the appropriate OPLAN(s), force list(s) and
TPFDD(s), and submit a validated tasking IAW CJCSM 3122.01A, JOPES Volume 1, AFI 10-
401 and/or Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) Request for Forces (RFF) to AFPC/DPW via
JS. At the same time, the SECAF, SecDef, and President will pursue, if appropriate, increased
access to ARC forces via the various activation authorities prescribed by law as noted in Table
3.1.
   4.5.1. All Aviation RFFs are submitted to the CAF SIPT, MAF SIPT or AFSOC, as
   appropriate, through JS.
   4.5.2. USAF force sourcing (and deployment) procedures are prescribed in AFI 10-401 and
   AFI 10-403. Once mobilization authority has been granted as required by law, the AFCAT
   WMP cell relays specific mobilization request procedures to HQ AMC, ACC, AFSOC,
   AFRC, ANG, AFPC/DPW, Air Staff Directorates and Functional Area Managers (FAM),
   AFCAT A1, and other CAT representatives.
   4.5.3. Crisis Action Teams (CAT). HQ USAF, MAJCOM, AFPC/DPW and operational-
   level (FOA/DRU, Numbered Air Force (NAF), unit-level) CATs and FAM networks will be
   alerted/activated and assigned duties to meet contingency mission needs.
 18                                                                   AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


   4.5.4. Emerging Crisis or Contingency Demand exceeds Active Component Capability.
   When the AF Component to the Joint Force Provider (AF FP) (AMC for mobility forces;
   ACC for conventional forces; AFSOC for special operations forces), in coordination with
   AFPC and the L-MAJCOMs, determine requirements cannot be met with Active Component
   forces and ARC volunteer forces (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d)), execution of the ARC
   Utilization Plan will commence (ref: AFPD 10-4 and AFI 10-401). The ARC Utilization
   Plan identifies specific ARC units for involuntary activation/mobilization sourcing and will
   be synchronized to account for general ARC force availability and readiness. This plan is co-
   developed by HQ AF, AF FP, L-MAJCOM, and ARC FAMs, and is prepared as a
   preparatory measure when existing CCDR demands levied on the Active Component drive
   them to operate at or below a 1:3 deploy-to-dwell ratio.
4.6. Mobilization Staffing Details: Figure 4.1. depicts the responsible agents for staffing an
involuntary activation/mobilization request for ARC units/personnel.

Figure 4.1. Mobilization Responsible Agents




   4.6.1. HQ AMC. As the Service component to USTRANSCOM, the JFP for mobility
   forces, AMC is also the responsible agent for Mobility Air Force – ARC mobilization
   requests.    The AMC Mobilization Cell receives and coordinates all Mobility

  ensure involuntary activation/mobilization requests for Mobility ARC forces comply with
  policy, guidance, and procedures stipulated within this instruction.
  4.6.2. HQ ACC. As the designated Service manager for conventional forces, ACC is also
  the responsible agent for both Combat Air Force and Conventional – ARC mobilization
  requests. ACC/A3O receives and coordinates all Conventional mobilization/demobilization
  and rescission requests with other MAJCOMs and the respective ARC component(s). All
  requests are then submitted to AF/A5XW (AFCAT WMP) NLT 255 days prior to the first
  mobilization start date. AF/A5XW will acquire SECAF and/or SecDef approval. ACC/A3O
  will develop internal guidance and procedures to ensure involuntary activation/mobilization
  requests for Conventional ARC forces comply with policy, guidance, and procedures
  stipulated within this instruction.
  4.6.3. HQ AFSOC. As the Service component to USSOCOM, the JFP for special operations
  forces, AFSOC is also the responsible agent for Special Operations Forces – ARC
  mobilization requests.            623 AOC receives and coordinates all SOF
  mobilization/demobilization and rescission requests with other MAJCOMs and the respective
  ARC component(s). All requests are then submitted to AF/A5XW (AFCAT WMP) NLT 255
  days prior to the first mobilization start date. AF/A5XW will acquire SECAF and/or SecDef
  approval. 623 AOC will develop internal guidance and procedures to ensure involuntary
  activation/mobilization requests for SOF ARC forces comply with policy, guidance, and
  procedures stipulated within this instruction.
  4.6.4. While staffing details may vary between commands, the mobilization request
  submission timeline to AF/A5XW of NLT 255 days prior to the first mobilization start date,
  for CCDR rotational requirements, is standard and mandatory for all commands (Figure 4.2.).
  The mobilization request submission timeline for emergent CCDR requirements is NLT 60
  days prior to the mobilization start date (Figure 4.3.).

4.7. Upon approval: - AFCAT WMP will prepare a message from the AF/A3/5 authorizing the
AF JP or agency to begin the involuntary activation process in accordance with the dates
specified within the mobilization message. Strict compliance with the mobilization message is
essential, since involuntary activation of ARC personnel constitutes a legal action. Deviations
from the approved authorization must be coordinated in advance with AF/A5XW who will then
acquire subsequent approval, as necessary. No additional notification to the SecDef is required
to activate those ARC units/Airmen specified within the mobilization authorization. However,
all activations must be IAW current OSD policy.
   4.7.1. The AF FP will direct activation of forces by message through the appropriate ARC
   headquarters/CAT.
 22                                                                   AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


       4.7.1.1. The ARC will enter the directed Tasking Notification Code into DCAPES to
       designate that the RC tasking has been authorized for mobilization.
       4.7.1.2. Mobilization requirements will be loaded into the system designated by
       AF/A1M.
4.8. Upon completion of deployment- specific pre-deployment training, deployment-
reconstitution time (if applicable), post-deployment stand-down time, any administrative absence
days accrued under PDMRA, and post mobilization leave, ARC members should be demobilized
expeditiously.

                    INVOLUNTARY ACTIVATION/MOBILIZATION

5.1. Involuntary Activation. Involuntary activation/mobilization should be the exception, not
the norm. However, the ARC must be prepared for activation/mobilization at any time.
Planning will cover all degrees of volunteerism, call-up, and mobilization in support of
OPLAN(s) as well as plans prepared to meet needs created by crisis situations. SelRes units and
IMAs may be activated within 72-hours of notification. However, when IRR, Stand-by Reserve,
and Retired Reserve Airmen are activated, they have five calendar days, or as specified, to report
for duty.
5.2. Effective Tour Dates. The President, with advice of the SecDef, will specify the effective
beginning and ending dates for each activation. Units, UTCs, and individual ARC members,
when applicable, may not be substituted unless specifically authorized within the mobilization
authorization and coordinated in advance with the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF, AF FP, AF/RE, and HQ
ANG. The first day of active duty begins the date an ARC Airmen begins pre-deployment
administrative actions, training, or travel in compliance with an active duty order.
5.3. ARC Airmen. will be released from active duty not later than the established end-of-tour
date, regardless of the date of entry to active duty. Do not extend end-of-tour dates unless a
request for continuation, retention, or an approved extension has been received. Mobilization
end dates are stipulated within the mobilization authorization message. Any deviations must be
coordinated in advance through the appropriate ARC Headquarters and AF FP to AF/A5XW,
who will acquire subsequent approval, if necessary.
5.4. Reporting for Active Duty. Units and individuals will report for AD as follows:
   5.4.1. AF JP, Unified Commands, and External Agencies will provide the ARC unit
   commander the authority to order unit Airmen to AD at their assigned duty station.
   5.4.2. IMAs report to their unit of assignment unless otherwise ordered by the C-
   MAJCOM/C-NAF, Unified Command, External Agency, or other authority.
   5.4.3. Unless specified otherwise, ARC members ordered to AD shall complete
   demobilization actions at their assigned duty station.
5.5. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Authority. The organizational commander
exercising Operational Control (OPCON) over the unit/organization to which a recalled or
activated reservist is assigned or attached for duty (at the mobilized or deployed location) has
concurrent UCMJ punishment authority. However, the deployed commander will confer with
the ARC Airman’s commander at his or her permanently assigned duty station before taking any
action.
5.6. Full Mobilization. Under Full mobilization, the Active Component will assume OPCON
and Administrative Control (ADCON) of activated ARC forces.
5.7. Short of full mobilization. ADCON will remain with AFRC or ANG, as appropriate,
unless a specific agreement is made to integrate the ARC and regular components.
5.8. Funds for pay and allowances: - are provided from the MPA fund (except for retirees;
who are gained directly to AD and do not use MPA funding). AFPC or the respective C-

MAJCOM/C-NAF will provide 2.5-MPA days to cover accrued leave for each 30-consecutive
day period the Airman is activated. Airmen will be returned to home station upon completion of
the required tour length. During the leave/out processing period, Airmen are not available to the
theater commander. The Airman shall be released from active duty once out-processing is
completed; however, they are still available subject to the limitations imposed by law and policy,
to be involuntarily activated after deactivation.
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                             25


                                            Chapter 6

                      VOLUNTEERISM (TITLE 10 U.S.C. § 12301(D))

6.1. Volunteerism. In the early stages of a contingency, participating ARC forces are often
volunteers from the SelRes (either as individuals or in postured UTCs), activated under Title 10
U.S.C. § 12301(d) and serving on MPA man-days. This may be expanded to include volunteers
from the entire Ready Reserve population. Until involuntary activation/mobilization authority
has been approved, volunteerism is the only means for bringing ARC forces on active duty to
support a contingency operation. Consent of the respective Governor is required for the
voluntary activation of Guardsmen. ARC volunteers thus represent responsive and flexible
capabilities that can quickly augment active forces on a global scale (at both Continental United
States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations).
6.2. Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-days. The MPA program is designed to
support the short-term needs of the Active Component when there is a temporary need for non-
Extended Active Duty (EAD) personnel with unique skills or resources that cannot be
economically met in the active force. MPA man-days may also be used, under Title 10 U.S.C. §
12301(h), to allow ARC members to receive authorized medical care or to be medically
evaluated for retention. Tours normally not approved include replacement of personnel on leave,
temporary duty (TDY), in school, or to cover gaps created by reassignment. Additional
information regarding the MPA man-day program can be found in AFI 36-2619, Military
Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-Day Program.
   6.2.1. Management and Tracking. AFPC, AF FP, C-MAJCOM/C-NAFs, ARC HQs, and
   respective ARC units will ensure volunteer forces are managed and tracked. These same
   volunteer resources may be associated with UTCs subject to involuntary activation to meet
   emerging requirements. Management of deploying volunteer ARC forces is critical and must
   be coordinated across the FAM communities (within HQ USAF, AFPC, MAJCOMs, and
   ARC), to de-conflict current requirements with projected and/or long term requirements. C-
   MAJCOM/C-NAFs/DoD agencies must ensure volunteers complete the period of active duty
   specified in their orders or until mission completion, whichever occurs first. HQ USAF
   authorizes the commander having OPCON to release them earlier after coordination with
   respective ARC HQs.
6.3. Managing Volunteers. Subject to the needs of the Air Force, ARC Airmen serving on
voluntary tours may be recalled or mobilized. A volunteer serving in a contingency outside his
or her unit will not return to his or her unit for call-up or mobilization without the coordination
and consent of the commander who gained the volunteer. Commanders who gain volunteers will
not delay or prohibit the return of volunteers to their home stations as their activation and travel
orders expire.
   6.3.1. ARC members that volunteer, and are selected, for voluntary activation/mobilization
   outside of their AEF vulnerability period are not exempt from involuntary
   activation/mobilization during their AEF vulnerability period. Therefore, it is possible that
   an ARC member may be involuntary activated/mobilized after completing a voluntary
   activation/mobilization outside of their AEF vulnerability period.
26                                                                   AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


  6.3.2. Once authorized, volunteers will be activated by the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF. Upon
  notification of activation, C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will immediately provide all appropriate
  MPA, travel, and per diem fund cites to the tasked unit. Unless immediate travel is mission
  critical, Airmen will not proceed without such information. AC units to which IMAs are
  assigned will ensure all individual pre-deployment processing actions are completed.
     6.3.2.1. Activation orders shall be provided to individuals volunteering under Title 10,
     U.S.C. 12301(d) within two weeks of the individual’s acceptance to support a valid
     operational requirement tasking that is received by the unit and approved by the wing
     commander or equivalent.
     6.3.2.2. ARC members who volunteer (Title 10, U.S.C. 12301(d)) to support a
     contingency operation for a period of more than 30 days are eligible to receive TRICARE
     benefits up to 180-days prior to the active duty order start date.
         6.3.2.2.1. AF FP, in coordination with C-MAJCOM/C-NAFs, shall make every effort
         to identify contingency operation requirements and sourcing options in a timely
         manner that affords ARC member volunteers the opportunity to receive orders at least
         180-days prior to the active duty order start date.
         6.3.2.2.2. The effective date of early TRICARE benefits is the date member orders
         are issued or 180-days prior to active duty order start date, whichever is later.
         6.3.2.2.3. At no time will the early TRICARE entitlement be greater than 180-days.
         6.3.2.2.4. If an ARC member is issued delayed-effective-date active duty orders (for
         more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation) that are subsequently
         cancelled prior to the member reporting to active duty, TRICARE coverage
         (eligibility) for the member and eligible family members terminates on the effective
         date the orders are cancelled.
  6.3.3. Ready Reserve Component members may volunteer under Title 10 U.S.C. 12301(d),
  and retired Airmen of the AC may volunteer under Title 10 U.S.C. § 688, if qualified to
  perform the mission and a validated requirement exists.
  6.3.4. Funds for pay and allowances are provided from the MPA Account (except for
  retirees). Travel and per diem will be paid from the operation and maintenance (O&M)
  account of the organization requesting the volunteer. The respective C-MAJCOM/C-NAF
  will provide 2.5-MPA days to cover accrued leave for each 30-consecutive day period the
  Airman is activated. Airmen will be returned to home station upon completion of the
  required tour length. During the leave/out processing period, Airmen are not available to the
  theater commander. The Airman shall be released from active duty once out-processing is
  completed; however, they are still available subject to the limitations imposed by law and
  policy, to be involuntarily activated after deactivation.
  6.3.5. MPA requirements to support a contingency will be calculated by the requesting
  organization and entered into CMAS or its replacement system. Deviations from this
  calculation must be coordinated through the supported C-MAJCOM/C-NAF and approved by
  AF/A1M.
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                       27


  6.3.6. Unless waived by the ARC member, individuals on MPA tours of 61-days or more
  will be given at least 60-days advanced notice of any change to their original tour length;
  members on tour for 31 to 60 days will be given 30-days advanced notice of tour curtailment.
 28                                                                    AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 7

  SOURCING FROM THE PRE-TRAINED INDIVIDUAL MANPOWER (PIM) POOL

7.1. Sourcing from the PIM Pool (IRR, Retired Active, Standby Reserve, Inactive Standby
Reserve, and Retired Reserve). During extremely large or sustained contingencies, or
scenarios placing significant demands on specific Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) where the
combination of Active Component plus SelRes forces is insufficient to meet requirements,
involuntary activation/mobilization of Airmen from the PIM pool may be warranted. Sourcing
from the PIM pool is a limited surge option, not intended as a force sustainment tool, and must
be carefully exercised as part of a deliberate and graduated force generation strategy
recommended by HQ USAF and approved by SecDef.
7.2. Activating the PIM. Involuntarily activating/mobilizing PIM is determined by the statute
utilized to recall personnel. Coordinated recommendations are required from the USD (P&R)
and the CJCS. Services whose current force structure sets conditions for PIM to be called to
active duty as casualty personnel replacements must ensure the intent, scope, and timing for the
involuntary use of PIM is included in plans presented to the SecDef for approval.
   7.2.1. Considerations for use of the PIM pool include: required mission response times,
   required skill sets, availability of AC forces, the size (or estimates) of the ARC volunteer
   population, expected duration of the contingency, deployment requirements, etc.
7.3. PIM Activation Criteria. Normally, PIM involuntary activation will not be recommended
unless the following factors are present relative to the contingency:
   7.3.1. Mobilization authority under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12302 (Partial Mobilization) or Title
   10 U.S.C. § 12301(a) (Full/Total Mobilization) has been established (also, SECAF authority
   under Title 10 U.S.C. § 688 is necessary to activate Retired Active Duty).
   7.3.2. Tasked active duty and SelRes resources have been cross-leveled Air Force-wide
   (consideration should also be given to cross-leveling skill sets across all Services’ SelRes
   populations), and PIM resources represent the best remaining source of personnel to satisfy
   the projected shortages.
   7.3.3. Stop-Loss has been invoked for PIM skill sets under consideration.
7.4. Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). Airmen serving in the IRR can provide depth of
capability to support future conflicts. However, the decision to draw from this resource requires
a thorough examination of other viable options. One additional consideration is activation with
the consent of the Airman. If involuntary activation is required, appropriate IRR Airmen with
the necessary skills will be selected for activation based on CCDR requirements.
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                             29


                                            Chapter 8

                            SCREENING THE READY RESERVE

8.1. Screening the Ready Reserve. All Airmen of the Ready Reserve are to be screened at
least annually to meet the provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. § 10149. These measures provide for a
Ready Reserve force composed of Airmen who comply with the following standards:
   8.1.1. Meet military service wartime standards of mental, moral, professional, and physical
   fitness.
   8.1.2. Possess the military qualifications required in the various grades, ratings, and
   specialties.
   8.1.3. Are available immediately for               active   duty    during     an    involuntary
   activation/mobilization, or as required by law.
8.2. Participating Airmen. Participating Airmen are assessed during their fulfillment of
statutory participation requirements.
   8.2.1. Some non-participating Airmen of the Ready Reserve who have remaining military
   service commitment are assessed during Muster or Push-Pull screenings.
8.3. Theology and Divinity Students. Ready Reservists who are students in an accredited
theology or divinity school cannot be involuntarily called to active duty or required to participate
in active duty training IAW Title 10 U.S.C. 12317. These students must be transferred to the
Standby Reserve for the duration of their theological studies. Ready Reservists participating in a
military Chaplain Candidate or Theology Student Program may continue their Ready Reserve
affiliation and engage in active duty training and serve on active duty.

                                           Chapter 9

                      EXTENSION AND RESCISSION GUIDANCE

9.1. Extension Guidance. Mobilization extensions are the exception and not the norm. It is
critical that AF FPs, in coordination with C-MAJCOM/C-NAFs, thoroughly assess the continued
need and use of ARC forces to support a particular mission.
   9.1.1. For each PRC authority, the total activation period, including any extensions, will not
   exceed 365 consecutive days per individual. For PM Authority, the total activation period
   (including extension) will not exceed 24 consecutive months. Implementation of each
   authority will be IAW current OSD policy.
   9.1.2. The AF FP, in coordination with AF/A3/5 and the applicable Air Staff FAM and ARC
   headquarters, will review the requirement as soon as possible but not later than 120 days
   prior to the expiration of involuntary activation/mobilization authority to assess whether an
   extension will be required. If an extension is required, the AF FP, in coordination with
   respective C-MAJCOM/C-NAF, will submit a mobilization extension request for approval
   not later than 60-days before the expiration of mobilization authority together with a specific
   mitigation plan to sustain operational requirements once all periods of mobilization are
   complete.
   9.1.3. Extension requests will be forwarded to AF/A5XW (AFCAT WMP), which will staff
   the request accordingly. All requests are subject to SECAF and/or SecDef approval.
9.2. Rescission Guidance. Upon AF/A5XW direction, C-MAJCOM/C-NAFs will revalidate
their involuntary activation/mobilization requirements against operational needs and identify
unused mobilization authorizations for rescission. AF FP, in coordination with respective C-
MAJCOMC-NAFs, will coordinate with the respective ARC headquarters every 90 days to
determine if any unexecuted or unused authority can be rescinded. This coordination will assist
in the proper management of ARC force mobilization authority and approval by civilian
leadership of additional mobilizations, as needed. AF/A5XW (AFCAT WMP) will inform C-
MAJCOM/C-NAFs via message of the timeline for authorization rescission.

Terms
Activation— The ordering of units and individual members of the reserve components to active
duty under legislative authority granted to the President, Congress, or the Secretaries of the
Military Departments.      Activation expands active duty forces through voluntary and
involuntary/mobilization authorities.
Administrative Control (ADCON)— Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or
other organizations in respect to administrative matters such as personnel management, supply,
services, and matters not including operational missions of subordinate or other organizations.
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)— Air Force Reserve Command, unless otherwise
specified, refers to unit selected assigned reservists, IMAs, Individual Ready Reserve (IRR),
Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. AFRC/CC has oversight over the management and
mobilization of IMAs.
Air National Guard (ANG)— Refers to the Air National Guard of the United States. This
Reserve Component contains unit selected assigned guardsmen only (no IMA’s).
Air Reserve Component (ARC)— This term comprises all the forces assigned to both the Air
National Guard and the Air Force Reserve.
Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC)— ARPC is the AFRC Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)
responsible for management and mobilization of all individual reservists not in the SelRes unit
and IMA program (IRR, PIM, etc.).
Amend— To add, delete or change pertinent data on an order to read as originally intended.
Assigned Unit— The ARC unit or organization the Airman is permanently associated with in
peacetime.
Attached Unit— The unit an ARC Airman is temporarily associated with while on Federal
active duty. The attached unit commander gains/exercises OPCON of the ARC Airman.
Combat Air Forces Scheduling Integrated Process Team (CAF SIPT)— Multi-team of
colonels or civilian equivalents representing the Combat Air Forces, which coordinates

Call Up— This term applies only to members involuntarily called to active duty under Title 10
U.S.C. § 12304 (Presidential Reserve Call Up).
Command and Control— The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and control
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and
controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM)— A type of MAJCOM that is the USAF component to
a Unified Combatant Command. The C-MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic level, component
activities across all phases of conflict. NOTE: A MAJCOM can be both a C-MAJCOM and a
Lead MAJCOM.
Conventional Forces— Those forces capable of conducting operations using nonnuclear
weapons and those forces other than designated special operations forces.
Cross Leveling— The authority and ability to shift materiel inventory from one owner to meet
the requirement of another. At the theater strategic level and operational level, it is the process of
diverting en route or in-theater materiel from one military element to meet the higher priority of
another within the combatant commander’s directive authority for logistics. Cross-leveling plans
must include specific reimbursement procedures.
Directorate of Air Expeditionary Force Operations (AFPC/DPW)— A directorate of AFPC,
and is itself without authority to exercise operational command authority over Air Force forces.
AFPC/DPW authority stems from COMACC’s authority granted by the Chief of Staff of the Air
Force (CSAF). In its role as the U.S. Air Force’s primary single-source force/capability
provider, the AFPC/DPW is responsible for executing the Air Force battle rhythm by centrally
managing the scheduling and sourcing of forces to meet combatant commander requirements.
Deactivation— The process terminating activation orders, notifying, and transferring an
individual or unit from federal active duty status to their previous reserve status. In some
instances, deactivation may include return of ADCON to the assigned Reserve Component.
Defer— An action, which for a specified event or period of time, excludes an individual from
activation so they may complete training or other requirements. However, the individual is still
obligated to report while mobilization authorities are in effect.
Delay— An action that postpones, for a short duration of time (normally less than 30 days), an
individual reporting for active duty after mobilization. A delay is used to resolve temporary or
unforeseen circumstances.
Demobilization— The process necessary to release from active duty, or Federal service, units
and RC members who were ordered to active duty, or called to Federal service pursuant to
sections 688, 12301(a) or (d), 12302, 12304, 12306, 12406, and Chapter 15 of Title 10, USC.
(In some instances, demobilization may include the return of OPCON to the assigned Reserve
Component. This process culminates with the separate and distinct act of deactivation.)
Deployment— The relocation of forces and material to desired areas of operations. Deployment
encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including
within the United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater movement legs, staging, and holding
areas.

time of Congressionally declared war or national emergency (or when otherwise authorized by
law). Mobilization of all Reserve Component units, in the existing approved force structure, as
well as all individual reservists, retired military personnel, and the material resources needed for
their support to meet the requirements of a war or other national emergency involving an
external threat to national security. Reserve personnel can be placed on active duty for the
duration of the emergency plus six months.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)— The FAM is the individual or designated agency,
accountable for the management and oversight of all personnel and equipment within a specific
functional area to support operational planning and execution. Responsibilities may include:

Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)— An individual reservist attending drills who
receives training and is pre-assigned to a Active Component (AC) organization, a Selective
Service System, or a Federal Emergency Management Agency billet that must be filled on, or
shortly after, mobilization. Individual mobilization augmentees train on a part-time basis with
these organizations to prepare for mobilization, unless directed otherwise.
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)— An Airman of the Ready Reserve not assigned to the
SelRes and not on active duty. Additionally, the IRR is subject to mobilization pursuant to
sections 12301 and 12302 of Title 10, USC. Certain members of the IRR are subject to

AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                           39


Mobility Air Forces (MAF)— The Mobility Air Forces are comprised of those air components
and Service components that are assigned air mobility forces and/or that routinely exercise
command authority over their operations.
Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA)— MPA man-days support short-term needs of the
active force by authorizing active duty man-days to eligible ARC officers and airmen. The MPA
man-day program funds pay and allowances for volunteers and mobilized ARC personnel.
These days are at the convenience of the government and are authorized when there is a
temporary need for personnel with unique skills or resources that cannot be economically met in
the active force. Requirements, allocations, and execution of MPA man-days are tracked and
managed by AF/A1M.
Mobilization— The process by which the nation makes the transition from a normal state of
peacetime preparedness to a warfighting posture. It involves the assembly, organization, and
application of the nation’s resources for national defense and it encompasses all activities
necessary to prepare systematically and selectively for war. A federal active duty status applying
specifically to Title 10 U.S.C. 12302 (Partial Mobilization) and Title 10 U.S.C. 12301(a)
(Full/Total Mobilization) in which an Airman is involuntarily called to active duty for the period
specified in the applicable statute.
Mobilization Plans— These plans detail responsibilities and procedures for accomplishing
timely and effective mobilization. Programming data contained in the USAF WMP-3 and the
USAF program series documents will be used as a mobilization planning base.
Operational Control (OPCON)— Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at, or below, the level of combatant command. Operational control
is inherent in combatant command (command authority) and is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects
of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the
command. Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate
organizations; normally this authority is exercised through the Service component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces, as the commander in operational control considers necessary, to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not imply authoritative direction for logistics or
matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also called OPCON.
Partial Mobilization (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12302)— Expansion of the active Armed Forces during
time of national emergency declared by the President. Expansion by way of involuntary recall to
active duty, Ready Reserve component units, individual reservists, and the resources needed for
their support with duration not to exceed 24 consecutive months. No more than 1,000,000
members of the Ready Reserve may be on active duty, without their consent, under this section
at any one time.
Presidential Reserve Call up (PRC) (Title 10 U.S.C. § 12304)— The President may augment
the Active Armed Forces by a call up of Selected Reserve units and individuals and certain
members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) designated essential under regulations
prescribed by the SECAF for up to 365 days to meet requirements of an operational mission or
respond to certain emergencies. The President must notify the Congress and state the reason for
 40                                                                      AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012


this action. He is limited to no more than 200,000 total Ready Reserve members from all
Services, 30,000 of which may be certain IRR members.
Push-Pull Mobilization— The process of activating selected members of the Pre-trained
Individual Manpower (PIM) pool (IRR, Standby Reserve, and retirees) in anticipation of their
need to fill wartime requirements. The Push-Pull process is intended to supplement the normal
requirements based mobilization process (i.e., mobilization to meet requirements only as they
become known).
Ready Reserve— Refers to units (Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve) and individual
reservists eligible to be called to active duty in their current assignment. The Ready Reserve
includes the SelRes and the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). The SelRes and Individual Ready
Reserve liable for active duty as prescribed by law. (Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 268, 12301,
12302 and 12304).
Reconstitution— A specified period approved by the commander to account for equipment,
supplies and for stabilizing and replenishing equipment and supply levels. This period of time is
restricted to unit gained members.
Rescind— To withdraw an order when it is no longer required.
Retired Reserve— Consists of all personnel transferred to the Retired Reserve (reference DoDI
1215.06, Uniform Reserve, Training and Retirement Categories, 7 Feb 07 (Incorporating Change
2 dated 24 Dec 08)) and subject to mobilization IAW DoDD 1352.1, Management and
Mobilization of Regular and Reserve Retired Military Members, 16 Jul 05.
Revoke— To cancel an order before it goes into effect or before any funds are expended.
Selected Reserve (SelRes)— Those units and individuals within the Ready Reserve designated
by their respective Services and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial
wartime missions that they have priority over all other Reserves. All Selected Reservists are in
an active status. The SelRes also includes persons performing initial active duty training.
Stand-By Reserve— Refers to personnel who are not members of the IRR or Retired Reserve
and for sanctioned reasons are unable to train.
Stop Loss— Presidential authority under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12305 to suspend laws relating to
promotion, retirement, or separation of any member of the Armed Forces determined essential to
the national security of the United States ("laws relating to promotion" broadly includes, among
others, grade tables, current general or flag officer authorizations, and E8 and E9 limits). The
President may exercise this authority only if Reservists are serving on active duty under Title 10
authorities for Presidential Reserve Call-up, partial mobilization, or full mobilization.
Total Mobilization— Expands the Active Armed Forces by organizing and/or activating
additional units beyond the existing approved force structure and the mobilization of all
additional resources, including civilian facilities to round out and sustain such forces, to meet the
total requirements of a war or other national emergency involving an external threat to the
national security.
Unit Reconstitution— Unit-focused activity following a deployment or operation that is
dedicated to accounting for unit assigned members, equipment and supplies, and for
stabilizing/replenishing equipment and supply levels commensurate with pre–deployment/pre-
operation levels. Unit Reconstitution is a command prerogative and may be approved by the unit
AFI10-402 1 MAY 2012                                                                         41


commander after completion of redeployment or operations. Unit reconstitution may be
approved for any time span up to 30 calendar days as required. Unit reconstitution begins after
the unit’s release by the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF and is generally accomplished upon the unit’s
arrival at their home base. Although unit reconstitution is restricted to unit-assigned members,
this time period is not intended for the following member actions: completion of required
medical evaluations, out–processing, application for retention in the Active Component,
application for retention on active duty for hardship, using accrued leave, approved MAJCOM
down time, or travel time. All requests for reconstitution time must be coordinated through the
respective ARC HQ, the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF, and AF/A5XW (AFCAT WMP).
Volunteerism (Title 10, Sec 12301(d))— Allows the Secretary of the Air Force to activate Air
Reserve Component (ARC) SelRes and Participating IRR members in a voluntary federal status
(e.g., Title 10 U.S.C. 12301(d)). This authority is normally used as a bridge to expand active
force capabilities while awaiting legal authority for involuntary recall.
