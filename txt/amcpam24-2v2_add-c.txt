This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 2, Airbus. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 2 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by Airbus S.A.S. Corporation. Airbus was first created in 1970 as Airbus Industrie
GIE, a multi-national consortium, and is currently owned by European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company (EADS). As of the date of this publication, Airbus S.A.S. has provided more
than 5,900 aircraft to carriers worldwide, with over 5,600 still in operation.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 2, Airbus Addenda. Volume 2 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 2 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Airbus
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 2, Airbus Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.6. Copyrights. All drawings and diagrams, unless otherwise noted, are derived from copyright
© or copyrightable material of Airbus S.A.S. Used by permission. All rights reserved.

1.7. Description. Addendum C. Airbus A320 Series.
The A320 Series aircraft is actually comprised of several models of narrow bodies (which are
described in more detail below). As of the date of this publication, 4,076 aircraft of the A320
Series have been delivered with over 4,000 currently in operation. Furthermore, each model of
the A320 Series has several pending orders, indicating that this series will be around for the
foreseeable future.

Initially conceived as a result of the oil crisis in 1979, Airbus wanted to focus on fuel
consumption savings. Demand for a short- to medium-range single-aisle (narrow body) aircraft
brought about the A320. The A320 Series designation of aircraft was a concept in
“commonality” that Airbus expanded on. Simply stated, due to fly-by-wire commonality, pilots
can fly the A320, A321, A319, and A318 in the same way no matter how one aircraft varies in
size or weight from another, further reducing operating costs and allowing airlines to match
capacity to demand more flexibly.

The A320 made its initial debut in 1987, and was type-certified in 1988. This was the first of the
narrow body series aircraft and featured a slightly wider (155.5") diameter fuselage, enabling
airlines to install more spacious seats with a wider aisle. To date, over 2,170 A320s are in
operation worldwide.

The A321 became the next aircraft in the series, making its first flight in March of 1993, and
being type-certified in December of the same year. The A321 is basically a “stretch” offering
more seating capacity over the A320. To date, approximately 560 A321s are in operation
worldwide.

The A319 came next, first flying in 1995 and being type-certified in 1996. Airbus essentially
“shrank” the A320, offering less seating. To date, more than 1,200 A319s are in operation
worldwide.

The A318 is the last in the A320 Series, or family. Its first flight was in January of 2002 and was
type-certified in 2003. Airbus affectionately refers to this as the “baby” in the family, being
smaller and offering the least seating of all A320 Series. To date, almost 70 A318s are in
operation worldwide.

Variants of the A320 series are in development to enable the transition of A320 family of
passenger aircraft to freighters. Changes required for the A320/A321 passenger-to-freighter
(P2F) transition include the installation of a large cargo door on the aft fuselage and
reinforcement of the cabin floor. In addition, a cargo loading system is incorporated and cockpit
systems are modified. The P2F versions of Airbus' A320 and A321 are expected to take place as
early as 2011.

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
