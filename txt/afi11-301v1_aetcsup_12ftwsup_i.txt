1.1. Mission. Provide USAF aircrew safe and effective aircrew flight equipment and programs
to increase aircrew performance. Protect and sustain human life during flight operations.
Prepare aircrew and passengers to survive, affect their rescue, and return to duty if forced to
abandon their aircraft during an emergency. Provide aircrew protection from effects of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons.
1.2. Program Objectives:
   1.2.1. Increase combat capability of the total weapon system by enhancing and maximizing
   the performance and survivability of the aircrew.
   1.2.2. Reduce injuries and increase survival rates by providing aircrew and passengers with
   the best equipment available through new technologies, system training, and quality system
   maintenance.
   1.2.3. Identify requirements for modernization and new equipment by analyzing: customer-
   validated operational requirements, operational deficiencies, USAF suggestions and
   recommendations, Air Force Technical Order (TO) improvement reports, aircraft mishap
   investigation and safety report recommendations, and joint developmental programs from
   other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
   1.2.4. Train aircrew and passengers to use their Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) in a
   manner that reinforces recall during emergency situations. Training should be accomplished
   using training equipment that mirrors operational equipment and realistic scenarios, in which
   aircrew and passengers are likely to encounter. Realistic training will ensure aircrew and
   passengers have confidence in their equipment and increase their ability to use it.

                            AFE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance to assist AFE personnel in administering key
areas necessary for effective management of the AFE program.
3.2. Budgeting:
   3.2.1. Each AFE activity must use established DoD and USAF budgeting procedures to
   ensure their AFE programs are properly funded.
   3.2.2. Each AFE activity will prepare and submit a detailed annual budget and financial plan
   to their appropriate commanders and resource advisors. Submit unfunded requirements
   during mid-year and end-of-year calls IAW MAJCOM procedures.
3.3. Supply Accounts:
   3.3.1. The OSS AFE section will budget for and establish their own supply account as
   specified by AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter 8.
   3.3.2. When appropriate, local contingency plans will include qualified AFE technicians
   who will assume supply custodial responsibilities at deployed AFE locations.
   3.3.3. Ensure custodians receive base supply customer training as needed IAW AFMAN 23-
   110, Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 13, and the Education and Training Course
   Announcements (ETCA) site at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
   3.3.4. Develop procedures to track supply, equipment and clothing expenditures so as to
   provide quantitative requirements to the unit commander and resource manager to assist in
   and justify budgeting and funding requirements.
   3.3.4. (AETC) Monitor supplies from date ordered to date received through use of
   automated supply products. Maintain an accurate listing of all backordered items. Ensure Air
   Force Equipment Management System TORC screen authorizations are accurate and
   reviewed semiannually.
   3.3.4. (12FTW) Operations Group (OG) Resource advisor will make available on the OG
   server all Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH) spreadsheets required for tracking/reconciling
   purchases made with their Government Purchase Card (GPC) or through Base Supply.
   3.3.5. To ensure/justify equipment authorizations, units will maintain a current printed copy
   of the TORC screen for each NSN. This product will be used as the configuration data
   resume list. Refer to AFH 170-1, Resource Manager’s Handbook (projected to be AFPAM
   65-605).
   3.3.6. Ensure applicable Force Activity Designators (FAD) code is used when requisitioning
   AFE. When ordering time-change items, use TEX Code 8 to by-pass base level stock (if
   remaining service-life is inadequate to meet mission needs) and advice code ―2G‖ to ensure
   assets received from depot have the most service-life remaining on item.
   3.3.7. Report time-change component requirements IAW TO 00-20-9 and HHQs directives.
   AFRC associate units will provide information copies to their respective AFRC NAF.

   3.3.8. Use AS 538, AS 450, AS 660, aircraft configuration instructions, mission
   requirements, Logistics Details (LOGDET), AFEMS, MAJCOM specific guidance and this
   instruction to determine the basis of equipment required.
   3.3.8. (AETC) Formal training units may use AETC Form 120, Training Equipment List, in
   lieu of allowance standards, to establish classroom training equipment authorizations.
   Operational equipment requirements will be based on applicable allowance source codes.
   3.3.9. Each supply account custodian must submit supply difficulty and mission impact
   letters as required.
   3.3.9. (AETC) Send copies of submitted supply difficulty and mission impact
   memorandums, along with supply responses, to the AFE superintendent. Contract AFE units
   will forward a copy to their local quality assurance office.
3.4. Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group/Cost Per Flying Hour (AFCAIG/CPFH)
Program:
   3.4.1. Aircraft AFE components either on or off aircraft, to include prepositioned, used
   solely for flying operations are included as part of the CPFH program. In addition, aircrew
   equipment (other than uniforms and personal items are CPFH expenses. To purchase these
   items, use EEIC 644 for Materiel Support Division (MSD) items, EEIC 605 for General
   Support Division (GSD) items, and EEIC 61952 for Government Purchase Card (GPC)
   items. Units should use the most recent FY standardized CPFH RC/CC and PFMR/ORG
   codes applicable to their unit. Equipment items are not funded through the CPFH program.
   3.4.2. AFE and A4 AFCAIG/CPFH managers will identify and define, (by decision-tree
   method), total aircrew performance program AFCAIG/CPFH requirements for each MDS
   aircraft configuration within the command that adhere to HAF and MAJCOM guidance.
   Items not passing the decision-tree method for AFCAIG/CPFH AFE funding will be
   considered non-fly items.
3.5. Equipment Redistribution. In the event AFE becomes excess to organizational needs, the
AFE superintendent will notify respective MAJCOM, ANG, or NAF FMs for possible
redistribution prior to turn-in.
3.6. Transfer of AFE:
   3.6.1. During aircraft transfers or movement of AFE, communication between depot,
   modification agencies, and gaining or losing units is required. Comply with the instructions
   in AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 15, Asset Reporting, Redistribution, and Disposal, and TO 00-20-
   1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures.
3.7. In-shop/section Quality Control (QC). AFE QC programs are designed to provide
feedback to technicians, trainers, supervisors, and managers to eliminate defects and deviations
from established guidance.
   3.7.1. Quality Inspector (QI) Requirements. AFE QIs are 1P071 (or equivalent) technicians,
   trained and certified in the QI process. Highly experienced 5-level technicians may be
   appointed as an exception when approved by the AFE FEO/Superintendent. AFE QIs will
   augment the AFE QA Inspector.

             or else the equipment will be removed from service. Minor discrepancies will be
             corrected no later than the following duty day.
             3.7.2.1.2.3. (Added-12FTW) Specific action taken, date completed, and initials
             of individual making the correction will be annotated next to the affected
             discrepancy and will be cleared by annotating complete corrective action taken
             and initialed. ―Corrected or Complied With (C/W)‖ is not acceptable.
             3.7.2.1.2.4. (Added-12FTW) Supervisors will review AF Form 2420, Quality
             Control Inspection Summary to insure timely compliance of corrective actions. It
             is the ultimate responsibility of each individual to expeditiously correct all
             applicable discrepancies found during QCI.
  3.7.3. Develop and ensure IPIs are performed by current and qualified 1P071 (or equivalent)
  personnel. IPIs will be annually reviewed, updated and documented on locally developed
  form coordinated with AFE superintendent and AFE QA inspector. The form will remain on
  file until the next repack, repair, or aircraft transfer. As a minimum, IPIs will be performed
  during inspection and repack of parachutes and survival kits.
 36                              AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009

   to the AFE QA function monthly or earlier if a negative trend is identified.
      3.7.6. (AETC) Maintain quality control documentation until next scheduled inspection or
      for a minimum of 6 months.
         3.7.6.1. (Added-AETC) AFE superintendents, along with the AFE QA inspectors, will
         establish criteria for identifying positive and negative trends. Document identified
         positive and negative trends monthly.
   3.7.7. AFE personnel certified to clear ―Red-X‖ discrepancies will be annotated on the
   automated SCR, designated by unit commander via appointment letter for units that do not
   have access to an automated SCR, or as determined by applicable MAJCOM and ANG.
   AFE ―Red-X‖ certified personnel will be a 1P071 (or equivalent). The first O-6 in the chain
   of command may waive the 7-level requirement for a SSgt (E-5) or SrA (E-4) to clear ―Red-
   X‖ discrepancies based on their experience and technical expertise; such a waiver will
   terminate once a sufficient quantity of 7-levels are available.
3.8. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Program. The objectives of the CTK program are to prevent
and eliminate Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, engines, missiles, training and support
equipment, and to reduce tool cost through effective control of assets.
   3.8.1. Establish a CTK and lost tool procedure program to control and account for tools used
   in each AFE section IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13,
   Chapter 8, as well as MAJCOM, and wing/unit directives.
NOTE: AFE sections are authorized to manually track all their CTKs, or ALERTS is authorized
as well for AFE sections to track their CTKs. AFE sections are not required to use the
automated Tool Accountability System (TAS). Units will develop local tracking procedures that
will include quantity of serviceable/unserviceable oxygen connectors dispatched to and from the
flightline (if applicable).
         3.8.1.1. (Added-12FTW) Each CTK will be assigned an individual identification
         number. A master listing will be accomplished for each shop CTK and approved by the
         Superintendent.
AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009                                                      37


       3.8.1.2. (Added-12FTW) The tools or equipment contained in a CTK will either be
       etched or stamped with the assigned CTK number. Small tools or items which cannot be
       marked (i.e. drill bits, allen wrenches), and are maintained in a container, will have the
       container marked with the CTK number and the quantity of tools stored in the container.
       3.8.1.3. (Added-12FTW) Develop and use a color-coding system to identify tools
       removed from CTK’s. The purpose of this system is to enable a quick visual inventory
       and maintain positive control of tools. A color chit will be used to meet this requirement.
       Information regarding the removal of a tool will be documented on AETC Form 1042,
       CTK Tool Checklist in conjunction with a marker identifying the location of the removed
       tool. (i.e. TMDE, missing, on order).
       3.8.1.4. (Added-12FTW) Do not use markers or chits for CTK’s that have a FOD
       potential outside the Aircrew Flight Equipment shop.
Note: For dispatch to/from flightline, CRU-60 oxygen connector will be a one for one item.
AFE personnel will issue one from their CTK and take the bad one back to their section to
inspect/condemned/replace as required, if applicable.
   3.8.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an assigned
   location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, or
   silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
   issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
   NOTE: Personal tools are NOT authorized on the flightline or in any maintenance area. (e.g.,
   Mini-Mag type flashlights, Leatherman type multi-tools, buck knives).
   3.8.3. Units must place the 9-digit Equipment Identifier (EID) on all CTKs, tools not
   assigned to a box, and dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must
   be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be
   marked with less than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit World Wide Identification
   (WWID) and identifying characters that tie the tool back to the CTK. For example, tools
   inside an assigned dispatchable CTK ―U6JG00001‖ may be marked ―U6JG1‖.
   3.8.3. (12FTW) The following identifiers will be assigned to each section:
       3.8.3.1. (Added-12FTW) 559FTS – RJLS0XXXX

       3.8.3.5. (Added-12FTW) Survival Equipment – RJ21XXXXX
   3.8.4. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable
   equipment at the beginning and end of each shift, when moving from aircraft to aircraft,
   annually, and when custodians change. NOTE: Annual inventories do not replace inventories
   conducted each shift.
   3.8.5. Tool Accountability. AFE Flight commanders, superintendents and section NCOICs,
   through CTK custodians, are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control
   (knowing where tools are and who has responsibility for them.) When a person signs for a
38                             AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009


  tool or piece of equipment, they are accountable for the item until it is returned to the AFE
  section and accountability transfers back to the CTK custodian.
     3.8.5.1. (Added-12FTW) CTK custodians are responsible for tool and equipment
     accountability and control within their respective tool storage facility. Custodians will be
     identified by appointment letters generated by the Aircrew Flight Equipment
     Superintendent.
     3.8.5.2. (Added-12FTW) Control and accountability for tools will be maintained via
     AETC Form 1042, CTK Tool Checklist and AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
     By utilizing these forms, the CTK custodian must be able to determine at all times what
     tools and equipment are checked out and to whom.
     3.8.5.3. (Added-12FTW) CTK inventories will be accomplished daily. Account for all
     CTK’s and individual issue tools at the beginning and end of each shift.
     3.8.5.4. (Added-12FTW) At no time will tools from CTK’s be loaned to unauthorized
     personnel.
     3.8.5.5. (Added-12FTW) A comprehensive inventory will be performed on each CTK
     no less than annually, or whenever a CTK custodian changes. Check for condition,
     identification markings, and the accuracy of the CTK contents listing. Document the
     inventory on the appropriate form located in the master listing binder. The CTK
     custodian will maintain the current copy on file.
 3.8.6. (Added-12FTW) CTK Security:
     3.8.6.1. (Added-12FTW) CTK’s will be stored in a secure area.

       upgrade to 5- or 7- skill levels will be conducted on all Air Force core tasks, applying to
       the unit’s specific AFE equipment and mission design series (MDS) aircraft as identified
       in the wing master task listing. All evaluations must be completed before upgrading
       individuals to the 5- or 7- level (or equivalent for contractors).
       4.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) Initial task evaluations and/or certifications on core tasks may
       be certified by any qualified certifying official.
       4.1.2.3. (Added-AETC) The only documentation required on initial task certifications
       (after training and completion of the task evaluation) is to sign off the item in the
       specialty training standard in part II of the career field education and training plan
       (CFETP). If an item is not included in the specialty training standard, add the item to AF
       IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation /Command JQS, and place the form
       in the training record.
NOTE: Training Business Area (TBA) is an authorized AF Form 623 automated electronic
equivalent alternative for those units that do not have access to ALERTS.

                                             Chapter 5

      AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT CONTINUATION TRAINING (AFECT)

5.1. Purpose. AFECT consists of ground training events (not ancillary training) listed in Table
5.1 of this instruction and is provided for each aircrew member, designated non-rated personnel,
and passengers to refresh and enhance their proficiency and knowledge in all AFECT events.
This chapter establishes specific requirements and applies to all AFECT Instructors (AFECTI),
aircrew and personnel who fly. Training equipment will be configured to mirror operational
equipment and all training will be realistic, hands-on and student centered to the maximum
extent possible. This is the standard method for developing aircrew proficiency. AFECT will be
conducted in a distraction-free facility/environment.
5.2. Responsibilities:
   5.2.1. AFECT will be conducted IAW Table 5.1 of this instruction. MAJCOMs will
   supplement this instruction to tailor AFECT courses to fulfill their specific requirements. The
   361 TRS/TRR will update their AFE Air Force Master Lesson Plans (AFMLP) based on
   current safety information provided by the Air Force Safety Center and MAJCOMs. AFE
   Superintendent/FEO, upon notification from their MAJCOMs, will download the update
   information         from          the      AFE          AFMLP              CoP         website:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AE-OP-00-01.
   5.2.2. AFECT instructors may be an FEO, qualified instructor aircrew, or AFE (1P0X1)
   training instructor. MAJCOMs and ANG units will supplement this instruction with
   requirements for assigning and certifying AFECT instructors.
       5.2.2.1. Emergency egress training will be taught by a FEO (rated officer) or by an
       appointed rated officer and qualified instructor aircrew designated in writing by the group
       FEO. EXCEPTION: Civil service and contractor equivalent may conduct AFECT
       course(s) if specifically hired for that purpose and ANG AFECTIs.
       5.2.2.1. (AETC) AETC units will assign and certify aircrew flight equipment
       continuation training (AFECT) instructors as follows:
           5.2.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) The group and/or squadron FEO or AFE superintendent
           will certify all AFECT instructors on each event initially and on at least one event
           every 18 months thereafter. Vary training events used for certifications to avoid
           certifying instructors on the same training events each time.
           5.2.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Use AETC Form 281, Instructor Evaluation Checklist, to
           document initial evaluations when certifying instructors. Use AETC Form 281 or

5.3. AFECT Event Descriptions. Lead Commands, IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating
Command Weapon Systems Management, will be OPR for developing core curriculum for each
of the following blocks of instruction. AFECT event instruction may be consolidated as long as
curriculum requirements are met and individual events are tracked by the designated identifiers
in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). Lead commands will provide AFECT event
guidance in applicable AFI 11-2MDS-series, Vol 1 publications.
   5.3.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization (LL01): One time event, per base
   assignment, conducted prior to the first flight at home station to familiarize aircrew members
   with local AFE items availability, issue, use, pre-flight, and post-flight procedures. This
   training will be provided for subsequent re-assignments to the same base.
   5.3.2. Emergency Egress Training, Ejection Seat (LL02): Evaluates aircrew and passenger
   ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress/ejection procedures. In
   aircraft with multi-crew ejection seat capability, stress importance of aircrew coordination
   actions in emergency situations. Ensure aircrews are aware of their responsibilities for
   conducting safety and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
   5.3.3. Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat (LL03): Evaluates aircrew and
   passenger ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress procedures.
   Stress the importance of aircrew coordination, aircrew and passenger responsibilities and use
   of appropriate emergency egress equipment. Ensure aircrews are aware of their
   responsibilities for conducting safety and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
   5.3.3. (AETC) Units will incorporate the onscene commander (OSC) briefing into LL02
   and LL03 lessons. OSC briefing slides are available at https://www-
   r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp.
   5.3.4. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) (LL04): An academic and equipment
   training session in which the aircrew member demonstrates and performs donning, doffing,
   and buddy dressing procedures using either the first or second generation ACDE or Aircrew
   Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) equipment. This training also includes information on
   hazards and limitations of wearing the equipment properly and improperly, preflight
   procedures, aircraft integration, and parachute descent emergency procedures. Each aircrew
   will demonstrate procedures during their initial class; subsequent classes require a minimum
   of 10% of aircrew participants to dress out and demonstrate ACCA decontamination
   processing procedures.
   5.3.5. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05): Evaluates the aircrew’s ability to demonstrate
   proficiency in the use of primary as well as secondary air and ground egress procedures
   while wearing ACDE. Training will stress the unique changes in procedures to include added
   difficulties aircrew would and could experience as a result of wearing ACDE.
   5.3.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment Training (AFET) (LL06) (formerly Aircrew Life Support
   Equipment [ALSE] Training): An academic and equipment training event, in which aircrew
   members demonstrate their ability to locate, preflight, and use all aircrew and passenger AFE
   carried aboard unit aircraft or issued to aircrew members. This training includes the
   limitations and safety issues related to AFE. Additionally, include aircrew clothing items and

   contained in Table 4.1 of this instruction and be assigned using guidelines established by
   respective MAJCOMs.
   5.4.3. To obtain formal supplemental course allocations for AFE personnel, forward the full
   name, rank, Social Security Number (SSN), and organization of personnel requiring training
   to the appropriate MAJCOM AFE focal point at least 60 days in advance of the requested
   training date. AFRC and ANG will request quotas IAW AFRC and ANG procedures.
   5.4.4. The group FEO or AFE superintendent will control and manage the wing’s AFE
   formal supplemental course allocations. Cancellations or substitutions will be accomplished
   by contacting the appropriate MAJCOM or ANG AFE focal point not later than 30 days prior
   to class start date. Return all allocations that cannot be used to the appropriate MAJCOM or
   ANG AFE focal point for redistribution at least 30 days prior to class start date.
5.5. AFECT Requirements:
   5.5.1. Minimum Training Requirements. Table 5.1 of this instruction specifies the required
   AFECT events and frequencies for aircrew members and passengers.
   5.5.2. Failure to accomplish AFECT at the required intervals IAW AFI 11-2MDS-series,
   Vol 1/Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking memo, will result in grounding or non-combat
   mission ready status.
   5.5.3. If an aircrew member, current in all AFECT events, is TDY to perform flying duties to
   a location where a training capability does not exist and the individual becomes due in an
   AFECT event, training must be accomplished before first flight at home station. AFRC and
   ANG FMs will determine time frame required to complete training upon arrival at home
   station.
   5.5.4. Emergency Egress and Parachute Descent Training (PDT) should be given
   concurrently when practical (ejection or non-ejection aircraft).
   5.5.5. Flight Surgeons will receive AFECT at frequencies determined IAW MDS-specific
   guidance.
   5.5.6. Aircrew members arriving PCS or visiting aircrews, such as those assigned to the
   inspector general, test squadrons, etc., are not required to re-accomplish egress or PDT if
   source documentation of currency can be obtained (e.g., ARMS) and they are current in the
   assigned aircraft. However, training on local unit specific AFE and rescue requirements will
   be accomplished.
AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009                                                   51


   5.5.6. (AETC) Visiting aircrew to include HQ AETC/IG inspectors and 19 AF stan/eval
   flight evaluators, when performing observation and/or evaluation duties, must receive
   emergency egress training and unit-specific aircrew equipment training prior to the first flight
   at the inspected unit. Units may credit parachute descent training and aircraft specific
   emergency egress training received at other units during the past 12-month period provided
   documentation of currency can be obtained and only minor differences in equipment exist. If
   minor equipment differences exists (for example, parachute harness releases), training will be
   provided to ensure users are aware of the differences and can safely operate the equipment.
   For inspectors not currently qualified in an ejection seat aircraft, emergency egress currency
   expires at the end of the unit’s inspection.
   5.5.7. Aircrew members previously qualified in a given ejection seat equipped aircraft and
   currently in transition to a different model of the aircraft, or undergoing upgrade training in
   the same type of aircraft, may receive egress training at the regular interval from date last
   accomplished, if the escape systems and procedures are the same in both aircraft models.
   5.5.8. Aircrew members in transition from one type of ejection seat equipped aircraft to
   another and awaiting a Fighter Training Unit (FTU) slot will receive Emergency Egress and
   PDT at intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.5.8. (AETC) The OG/CC will determine acceptable training intervals. However, training
   intervals will not be less restrictive than those outlined for applicable MDS and/or in ready
   aircrew program requirements.
   5.5.9. Student aircrew members assigned to an FTU will receive emergency egress and PDT
   training IAW applicable syllabus.
   5.5.10. Initial and periodic ACDE training will be conducted IAW appropriate 11-2MDS-
   series, Vol 1 publications, this instruction, applicable TOs, and approved AFMLPs.
   5.5.11. An aircrew member may be credited with ACDT (LL04) during local operational
   readiness exercises provided all AFECT requirements and objectives are satisfied (i.e.
   crewmember donned chemical defense ensemble and subsequently processed through
   ACCA).
   5.5.12. (Added-AETC) Training currencies are valid through the last day of the month in
   which the training expires.
   5.5.13. (Added-AETC) Personnel who fly in an ejection seat aircraft other than their
   primary aircraft will receive applicable egress training before flying in that aircraft. For
   example, a T-6 qualified pilot will receive T-38 egress training before flying in the T-38.
   This training expires with primary seat training.
5.6. AFECT Safety. Safety is paramount when planning and conducting AFECT. As a
minimum, the following will apply:
   5.6.1. The group FEO or AFE superintendent, with assistance from the local safety office,
   will ensure ORM or other risk management programs or techniques are fully implemented,
   documented in unit lesson plans (LP), and tailored to their specific operation and location for
   all AFECT events.
   5.6.2. The AFE superintendent will develop and publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
   for use during any training event where injury is likely, (e.g., AFE class if signal flares are
 52                                AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009


   activated). The EAP will be included in the unit LP, briefed by the lead instructor prior to
   each training event, and understood by every instructor and student prior to event start.
5.7. Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training:
   5.7.1. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard ejection seat equipped aircraft will receive, as a
   minimum, emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
   If the 72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Emergency
   egress training includes cockpit familiarization, use of oxygen/communication controls and
   switches, and manual bailout procedures training, if applicable.
         5.7.1.1. Incentive/FAM riders flying over water beyond gliding distance to land will also
         receive water survival academics and hands on training with life preservers/life rafts.
   5.7.2. Non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform official duties (e.g., enroute
   ground support, security, etc.) will receive emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training at
   intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.7.2. (AETC) OG/CC will identify categories of personnel that fly occasionally to perform
   official duties. These personnel may be placed on a 60-day currency after meeting the
   following requirements:
      5.7.2. (12FTW) The following categories of personnel that fly occasionally to perform
      official duties are: Combat Aerial Photographers, Aerospace Physiologists, Pilots in awaiting

   5.7.3. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard non-ejection seat equipped aircraft will be
   briefed on emergency procedures and AFE as depicted in appropriate aircraft passenger
   briefing guides. The aircraft commander or their designated representative may conduct this
   briefing.
5.8. Training Documentation:
   5.8.1. All completed AFECT events will be documented on AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional
   Training Accomplishment Report, or equivalent and maintained as a record of class
   attendance IAW AFI 37-139. Only those event identifiers shown in Table 5.1 of this
   instruction will be used to identify AFECT events.
      5.8.1. (AETC) Other event identifiers are listed in AFI 11-202, Volume 1/AETC
      Supplement, Aircrew Training.
   5.8.2. Upon completion of training, one or more rosters will be signed by the instructor and
   forwarded to appropriate office for input into ARMS. The OSS AFE Flight staff will keep a
   duplicate copy of the rosters on file.
   5.8.2. (AETC) Keep rosters for a minimum of 2 years.
AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009                                                53


   5.8.3. Instructors will provide written documentation to individuals who are from another
   unit (i.e., Inspector General, HHQs staff, and visiting aircrews) so their records can be
   updated at home station.
   5.8.4. FTU and Basic Fighter Training (BFT) student rosters will be maintained until
   graduation.
   5.8.5. AFE is not responsible for maintaining ARMS or managing and tracking aircrew
   training status for AFECT events in ARMS.
5.9. Training Aids and Equipment:
   5.9.1. Emergency ground and air egress and ejection seat training will be accomplished
   using the appropriate Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) when available or the actual aircraft
   only when an EPT is not available. Non-ejection seat egress training will be conducted using
   actual aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   5.9.2. Units may use the actual aircraft installed ejection seat for egress training when
   designated training devices are not available provided all ejection seats are made safe by
   qualified egress personnel.
   5.9.2. (AETC) When off station and in the absence of qualified egress and/or maintenance
   personnel, instructor pilots certified to conduct egress training are permitted to make the
   ejection seat safe according to applicable MDS procedures to train incentive and/or
   orientation flyers. Additional plastic zip ties or strap fasteners may be used to prevent
   inadvertent removal of safety pins provided the appropriate form entries are made. Safety
   pins will remain in place throughout the entire training exercise.
   5.9.3. For ACDT and egress training, aircrew members are required to wear all clothing and
   AFE items typically worn during contingency operations unless specifically prohibited by
   this instruction.
   5.9.4. AFECT instructors will inspect training devices and aids prior to use to ensure they
   are properly configured, safe, and operational for training. The AFE superintendent or their
   designated representative will perform annual inspections of all AFE training devices and
   aids to ensure they are current and safe for training use. This includes displays, ACDE, AFE,
   and personnel lowering devices. Inspections will be documented appropriately.
   5.9.5. Training equipment will mirror operational equipment to the maximum extent
   possible. Equipment used for training will be clearly marked ―FOR TRAINING USE
   ONLY‖ and stored to prevent co-mingling with operational equipment. When training
   equipment does not exist (i.e., night vision devices, combat survival radios, etc.), MAJCOMs
   may designate the use of operational equipment for training as long as the training does not
   damage or destroy the integrity of the equipment.
   5.9.5. (AETC) Units are authorized to use operational equipment for training, provided the
   training does not damage, destroy, or bring into question the integrity of the equipment.
5.10. Lesson Plans Development Guidance:
   5.10.1. AFECT Air Force Master Lesson Plans. AFMLPs are documents developed to
   prescribe instructional requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities
   essential to the accomplishment of training objectives for all AFECT. AFMLPs are designed
54                             AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009


  to include the minimum training requirements and are essential for supervisors and
  instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
  5.10.2. Only approved AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer,
  Sheppard AFB, TX will be used to conduct AFECT. The AFMLPs, developed by the 361
  TRS/TRR, are complete and ready be downloaded once they have been approved by Lead
  MDS MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the AFMLPs that does not pertain to
  their mission or unit. MAJCOMs will use AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
  Furthermore, ARC units that have AFECTIs who are solely responsible for conducting code
  of conduct continuation training events will only use lesson plans approved by AFRC/A3TS
  or NGB/A3OS.
  5.10.3. The FEO or AFE superintendent must tailor down the AFMLP and produce an
  AFECT Master Lesson Plan (MLP) to meet their wings mission needs. AFECT MLP are un-
  personalized lesson plans used for control and standardization within an organization or unit
  that has been developed from the AFMLP by deleting unnecessary information based on a
  units equipment or MDS. Group FEO/AFE superintendents who identify a need for a new
  AFMLP will forward request to MAJCOMs or Lead MDS MAJCOM for review of new
  requirement(s). Approved requests will be forwarded, and all data from Subject Matter
  Expert (SME) for development of AFMLP to 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer, Sheppard
  AFB, TX.
  5.10.4. AFECT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed from the AFECT MLP and
  prepared for use by each instructor to organize and present information. A personalized
  lesson plan contains information to aid the instructor. This is accomplished by writing
  personal instructional notes and material on the right-hand side of the AFECT MLP. The
  lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials that can be produced upon
  request.
  5.10.5. All AFE MLPs and AFECT LPs used to conduct AFECT will be reviewed annually
  by the group FEO or AFE superintendent. Annual reviews will be documented as directed by
  individual MAJCOMs.
  5.10.5. (AETC) Document annual reviews on the front of each AFE master lesson plan and
  AFECT lesson plan.
  5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, Flight Crew Information Files
  [FCIF], etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in AFECT AFMLPs or lesson
  plans will be added as directed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
  5.10.7. Designated Lead MAJCOM MDS SMEs will assist the 361 TRS/TRR in validating
  AFMLPs biennially during the World Wide AFE Workshop MAJCOM breakouts. If more
  frequent reviews are deemed necessary; the requesting MAJCOM will coordinate and fund
  for the CDC Writer to attend MAJCOM conference to accomplish the review with SMEs.
  The 361 TRS will notify the MAJCOMS of any changes to the AFMLPs and group
  FEO/AFE superintendent will update their MLPs upon notification by their MAJCOMs.

AUTOMATED LIFE-SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT RECORDS & TRACKING SYSTEM
       (ALERTS) AND AIRCREW PROTECTION WEBSITE (APWEB)

6.1. Overview. The ALERTS and APWEB are automated global data management systems
developed to allow ―total asset visibility‖ of AFE items and associated documentation processes.
ALERTS is capable of supporting the entire AFE community to automate the data management
processes for most inspection, training, supply, and administration documents. The vision of
ALERTS is to provide the ability and means of improving the performance methods and
administration needs of the AFE community and support agencies using current COTS hardware,
software, and the military (.mil) network.
6.2. Automated Document and Management Systems:
   6.2.1. ALERTS. Once fully fielded, ALERTS will be used by all AFE functions within the
   Air Force IAW this chapter and MAJCOM supplements thereto. ALERTS Computer Based
   Training (CBT) is a mandatory training requirement prior to any individual using ALERTS
   in all organizations.
   6.2.2. ALSMS. ALSMS is a management tool used by AFE personnel. AFE units are
   authorized to continue using the ALSMS program to best suit their needs until they are
   designated by their MAJCOMS to be upgraded to ALERTS. Units tracking AFE items with
   the ALSMS program are not required to duplicate the data maintained in the computer on
   status boards, shop inspection cards, or forms. AFE superintendents will standardize
   equipment tracking methods within their respective groups.
   6.2.3. Aircrew       Protection    Website      (APWEB)         can     be   accessed     at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/DOTL/UnitData/UnitDataHomeFrame.cfm. All
   units that are not using ALERTS will use APWEB to document their end item data IAW the
   APWEB user manual. Each unit will provide all relevant data on each item to include;
   contract numbers, lot numbers, dates of manufacture, dates of expiration, back order
   quantities, off-base requisition numbers, and quantities deployed. The data contained within
   this site must be complete, verified, and validated by their respective MAJCOM prior to the
   unit being upgraded to ALERTS.
6.3. Responsibilities:
   6.3.1. Air Force ALERTS Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). HQ AMC is the primary

     6.3.4.3. Prepare equipment, personnel, aircrew, and aircraft for contingency operations
     through ALERTS.
     6.3.4.4. Extract, analyze, and formulate decisions from reports in preparation of
     equipment, training, personnel, aircrew, and aircraft for daily and contingency operations.
     6.3.4.5. Validate that assigned personnel have completed the CBT prior to authorizing
     the use of ALERTS.
     6.3.4.6. AFE superintendent will serve as the group OPR and the unit’s overall POC for
     ALERTS issues and is responsible for all unit actions. And, will serve as the primary
     conduit to the MAJCOM ALERTS OPR.
 58                             AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009


   6.3.5. AFE Technician. Through ALERTS, the AFE technicians will:
      6.3.5.1. Document the results from AFE item inspections to include all routine and
      TCTO inspections and modifications.
      6.3.5.2. Document results from AFE items, supply inventories, and transactions.
      6.3.5.3. Document aircraft and AFE item and maintenance actions.
      6.3.5.4. Document aircraft’s AFE items configuration loading and unloading.
      6.3.5.5. Document corrective actions from quality control inspections.
      6.3.5.6. Ensure training records are correct.
6.4. ALERTS General Areas:
   6.4.1. Requesting Modifications or New Capabilities:
      6.4.1.1. Purpose.     ALERTS serves as the single focal point program in the
      documentation of all AFE processes. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the AFE
      community, the following process will be used to manage requests for modifications and
      new ALERTS capabilities outside of the scope of the current support contract. This
      process is described below.
      6.4.1.2. Changes to Policy/Procedure Documents and or ALERTS Processes.               The
      identifying user will accomplish the following:
      6.4.1.2.1. Provide a written proposal of the complete suggested process to their
      MAJCOM FM.
          6.4.1.2.2. The MAJCOM FM will validate the need and forward the proposed
          process to the Air Force ALERTS OPR.
          6.4.1.2.3. The Air Force ALERTS OPR will forward the proposal to the support
          contractor for evaluation.
          6.4.1.2.4. The support contractor will evaluate the proposed process and determine
          the technical feasibility.
          6.4.1.2.5. If the need is technically feasible, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate and forward to all using commands for their input. MAJCOM ALERTS
          POCs have 10 working days to evaluate proposals. Negative replies are required. If
          the need applies to only the proposing command, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate the need and proceed to the next step.
             6.4.1.2.5.1. If all MAJCOMs’ POCs do not agree, the proposal will be forwarded
             to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for final resolution.
             6.4.1.2.5.2. If all ALERTS MAJCOMs’ POCs agree, the support contractor will
             determine the cost for development and implementation.
          6.4.1.2.6. Once the technical feasibility and cost analysis are received, the proposal
          will be forwarded to the APWG and APEC for final determination and a funding
          solution.
AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009                                                   59


             6.4.1.2.6.1. If approved and funding has been secured, the Air Force ALERTS
             OPR will initiate the development and implementation process.
             6.4.1.2.6.2. If disapproved, the submitting command will be notified by the Air
             Force ALERTS OPR and or the APEC of their decision and rationale for
             disapproval.
  6.4.2. Software Problem Report (SPR):
     6.4.2.1. Users will submit SPRs through the established procedures contained in
     APWEB or ALERTS websites. Users should contact their local Work Group Managers
     to validate there is not connectivity problems locally before contacting the help desk or
     submitting an SPR. There are 3 types of SPRs, which are described as follows: NOTE:
     The inability to connect or a slow response from the APWEB or ALERTS servers does
     not constitute a problem with these systems.
         6.4.2.1.1. Category 1. An identified requirement is nonfunctional.
         6.4.2.1.2. Category 2. An identified requirement is nonfunctional, but there is a valid
         work-around to accomplish a required task.
         6.4.2.1.3. Category 3. Administrative or cosmetic only and do not affect the function
         of the programs.
     6.4.2.2. Users will fill out all required information on the SPR submittal form to include
     detailed descriptions of the problem when required.
  6.4.3. AFE Automated Information Technology (AIT) Barcode Marking Standard. All AFE
  units with acquisition authority will refer to their responsibilities paragraphs contained within
  this instruction and Attachment 2 for implementing the AF AFE AIT barcode marking
  standard for AFE supplies.
  6.4.4. Standards.
     6.4.4.1. Nomenclature Standard. To ensure a common standard for nomenclatures
     within ALERTS, units will use the technical order IPBs or manufacturer’s manuals when
     establishing items. Items or equipment not addressed in IPBs, formal technical orders, or
     manuals will be assigned a nomenclature by 77 AESG or 642 CBSG.
     6.4.4.2. Air Force Kit/Aircraft Configuration Naming Standards. To ensure global data
     reporting capability, units will use the identified standards contained within ALERTS.
     Request additional templates IAW paragraph 6.4.1 of this Instruction.
     6.4.4.3. Item Supply Detail Data. All relevant data on these screens will be tracked by
     all AFE units. If the data is not available units will use the standard established below for
     all unknown data fields.
  6.4.5. Data Entry Standards:
     6.4.5.1. Within APWEB, units attempting to enter data that is unavailable will use
     ―UNK‖ for unknown text fields, and 01/01/1900 for unknown date fields. All unknown
     data fields that are not mandatory will be left blank.
     6.4.5.2. Within ALERTS, all unknown data fields not mandatory will be left blank. For
     mandatory fields, units will use the APWEB standard.
 60                               AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009


         6.4.5.3. All contract number and lot number entries must include the full contract and lot
         number and be entered into ALERTS exactly as they appear on the item. This will
         ensure there is no confusion when data is recalled.
   6.4.6. LOGIN Standard for AFE Personnel and Aircrew. LOGIN standard is case sensitive
   and includes the last name, first initial, and last six numbers of individual’s SSN. AFE units
   must scan the one-dimensional bar code on the backside of the aircrew’s military
   identification card for the ALERTS login.
   6.4.7. APWEB and ALERTS Data Protection; For Official Use Only (FOUO):
         6.4.7.1. Reports generated from APWEB/ALERTS will be considered FOUO, unless
         otherwise marked, and must be protected IAW DoD and AF instructions.
         6.4.7.2. Reports containing personnel data, i.e., SSN will have the privacy act statement
         affixed.
         6.4.7.3. Aircraft tail number location in ALERTS must use the last six digits as the
         standard (example: 99-0011). This will allow full integration of the new automated
         forecasting system and the requirements established by 84 MUSG/GJ (OO-ALC) for
         properly tracking and forecasting time change items for replacement.
      6.4.8. Configuration Data File (CDF) Process:
         6.4.8.1. The CDF established for accountable equipment items will be maintained in
         AFEMS IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable and non-accountable equipment end item
         authorizations will be documented and maintained in APWEB/ALERTS. Air Staff,
         MAJCOMs, and 77 AESG when experiencing acquisition difficulties, may direct units to
         document authorizations and on-hand quantities within these programs.
6.5. ALERTS Operations Areas:
   6.5.1. Aircraft Accident Data Records. Upon notification from a competent authority, the
   AFE superintendent, squadron system administrator, or AFE NCOIC will freeze all AFE
   records for equipment involved in a mishap. To ensure data fidelity for the safety review
   board, these records will remain frozen until such time as determined by the involved
   MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate or delegated authority. Once authority has been granted,
   the AFE superintendent will notify the contractor help desk to unfreeze the records.
   6.5.2. Data Review Requirement. AFE superintendents and NCOICs or designated
   individual will review APWEB and ALERTS to validate data accuracy every 180 days.
   6.5.3. CTK Procedures. AFE specialized equipment used on the flightline will be marked
   and managed IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   6.5.4. Equipment Accountability. ALERTS specialized equipment will be marked and
   managed IAW AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
      6.5.5. ALERTS Data Record Transfer Process:
         6.5.5.1. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
         other ALERTS enabled units will use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
AFI11-301V1_AETCSUP_12FTWSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2009                                              61


     6.5.5.2. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
     non-ALERTS enabled units will still use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
     However, the information will be stored under a general identified Personnel Accounting
     System (PAS) code until the receiving unit comes online with ALERTS. The sending
     unit will also provide paper copies of all required forms.
  6.5.6. AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, Process. AFE units with ALERTS fully
  implemented can use ALERTS in lieu of the AF IMT 1297 to transfer responsibility of the
  item. MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures as required.
  6.5.7. Contact Memory Button (CMB) Processes and Mounting. MAJCOMs will develop
  their own implementation process for units using the CMB.
  6.5.8. Interaction with Mobility Inventory Control & Accountability System (MICAS). Air
  Staff or MAJCOM will provide the APWEB or ALERTS data associated with MICAS to
  data managers when requested through these programs.
  6.5.9. Deployment and Multi-Command or Multi-Unit Operations:
     6.5.9.1. Units will use the guidance in the ALERTS user and process manuals for these
     operations. Units who do not have any ALERTS specialized equipment or are not
     connected to the ALERTS site while deployed will refer to paragraph 6.5.10 for
     documentation procedures.
     6.5.9.2. Non-ALERTS units, or units not using CMB, which service multi-place aircraft
     will preposition a copy of all AFE items inspection records on the aircraft prior to all
     deployments.
  6.5.10. Units will develop documentation procedures to update ALERTS data when
  connectivity is not available or if they do not have the necessary hardware to use ALERTS in
  the unconnected mode. This will include all maintenance actions, QA, and any other actions.
  6.5.11. DoD, Air Force and AFTO Forms/IMT, and Other Documentation (NL555, Battery
  Inspection Label) Within the Sections/Shops. Units implementing ALERTS do not have to
  use serviceability tags to identify equipment in service, storage, or otherwise used unless
  specifically required in AFMAN 23-110 or required by Air Force technical orders. Units
  will use condition code tags when turning in equipment to supply IAW AFMAN 23-110.
  MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures to distinguish
  serviceability of equipment as required.
  6.5.12. ALERTS will use a single type of inspection record for all AFE items when
  applicable.
  6.5.13. AF Form 623 (Automated). ALERTS is the primary electronic equivalent authorized
  means to provide the capability to electronically track all AFE technician training.
  MAJCOMS will develop an implementation process for using the electronic ALERTS AF
  Form 623. NOTE: TBA is an authorized AF Form 623 automated electronic equivalent
  alternative for those units that do not have access to ALERTS.

                                          Attachment 2
AIR FORCE STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)
                       BARCODE MARKING

Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code
nameplates, labels, or direct part markings IAW DoD MIL-STD-130 Change 1, DoD UID
Guide, and this document. Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D
symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated ―removal and
replace‖ features of automated programming and product support/maintenance. Exceptions to
use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance
with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel
tank, etc.). AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become
commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government
in the future.

Marking Requirements.

Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for
current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency. Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD has mandated the use of Data Matrix
ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings. Overarching guidance for the construct
and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD UID Guide
located at www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID. Specific examples are given here for manufactures and
suppliers for implementation.

AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are:

a. UID Serialized Lot Batch; Items controlled with serial numbers and lot numbers
b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only
c. Non UID/Non Serialized Lot Batch; Items that do not meet the UID requirement and are not
controlled with serial numbers.

See figures 1 – 6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams.

HRI Marking Requirements. The following HRI data is required (as a minimum):

- Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters

- Item Lot Number

           NOTE: The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s
           CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

           99,999 has been reached

- Item manufacturer’s Part Number

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement

- Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters

- Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format

           NOTE: Markings and/or attachments shall make no reference to item
           installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives.

MRI Data Construct.

Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data
Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure 2). To
facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet
zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate. The symbol’s internal module (cell)
sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).
Marks shall contain only the data elements identified below:

           NOTE: The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D
           symbol.

- (17V) Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric
characters.
