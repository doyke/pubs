1. Overview and Applicability
     1.1. In accordance with paragraph 1.3. of AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic
     Supervision, the 81st Mission Support Group commander is hereby delegated responsibility
     for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Keesler AFB.
     1.2. Additional traffic regulations may be created to address situations unique to Keesler
     AFB that are not covered by in Title 63, Mississippi State Code, Motor Vehicles and Traffic
     Regulations, AFI 31-218, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, AFMAN 31-116, Air Force
     Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, or AFI 91-207, USAF Traffic Safety Program.
     1.3. This instruction applies to anyone who operates a motor vehicle or human-powered
     vehicle on Keesler AFB.
2. Rules of the road.
     2.1. Moving violations.
        2.1.1. Driving under the influence. It is unlawful for any person to drive or otherwise
        operate a vehicle on Keesler AFB who:
             2.1.1.1. Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor
                2.1.1.1.1. Is under the influence of any other substance which has impaired such
                person's ability to operate a motor vehicle.
                2.1.1.1.2. Has an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths percent (.08%) or
                more for persons who are above the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages
                under state law, or two one-hundredths percent (.02%) or more for persons who
                are below the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages under state law, in the
                person's blood based upon grams of alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters of
KEESLERAFBI31-218 22 April 2013                                                                  3


            blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath as shown by a
            chemical analysis of such person's breath, blood or urine.
            2.1.1.1.3. Is under the influence of any drug or controlled substance, the
            possession of which is unlawful under the UCMJ or Mississippi Controlled

            as shown by a chemical analysis of such person's blood, breath or urine for
            persons operating a commercial motor vehicle.
     2.1.2. Driving while ability impaired. If the blood, breath or urine alcohol percentage
     is found to be 0.05 but less than 0.08, the driver will be presumptively impaired. This
     standard will be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the
     driver is under the influence of alcohol.
     2.1.3. Failure to obey speed limits. The maximum permissible vehicle speed on
     Keesler AFB is 25 miles per hour, unless otherwise posted. The following special speed
     limits also apply, unless hazards exist which warrant a slower speed
        2.1.3.1. The speed limit in all Military Family Housing areas is 15 miles per hour.

        Mini Mall is 35 miles per hour.
     2.1.4. Obstructing Traffic Flow. No motor vehicle shall be driven at a speed less than
     10 miles per hour under the posted speed limit where no hazard exists. An exception to
     this requirement shall be recognized when reduced speed is necessary for safe operation
     due to hazards, when a vehicle cannot be safely operated at the posted speed limit, or
     when drivers are so directed by Security Forces personnel.
     2.1.5. Failure to obey traffic control devices or signs. No driver of a vehicle shall
     disobey the instructions of any official traffic-control device, unless at the time otherwise
     directed by a security forces member. This includes, but is not limited to: stop signs,
     one-way street signs, yield signs, et cetera. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-
     control signals exhibiting different colored lights successively one (1) at a time, the lights

4                                                       KEESLERAFBI31-218 22 April 2013


       2.1.5.1. Green signal: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight
       through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn.
       However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
       pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.
       Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or
       unmarked crosswalk.
       2.1.5.2. Yellow when shown following the green signal: Vehicular traffic facing the
       signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection, but if such
       stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the
       intersection. Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
       insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall
       yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
       2.1.5.3. Red signal or stop sign: Vehicular traffic facing the signal or sign shall stop
       before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may
       be indicated by a clearly visible line.
           2.1.5.3.1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the
           intersection to turn right after stopping; unless a sign stating "No Turn on Red" is
           in place prohibiting such a turn.
           2.1.5.3.2. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
           lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic lawfully using
           the intersection.
           2.1.5.3.3. Stop is defined as the vehicle coming to a complete halt with no
           forward motion.
       2.1.5.4. Red signal with green arrow: Vehicular traffic facing such signal may
       cautiously enter the intersection only to make movement indicated by such arrow but
       shall not interfere with other traffic or endanger pedestrians lawfully within a
       crosswalk. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do
       so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
       2.1.5.5. Flashing yellow (caution signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated with
       rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or
       past such signal only with caution.
       2.1.5.6. Yield signs. The driver shall reduce the speed of the vehicle and shall yield
       the right of way to other vehicles that have entered the intersecting roadway either
       from the right or left or which are approaching so closely on said intersecting
       roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard. The driver may proceed at such time
       as a safe interval occurs.
       2.1.5.7. Instrument Landing System lights. All traffic will come to complete and full
       stop when the Instrument Landing System Warning/Signal lights are red. These
       systems are located on Ploesti Drive North of 1st Street near the softball fields, on
       Polesti Drive across from Marina Park and at north exit of Marina Park.
    2.1.6. Failure to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks or inter. Where traffic control
    signals are not in place or in operation, the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way,
KEESLERAFBI31-218 22 April 2013                                                                   5


     slowing down or stopping if need be to so yield to a pedestrian crossing the roadway
     within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection.
     Whenever any vehicle is stopped at a marked crosswalk or at any unmarked crosswalk at
     an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the roadway, the driver of any other vehicle
     approaching from the rear shall not overtake and pass the stopped vehicle.
     2.1.7. Vehicles must stop when approaching an active marching formation or closer than
     50 ft. It is unlawful to pass a marching formation.
     2.1.8. Failure to yield to emergency vehicles. Upon the immediate approach of an
     authorized emergency vehicle, when the driver is giving a visual or audible signal by
     flashing lights, siren, exhaust whistle, or bell, the driver of every other vehicle shall yield
     the right-of-way and shall immediately drive to a position parallel to, and as close as
     possible to, the right-hand edge or curb of the roadway clear of any intersection and shall
     stop and remain in such position until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed,
     except when otherwise directed by a security forces member. This section is not intended
     to relieve the drivers of authorized emergency vehicles of the duty to drive with due
     regard for the safety of all persons using the roadway.
     2.1.9. Failure to obey Security Forces personnel. Any driver of a motor vehicle
     willfully flees or otherwise attempts to elude any security forces member is subject to
     having his/her installation driving privileges suspended for no more than one year.
     2.1.10. Failure to signal lane change, turn, or decrease of speed. No person shall turn
     a vehicle from a direct course unless and until such movement can be made with
     reasonable safety and then only after signaling.
        2.1.10.1. Drivers will give a signal of intention to turn left or right for a reasonable
        distance before turning.
        2.1.10.2. No driver shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of a vehicle without
        first giving an appropriate signal to the driver of any vehicle immediately to the rear
        when there is opportunity to react to such signal.
     2.1.11. Failure to maintain single lane of traffic. A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as
     practical entirely within a single lane. In the event of road hazards, the vehicle shall not
     be moved from the lane of traffic until the driver has first determined that such movement
     can be safely made.
     2.1.12. Improper overtaking and passing another vehicle. Unless prohibited by
     roadway markings, the driver of a vehicle may overtake and, allowing sufficient
     clearance, pass another vehicle proceeding in the same direction either upon the left or
     upon the right on a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for four (4)
     or more lanes of moving traffic when such movement can be made in safety. The left lane
     shall be the preferred passing lane. No person shall drive off the pavement or upon the
     shoulder of the roadway overtaking or passing on the right.
     2.1.13. Following too closely. The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another
     vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of
     such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the roadway.
6                                                       KEESLERAFBI31-218 22 April 2013


       2.1.14. Careless driving. Any person who drives any vehicle in a careless or imprudent
       manner, without due regard for the width, grade, curves, corner, traffic and use of the
       streets and highways and all other attendant circumstances is guilty of careless driving.
       Careless driving shall be considered a lesser offense than reckless driving.
       2.1.15. Reckless driving. Any person who drives any vehicle in such a manner as to
       indicate either a willful or a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property is
       guilty of reckless driving. Reckless driving shall be considered a greater offense than
       careless driving.
          2.1.15.1. Speed contests and exhibitions are prohibited on the roadways of Keesler
          AFB. Speed exhibitions include intentional breaking of traction when cornering or

          or exhibitions will be charged with reckless driving.
       2.1.16. Driving off road. Unless hazards exist, vehicles operated on Keesler AFB will
       only be driven on paved surfaces unless in the performance of official duty or as directed
       otherwise by a Security Forces member.

       documents:
          2.2.1.1. A valid and current state or international drivers license applicable to the
          class of vehicle being driven. Licenses suspended or revoked in any jurisdiction are
          not considered valid.
          2.2.1.2. Proof of current vehicle registration. Vehicle registration and tag must match
          the vehicle in question.
          2.2.1.3. Proof of valid insurance consisting of an insurance card which has a policy

       effectively setting the brake and turning the front wheels to the curb or side of the
       roadway.
KEESLERAFBI31-218 22 April 2013                                                                 7
