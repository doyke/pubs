                                   FLIGHT OPERATIONS

3.1. Airspace.
   3.1.1. Class C Airspace. Fairchild AFB Class C Airspace (Attachment 4) includes airspace
   extending upward from the surface up to and including 6,400’ MSL within a 5 NM radius of
   Fairchild AFB and airspace extending upward from 3,700’ MSL up to and including 6,400’
   MSL, within a 10 NM radius of the airport. It excludes airspace within the Spokane
   International Airport Class C Airspace east of a line bisecting the area where the 10 NM
   radius of Fairchild AFB Class C Airspace intersects the 10 NM radius of Spokane
   International Airport Class C Airspace. Spokane Approach Control is the controlling agency
   for both Fairchild AFB and Spokane International Airport Class C Airspace, with the
   exception of airspace delegated to Fairchild Control Tower (see below). Note: Fairchild
   Tower’s Class C airspace is based off the geographical center of the runway.
   3.1.2. Control Tower Airspace (Attachment 5). Spokane Approach Control delegates
   control of certain airspace within the Fairchild AFB Class C surface area to Fairchild Control
   Tower. This airspace is defined as all airspace north of a line ½ mile south of Runway 05/23
   and the extended Runway 05/23 centerline within a 5 NM radius of Fairchild AFB, up to and
   including 4,500’ MSL.
3.2. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Areas.
   3.2.1. Fixed Wing FCF Area. This area is bordered by a line from Fairchild AFB west to
   Coulee City (SKA Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) 249/66), northeast to Electric City
   (SKA TACAN 269/59), east to Deer Park (SKA TACAN 360/21), and southwest to Fairchild
   AFB. Pilots will continuously monitor Spokane Approach Control or Seattle Center
   frequency for ATC service. The alternate FCF area is AR-717. Use of AR-717 must be
   coordinated with the scheduling agency by 92 OSS/OSOF.
   3.2.2. Helicopter North Functional Check Flight Area Alpha (NFCFA) (Attachment 7).
   The NFCFA includes the airspace from the surface to 3500’ MSL (up to 4500’ MSL may be
   requested and approved based on other traffic) in an area bounded by a line from the
   intersection of Highway 2 and Dover Road, north to a point 5 Distance Measuring
   Equipment (DME) from the SKA TACAN; then southwest along the 5 DME arc to its
   intersection with Highway 2, and then east along Highway 2 to the starting point
   3.2.3. Helicopter North Functional Check Flight Area Bravo (NFCFB). The NFCFB area
   includes the airspace from the surface to 4500’ MSL based on other traffic in an area
   bounded by the 324 radial at 012 DME (N47 48.50 W 117 45.00), East to the 340 radial at
   012 DME (N47 48.50 W 117 40.00), South to the 349 radial at 0008 DME (N47 45.00 W
   117 38.00), West to the 318 radial at 009 DME (N47 45.00 W117 45.00), then back North to
   the 324/012. All radials and DME are off the Fairchild TACAN.
3.3. Civil/Foriegn Aircraft Use.
   3.3.1. Civil aircraft are not permitted to land at Fairchild AFB except as permitted by AFI
   10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft
 26                                           FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


   Use of Air Force Airfields. For civil aircraft landings, a DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft
   Landing Permit, must be executed and on file in Airfield Management.
   3.3.2. Civil aircraft may conduct practice approaches at Fairchild AFB provided no undue
   delay exists to military aircraft. Civil aircraft cannot make touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or
   full-stop landings unless authorized by Airfield Management or an emergency exists.
   3.3.3. Foreign government aircraft operating at USAF airfields must comply with procedures
   in AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States Air Force
   Installations, and have an approved aircraft landing authorization number (ALAN) prior to
   use, except for emergencies. NOTE: Foreign government aircraft PPR procedures are
   covered in OSAA OI 13-204, Airfield Management, Chapter 17.
3.4. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   3.4.1. Pattern altitudes are as follows:
   3.4.2. Overhead Traffic Pattern. Aircraft will be vectored to "initial" at 4,200’ MSL by
   Approach Control. Aircraft will break right on Runway 23 and left on Runway 5
   (Attachment 6).
   3.4.3. VFR Rectangular Traffic Pattern. Aircraft operating in the VFR rectangular pattern
   (closed traffic) will make right turns to Runway 23 and left turns to Runway 5 (Attachment
   6).
      3.4.3.1. High-performance (fighter type) aircraft: 4,200’ MSL
      3.4.3.2. Helicopters: 3,000’ MSL
      3.4.3.3. All other aircraft: 3,700’ MSL Note: Due to the close proximity of Spokane
      International Airport, all Fairchild AFB traffic patterns are flown to the northwest of the
      runway only. Base-assigned helicopters may conduct runway operations to and from the
      STA as traffic permits.
3.5. Weather Minimums for VFR Patterns.
   3.5.1. Ceiling shall be at least 500’ above the applicable pattern altitude. EXCEPTION:
   Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) helicopters may operate in the closed pattern at an
   altitude that allows the pilot to maintain SVFR. Controllers will ensure SVFR requirements
   are maintained IAW FAAO 7110.65, 7-5-all, the Reduced Separation for SVFR Helicopters
   LOA, and Paragraph 3.9.7. Pattern altitude weather minimums are as follows:
      3.5.1.1. High-performance (fighter type) aircraft: min. ceiling 2,200’ AGL
      3.5.1.2. Helicopters: min. ceiling 1,000’ AGL
      3.5.1.3. All other aircraft: min. ceiling 1,700’ AGL
   3.5.2. Anytime weather conditions limit a controller’s ability to maintain visual contact with
   an aircraft, the Control Tower Watch Supervisor will close the compromised pattern
   (regardless of the reported weather) until the Watch Supervisor determines the weather
   conditions allow safe pattern operations.
FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              27


3.6. Radar Traffic Patterns. Spokane Approach Control has control over Fairchild’s Radar
Traffic Pattern. Aircraft operating in the radar traffic pattern will do so at the following altitudes
or as directed by Approach Control (see Attachment 6).
   3.6.1. Fixed-wing aircraft: 5,000’ MSL.
   3.6.2. Helicopters: 4,000’ MSL.
3.7. Radar Vector to Initial Procedure. Requests from IFR aircraft for an overhead approach
shall be made with Spokane approach control. If approved, aircraft will be sequenced to a five-
mile initial unless otherwise coordinated.
3.8. Availability/Restrictions for Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Precision
Approach Radar (PAR) Approaches/Monitoring. Not available at Fairchild AFB.
3.9. Special Procedures (Helicopter, Functional Check Flight, Paradrop Operations).
   3.9.1. Helicopter Operating Areas.
       3.9.1.1. The South Training Area (STA). The STA is designated as those portions of the
       Fairchild Class C and Spokane Class C surface areas from the surface up to and including
       3000’ MSL, bounded on the northwest by a line parallel to and 500’ southeast of the edge
       of Runway 5/23, from the intersection of Craig and McFarlane Roads to Brooks Road; on
       the west by a line south along Brooks Road, continuing to the center of Medical Lake
       Hospital; on the south by a line along Lake Street in the town of Medical Lake, to the
       western edge of Silver Lake; on the southeast by a line northwest to the Federal
       Communications Commission monitoring station; and then back along Craig Road to its
       intersection with McFarlane Road, as depicted in Attachment 7.
       3.9.1.2. The Hoist Operations Area (HOA). The following coordinates define the HOA:
       N 47 35’ 05.86” W 117 37’ 45.18”, N 47 35’ 33.41” W 117 37; 45.18”, N 47 35; 33.41”
       W 117 39’ 09.39”, N 47 36’ 44.90” W 117 39’ 09.38”, as depicted in Attachment 8.
   3.9.2. Helipad/Helicopter Landing areas. Control Tower cannot provide positive control for
   helicopter operations at areas other than Helipad 1. At locations other than Helipad 1, pilots
   are responsible for ensuring that areas are clear before requesting clearance for departure and
   landings. Control Tower may allow the operations at the pilot's own risk. The helicopter
   takeoff and landing areas are:
       3.9.2.1. Helipad 1 is located on Taxiway Papa between the Taxiway Golf and Taxiway
       Hotel. Take off parallel to the runway unless otherwise requested due to winds or to
       avoid taxiing aircraft. Helipad 1 is restricted to daytime, VFR use only due to the
       lighting configuration on Helipad 1.
       3.9.2.2. STA. Helicopters will avoid flying over Control Tower and Survival School
       while in the STA. Helicopters may land and takeoff, at their own risk, in the STA
       without coordination with the tower, unless otherwise directed by ATC.
       3.9.2.3. Hoist Operations Landing Area is located in the STA next to Survival School.
       Pilots are responsible for clearing the area before takeoff or landing. Takeoff and landing
       clearances will not be issued. Operations will be conducted at the pilot’s own risk.
28                                         FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


  3.9.3. Helicopter Departures. If a helicopter is departing the area from Taxilane Juliet, “The
  Ladder” (Taxilane Juliet between Taxiway Foxtrot and Taxiway Golf), or from Skid Row
  (the helicopter parking area next to hangar 1005) the following procedures will apply:
     3.9.3.1. Helicopters departing west – northwest – north bound from The Ladder, Skid
     row do not need to hold for wake turbulence after a heavy aircraft departure. The
     helicopter must request to depart west-northwest – north bound and Control Tower must
     approve the departure as west –northwest – north bound only.
EXAMPLE: “ON DEPARTURE PROCEED WESTBOUND (OR NORTHWEST/NORTH
BOUND), DEPARTURE FROM SKID ROW WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK, USE CAUTION.
WIND (direction) AT (velocity)” (any additional information as necessary).
  3.9.4. Communications. Helicopters will continuously monitor Control Tower frequencies
  while operating in the STA or Fairchild designated airspace.
  3.9.5. Communications Failure (VFR Aircraft).        Helicopters unable to contact Control
  Tower due to radio problems will:
     3.9.5.1. When north of the runway, make an approach to Helipad 1 from the northwest,
     flash the landing light, watch for light-gun signals and wait for Control Tower to give a
     green light indicating the helicopter is cleared to land at Helipad 1.
     3.9.5.2. When south of the runway, hover west of Control Tower, flash the landing light,
     watch for light gun signals, and wait for Control Tower to give a green light indicating
     clearance for the helicopter to land on Helipad 1.
  3.9.6. Parachute Training. Day and night parachute activities may be conducted on the
  airfield with the following provisions:
     3.9.6.1. The primary helicopter Drop Zone (DZ) is the Fairchild DZ, which encompasses
     the runway from Taxiways D to A, extending north to include the parallel taxiway and to
     the south in front of Control Tower to a line parallel to the fenced portion of the survival
     school. Additionally, the Ellington DZ located within the STA may be used. Other
     aircraft operations may experience ATC delays, as published in the IFR Supplement (or
     by NOTAM if other than published), to non-helicopter activity during scheduled
     parachute operations.
     3.9.6.2. Periodically, the 336th Training Group Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and
     Escape (336 TRG/SERE) conducts parachute operations for training on the airfield.
     Parachute operations for training could include altitudes up to 12,000’ MSL.
     3.9.6.3. The 336 TRG/SERE will request, through Airfield Management, posting of a
     NOTAM for other than published jumps NLT 72 hours prior to the event. The published
     or NOTAM window will not normally be extended.
     3.9.6.4. Prior to the actual parachute operation, the aircrew will coordinate the desired
     altitude with Fairchild Control Tower and will notify the Control Tower one minute prior
     to streamer or jumper drop. After deployment aircrew will notify Control Tower
     (Example: “Streamers (or jumpers) away”) and state number of jumpers deployed. The
     aircrew will coordinate with the Control Tower prior to each sequence and will notify
     Control Tower when parachute operations are complete.
FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         29


     3.9.6.5. Fairchild DZ Only. Prior to streamer or jumper drop, Control Tower will
     suspend runway operations until the jumpers have vacated the CMA and Airfield
     Management completes the runway check. The DZ party will recover the streamers and
     may request assistance from Airfield Management personnel recover the streamers.
     3.9.6.6. Helicopters utilizing the STA during parachute operations on the Fairchild DZ
     shall be restricted to east of the Control Tower from the time jumpers have left the
     aircraft and until all jumpers are safely on the ground.
     3.9.6.7. If at any time a jumper strays out of the designated DZ in use, Control Tower
     shall take immediate action to direct the helicopter to the far eastern side of the STA.
     Control Tower shall issue traffic on jumpers until the helicopter reports them in sight or
     they are no longer a factor.
  3.9.7. Helicopter Special VFR Procedures.
     3.9.7.1. No more than four helicopters may operate SVFR in the STA and FTA at one
     time, with no more than two in any one area and only if all aircraft can maintain visual
     separation from each other.
     3.9.7.2. Request clearance from Control Tower for entry into and departure from
     designated areas.
     3.9.7.3. Helicopter SVFR operations will remain within the confines of the designated
     airspace.
     3.9.7.4. Control Tower shall issue arriving and departing traffic information to
     helicopters conducting SVFR operations in the STA in sufficient time to permit required
     pilot action. When helicopters are operating SVFR in the STA or Fairchild designated
     airspace, and visual separation cannot be maintained, helicopters will be instructed to
     land and remain on the ground until other separation can be applied or traffic is no longer
     a factor.
     3.9.7.5. SVFR helicopters are responsible for maintaining visual reference to the surface
     and avoiding the fixed wing traffic pattern.
  3.9.8. Hoist Operations. The 36 RQF has a requirement to conduct hoist operations at the
  HOA area as part of USAF Survival School student training. In order for helicopter aircraft
  to air taxi to HOA area for hoist operations, the weather minimums must be IAW AFI 11-
  2UH-1NV3, UH-1N Helicopter Operating Procedures. The 36 RQF will comply with the
  following procedures when conducting hoist operations:
     3.9.8.1. Request approval from ground control to air taxi to the HOA at or below 100’
     AGL to conduct hoist operations.
     3.9.8.2. Maintain visual reference to the surface while air taxiing and avoid over flight of
     aircraft holding in position on the runway or taxing.
     3.9.8.3. Advise ground control when hoist operations have begun and when operations
     are completed.
  3.9.9. Autorotations: Autorotations are Practice Precautionary Approaches conducted
  helicopters which simulate engine failure.
 30                                           FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


       3.9.9.1. Pilots requiring autorotation approaches shall make request through Control
       Tower.
       3.9.9.2. If an altitude deviation is required from the normal helicopter pattern (3000’
       MSL), the pilot will make a request for the deviation no later than crosswind turn and
       before passing 3000’ MSL. Approval will be based on traffic conditions, weather, etc.
       3.9.9.3. If an altitude deviation is not required, the pilot will state “autorotation” in their
       base turn call to Control Tower. A landing (or any option) clearance issued by Control
       Tower is approval for the operation.
       3.9.9.4. Traffic and sequencing will be issued in the same manner as any other aircraft
       operating within Class C Airspace.
       3.9.9.5. Autorotations will not be terminated by Control Tower once the helicopter
       makes base turn. Autorotations, conducted to the runway, will normally be executed to a
       low approach; however, a pilot may request a full stop landing. Autorotations, conducted
       to a taxiway, will be executed to a full stop.
       3.9.9.6. DELETED.
3.10. Protection of the Overhead Traffic Pattern. During VFR conditions, Tower will
instruct all aircraft conducting departures, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, and low approach landings
to remain at or below 3,700 until departure end of the runway for protection of the overhead
pattern. Tower shall issue the following to all IFR departing aircraft: “(ACID), maintain at or
below 3,700 until departure end of the runway, overhead in use (traffic information).”
3.11. Local Aircraft Priorities.
   3.11.1. ATC will provide service to aircraft operating at Fairchild AFB in the following
   order of precedence:
       3.11.1.1. Alert departures/National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) (non-exercise).

3.13. Same Runway Opposite-Direction Procedures. The following minima apply to all
aircraft utilizing the same runway:
   3.13.1. Arrival versus Arrival: An arrival shall not proceed closer than 10-mile final until the
   opposing arrival inside of 10 miles has made a full stop, or executed missed approach,
   climbed out, and turned to avert conflict.
   3.13.2. Arrival versus Departure: An arrival shall not proceed closer than 10-mile final from
   the time an opposing departure is released, airborne, and turned away from the final approach
   course.
   3.13.3. Departure versus Arrival: A departure shall not become airborne from the time an
   opposing arrival reaches 10-mile final, lands, or executes a missed approach and climbs out
   passed the runway end.
3.14. Restricted Low Approaches. When personnel or equipment are on the runway, Tower
may authorize restricted low approaches at or above 3,000’ MSL (500’ AGL) to locally assigned
heavy aircraft. Transient heavy aircraft will be assigned 3,500’ MSL (1,000’ AGL).
3.15. Standard Breakout/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   3.15.1. Breakout Procedures. Due to the close proximity of Spokane International Airport
   there is no standard break out procedure for Fairchild AFB. Spokane Approach Control will
   issue break out instructions based on existing traffic conditions.
   3.15.2. Aircraft instructed by Control Tower to "go-around" while operating in the VFR
   rectangular or the overhead pattern will climb and maintain the appropriate rectangular
   pattern altitude paragraph 3.4, unless instructed otherwise by ATC.
   3.15.3. Aircraft instructed to "go-around" while conducting an instrument approach will
   maintain at or below 3,700 feet MSL and fly runway heading until reaching the departure
   end of the runway, and then will execute the published missed approach procedure or comply
   with standard abbreviated climb out instructions, unless instructed otherwise by ATC.
   Aircraft without two-way communication capability will remain with Control Tower and
   enter closed traffic following a "go-around," weather permitting; otherwise aircraft will
   comply with lost-communications procedures in paragraph 4.12.
   3.15.4. Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, missed approach procedures will be flown as
   published.

                               EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

4.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). Control Tower will activate the PCAS or "Crash
Phone" on all declared and observed aircraft and airfield emergencies, including exercise inputs.
Note: If the PCAS is out of service, Tower will notify Airfield Management via landline, and
Airfield Management will activate the Secondary Crash Net (SCN), relay that PCAS is out of
service OTS, and forward the pertinent emergency information.
   4.1.1. Members on the PCAS are:
       4.1.1.1. Tower.
       4.1.1.2. Airfield Management.
       4.1.1.3. Ambulance Services and Medical Control Center (when activated).
       4.1.1.4. Fire Department.
   4.1.2. The Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller shall ensure activation of the primary crash
   system in the following situations:
       4.1.2.1. In-flight/Ground Emergencies.
       4.1.2.2. Unauthorized aircraft movement (Hijack).
       4.1.2.3. Unsafe weapons or external stores not visible to the pilot.
       4.1.2.4. Aircraft accident.
       4.1.2.5. Bomb threat.
       4.1.2.6. Control Tower evacuation.
       4.1.2.7. Disaster preparedness exercises (unless otherwise coordinated).
       4.1.2.8. When an aircraft reports hot brakes after landing or during taxi operations.
   4.1.3. PCAS Information. Control Tower transmits the following information via the
   primary crash phone upon receipt (normally, the first three items listed are necessary to
   activate the crash phone): type of emergency (ground, in-flight, exercise input), nature of
   emergency, type aircraft/call sign, pilot's intentions, number of persons on board, fuel
   remaining in pounds or minutes, estimated time of arrival, runway of intended landing, wind
   information, type of hazardous cargo on board, and any necessary additional information.
   4.1.4. After information is transmitted, Control Tower will conduct a roll call of all agencies
   with transmit capability on the PCAS. Agencies will acknowledge receipt of information by
   providing operator initials and hanging up the PCAS immediately. Unless the emergency or
   exercise situation necessitates additional PCAS activation, Control Tower will use the regular
   telephone system and FM radio nets to relay additional non-urgent information
       4.1.4.1. If Ambulance Services does not answer the PCAS, they will be contacted by Fire
       Department dispatch IAW 92 MGI 41-28, Ambulance Services.
FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        35


   4.1.5. Tower will monitor crash net (from activation to emergency termination) and relay
   any additional information to the on-scene commander.
4.2. Secondary Crash Net. After Control Tower passes information over the PCAS, Airfield
Management will ring out the SCN with all pertinent information.
   4.2.1. Members on the SCN are:
       4.2.1.1. Fire Department
       4.2.1.2. Weather
       4.2.1.3. Security Forces
       4.2.1.4. Command Post
       4.2.1.5. Ambulance Services
       4.2.1.6. MOC
       4.2.1.7. Transportation
       4.2.1.8. Mission Support Group Commander (MSG/CC)
       4.2.1.9. Safety
       4.2.1.10. Emergency Management
       4.2.1.11. 36 RQF
       4.2.1.12. EOD
       4.2.1.13. Civil Engineering Heavy Equipment
4.3. Daily PCAS/SCN Check. To ensure both systems are fully operational, Control Tower
and Airfield Management will check the crash phone system.
   4.3.1. The Control Tower shall check the primary crash net daily between 0645-0715L.
   Agencies that have transmit capability will acknowledge the daily PCAS check by stating the
   quality of the transmission received (i.e. “loud and clear”), and providing operator initials
   before hanging up the phone.
   4.3.2. Airfield Management shall check the SCN daily between 0800-0830L. Additionally,
   a check of the alternate SCN is completed on the first Wednesday of the month. Crash net
   checks taking place during times other than those above must be coordinated prior to
   activation. The procedures in paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 apply to all agencies on the SCN
   during activation of the system. Airfield Management may activate the SCN without prior
   activation of the PCAS to relay urgent information concerning aircraft or airfield operations
   as required. Airfield Management will notify the Control Tower any time the SCN is
   activated without prior activation of the PCAS.
4.4. Emergency Response Procedures. Fairchild’s emergency response procedures are
outlined in the FairchildAFB Operations (OPLAN) 10-2, Emergency Management and
FairchildAFB PLAN 91-204, Mishap Response Plan. These publications document the
procedures or on and off base in-flight/ground emergencies and the responsibilities of the on-
scene commander.

4.5. Hot Brake Procedures. The hot brake areas are located at both runway hammerheads.
Pilots suspecting hot brakes will notify Control Tower and taxi to the nearest hot brakes area.
Pilots will follow directions of Fire Department and Aircraft Maintenance personnel. Fire
department in coordination will establish a cordon to ensure the safety of other aircraft and
personnel.
4.6. Hot Gun/Hung Ordnance Procedures.
   4.6.1. Hot Gun: When an aircraft reporting "hot gun" is inbound for landing, the Control
   Tower will activate the PCAS. Runway will be closed after the aircraft lands and until
   released by the On-Scene Commander (OSC). Whenever possible, the aircraft will land on
   Runway 23. Aircraft landing with a hot gun (i.e. jammed or otherwise malfunctioning
   weapon) will be instructed to make a full stop landing and roll-out to a complete stop on the
   runway without making any turns on the ground (i.e. remain runway heading). The aircraft
   will not be issued taxi clearances which would require a turn off the runway until approved to
   do so by the OSC. Aircraft landing on Runway 5 will be instructed to back taxi on the
   runway to Taxiway Alpha with a right 180 degree turn.
   4.6.2. Hung Ordnance: When an aircraft reporting "hung ordnance" is inbound for landing,
   the Control Tower will activate the PCAS. Aircraft landing with hung ordnance (i.e. bomb-
   type, fuel tanks, and other non-forward firing stores) will be instructed to make a full stop
   landing and taxi to designated de-arming area on Taxiway Alpha. Aircraft landing with
   forward firing hung ordnance (i.e. missiles) will comply with procedures in paragraph 4.6.1
   with respect to turns after landing. Whenever possible, the aircraft will land on Runway 23,
   exit the runway at Taxiway Alpha, and hold there until cleared by the on scene commander
   to continue taxiing. Aircraft landing on Runway 5 will be instructed to back taxi on the
   runway to Taxiway Alpha. Note: Restricting aircraft with hot guns or forward-firing hung
   ordnance from making turns away from runway heading is intended to minimize the potential
   for damage to base assets which could result from a weapon misfire. Reference: Fairchild
   AFBI 91-201, Weapons Safety Program.
4.7. Aircraft Bomb Threat. Aircraft suspected of having a bomb onboard will use the
following procedures unless otherwise directed by the OSC:
   4.7.1. Whenever possible, arriving aircraft will land on Runway 23, exit the runway at
   Taxiway Alpha, and hold there until cleared by the OSC to continue taxiing.
   4.7.2. Aircraft landing on Runway 05 will back-taxi on the runway to Taxiway Alpha.
   4.7.3. Relay all requests for Explosive Detection K-9 Teams to the CP and the Weapons
   Safety Office. The CP will notify SFS.
4.8. Emergency Locator Transmitters. Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) may be
tested during the first five minutes of the hour for no more than three audible sweeps. All other
ELT signals must be handled as an emergency, regardless of duration, as follows:
   4.8.1. Control Tower will notify Airfield Management immediately upon receipt of an ELT.
   4.8.2. Airfield Management will:
       4.8.2.1. Check the local aerodrome for the transmission source (MOC, Survival School,
       Aircrew Life Support, etc.) if the signal appears to be coming from the base.
FAIRCHILDAFBI13-201 11 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           37


       4.8.2.2. Forward periodic progress reports on locating and silencing errant signals to
       Control Tower and Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).
       4.8.2.3. If the source cannot be located, activate the secondary crash net and initiate
       search and rescue operations if appropriate. Reference: FAAO 7110.65, Chapter 10.
4.9. Runway Use During Emergencies.
   4.9.1. All emergency vehicles must receive approval from Control Tower prior to entering
   the CMA. Vehicles will hold short of the runway and request permission from Control
   Tower to enter/cross the runway.
   4.9.2. Fairchild Control Tower will give priority to emergency response vehicles and
   suspend runway operations when:
       4.9.2.1. An aircraft accident occurs on or in the immediate vicinity of the airfield. For
       the purpose of this instruction, the "immediate vicinity" of the airfield is defined as any
       location, on or off base, where safety of other aircraft could be potentially jeopardized as
       a result of the accident site (i.e. approach and departure zones) as determined by the
       Control Tower Watch Supervisor and/or Airfield Management. Note: An aircraft
       accident can involve smoke, flame, toxic fumes, explosions and other phenomena which
       could be considered hazardous to nearby aircraft.
       4.9.2.2. An inbound emergency aircraft lands. EXCEPTION: Emergency fuel and
       physiological emergencies will not automatically result in runway suspension.
       4.9.2.3. A safety hazard is observed on the runway or in a location, which could
       potentially jeopardize flight safety.
       4.9.2.4. An aircraft is disabled on the runway for mechanical or other reason and requires
       assistance to exit the runway.
   4.9.3. Suspend runway operations until a FOD check is completed. Control Tower will not
   resume normal operations until authorized by Airfield Management.
   4.9.4. Control Tower personnel will suspend runway operations when applicable and advise
   Airfield Management. Airfield Management will respond to the runway to resume
   operations once the issue has been corrected. Airfield Management will issue required
   NOTAMS when applicable. Note: Airfield Management must temporarily suspend/close
   runway operations when any unsafe condition affects runway operations (e.g. FOD, bird
   condition, snow removal, airfield construction, pavement repair, etc.).                The
   suspension/closure announcement will be accompanied with the time runway operations are
   expected to resume. Airfield Management will complete an airfield check and report the
   airfield status/runway condition prior to resuming operations. Suspensions are very short in
   duration such as responses to in-flight emergencies, FOD, bird conditions. Closures are
   normally for extended periods such as snow removal operations and construction/repair
   activities.
4.10. Control Tower Evacuation. Fairchild AFB is not equipped with alternate facilities for air
traffic control operations in the event the Control Tower is evacuated or otherwise not
operational.
   4.10.1. Evacuate Fairchild Control Tower when any of the following conditions exist:

       4.10.1.1. Sustained wind velocity or gusts exceed 70 knots. Wind velocity may be
       determined using any of the available wind sensors. If this occurs 92 CES will
       accomplish an infrastructure evaluation to determine the building is safe for occupation.
       4.10.1.2. Fire, smoke, fumes, or natural disaster threatens the Control Tower and/or
       tower personnel.
       4.10.1.3. A bomb threat against the Control Tower has been received.
   4.10.2. Prior to evacuation, time permitting, Control Tower personnel will:
       4.10.2.1. Broadcast on all air traffic control frequencies (to include emergency and ATIS
       frequencies) that Fairchild AFB Control Tower is being evacuated and runway operations
       are suspended. All airborne aircraft shall be advised to contact Spokane Approach
       Control for further instructions. All taxiing aircraft shall be advised to return to parking
       and contact CP.
       4.10.2.2. Activate the PCAS. Note: If unable to complete the evacuation checklist,
       Control Tower will contact Airfield Management via telephone.
   4.10.3. Upon notification of Control Tower evacuation, Airfield Management will:
       4.10.3.1. Notify Spokane Approach Control when the Fairchild Control Tower

       4.10.3.3. Issue the following NOTAM: “Fairchild AFB Control Tower has been
       evacuated and the airfield is closed. Contact Command Post for further instructions.”
4.11. Airfield Management Facility Evacuation. In the event Airfield Management is
required to evacuate they will relocate to the alternate Airfield Management facility, Bldg. 2005,
Room 126D. The alternate facility is stand up ready and is checked weekly to ensure all
equipment is operational. Airfield Management will also be in the AM vehicle to meet inbound
transient crews and respond to airfield needs. Equipment located in the alternate facility:
   4.11.1. Computer and printer for AISR flight planning, NOTAMS and AF FORM 3616 use
   4.11.2. Phone lines (same as primary AM) rings in both locations
   4.11.3. Fax machine to receive flight plans (CP will advise both home station and transient
   aircrew or the evacuation and contact numbers)
   4.11.4. Alternate SCN tested the first Wednesday of each month.
   4.11.5. Hand held radios will be taken as part of the evacuation.
4.12. Lost Communication/Minimum Communication Procedures.
   4.12.1. In the event an aircraft loses two-way communication capability, aircrew should take
   the following actions regardless of phase of flight or weather conditions:
       4.12.1.1. Adjust transponder to reply on MODE A/3, code 7600 (communications failure
       code).
       4.12.1.2. Monitor NAVAID voice features, if available.

  nor receive) capability will execute the following procedures depending on weather
  conditions, and phase of flight:
     4.12.2.1. IFR under radar control (Attachment 9):
     4.12.2.2. In Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC): Maintain VMC; maintain visual
     separation from all observed traffic; land as soon as practicable.
     4.12.2.3. In Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC):
        4.12.2.3.1. On initial departure: Execute published missed approach procedure or
        proceed direct KNOCK; conduct a minimum of one turn in holding at KNOCK
        maintaining 6000’ MSL; execute one ILS or TACAN approach as published for the
        runway in use; "IDENT" when departing KNOCK.
        4.12.2.3.2. In radar pattern: Establish aircraft on radar downwind, maintain 5000‘
        MSL; intercept published portion of ILS or TACAN approach for the runway in use
        (14 DME arc in all cases); execute remaining portion of published approach.
        4.12.2.3.3. Enroute to Fairchild AFB: Proceed via remaining portion of flight plan
        route (or direct if "SKA" is not part of the filed or cleared route) to SKA TACAN at
        last assigned altitude; proceed direct KNOCK (do not descend until reaching
        KNOCK); conduct a minimum of one turn in holding at KNOCK maintaining 6000’
        MSL; execute one ILS or TACAN approach as published for the runway in use;
        "IDENT" when departing KNOCK. Note: Use of the transponder "IDENT" function
        when departing KNOCK is intended to advise ATC that the lost-comm. aircraft is
        commencing the published approach.
     4.12.2.4. VFR under tower control: Continue flight on established traffic pattern ground
     track; maintain VMC; maintain visual separation from all observed traffic; land as soon
     as practicable. Note: Whether conducting an instrument approach or operating in the
     VFR traffic patterns, lost communication aircraft are expected to perform one approach
     to a full stop landing. Once established on final, aircraft should watch for appropriate
     light signal from the tower. Standard go-around procedures apply (see paragraph 3.15).
     Reference: AIM Chapter 6; Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91
  4.12.3. Minimum Communications. Aircraft operating with receiver-only communications
