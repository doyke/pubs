This instruction aligns with AFPD 31-2, Provost Activities, and implements AFI 31-101,
Integrated Defense (FOUO). It outlines procedures for using pre-signed on-scene barment
letters if the commander is unavailable and the vice commander has not been placed on G-Series
Orders. This instruction applies to all civilian personnel assigned or attached to Robins Air
Force Base. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been revised to reflect current office symbols and terminology.

The Commander, 78th Air Base Wing (78 ABW/CC) possesses broad authority as the
installation commander to control activities on Robins AFB, including the authority to exclude
any person whose presence on the installation is unauthorized or whose presence disrupts good
order and discipline. This authority enables the commander to fulfill his or her responsibility to
protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the
 2                                                     ROBINSAFBI31-209 12 AUGUST 2010


successful, uninterrupted performance of the Air Force mission. Nothing in this instruction
limits or otherwise affects the ability of the commander to exercise the above-stated authority.


1. BACKGROUND: Some civilians in the past committed serious crimes on Robins Air Force
Base to include domestic violence offenses and violent crimes involving dangerous weapons.
Because there was no mechanism in place to bar these offenders immediately, they continued to
pose a potential threat to the installation and to their victims between the dates the offense was
committed and date barment orders were actually issued. In order to reduce the risk to the
installation and base population of further criminal acts by such offenders in a more expeditious
manner, the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center Staff Judge Advocate (WR-ALC/JA) developed
the On-Scene barment process.
2. CRITERIA FOR ON-SCENE BARMENTS: On-Scene barments are appropriate in
situations involving violent offenses and other serious crimes committed on Robins Air Force
Base by civilian offenders. In determining the appropriateness of an On-Scene barment,
consideration will be given to the seriousness of the offense, the offender’s prior criminal record
and connection to the installation, and the likelihood of future on-base misconduct by the
offender. NOTE: Active-duty members of the armed forces will not be processed for On-Scene
barments under this instruction. Instead, the appropriate military commander will be contacted
and will be responsible for determining whether the initiation of pretrial restraint under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is warranted.
3. PROCEDURES:
     3.1. Preparation and signing of the On-Scene Barment Letters: The 78th Security Forces
     Squadron Police Services Section (78 SFS/S5L) will be responsible for constructing and
     producing the On-Scene barment package (On-Scene barment letters, consent form and
     acknowledgement). A template of this package is attached as Attachment 2. All On-Scene
     barment letters will be coordinated through the Staff Judge Advocate’s Office (WR-
     ALC/JA). Once 78 SFS/S5L drafts its On-Scene bar package it should coordinate with WR-
     ALC/JA to approve the package for legal sufficiency. Once the On-Scene barment package is
     approved,          78 SFS/S5L will then submit nine On-Scene barment letters to the 78
     ABW/CC for signature. 78 SFS/S5L will obtain the nine original On-Scene barment letters
     after they are signed by the 78 ABW/CC.
        3.1.1. Only barment letters approved by WR-ALC/JA may be used. 78 SFS/S5L should
        forward any newly drafted On-Scene barment letters or revisions to the Office of the
        Staff Judge Advocate (WR-ALC/JAC) to review for legal sufficiency.
        3.1.2. Once reviewed, the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (WR-ALC/JA) will
        forward the approved letters back to 78 SFS/S5L so that 78 SFS/S5L can submit them to
        the 78 ABW/CC for signature.
     3.2. Custody of the pre-signed On-Scene Barment Letters: The pre-signed On-Scene
     Barment Letters will be treated as a controlled item. 78 SFS/S5L will number each pre-
     signed letter and log each into a logbook to be used to account for the numbered barment
     letters. The 78 SFS Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) will maintain one pre-signed
ROBINSAFBI31-209 12 AUGUST 2010                                                              3


  barment letter. 78 SFS/S5L will track custody of the pre-signed letters using the number on
  the barment letter, the date the letter is served, and the name of the offender receiving the


  barment letter. 78 SFS/S5L will be responsible for obtaining additional pre-signed barment
  letters from the 78 ABW/CC when it has three remaining pre-signed barment letters to be
  served.
     3.2.1. 78 SFS/S5L will be responsible for maintaining all On-Scene barment records and
     files in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records.
  3.3. Procedure for serving pre-signed On-Scene Barment Letters:
     3.3.1. The BDOC will contact the on-call WR-ALC/JA representative in all situations
     where an On-Scene Barment Letter may be appropriate.
     3.3.2. The on-call WR-ALC/JA representative will provide a recommendation to the
     BDOC as to whether or not On-Scene barment should be accomplished.
     3.3.3. The BDOC will then contact the Robins Command Post (RCP) to request a call-
     back for a conference with the 78 ABW/CC, via conference call if possible. During the
     conference call the BDOC will provide details of its conversation with the on-call WR-
     ALC/JA representative to the 78 ABW/CC.
     3.3.4. If On-Scene barment is authorized, the BDOC will fill in the specific information
     on the On-Scene Barment letter and make a copy of it before serving the barment to the
     offender. BDOC will record all pertinent information in the On-Scene barment logbook
     before issuing the letter.
     3.3.5. The BDOC will then serve the original signed barment letter to the offender.
     3.3.6. At the time the original signed barment letter is served, the BDOC must have the
     offender sign the acknowledgment attached to the letter. This acknowledgment is proof
     of service.
     3.3.7. If the offender refuses to sign the acknowledgment, the 78 SFS process server can
     sign the acknowledgment and have it witnessed by another 78 SFS member.
     3.3.8. The BDOC will make an appropriate blotter entry to record the commander
     authorization for the issuance of an On-Scene Barment Letter.
     3.3.9. The BDOC will send a copy of the served On-Scene barment letter and the
     original acknowledgment to the Staff Judge Advocate’s office (Attention to the Program
     Manager or Lead SAUSA) as soon as possible after service.
  3.4. Issuing On-Scene barment letters is accomplished with the expressed authority of the
  installation commander. Personnel under the command of 78 ABW/CC who issue such
  letters act as agents of the installation commander under color of his or her authority.
