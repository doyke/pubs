                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Overview. This manual directs procedures and provides guidance specific to the
investigation and reporting of USAF aviation mishaps and events in support of the Air Force
Chief of Staff (CSAF) Safety Program and supplements material in AFI 91-204, Safety and
Investigations Reports.
1.2. Waiver Authority.
   1.2.1. Unless specified, deviations from policies and requirements in this AFMAN require
   waiver approval by HQ AFSEC/SEF, or designated representative, prior to execution.
   Submit waiver requests through MAJCOM/SE to HQ AFSEC/SEF. Report deviations
   without waiver through channels to MAJCOM/SEF (or equivalent) who will notify HQ
   AFSEC/SEF for follow-on action, if necessary.
   1.2.2. See paragraph 6.4.2. for formal report waiver procedures.
1.3. Aviation Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
   1.3.1. Class A-D mishaps as directed by AFI 91204. In cases where the mishap initial cost
   estimate is within 10% of the next higher mishap class, consider using the higher class and
   issuing a status message reflecting the class change should the mishap subsequently
   downgrade. This process will ensure the appropriate level of oversight and Safety
   Investigation Board (SIB) composition is properly resourced.
   1.3.2. Class E Events. Unless noted, report all of the following events whether intent for
   flight is established or not. In most cases, events do not require reporting if they occur as
   described in the aircraft flight manuals and are expected responses to a crew’s actions or
   flight regime. For example, do not report the loss of pitot-static instrument indications if the
   loss is the result of crew failure to activate the pitot heat. If the circumstances of an event
   meet two or more criteria, such as an in-flight fire which results in a physiological episode,
   report the event using the following hierarchy: Physiological, Propulsion, Flight Control,
   Instrument, Miscellaneous, High Accident Potential (HAP), Hazardous Air Traffic Report
   (HATR), Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Violation, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
   (BASH). Note: Although Class E events do not require findings, a finding is required in
   order to input a recommendation into the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS).
      1.3.2.1. Physiological Events. If a physiological event meets the criteria of a Class A, B,
      C or D mishap IAW AFI 91-204, then the event will only be reported once as the higher
      class (i.e., no Class E report will be made). If injury, illness, or abnormal symptoms are
      experienced as a result of the flight environment that do not meet the Class D threshold as
      defined in AFI 91-204, then it must be reported as a Class E Physiological Event.
      Include any physiological symptoms that were experienced in the event narrative. Smoke
      and fumes without physiological symptoms does not constitute a Class E physiological
      event and will be reported as Class E miscellaneous. Aircrew or passenger
      decompression sickness from evolved gas (bends, chokes, skin, neurological, or
      neurocirculatory manifestations) is usually considered a mishap (Class A, B, C, or D), not
      an event. Only report decompression sickness as a Class E Physiological Event if
6                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


    symptoms resolved during descent (with or without in-flight oxygen) or during a 2-hour
    observation period (with or without ground level oxygen), and no recurrent symptoms or
    other medical treatment (compression chamber or prolonged oxygen) is required. Assign
    mishap class IAW AFI 91-204. For assistance in determining reportability of
    physiological events, contact the owning MAJCOM/SEF, MAJCOM Chief of
    Aeromedical Services (SGP), or HQ AFSEC/SEH (DSN 263-1117 or 246-0880,
    commercial (505) 853-1117 or (505) 846-0880). The following physiological events will
    be reported:
       1.3.2.1.1. Aircrew trapped gas disorders (ear, sinus, teeth, or abdominal).
       1.3.2.1.2. Aircrew hypoxia (suspected, probable, or definite). Loss of cabin
       pressurization without hypoxia is addressed in paragraph 1.3.2.5.10.
       1.3.2.1.3. Aircrew loss of consciousness or incapacitation in-flight (not resulting
       from injury or occupational illness), including G-induced loss of consciousness
       (GLOC).
       1.3.2.1.4. Aircrew or passenger symptoms or health effects caused by toxic, noxious,
       or irritating materials such as smoke, fumes (including carbon monoxide), or liquids.
       1.3.2.1.5. Aircrew spatial disorientation of any type (including visual illusion)
       resulting in an unusual aircraft attitude.
       1.3.2.1.6. Any medical condition, event, or physical injury directly resulting from
       performance of flight activities associated with a specific mission that a medical
       provider determines is significant to the health of the aircrew.
       1.3.2.1.7. Laser strikes. Damaging laser strikes to both personnel and aircraft should
       be reported IAW this AFMAN according to the respective class of the mishap (i.e.,
       Class A-D). Laser strikes involving exposure to personnel should be reported IAW
       AFI 48-139, Laser and Optical Radiation Protection Program, attachment 4.
       Additionally, aircrew should consider reporting laser strikes to the Federal Aviation
       Administration       (FAA)     laser      incident       reporting     website      at
       http://www.faa.gov/go/laserinfo.
    1.3.2.2. Propulsion-Related Events.      The following paragraphs identify those
    occurrences, which when reported, provide the necessary information for the timely
    identification and tracking of propulsion hazards while limiting the reporting of
    “nuisance” occurrences. Report the following propulsion related events:
       1.3.2.2.1. Loss of thrust sufficient to prevent maintaining level flight at a safe altitude
       or which requires the pilot to jettison stores.
       1.3.2.2.2. All non-afterburner operation engine stalls.
       1.3.2.2.3. Emergency or precautionary landing of a single engine or rotary wing
       aircraft, with imminent engine or rotor drive system failure confirmed after landing.
       1.3.2.2.4. Any unselected or inadvertent propeller or thrust reversal event (to include
       Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)).
       1.3.2.2.5. Engines which do not restart normally after an intentional in-flight engine
       shutdown for training, functional check flights (FCFs), or other non-emergency
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          7


        purposes. A normal restart is one that occurs at the planned and expected time and
        altitude using routine restart procedures.
        1.3.2.2.6. Engine fires that were extinguished with agent.
        1.3.2.2.7. Emergency, precautionary, or inadvertent engine shutdown at any time
        after taxi until normal engine shutdown.
            1.3.2.2.7.1. Do not report:
                1.3.2.2.7.1.1. Flameouts, engine stalls, or emergency engine shutdowns
                occurring during maintenance engine runs.
                1.3.2.2.7.1.2. Intentional in-flight engine shutdowns for training, testing, or
                FCFs.
     1.3.2.3. Flight Control-Related Events.
        1.3.2.3.1. Unintentional departure from controlled flight for any reason. Use the
        mission design series (MDS)-specific flight manual for definition of a “departure” for
        that aircraft.
        1.3.2.3.2. All uncommanded inputs to the flight controls (including stability
        augmenter, autopilot, or trim systems) whether it resulted in a dangerous situation or
        not. Report autopilot faults if, in the opinion of the aircrew, the autopilot would have
        put the aircraft in a dangerous situation.
        1.3.2.3.3. All uncommanded reversions to a backup mode for any safety-critical
        flight control system that resulted in an in-flight emergency (either declared by the
        crew or directed by the flight manual).
        1.3.2.3.4. Unintentional aircraft stick or yoke controller interference from any source
        or for any reason resulting in a hazardous situation.
        1.3.2.3.5. Any incident resulting in RPA action not complying with the operator’s
        intent. This includes, but is not limited to: unintentional autonomous goaround,
        permanent loss of all command and control links, and malfunctions or emergencies
        for which the aircraft modifies its flight path without operator input.
     1.3.2.4. Instrument-Related Events.
        1.3.2.4.1. In-flight loss of all pitot-static instrument indications.
        1.3.2.4.2. In-flight loss of both primary and standby attitude indicators.
        1.3.2.4.3. Any permanent loss of more than one electronic primary flight display (as
        defined in MDS-specific flight manuals) in either primary duty station, regardless of
        the ability to fly the aircraft on standby instruments.
     1.3.2.5. Miscellaneous Aircraft Events. The following paragraphs, while not all
     inclusive, identify occurrences that are to be reported due to the potential for becoming a
     mishap:
        1.3.2.5.1. In-flight fire.
        1.3.2.5.2. Fuel leakage resulting in an in-flight emergency or forced landing.

    1.3.2.5.3. Landing with any gear up.
    1.3.2.5.4. Structural failure of critical landing gear components. A critical landing
    gear component is defined as any component that could cause landing gear collapse.
    1.3.2.5.5. Unintended departure from takeoff or landing surfaces (e.g., runway,
    helipad, landing zone, etc.) onto adjacent surfaces, including landing short of the
    landing surface. For the purposes of this manual, the overrun is considered part of the
    takeoff or landing surface. EXCEPTION: Unintended departures of USAF Academy
    sailplanes from the planned landing surface are not required to be reported if the
    aircraft is undamaged.
    1.3.2.5.6. Inadvertent or uncommanded canopy openings in flight.
    1.3.2.5.7. Spillage or leakage of radioactive, toxic, corrosive, or flammable material
    from aircraft stores or cargo creating a hazardous condition or an in-flight emergency
    divert. Identify in the message which agency or unit prepared the shipment. If cargo
    was shipped under a waiver, specify the agency (MAJCOM, NAF, etc.) who granted
    the waiver.
    1.3.2.5.8. Any unintentional strike by an aircraft to another object regardless of
    damage cost or need for repairs.
    1.3.2.5.9. All events where a member of the crew executed any portion of an
    emergency checklist in response to smoke or fumes, regardless of aircrew symptoms.
    This includes smoke and fumes events in the ground control station (GCS) of an
    RPA. If the event resulted in aircrew or passenger health effects, report as a
    “Physiological Event” IAW paragraph 1.3.2.1. of this manual.
    1.3.2.5.10. Loss of cabin pressurization that requires executing an emergency
    checklist.
    1.3.2.5.11. In-flight malfunction of an air refueling drogue (Multi-Point Refueling
    System, Wing Air Refueling Pod, Boom Drogue Adapter, etc.), hose, hose reel
    assembly, refueling pod, or malfunctions involving helicopter air refueling probe
    oscillations.
    1.3.2.5.12. In-flight hoist malfunctions involving inadvertent separation of the hoist
    cable from the hoist (e.g., inadvertent cable shear or cable unwrapping from the
    drum).
       1.3.2.5.12.1. Intentional helicopter hoist cable shear due to a fouled or stuck
       cable.
    1.3.2.5.13. All in-flight events where electrical power was completely lost.
    Momentary power loss events that resulted from a purposeful act of the aircrew, such
    as a transfer from one generator to another, need not be reported.
    1.3.2.5.14. Any inadvertent system actuation due to design or ergonomic issues that
    created a potentially hazardous condition.
    1.3.2.5.15. F-16 Canopy Water Pooling. Report rain pooling events referenced in
    Chapter 7 of the 1F-16()-1. Describe the effects on the canopy, the phase of flight
    (final, short final, etc.), and the weather conditions. Additionally, report when it
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            9


        dissipated (e.g., "The rain pooled 20 degrees aft on final (both sides); just in front of
        the HUD on short final; dissipated when the nosewheel touched down. Heavy rain
        from 3-mile final to landing .").
     1.3.2.6. Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Events. The intent of the HATR program
     is to identify potentially hazardous aviation practices or procedures based on a particular
     event and to disseminate information that might prevent similar hazardous conditions at
     other USAF locations or operations. See paragraph 1.4. for HATR reporting procedures.
        1.3.2.6.1. Report any air traffic or movement area hazardous occurrence that
        endangered the safety of an aircraft. HATR information is not privileged information
        and therefore releasable outside AF channels, with the exception of the identity of the
        personnel involved. Reports completed by another agency such as the FAA do not
        relieve safety offices of the requirement to submit a HATR if AF personnel or
        equipment were involved.
            1.3.2.6.1.1. Report the following as a Class E HATR event using an AF IMT
            Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR):
                1.3.2.6.1.1.1. Near Mid Air Collision (NMAC): the aircrew took abrupt
                evasive action to avoid a collision or would have taken evasive action if
                circumstances allowed. While unintentional separation less than 500’ (well
                clear) would qualify, it is not necessarily required. Incident circumstances
                such as closure rate, visibility, airspace class, airspace control, etc., can also
                lead to NMAC reporting with far greater separation distances. This also
                includes Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Resolution Advisories
                (RA) requiring the aircrew to deviate from a planned or assigned flight path
                and USAF aircraft triggering TCAS RA aboard civil or other DoD aircraft. If
                a TCAS RA required the aircrew to deviate, then they are required to file a
                HATR regardless of position deconfliction.
                1.3.2.6.1.1.2. Communication or Navigational Aid (NAVAID): an equipment
                indication or malfunction that contributed to a hazardous air traffic condition.
                This does not include any incident involving a near miss of multiple aircraft;
                those should be entered as a NMAC.
                1.3.2.6.1.1.3. Ground Incidents: any occurrence on the airfield movement
                area that endangered an airborne aircraft or an aircraft operating on the
                ground. This includes improper runway use (landing on the wrong runway,
                clearance of multiple aircraft at the same time, access without clearance, or
                access by multiple conflicting aircraft when no clearance authority present), or
                taxi conflicts.
                1.3.2.6.1.1.4. Publications or Directives: publications or directives (FLIP,
                NOTAM, AIP, etc.) that contributed to a hazardous air traffic condition. This
                does not include any incident involving a near miss of multiple aircraft; those
                should be entered as a NMAC.
     1.3.2.7. Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Events. Use AF IMT Form 457,
     USAF Hazard Report, to report airfield infractions caused by aircraft, vehicles, or
     pedestrians entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. CMAV
 10                                           AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


      information is not privileged information and therefore releasable outside AF channels,
      with the exception of the identity of the personnel involved. See paragraph 1.4. for
      CMAV reporting procedures.
          1.3.2.7.1. This includes incidents of aircraft landing or taking the runway for takeoff
          without clearance. If the violation resulted in the endangerment of an aircraft, report
          as a Class E HATR event using AF IMT Form 651.
      1.3.2.8. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Events. All bird/wildlife strikes
      falling below Class D dollar damage threshold will be reported in AFSAS as a Class E
      BASH event. Non-damaging BASH reports are important and required to trend
      accurately for mishap prevention. Information contained in BASH reports is not
      privileged and is releasable outside AF channels, with the exception of personally
      identifiable information. Ensure the reports do not include safety privileged information
      IAW AFI 91-204. See paragraph 1.5. for BASH reporting procedures.
      1.3.2.9. High Accident Potential (HAP) Events. Report any hazardous occurrence that
      has a high potential for becoming a mishap and is not reportable under any other category
      as a HAP event. This includes emergency conditions arising from aircraft operation or
      from the failure or malfunction of systems or components essential for safe flight.
1.4. Class E HATR and CMAV Reporting Procedures.
   1.4.1. Unit commanders will ensure AF IMT Form 651 and AF IMT Form 457 are available
   to aircrews at base operations facilities, flying squadron operations offices, in trip kits, and in
   USAF Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities. Commanders must emphasize the importance of
   identifying hazardous situations and direct the filing of appropriate HATRs or CMAV events
   as a method of preventing future mishaps.
   1.4.2. Any person (e.g., air traffic controller, pilot, safety officer, etc.) aware that a
   reportable event occurred will file a HATR or CMAV. Report the details on AF IMT Form
   651 or AF IMT Form 457 in the following manner:
      1.4.2.1. If the individual is at the AF base where the event occurred, file the report within
      24 hours to the base safety office.
      1.4.2.2. If the event occurred away from an AF installation, report the event to AF safety
      personnel at the nearest AF safety office or the next landing location with an AF safety
      office. If not planning to transit an installation with an AF safety office, crews should
      contact home unit safety offices.
   1.4.3. If an aircrew experiences a HATR and circumstances permit, immediately (i.e., while
   airborne) inform the nearest ATC agency, civil aviation authority (CAA) for overseas events,
   or flight service station and provide the following information:
      1.4.3.1. Identification or call sign.
      1.4.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial and distance, and GPS coordinates, if
      available) of event.
      1.4.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
      1.4.3.4. Description of other aircraft in the event.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            11


     1.4.3.5. Advise the controlling agency a written report will be filed and request all
     available data be saved.
  1.4.4. It is the responsibility of the unit safety office to ensure all aircrew members, ATC,
  and other personnel controlling aircraft (e.g., Tactical Air Control Party personnel) are aware
  of HATR reporting requirements. Note: Aircrews who experience a NMAC under FAA
  control should immediately request that facility initiate a FAA Near Miss report.
  1.4.5. Within 24 hours after notification of the event, the safety office receiving the report
  determines which safety office is responsible for the investigation. Send the AF IMT Form
  651 or AF IMT Form 457 to the appropriate safety office. The responsible office is
  determined in the following order:
     1.4.5.1. If applicable, comply with host nation agreements or other international
     agreements (e.g., STANAGs, ICAO agreements, etc.). If unable to determine
     agreements, contact the overseas MAJCOM/SE or the AFFOR/SE.
     1.4.5.2. If foreign ATC or aircraft are involved, the unit involved in the HATR in
     conjunction with the overseas MAJCOM/SEF, or the AFFOR/SE.
     1.4.5.3. For local hazardous events, the AF safety office at that installation.
     1.4.5.4. If no AF safety office is available or if an airborne report is initiated by pilot or
     aircrew, the originator’s home station or deployed location. The originator’s home
     station safety office will then forward the HATR to appropriate agency for investigation.
  1.4.6. The investigating safety office will:
     1.4.6.1. Determine if the reported event merits a HATR. Notify the individual or unit
     that filed the HATR of this determination and the pending actions.
     1.4.6.2. If the event is reportable, document the event in AFSAS as either a Class E
     HATR or Class E CMAV. Note: Class E HATR and CMAV messages should not
     contain findings.
     1.4.6.3. Determine which organizations were involved and request those offices’
     assistance with the investigation. Notify the following organizations:
         1.4.6.3.1. The base Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), or equivalent,
         if USAF ATC, Tactical Air Control, or Airfield Management (AM) services were
         suspected to be involved. Note: Review ATC recordings needed for HATR
         investigations as quickly as possible. ATC recordings are routinely retained for only
         45 days. Due to various types of recording equipment installed, review of ATC
         recordings is best conducted at the ATC facility. Coordinate times for review with
         the AOF/CC in order to minimize impact on support of flight operations.
             1.4.6.3.1.1. If ATC or AM personnel are contributory to the event, the
             Investigating Officer (IO) should contact the AOF/CC to discuss the investigation
             and advise on ATC/AM procedures. At the conclusion of the investigation,
             AOF/CC concurrence or non-concurrence with the IO’s report must be input into
             AFSAS. If the AOF/CC non-concurs, his/her rationale with corrective actions
             must also be input in AFSAS. If the event takes place at a non-USAF base (e.g.,
             Navy base or civil airfield), contact the AOF/CC equivalent. If no AOF/CC
 12                                       AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


             equivalent can be identified (e.g., contingency operations at a foreign airfield),
             contact the AF organization responsible for coordination with the airfield
             owner/operator. If unable to identify an appropriate organization, contact the
             MAJCOM staff for assistance.
             1.4.6.3.1.2. The base Communications Commander if NAVAIDs were likely
             involved.
         1.4.6.3.2. The flying unit if local base aircraft were involved. If transient aircraft
         were involved, notify the aircrew’s unit of assignment safety office.
         1.4.6.3.3. The FAA facility or Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) if FAA ATC
         or civil aircraft were involved. Note: Contact the AOF/CC or FAA Air Force
         Representative (AFREP) for help in notifying the proper facility or FSDO. See Table
         1.1 for which AFREP to contact. Include the AFREP in these investigations as
         needed, especially if you are having difficulty getting information from the FAA.

             1.4.6.3.3.1. The AFREP at FAA Regional Offices reviews HATR and CMAV
             events in their region involving FAA ATC or civil aircraft and provides assistance
             when requested.
      1.4.6.4. HQ Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) uses AFSAS to administer
      program oversight for AF review of Airfield Operations related HATRs. Coordinate with
      MAJCOM Airfield Operations staffs to reconcile any discrepancies in conclusions and
      recommended corrective actions for AF-wide trends. Coordinate safety reviews,
      evaluations, recommendations, and time critical notifications with HQ AFSEC/SEF.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             13


1.5. BASH Reporting Procedures. Report all bird/wildlife strikes falling below the Class B
threshold in AFSAS as a Class C, D, or E BASH mishap/event using the format in Attachment 5,
Class C/D/E Sample Report Format. If a Class E BASH event is non-damaging, the
Attachment 5 Sample Report Format is not necessary; however, reasonable investigation efforts
and documentation within AFSAS are required. Wildlife-related information contained in
BASH reports is not privileged and is releasable outside AF channels with the exception of
personally identifiable information. Any subsequent safety investigation into these events and
the resultant analysis, findings, and recommendations are privileged and not releasable outside
AF channels.
   1.5.1. Flight safety offices of the organization owning the aircraft will report wildlife strikes
   sustained by their assets. This allows for universal reporting standards for all mishap classes
   for non-expeditionary forces. Host installation aviation safety offices will also report all non-
   USAF aircraft/wildlife strikes at that AF installation in AFSAS as no-cost Class E BASH
   events for trending.
   1.5.2. When aircraft are under the Operational Control (OPCON) of an expeditionary
   organization, wildlife strikes to aircraft will be reported by the owning expeditionary force
   flight safety office to facilitate timely reporting. Ensure transient aircrew that have not
   notified or coordinated with the expeditionary force safety office fill out an AF IMT Form
   853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report (or equivalent), and send a copy to the safety office of
   the organization owning the aircraft for entry into AFSAS. See paragraph 2.5.2. for
   investigation responsibilities.
   1.5.3. For every bird/wildlife strike, send samples of the remains (if available) to the
   Smithsonian Institution’s Feather Identification Lab (FIL) for identification and record the
   incident in AFSAS. Coordinate with aircraft maintenance personnel prior to collecting
   remains from aircraft surfaces. For whole bird or partial carcass, pluck a variety of feathers
   from the head, breast, back, body, and tail if possible. Collect any/all blood, tissue, or fluid
   remains for DNA analysis. To do this, spray the area with ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70%
   isopropyl alcohol and wipe with a clean paper towel, or use pre-packaged alcohol wipes. If
   there is a concern over using alcohol on certain aircraft surfaces, use a dry cloth. Use water
   and a clean paper towel as a last resort. Ethanol is preferable to isopropyl alcohol but both
   types of alcohol are preferable to water. Allow all bird strike remains to completely dry, fold
   the towel, and place remains into a labeled re-sealable plastic bag. Investigators should not
   delay recovering and shipping remains to the FIL, as the DNA in the sample could degrade.
   Also, report all wildlife remains, whether whole or in part, found on the airfield within 200
   feet of a runway centerline in AFSAS as a bird strike, unless another reason for the animal’s
   death is identified, and send remains to the FIL for identification. If you find a complete bird
   carcass in good condition on the airfield, place it in a freezer and contact the FIL at (202)
   633-0801 to see if the museum would like to have the specimen for their collections. Attach
   a copy of the corresponding BASH shipping sheet, found on the BASH web page in AFSAS,
   to all types of wildlife strike evidence and ship to the following address: Smithsonian
   Institution, Feather Identification Lab, NHB-E -600 MRC 116, PO Box 37012, Washington,
   DC 20013-7012. For high priority mishap identifications, ship remains via weekday
   overnight delivery to the following address: Smithsonian Institution, Feather Identification
   Lab NHB-600, MRC 116, 10th and Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20560, (202)
   633-0801 (include the telephone number on overnight shipments). Once the FIL has entered

   the identification into the AFSAS report, AFSAS will automatically notify the named
   investigators of the species identification via email. If there are any questions, contact HQ
   AFSEC/SEFW (DSN) 246-5674.
   1.5.4. For wildlife strikes other than birds, gather samples of skin, hair, teeth, or other non-
   fleshy remains following procedures in paragraph 1.5.3. While physical evidence is
   preferred, gathering remains of wildlife other than birds may not be practicable. In these
   cases, photographs will be accepted. Send an electronic image/email of the carcass or
   remains to the FIL (dovec@si.edu).
   1.5.5. Additional BASH guidance is available on the AF BASH Portal page (found on the
   AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Sub-Organizations: Aviation Safety
   Division : Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)) and the AF BASH public webpage
   (http://www.afsec.af.mil/organizations/bash/index.asp).
1.6. RPA Mishaps. RPAs are considered aircraft, and mishaps will be reported IAW DoDI
6055.07 and AFI 91-204 unless exempted as follows:
   1.6.1. Damage or destruction of an RPA resulting from a deliberative risk acceptance
   decision by an appropriate command authority to employ the vehicle in an environment or
   condition where the risk of loss of the vehicle is outweighed by operational requirements.
   1.6.2. Intentional or expected damage to RPA during authorized testing is not reportable if
   both of the following conditions are met:
      1.6.2.1. The extent of the damage or destruction was an expected or desired result of the
      planned test or operation and the damage or destruction occurred in the intended manner.
      1.6.2.2. The damage or destruction occurred at planned times, location, and for
      anticipated reasons with no other collateral damage.
   1.6.3. Parachute Recovered RPA. Damage to parachute recovered RPAs is reportable if it is
   the result of an abnormal event including but not limited to: torn parachutes, late recovery
   initiation, failure of a parachute to properly open or release, high winds, etc., and are
   reportable under the appropriate overall mishap class criteria. Include the repair costs or loss
   involved related to abnormal events. Do not include the cost of expected damage to
   parachute-recovered RPAs resulting solely from surface or water impact during an otherwise
   normal recovery sequence since this meets the definition in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, of
   expected damage during authorized testing. This is an operational expense and not
   reportable. Likewise, do not include cost of recovery since recovery is normally a mission
   objective for recoverable RPAs.
   1.6.4. Tethered Aerostat Radar Systems (TARS) and other buoyant platforms are considered
   RPAs for the purposes of mishap reporting.
      1.6.4.1. When a mishap occurs while the buoyant platform is moored to its ground
      station tower, it will be reported as an Aircraft Ground Operations (AGO) mishap.
      1.6.4.2. When a mishap occurs after the buoyant platform is released from its mooring
      tower, it will be reported as an Aircraft Flight mishap.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             15

                                    RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Responsibilities of the Convening Authority (CA).
   2.1.1. Determine the size and scope of the investigation required for each mishap, subject to
   the minimums established in AFI 91-204 and this manual.
   2.1.2. Provide funding for the mishap investigation.
   2.1.3. Receive an out-brief for all Class A and B mishaps with the exception of mishaps in
   which the entire formal report has been waived by HQ AFSEC. This briefing should be in-
   person; however, other forms (e.g., video teleconference, slides-only) may be conducted at
   the discretion of the CA. The out-brief should occur within 15 days after the SIB completes
   the investigation to avoid minimizing the urgency of the safety investigation and to begin
   implementation of recommendations aimed at mitigating hazards to avoid future mishaps.
2.2. Responsibilities of the MAJCOM or NAF Chief of Safety (SE).
   2.2.1. Ensure an adequate number of potential SIB members are appropriately trained and
   available to fulfill the membership requirements in Chapter 4 of this manual. The AFSEC
   conducts training through courses such as Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC),
   Safety/Accident Investigation Board President Course (BPC), etc. For a complete listing of
   courses available, see the Media and Force Development page on the AFSEC AF Portal.
   Request training allocations through the MAJCOM POC for training.
      2.2.1.1. CA/SE will be postured for a timely identification of SIB members. CA/SE
      should ensure the SIB is physically in place within 72 hours of mishap notification unless
      the situation precludes this timing (e.g., recovery operations, travel restrictions, available
      transportation, etc.).
      2.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Request training allocations through the HQ PACAF Safety
      Training         SharePoint        site          https://pacaf.eim.pacaf.af.mil/SE-
      Safety/Pages/Safety%20Training.aspx. All requests must go through the Wing/SE
      POC(s).
   2.2.2. For Class A and B mishaps, the CA safety staff or designated representative will
   provide the following support and assistance on behalf of the CA to the SIB or Single
   Investigating Officer (SIO) as applicable:
      2.2.2.1. Provide Interim Safety Board (ISB) contact information to the SIB Board
      President (BP) as soon as the BP is identified.
      2.2.2.2. Appoint an individual from the CA aviation safety staff or designated
      representative to act as a point of contact during the course of the investigation to answer
      SIB/SIO questions and provide investigative assistance. Issues that cannot be resolved
      should be forwarded to the AFSEC/SEFF SIB support line at DSN 263-6175, Comm
      (505) 853-6175.
16                                       AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


     2.2.2.3. Advise each SIB member to hand carry and e-mail a copy of their Information
     Assurance Awareness training certificate to the SIB’s host wing safety office POC so that
     network access and an e-mail account can be established.
     2.2.2.4. Ensure an AFSAS account is set up for each SIB/SIO member with the
     appropriate security roles.
     2.2.2.5. Issue orders appointing SIBs. For each board member, the order must contain
     the SIB position, full name, rank/grade, organization, assigned base, and assigned board
     status (primary or secondary member as defined in Chapter 4). Do not include observers
     on SIB orders. See Attachment 3 for the suggested SIB Convening Orders Format.
     These orders will be signed by the CA or designated representative.
     2.2.2.6. Provide formal briefing templates and example briefings.
     2.2.2.7. Act upon requests for additional members to be added to the SIB as the
     investigation progresses. See paragraph 4.2.2.
     2.2.2.8. For mishaps involving suspected material or system related failures or where
     complex technical issues are expected, ensure adequate technical expertise is assigned to
     the investigation.
     2.2.2.9. Assist the SIB/SIO with determining Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
     and Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) for recommendation(s) and other
     recommendation(s) of significance.
     2.2.2.10. Formal reports and final messages Quality Control. It is the responsibility of
     the CA’s SEF to accomplish the following:
        2.2.2.10.1. Ensure the final report Tab T follows specific guidance set forth in
        paragraph 6.4.5.1. See Sample Tab T at Attachment 4.
        2.2.2.10.2. Ensure the final message is derived from the formal report Tab T and is a
        stand-alone product without images/pictures/diagrams/tables, contains no references
        to any portion of the formal report (e.g., “see Tab W”), and does not mention
        persons/companies/products by name (e.g., use “mishap pilot,” “prime/sub-
        contractor,” “abradable coating,” etc.).
        2.2.2.10.3. Review, as a minimum, the formal report Tab T, Tab Y, and final
        message to ensure the SIB/SIO followed formatting and investigative guidance
        placing special emphasis on paragraph 6.4.5. and AFI 91-204, Chapter 5.
        2.2.2.10.4. Review AFSAS data fields for accuracy prior to the release of the final
        message (e.g., mishap category, mishap class, mishap cost, one-liner, etc.), and do not
        solely rely on AFSAS error check.
        2.2.2.10.5. Per paragraph 6.1.4. of this manual, reviewing safety specialists should
        provide suggestions for accuracy and effectiveness but will not supersede the
        judgment of the SIB/SIO.
     2.2.2.11. Other than HQ AFSEC involvement, the investigation will not be staffed
     during this review process outside of the CA safety office or designated representative.
     IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, no pre-screening, staffing, or review is permitted. SIB/SIO
     independence is paramount and even the appearance of influence must be avoided.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                           17


       CA/SE will ensure the CA and staff understand the importance of preserving SIB
       independence.
       2.2.2.12. SEs will ensure the content of board briefings to the CA match the formal
       report and final message prior to being presented to the CA for acceptance.
2.3. Installation Commander Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Ensure appropriate Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (10-2) includes ISB
   procedures for aviation mishaps IAW Chapter 3 of this manual.
   2.3.2. Ensure adequate facilities are identified and ready for use by an ISB/SIB. Host units
   are responsible for funding the administrative and logistical support required for a SIB even
   if the host installation is not assigned to the investigating MAJCOM. See AFI 91-204,
   Chapter 5. A “host unit” is an Air Force wing or installation supporting an ISB or SIB.
   Several host units may exist for a given SIB depending on the mishap location, the home unit
   of the aircraft, etc.
   2.3.3. Establish provisions for the host unit to provide information system support to the
   SIB. Prior coordination with the unit’s Network Control Center (NCC) is essential to the
   timely establishment of account access and proper creation of these information processing
   tools. This support will include:
       2.3.3.1. Access to the global information grid and a local area network (LAN) common
       drive access folder for the SIB. Ensure the folder and its contents’ access permissions are
       restricted to only the SIB.
       2.3.3.2. Ensure administrative and logistical support is provided to the SIB as requested.
       For example transcribers, copy machines, and vehicles.
2.4. Wing/Installation Chief of Safety (CoS):
   2.4.1. The CoS may have as many as three broad responsibilities in the aftermath of a major
   mishap:
       2.4.1.1. Ensure a timely and effective response to the mishap scene IAW with the
       Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) and wing’s Mishap Response
       Plan (MRP). See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, Chapter 1.
       2.4.1.2. Support the activities of the ISB and SIB.
       2.4.1.3. Notify the Incident Commander (IC) or Recovery Operations Chief (ROC), as
       applicable, once all investigative activities are completed to allow mishap site cleanup,
       unless there will be a follow-on Accident Investigation Board (AIB).
   2.4.2. The CoS can best fulfill the above responsibilities by ensuring:
       2.4.2.1. A viable pre-accident plan is in place and frequently exercised, preferably in
       conjunction with a Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE).
       2.4.2.2. Necessary investigation and board support supplies are on hand or immediately
       available.
       2.4.2.3. Maintain a list of potential SIB members who have completed the formal
       training requirements IAW AFI 91-202, Chapter 1.
 18                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


          2.4.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) A list of potential SIB members is maintained by
          PACAF/SEF at https://pacaf.eim.pacaf.af.mil/SE-Safety/SEF/default.aspx and
          updated the first week of every month. PACAF units may use this list to satisfy the
          requirement of 2.4.2.3.
      2.4.2.4. Provide identified potential ISB and SIB members training annually on the
      basics of mishap investigation, IAW AFI 91-202, Chapter 1.
      2.4.2.5. Tenant unit safety offices should coordinate with the host unit to determine
      mishap response actions.
2.5. Deployed Safety Operations.
   2.5.1. When an aviation mishap occurs during wartime or contingency operations, the CA
   will investigate the mishap, subject to access restrictions imposed by the Theater
   Commander. Close coordination with the theater safety office is crucial to ensuring all
   required SIB members are properly vetted for theater entry.
   2.5.2. Mishap Ownership. OPCON or Tactical Control (TACON) of an aircraft does not
   change mishap ownership. While expeditionary safety personnel will often perform initial
   reporting functions, Class A and B mishaps will be investigated by the owning organization
   in accordance with AFI 91-204, Chapter 4. Expeditionary forces flight safety officers (FSO)
   and non-commissioned officers (FSNCO) may conduct Class C through E investigations
   (when allowed by paragraph 4.2.1.3.2) at the request of the mishap owner and upon approval
   of the deployed expeditionary Wing Commander or equivalent.
2.6. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation or Federal Air Traffic Services. Cooperation between
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), FAA, and the AF in these investigations is
essential (reference AFI 91-204, chapters 2 and 4). For mishaps involving Civil Air Patrol
(CAP)-USAF, USAF active duty, or government civilians flying CAP-owned assets on approved
AF missions, follow the procedures in AFI 91-204 and this manual. Mishaps involving CAP
volunteers will be handled by the NTSB/FAA.
   2.6.1. USAF Aero Club Mishaps. For mishaps involving Air Force Aero Clubs, the NTSB
   is the lead investigating agency. If the NTSB or designated representative agency does not
   investigate, the host wing commander may direct the wing safety office to conduct an
   investigation. Exception: For mishaps occurring outside the United States, the host nation
   civil aviation authority may have jurisdiction and investigative authority; check existing host-
   nation agreements.
      2.6.1.1. The CoS at the host wing will appoint an FSO to assist with or conduct Aero
      Club mishap investigations if needed. In units with no active flying mission, the CoS
      will appoint a ground safety technician to assist with Aero Club investigations.
      2.6.1.2. Aero Club mishaps investigated by the wing safety office are conducted under
      AFI 34217, Air Force Aero Club Program, Chapter 3. An Air Force FSO will conduct
      an official investigation on each reportable Aero Club mishap as a sports and recreation
      mishap under AFI 91-224. The FSO will work closely with applicable ground safety,
      NTSB, FAA, or host country investigators.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            19


       2.6.1.3. If an Aero Club aircraft is on a USAF directed mission, investigate IAW AFI 91-
       204 and this manual (e.g., Air Force personnel using an Aero Club aircraft to conduct an
       airfield assessment for certification purposes).
   2.6.2. Civil Aviation mishaps resulting in injury to Air Force students participating in Initial
   Flight Screening (IFS) or Navigator Introductory Flight Training (NIFT) are considered
   Aircraft Flight mishaps and investigations of these mishaps will be conducted IAW AFI 91-
   204 and this manual.
   2.6.3. AF Participation in NTSB Investigations. Reference AFI 91-206(I), Participation in a
   Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation. The AF may take part in NTSB-led
   investigations. If the AF does take part in such an investigation or public hearing, it does so
   as “a party to” the investigation or hearing.
       2.6.3.1. Air Force representatives to NTSB investigations will be graduates of formal Air
       Force safety training courses. Colonels and above will be graduates of the Air Force’s
       BPC. All others will be graduates of AMIC or trained and qualified FSOs. Air Force
       representatives to NTSB investigations are responsible to AF/SE while assigned to the
       NTSB investigation.
   2.6.4. FAA Participation in USAF Investigations. When a military flight mishap involves a
   function of the FAA, the CA will allow the FAA to participate in the military investigation.
   FAA participants must sign nondisclosure of privileged information agreements. If a
   military investigation concludes FAA personnel or facilities were causal in the mishap,
   comply with AFI 91-206(I).
2.7. Safety Investigations Involving Both the Air Force and Other Services. If a mishap
involves aircraft, materiel, facilities, or personnel from the USAF and another Service or the
Coast Guard, the investigation will be convened under a single Service’s procedures but
conducted jointly and with joint membership in accordance with the current Inter-Service
Memorandum of Understanding and DoDI 6055.07. Each Service reserves the right to conduct
independent, concurrent safety investigations; however, the joint investigation takes precedence
with regards to access to evidence and witnesses. The involved DoD components shall
determine which DoD Component has primary responsibility for investigating and reporting
each multiple DoD Component mishap. Normally, the CA for the investigation will be the DoD
Component experiencing the greater loss, although other factors such as operational roles and
degree of involvement will also be considered. The convening DoD Component’s safety
investigation directives shall be used in investigating and reporting the mishap.
   2.7.1. The DoD Component that is determined to have ownership of the mishap will account
   for all fatalities, injuries, and property damage in that DoD Component’s statistics.
2.8. Friendly Fire Investigations. When the USAF is the lead for a friendly fire investigation,
the Air Force Component Safety staff and the SIB will adhere to AFI 91-204 and this manual for
sourcing, support, and conduct of the safety investigation. Reference DoDI 6055.07 for further
guidance.

                                            Chapter 3

                   INTERIM SAFETY BOARD (ISB) REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Data Collection. ISBs are convened by installation commanders to provide an organized
evidence preservation response to mishaps within their area of responsibility before the arrival of
the SIB. The ISB members are selected based upon their respective expertise within their normal
professional specialty. It is not within the ISB’s charter to conduct analysis or “solve” the
mishap. The ISB lays the groundwork necessary to ensure a successful investigation process is
accomplished by the SIB. Safety personnel (ISBs and Disaster Response Force (DRF) safety
members) will endeavor to capture as much data as possible to assist the SIB (e.g., weather,
flight crew records, flight plans, etc.) and take care to follow proper marking, handling, and
storage procedures. Particular attention must be given to classified or privileged safety
materials.
3.2. Mishaps during Wartime or Contingency Operations. Aviation mishaps occurring
during wartime or contingency operations present unique challenges. Access to crash sites may
not be possible if the aircraft is in hostile territory. Logistics and transportation for SIB members
may delay their arrival or even preclude the investigation from being completed within
established timeline guidance. In this case, produce applicable status messages and coordinate
for an extension with the CA. While it is recognized that wartime, contingency operations, or
classified operations may create delays in evidence gathering and reporting, these operations do
not relieve commanders of the requirements in 91-series directives. Conduct a Force Protection
Risk Assessment before traveling to a hostile area/crash site to gather/preserve evidence. The
safety of personnel is the top priority.
3.3. ISB Interaction with the Disaster Response Force (DRF).
   3.3.1. The DRF is the Air Force structure that responds to disasters or accidents, establishing
   command and control, and supporting disaster operations. See AFI 102501, Air Force
   Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations and AFMAN 10-2504, Air
   Force Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters, for more
   information on the DRF, members of the DRF, and the roles of the IC and ROC.
   3.3.2. Initial Response. The IC is the individual responsible for all incident activities,
   including the development of strategies and tactics and the ordering and release of resources.
   The IC has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is
   responsible for the management of all incident operations at the incident site.
   3.3.3. The safety member of the DRF may also be a member of the ISB. Regardless of
   additional roles, such as ISB membership, the safety member of the DRF should act in the
   interest of the ensuing safety investigation, but not at the expense of their disaster response
   duties.
       3.3.3.1. DRF Safety members must understand the priorities of the IC immediately
       following a mishap are to rescue the injured, to prevent or minimize fire damage to the
       wreckage, to remove wreckage obstructing essential air or ground traffic or rescue and
       firefighting services, and to make the site safe. Access to the site for safety investigation
       purposes will be subordinate to those priorities.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            21


      3.3.3.2. Once site access is approved and coordinated with the IC, the DRF safety
      member should always keep two goals in mind, both directly relating to preserving
      evidence: site preservation and identifying witnesses for the ISB.
      3.3.3.3. The safety member of the DRF must ensure the mishap site is preserved and
      documented by working with the IC to keep the mishap site as undisturbed as possible.
          3.3.3.3.1. Unnecessary vehicle and personnel movements must be curtailed, since
          they can obliterate vital ground scar evidence. Single routes into and out of the area,
          enforced with cordons, should be established as quickly as possible.
          3.3.3.3.2. Aircraft components must be left undisturbed if they pose neither a threat
          to survivors nor a hazard to the DRF; otherwise, it may not be possible to characterize
          damage as pre- or post-impact.
          3.3.3.3.3. If the site is constantly changing or subject to significant changes in
          conjunction with survivor recovery actions, photograph or video every change as it
          happens.
          3.3.3.3.4. Be cognizant of changing weather conditions which can alter or obliterate
          evidence, such as ground scars. Document conditions and place protective coverings
          as needed.
          3.3.3.3.5. When it is necessary to disturb the site to reduce site hazards, document the
          conditions prior to their disturbance whenever possible.
          3.3.3.3.6. Consult with a bioenvironmental engineer to ensure proper personal
          protective equipment (PPE) is worn to protect against blood-borne pathogens,
          composite materials and other potentially hazardous materials at the mishap site.
   3.3.4. Recovery Phase. The recovery phase begins when first responders have completed
   emergency response and lifesaving actions. Once the emergency is over and recovery starts,
   control of the site is transferred from the IC to the ROC, who is a subject matter expert in the
   hazards or activities within the incident site. The ROC will likely be the person in charge of
   the mishap site when the ISB/SIB begins their evidence collection and investigation.
3.4. ISB General Information.
   3.4.1. The ISB is not responsible for determining mishap cause. The sole purpose of the ISB
   is to gather, preserve, and protect evidence. ISB investigation is normally limited to
   determining what evidence exists. The ISB only analyzes evidence when it will perish prior
   to arrival of the permanent SIB and with the SIBs permission. The ISB is responsible to
   ensure perishable evidence is preserved by identifying items such as air traffic control tapes
   and surveillance video tapes for impoundment, notifying the owning installation of the need
   to collect aircraft and crew records, impounding all equipment which may be related to the
   mishap event, collecting perishable fluids, photographing the crash site, removing to a secure
   location the voice and flight data recorders, and advising en route installations and airports
   visited by the mishap aircraft prior to the accident so servicing people and equipment can be
   identified. The items of interest to be impounded are typically found in the wing’s MRP.
   After collection, ensure the only people with access to the evidence are members of the ISB.
   3.4.2. In some situations, multiple ISBs may be required following a mishap. If a locally
   based aircraft has a mishap off station, an ISB may be required at more than one location to
22                                          AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


  preserve and gather evidence. In any case, the CA will determine the lead ISB president,
  typically at the mishap location, who will coordinate and control the activities at all locations.
  3.4.3. ISB Membership. An ISB will consist of at least the following members who should
  be chosen from outside the mishap unit:
     3.4.3.1. ISB BP. The ISB BP should be an O-6 and a graduate of the HQ AFSEC BPC.
     The ISB BP ensures evidence is preserved and the installation is prepared to provide all
     necessary support to the SIB on their arrival. Knowledge of the safety process is required
     by the ISB BP to ensure the proper collection and preservation of safety evidence and
     protection of privilege.
     3.4.3.2. ISB Investigating Officer (IO). The ISB IO must be a graduate of AMIC or the
     legacy FSO course. The ISB IO’s principal function is to ensure preservation of physical
     evidence at the scene of the mishap. Additionally, the ISB IO should coordinate with the
     home unit safety office to preserve evidence if the mishap was at a location other than the
     home base.
     3.4.3.3. ISB Pilot Member (PM). A pilot, preferably qualified in the mishap aircraft
     type, whose main function is to assemble all factual information about the mishap flight
     and aircrew. This includes but is not limited to: training records, flight evaluation
     folders, flight crew information files, flight plans, weather briefings, flight orders,
     briefing notes, radar/tower tapes, etc.
     3.4.3.4. ISB Maintenance Member (MM). A maintenance officer or Senior Non-
     commissioned Officer (SNCO), with experience in the mishap aircraft. It is preferred to
     select a maintenance officer or SNCO who has graduated from either the AMIC or
     JEMIC courses. The MM’s chief function is to assemble as much information as
     possible regarding the history of the mishap aircraft, including but not limited to: AFTO
     Forms 781, automated maintenance records, training records of maintainers who last
     performed maintenance on the aircraft, fuel/oil/hydraulic/liquid oxygen (LOX) samples,
     impound Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) used on the aircraft, etc.
     3.4.3.5. ISB Medical Officer (MO). This member is a flight surgeon whose main
     function is preservation of medical evidence and care of mishap crewmembers, if
     required. The MO may be the flight surgeon who provided initial response to the mishap.
     This member must take responsibility for: the post-mishap medical history, 72-hour and
     14-day history, examination, care and toxicological testing of all those identified to be
     tested (IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 2), collection of medical and dental records, and
     ensuring human remains are photographed, preserved and documented. The 72-hour and
     14-day histories are an attempt to gain knowledge of a person’s life events preceding the
     mishap and are not intended to be an investigative interview concerning mishap events.
     The MO serves as the liaison between local medical authorities or coroners and military
     investigators, including medical examiners from the Joint Pathology Center (JPC), if
     assigned. The MO also coordinates medical care at the mishap site and advises the ISB
     on the site’s environmental hazards.
         3.4.3.5.1. For RPA mishaps, directed post-mishap medical history, 72-hour and 14-
         day history, examination, and toxicological testing are only mandatory for the RPA
         crew or associated personnel (including instructors or evaluators performing “over the
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        23


         shoulder” duties and technicians who performed maintenance or troubleshooting on
         the ground control station) who operated the RPA during and immediately preceding
         the mishap sequence. This is defined as the last two crews to operate the aircraft.
         This does not negate a commander’s prerogative, IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 2, to test
         any other military member whose actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have
         been factors in the mishap.
     3.4.3.6. ISB Recorder. This individual, normally a junior officer or non-commissioned
     officer (NCO) familiar with administrative duties, is responsible for ensuring the
     administrative and logistical needs of the ISB are met. Extensive experience in
     information technology and computers is extremely valuable for this individual. The
     recorder facilitates a timely and orderly process of evidence collection and transfer. The
     ISB recorder may be retained as the SIB recorder with MAJCOM and local unit
     agreement.
     3.4.3.7. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Member. This member is an officer or NCO
     who should be a graduate of the Life Sciences Investigation Course and is charged with
     preserving all evidence associated with AFE and aircraft crew protection and egress
     systems. This member also assembles as much information as possible regarding AFE,
     its most recent servicing, and the qualifications of the individuals who most recently
     worked on it to include electronic records (e.g., Automated Life-Sustainment Equipment
     Records (ALERTS) or similar system).
  3.4.4. The ISB will ensure the following actions are accomplished:
     3.4.4.1. The ISB will not allow any piece of evidence to be reviewed, copied, tampered
     with, or modified (e.g., Head Up Display (HUD) tape, aircraft or training records, flight
     evaluation folder (FEF), maintenance logs, etc.) nor will there be any mission debrief
     (with the exception of time sensitive intelligence debriefs), either by supervisors or
     among crewmembers. All mishap participants will be kept separated to preclude
     collective reconstruction of mishap events. Interviews or witness statement collection
     will be conducted on an individual basis. The integrity of each piece of evidence is
     crucial to the success of the investigation and the Air Force’s mishap prevention program.
     3.4.4.2. Record the name, office symbol, address, e-mail address, and phone number of
     each person who provides records or evidence (e.g., photos, videos, ATC tapes, training
     records, etc.). Document source information for any photographs or videos provided
     including the date of the photograph or video.
     3.4.4.3. Ensure power is removed from Flight Data Recorders (FDR) and Cockpit Voice
     Recorders (CVR) by pulling the appropriate circuit breakers as quickly as possible if
     aircraft power still exists after the mishap. Information on the data recorders can be
     overwritten and rendered useless in as little as 30 minutes if they remain powered after
     the mishap. The ISB should contact MAJCOM/SEF or HQ AFSEC/SEFE Technical
     Assistance (DSN 246-5867, Comm (505) 846-5867) prior to accomplishing any of the
     following:
         3.4.4.3.1. Downloading or transferring any data from recorders. The ISB should
         immediately download perishable data or ship data recorders or other recorded media
         and devices to a facility able to salvage the data. AFSEC/SEFE can help determine or
24                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


         designate a location if required. Any delays in shipping may needlessly extend the
         SIB’s timeline.
         3.4.4.3.2. Recovering data from other aircraft systems. Several other aircraft systems
         may retain useful data for the investigation. This data can be in the form of either
         volatile or non-volatile memory. Each of these systems is unique. AFSEC/SEFE can
         provide assistance for recovering this data.
         3.4.4.3.3. Downloading information from RPA Ground Control Stations (GCS).
         GCS data is RPA unique data that provides valuable information for mishap
         investigations. If not properly recovered and handled in a timely manner, this data
         can be overwritten and lost. With AFSEC/SEFE guidance, download the information
         from the applicable ground stations. Note: data may need to be downloaded from
         multiple GCSs. GCS data is typically classified and special procedures may be
         required to download and preserve evidence. Contact local Special Security Officer
         (SSO) to coordinate download.
         3.4.4.3.4. Securing perishable data from other sources. AFSEC/SEFE can provide
         assistance for identifying other applicable sources of data. This includes, but is not
         limited to, Test Range Data Systems, Training Range Data Systems, Security Camera
         Video, Tactical Data Links, Air Traffic Control, AWACS, recorders from companion
         aircraft, etc. The ISB should secure perishable data from all other applicable sources.
  3.4.5. Written and Verbal Testimony. The intent of ISB interviews is to capture witness
  recollection as soon as possible after the mishap. Collect witness contact information (name,
  address, phone number, and e-mail) for all individuals who provide a statement, are
  interviewed, or are potential witnesses. All potential witnesses must be identified, logged,
  and given an opportunity to provide at least a written statement as quickly as possible after
  the mishap. For interviews with contractors (e.g., contract maintenance, etc.) involved in the
  mishap, ensure the contract wording provides for cooperation with Safety Investigation
  Boards (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Clause 252.228-7005, Accident Reporting
  and Investigation Involving Aircraft, Missiles, and Space Launch Vehicles). Have Quality
  Assurance (QA)/Contracting Office Representative or the Government Flight Representative
  review the contract; look for wording like "…the service provider will assist with the
  investigation and reporting of mishaps." If that type of wording is not in the contract, contact
  the CA on how to proceed.
     3.4.5.1. On an ISB, only the BP or IO can authorize the offering of the promise of
     confidentiality, and only under the conditions established in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3.
     Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright cooperation
     of the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses. Limiting the
     persons authorized to make the promises of confidentiality does not mean the ISB
     President must be present at all witness interviews.
     3.4.5.2. Ensure each interview or written statement includes privilege or non-privilege
     documentation. Review the interviewee's involvement in the mishap and willingness to
     provide information to determine whether to offer a promise of confidentiality or not.
         3.4.5.2.1. Privileged Interviews. For privileged interviews, whether written or
         recorded, all witnesses sign the form from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, Witness
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         25


         Promise of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement. This only needs to be
         accomplished once for recorded interviews but must be done for ALL written
         statements whether initial or subsequent follow-up.
         3.4.5.2.2. For recorded privileged interviews ensure all interviewees are read the
         Notice to Witness Documenting Promise of Confidentiality of Recorded Statements
         from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done
         for ALL recorded interviews whether initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.
         3.4.5.2.3. Non-Privileged Interviews. For non-privileged interviews, whether written
         or recorded, all interviewees sign the form from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, Non-
         Privileged Witness Statement. This only needs to be accomplished once for recorded
         interviews but must be done for ALL written statements whether initial or subsequent
         follow-up.
         3.4.5.2.4. For recorded non-privileged interviews ensure all interviewees are read the
         Notice to Witness that Recorded Statement is not Confidential from AFI 91-204
         Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL
         recorded interviews whether initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.
     3.4.5.3. It is vital that when testimony is solicited, the ISB member does so without
     influencing the witness’ recollection. The member conducting the interview must not
     lead the witness but rather allow the witness to simply recount the details surrounding the
     mishap as he or she observed or experienced the events. Begin with general questions
     such as “Can you please tell me what happened from the beginning of the duty day until
     the mishap occurred?” Do not interrupt the witness’ testimony. Allow them to tell their
     story and ask any clarifying questions when they are complete. Also, don’t assume the
     terminology used by all weapon systems is the same. If the SIB arrival will be delayed
     and additional, focused interviews by the ISB are needed, contact HQ AFSEC/SEF and
     the SIB President for additional interview guidance.
     3.4.5.4. The ISB should transcribe pertinent interviews prior to the SIB’s arrival if
     personnel and time is available. This will prove invaluable to the SIB as it begins the
     formal investigation since the ISB member can be present during handover to clarify
     difficult to understand words or jargon.
  3.4.6. Ensure all equipment associated with the mishap is impounded (IAW AFI 21-101 and
  AFI 91-204) and turned over to the SIB. The ISB should create an inventory list and transfer
  it to the SIB. Coordinate with the Maintenance Group Commander or designated
  impoundment authority to ensure aircraft and equipment impoundment is properly
  accomplished. Immediately notify other bases with involved equipment of the need for
  impoundment.
  3.4.7. Photographic and Video Evidence. Digital and video images can be effectively used
  as evidence. Keep a list and description of photos taken. This listing should include, as a
  minimum, the location of the part(s) being photographed (in relation to main wreckage and
  including GPS coordinates) and what was photographed (e.g., left flap actuator, right wing
  tip, ground scar, etc.). Ensure all images are properly protected from release to the public.
  To ensure no potentially privileged or inappropriate photographs (e.g., staged/diagrammed
  photos, human remains, etc.) are inadvertently disclosed to the public, all mishap-related
26                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


  photographs/videos taken by individuals who have authorized access to the mishap site must
  be approved by the BP via the CA prior to being considered for public release by the public
  affairs office. Investigators should ensure no unauthorized photographs/videos are taken
  within the mishap site. The host unit will provide digital photography support. Personal
  cameras and cell phone photography is forbidden unless used for official photos with BP
  authorization. For release authority of electronic images, refer to guidance in AFI 91-204,
  Chapter 5.
  3.4.8. Coordinate with IC/ROC to ensure access to the mishap site is closely controlled.
  Only those with a legitimate need to be at the mishap site will be included on the entry access
  list (EAL). Additionally, on military property, and when possible on civil property,
  photography at the site will be closely controlled to prevent inadvertent release of potentially
  privileged photographs, photographs of human remains, etc. Non-ISB/SIB members who are
  granted temporary access to the mishap site will be escorted by an ISB/SIB member who will
  ensure evidence is not contaminated and will collect all copies of the photos taken. The ISB
  BP will coordinate these requirements directly with the IC/ROC. The ISB BP will not
  assume the role of IC or ROC.
  3.4.9. If wreckage or evidence must be moved due to operational necessity or other
  circumstances prior to the SIB’s arrival, the ISB will document the scene as thoroughly as
  possible using both still photographs and video. Aerial perspectives may prove particularly
  useful in these cases. Ensure photo or video documentation of both the wreckage as
  discovered and the removal process is accomplished.
  3.4.10. Medical Evidence Preservation.
     3.4.10.1. Preserve perishable evidence (by using video and still photography at the
     mishap site), collect laboratory samples, complete radiological studies, and obtain initial
     statements such as the 72-hour and 14-day medical histories. Every attempt should be
     made to collect 72-hour and 14-day medical histories without the promise of
     confidentiality. Only the ISB BP, ISB IO, SIB BP, or SIB IO/SIO can authorize offering
     of the promise of confidentiality.
     3.4.10.2. Ensure evidence not associated with human remains (e.g., AFE, aircraft egress
     systems, etc.) is left undisturbed at the mishap site until the evidence is turned over to the
     SIB or when directed by the SIB President. Carefully photograph and examine personal
     flight equipment and escape equipment if their removal from the remains is required.
     3.4.10.3. Ensure medical, mental health, family advocacy, pharmacy, and dental records
     are collected and shipped to the SIB (as needed) for all involved personnel.
  3.4.11. Fatalities.
     3.4.11.1. The ISB medical officer and mortuary affairs officer (when assigned by the
     command) will collect and preserve life sciences evidence as required. The ISB medical
     officer should be present before human remains are removed from the mishap site when
     possible. Great care must be taken to ensure a positive chain of custody for all human
     remains. If any chain of custody issues arise, contact the CA immediately. The
     following steps will be conducted by or under the supervision of the ISB medical officer:
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          27


     3.4.11.2. Contact the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) to coordinate
     forensic pathology assistance. AFMES can be reached at http://www.afmes.mil or via
     telephone at DSN 366-8648 or (302) 346-8648. Contact HQ AFSEC/SEH (DSN 263-
     4868, Comm (505) 853-4868) if further assistance is needed.
     3.4.11.3. Before moving any human remains, determine jurisdiction (legal control) for
     those remains. In most cases, the local coroner or medical examiner will have
     jurisdiction over the remains. Jurisdiction issues for geographic areas surrounding
     military installations and ranges should be delineated ahead of time during incident
     response planning. Most FAA Regional Medical Examiners maintain a database
     delineating the areas of jurisdiction and may be of assistance in clarifying these issues.
     3.4.11.4. Complete detailed site diagramming before any human remains are moved.
     Use clearly labeled stakes and take sufficient photographs recording pertinent details.
     3.4.11.5. Remove human remains only after completely documenting and closely
     scrutinizing all surfaces of remains with on-scene photography. Ensure photographs
     include adjacent structures which could account for traumatic injuries or objects which
     show evidence of tissue transfer.
  3.4.12. The ISB President will conduct a hand-off briefing to the SIB. This briefing will
  provide a full accounting of all evidence on and off-station or in transit. All members of both
  the ISB and the SIB will be present during the briefing unless approved by the SIB BP.
  Briefing should also include ISB actions accomplished to date, site hazards, etc., as well as a
  local area safety brief (see paragraph 5.1). This should be accomplished prior to the joint
  ISB/SIB site visit if one is conducted. The hand-off briefing should contain, as a minimum,
  the following information as applicable:
     3.4.12.1. Location/condition of the accident scene, including collateral property damage.
     3.4.12.2. Actions taken by emergency response forces that affected the scene or
     wreckage.
     3.4.12.3. Location/condition of participants/survivors, including any bystanders killed/
     injured.
     3.4.12.4. Status of toxicological testing, autopsies, etc.
     3.4.12.5. Next-of-kin notification status.
     3.4.12.6. Location/condition/status of wreckage, including all classified equipment.
     3.4.12.7. Presence of munitions, composites, or other hazardous materials at scene
     (including potential for blood borne pathogens based on presence of human remains).
     3.4.12.8. Civil authorities involved in managing scene/casualties.
     3.4.12.9. Status of records impoundment actions (refer to individual ISB member
     guidelines below for list).
     3.4.12.10. Status of witness search/statement collection.
     3.4.12.11. Technical reports issued to date.
     3.4.12.12. Technical assistance immediately available/offered/en route.

     3.4.12.13. Media interest/statements made to date.
     3.4.12.14. Logistical arrangements in place for permanent board (work center,
     communications, transportation, billeting, personal equipment, etc.).
  3.4.13. Once the hand-off is complete, the ISB will discontinue any involvement in the
  investigation or discussion of the mishap except when the SIB seeks further clarification.
  3.4.14. Coordinate with the IC/ROC to update the mishap site EAL with the members of the
  SIB. This will expedite a joint site visit by the ISB and the SIB. Following the handover, all
  ISB members’ names will be removed from the EAL.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          29

   SAFETY INVESTIGATION BOARD (SIB) / SINGLE INVESTIGATING OFFICER
                        (SIO) REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General Guidelines and SIB Composition. The SIB member or SIO duties prescribed by
this instruction take precedence over all other duties while the SIB is convened. SIB members
will be relieved of all non-SIB duties while supporting the investigation. Table 4.1. establishes
the minimum requirements. Board Presidents (BP) may request additional board members from
the CA. If the CA concurs with request, the CA will source these members. The CA will
identify additional members as necessary to thoroughly investigate and document a mishap
(reference paragraphs 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4). The CA may request a waiver to the minimum
requirements by contacting HQ AFSEC/SEF to request an AF/SE waiver. Note: If a CA
chooses to convene a non-Class A investigation board with SIB members required for a Class A
board, the CA should consider requiring a formal report with all tabs and requiring the SIB to
provide the CA with a formal out-briefing.
      4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Class A aviation mishap SIB Procedures are as follows.
      Following notification of a Class A aviation mishap, HQ PACAF/SEF will contact each wing
      and NAF Chief of Safety to identify available trained SIB members for each required board
      position with the exception of the Medical Officer, the AFE Member and the AFSEC
      Representative. Wing/SE offices will submit names through the NAF/SE offices who will
      select only the most highly qualified candidates to forward to HQ PACAF/SE. Potential
      Board Presidents will be forwarded by PACAF/SE to the Commander, Pacific Air Forces, for
      approval. After all SIB positions are filled; HQ PACAF/SE will publish the SIB orders.

Notes:

1. For Class A and B mishaps, the BP (including IO if no BP) must always be equal to or higher
in rank than the highest ranking individual involved in the mishap. If the mishap involved a
fatality, the BP must be a Brigadier General select or higher in rank.

2. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than Class D damage external to
the engine. If the confined damage was caused by Foreign Object Damage (FOD) or known
material deficiency with established corrective actions, the investigation may be completed with
an SIO. If the confined damage was not caused by FOD or was caused by a materiel deficiency
previously unknown or for which corrective actions have not been established, immediately
upgrade to a SIB based on mishap class IAW Table 4.1.

3. An AFSEC Representative is a required primary board member on all Class A investigations
involving a destroyed manned aircraft (MAJCOM must assess and declare the aircraft destroyed)
or a fatality. AFSEC representation on other SIBs will be considered in those cases where
AF/SE or the CA deems AFSEC representation crucial due to the nature of the mishap and the
significant and broad-reaching implications to the Air Force. In those cases, AF/SE will
determine availability and extent of participation. Additionally, the AFSEC may provide an
AFSEC representative on other Class A SIBs with the concurrence of the CA.

4. DoDI 6055.07 describes a Group 4 RPA (including the MQ-1) as “typically weighs more than
1,320 pounds and normally operates below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) at any speed.” A
Group 5 RPA (e.g., MQ-9, RQ-4) is described as “typically weighs more than 1,320 pounds and
normally operates higher than 18,000 feet MSL at any speed.”

5. For mishaps that involve certain focus areas (e.g., human factors, maintenance, etc.), assign
primary members experienced/qualified in that focus area in order to thoroughly investigate the
mishap.

6. For Air Reserve Component (ARC) Class B mishaps, the requirements in Table 4.1. are
recommended.
4.2. Safety Investigation Personnel Requirements, Restrictions, and Roles. Safety
investigations are conducted by either an SIO (typically Class C and D mishaps or Class E
events) or by a SIB (Class A/B mishaps). SIB personnel fall into one of four categories:
Primary members, “Conditional” Primary members, Secondary members, and Observers.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         31


  4.2.1. Primary SIB members. Primary SIB members determine findings, causes, and
  recommendations, and any primary member may submit a minority report (refer to Chapter 6
  of this manual) if they do not agree with the BP in the outcome of the investigation. Primary
  members are the only SIB members authorized to sign the Authentication Page of Tab T.
  The following requirements apply to all Aviation SIBs:
     4.2.1.1. Board President (BP). The BP is in charge of the SIB, is the final decision
     authority, and reports directly to the CA. The SIB BP should coordinate site access
     requirements directly with the IC/ROC. The BP will not assume the role of IC/ROC at
     any point during the investigation.

     investigation process expert to guide SIB analysis efforts. He or she conducts “refresher
     training” of SIB procedures and is familiar with technical assistance resources which may
     be required by the SIB. An AFSEC Representative that is assigned to and is on-site with
     the SIB is considered a primary member. AFSEC Representatives that support a SIB
     telephonically are not primary members but are considered required consultants to the
     SIB. If appointed, the AFSEC representative (or AFSEC telephonic advisor in the
     absence of an on-site representative) should be the single point of contact with AFSEC
     for the duration of the investigation.
        4.2.1.4.1. The AFSEC Representative works directly for the BP and is charged with
        facilitating the proceedings of the entire board. This includes helping the SIB
        President and IO formulate an overall investigative strategy and schedule, as well as
        lending his/her expertise to specific investigative issues. Because the AFSEC
        Representative will normally have completed multiple SIBs and reviewed many
        others, he or she is considered the expert regarding the process and is included in all
        aspects of the investigation. Specific duties include:
            4.2.1.4.1.1. Leading the development of findings and recommendations by first
            educating SIB members on the process and then guiding the SIB through

AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            37


     4.2.2.11. Crash Fire & Rescue (CFR) Member. Assign this member if CFR response,
     actions, or failures were suspected to have played a major role or contributed
     significantly to the extent of damage or injuries.
     4.2.2.12. AFFSA Member. Assign this member if instrument flight procedures or
     publications are involved. The CA coordinates with AFFSA/CC, DSN 884-6562 for
     assistance.
     4.2.2.13. Nuclear Expert. Assign this member if nuclear reactors, nuclear power
     systems, or radioactive sources are involved.
     4.2.2.14. Defense Contracting Management Agency Member. Assign this member if
     contract maintenance and operations are involved and government oversight and
     contractor actions may be factors in the mishap.
  4.2.3. Secondary Members. Secondary Members assist the SIB in mishap investigation and
  reporting. The BP determines the extent of their participation. They are not authorized to
  submit a minority report and do not sign the Authentication Page of the Tab T. Any
  additional member subordinate to a Primary Member will be designated as a Secondary
  Member and will not be a Primary Member (i.e., if there are two AFE members, one will be
  primary and one will be secondary). If the BP determines a conditional primary member’s
  area of expertise is not a factor in the mishap but that member’s expertise is still needed, then
  this member serves as a Secondary Member. The following Secondary Members may be
  added as indicated:
     4.2.3.1. AFE Members. If the mishap involved a successful ground egress with no
     injuries, an AFE Member may be assigned as a Secondary Member unless an AFE
     Member is already assigned as a Primary Member.
     4.2.3.2. Technical Engineering Member. If an investigation requires a significant level
     of technical expert involvement, as defined by the CA, a member should be assigned to
     lead these efforts. This member must have a technical background compatible with the
     technical nature of the investigation. HQ AFSEC/SEFE will be the coordinating agency
     for sourcing this member.
         4.2.3.2.1. This member must either be military or a government civilian employee
         but cannot be a contractor.
     4.2.3.3. Technical Assistance Members. These members can be from various technical
     backgrounds and training levels to include contractor safety/technical personnel. If a
     Technical Engineering Member is appointed, he or she is the lead for the Technical
     Assistance members. HQ AFSEC/SEFE will be consulted for sourcing these members.
     4.2.3.4. Recorder. An officer or NCO familiar with administrative procedures and
     experienced in the use of typical office computer software. Normally, recorders come
     from the base providing support to the SIB. If possible the ISB recorder should transfer
     directly to the SIB. The recorder’s primary objectives are to:
         4.2.3.4.1. Coordinate with the AFSEC Representative, or the IO if no AFSEC
         Representative is present, to ensure full administrative and logistical support is
         provided to the board.
38                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


         4.2.3.4.2. Manage the work center, control access, and make it an effective
         communications focal point for all board activities.
         4.2.3.4.3. Supervise all additional administrative assistants assigned to the board.
         4.2.3.4.4. Maintain a filing system to account for all evidence, testimony, and board
         proceedings, both electronically and physically, to ensure security and prevent loss.
         4.2.3.4.5. Assist the AFSEC Representative, BP, and IO with the compilation,
         assembly, and distribution of the formal report electronically and in AFSAS.
         4.2.3.4.6. Assist the BP with the administrative portion of the preparation of a
         briefing to summarize the mishap formal report to the CA.
         4.2.3.4.7. Assist the AFSEC Representative or IO to facilitate a smooth hand-off of
         factual material and evidence to the AIB.
     4.2.3.5. Representatives from the FAA or NTSB, if appropriate.            See AFI 91-204,
     Chapter 4, and AFI 91-206(I).
     4.2.3.6. Commander’s Representative. The SIB BP may request a representative from
     the commander whose assets were involved in the mishap, subject to CA approval. The
     commander who owns those assets may also request to have a representative on the
     board. The Commander’s Representative’s role is limited to providing basic information
     to the SIB regarding operational and organizational details and practices to help the SIB
     determine who to interview, mishap organization hierarchy, etc. This individual is
     considered the expert on local procedures, local command relationships, organizational
     structure, and unit personalities. The Commander's Representative’s presence on a SIB
     will not substitute for interviews with mishap principals.
         4.2.3.6.1. The Commander’s Representative must not have had any involvement in
         the mishap event and must not have supervised or trained involved persons. This
         individual will have no affiliation with a follow-on AIB. The Commander’s
         Representative is strictly prohibited from providing any information regarding the
         SIB investigation to anyone outside the SIB, including his/her commander or chain of
         command.
     4.2.3.7. Additional Personnel. Personnel determined by AF/SE to be necessary and
     appropriate under cooperative agreements (e.g., foreign military representatives).
     4.2.3.8. Administrative Specialists. NCOs or airmen that assist the SIB with
     administrative tasks such as building formal report tabs, transcribing interviews,
     answering phones, or filing.
     4.2.3.9. Cyberspace Member. If there is a possibility that Cyberspace systems were
     involved in the mishap, an expert in this area may be requested to support the
     investigation.
  4.2.4. Observers. Civil aviation, foreign military, and sister service personnel may request to
  observe the Air Force investigation. An observer is not a member of the Air Force SIB.
  Requests for observers must be approved by both AF/SE and the CA. DoD Observers may
  participate to the extent authorized by the BP. Non-DoD observers may not participate in
  privileged SIB proceedings or have access to confidential testimony or other privileged
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                     39


  information. Non-DoD Observers may participate in other SIB proceedings to the extent
  authorized by the BP. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 5 and AFI 91-206(I) for additional guidance.
 40                                          AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


                                           Chapter 5

               CONDUCTING THE FORMAL SAFETY INVESTIGATION

5.1. Handover Briefing. The SIB BP will ensure the SIB receives a handover briefing from the
ISB to include an updated site hazard briefing from either the ISB or IC/ROC prior to the initial
site visit. See paragraph 3.4.12. for details on the handover briefing. The handover between
boards marks the end of the ISB’s involvement in the investigation.
5.2. Entry Access List (EAL). The SIB will ensure the mishap site EAL is updated by adding
the SIB members and removing the ISB members.
5.3. Investigative Evidence.
   5.3.1. The SIB will make a full accounting of all evidence that has been collected or
   impounded at all geographic locations before releasing the ISB.
   5.3.2. In the event of fatalities, great care must be taken to ensure a positive chain of custody
   for all human remains. If any chain of custody issues arise, contact the CA immediately.
   5.3.3. All privileged safety information must be protected IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. The
   Investigating Officer or AFSEC Representative will provide all members of the SIB a
   refresher briefing on the concept of safety privilege immediately prior to beginning the
   investigation. This may be accomplished by viewing the video located on AFSEC JAG
   Portal page (found on the AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : JAG :
   Protecting Privileged Safety Information). All members of the SIB given or provided access
   to privileged safety information, to include administration support, must have a Safety
   Investigation Non-Disclosure Agreement (AFI 91-204 Attachment 3) on file with the SIB.
   5.3.4. Written or Verbal Testimony. On a SIB, only BP, IO, or SIO can authorize the
   offering of the promise of confidentiality under the conditions established in AFI 91-204,
   Chapter 3. Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright
   cooperation of the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses. Limiting
   the persons authorized to make the promises of confidentiality does not mean that the SIB
   President or the IO must be present at all witness interviews. The SIB President may task
   this offering to the member of the SIB accomplishing the interview. Ensure each statement
   or interview document is appropriately marked to indicate whether it is provided under
   privilege or not.
       5.3.4.1. For interviews with contractors (contract maintenance, etc.) involved in the
       mishap, ensure the contract wording provides for cooperation with Safety Investigation
       Boards (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Clause 252.228-7005, Accident
       Reporting and Investigation Involving Aircraft, Missiles, and Space Launch Vehicles).
       Have QA/Contracting Office Representative or the Government Flight Representative
       review the contract; look for wording like "…the service provider will assist with the
       investigation and reporting of mishaps." If that type of wording is not in the contract,
       contact the CA on how to proceed.
       5.3.4.2. Privileged Interviews. For privileged interviews (including 72-hour and 14-day
       histories), whether written or recorded, all interviewees sign the form from AFI 91-204
       Attachment 3, Witness Promise of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement. This
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         41


     only needs to be accomplished once for recorded interviews but must be done for ALL
     written statements whether initial or subsequent follow-up.
     5.3.4.3. For recorded privileged interviews ensure all interviewees are read the Notice to
     Witness Documenting Promise of Confidentiality of Recorded Statements, AFI 91-204
     Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL recorded
     interviews whether initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.
     5.3.4.4. Non-Privileged Interviews. For non-privileged interviews (including 72-hour
     and 14-day histories), whether written or recorded, all interviewees sign the form from
     AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, Non-Privileged Witness Statement. This only needs to be
     accomplished once for recorded interviews but must be done for ALL written statements
     whether initial or subsequent follow-up. During the interview, ensure questions are not
     derived from privileged sources. If it is determined after the interview that privileged
     information was divulged, the entire interview is now considered privileged. The
     interviewee must be notified and must sign the form from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3,
     Witness Promise of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement.
     5.3.4.5. For recorded non-privileged interviews ensure all interviewees are read the
     Notice to Witness that Recorded Statement is not Confidential from AFI 91-204
     Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL recorded
     interviews whether initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.
     5.3.4.6. Give a complete list of all witnesses to the AIB regardless of whether the
     statements of the witnesses are in the safety report. Include contact information such as
     addresses and telephone numbers. Provide the names of witnesses to the AIB only after
     the SIB decides to conduct no further interviews of any of the witnesses (Contact HQ
     AFSEC/JA for guidance in unusual mishaps where the SIB may release witnesses to the
     AIB before completing interviews of all witnesses).
  5.3.5. Photographic and Video Evidence. Digital and video images can be effectively used
  as evidence. Keep a list and description of photos taken. This listing should include, as a
  minimum, the location of the part(s) being photographed (in relation to main wreckage and
  including GPS coordinates) and what was photographed (left flap actuator, right wing tip,
  ground scar, etc.). Photos or videos which do not suggest SIB analysis are non-privileged.
  Photos or videos that indicate interpretation or analysis by primary SIB members are
  privileged. These include staged photographs, simulated reenactments, etc. Photos and
  videos produced by technical experts as a part of field or laboratory analysis of factual
  evidence are non-privileged. This includes parts reconstruction, measurement of debris field,
  parts locations and dimensions, identification of key features and witness marks,
  identification of failure sequences, etc. Still images that are privileged should be marked as
  such to include use of digital watermarks or coding on digital photos or video. To ensure all
  images are properly protected from inadvertent release to the public, especially those
  identified as privileged, all photographs relating to the mishap to be released by Public
  Affairs must be approved by the CA via the BP prior to release. Investigators should ensure
  no unauthorized photography takes place at the mishap site. Only those authorized by the
  ISB/SIB President or ISB/SIB IO should record images or video. The host unit will provide
  digital photography support. Any photography not authorized by ISB/SIB President or
  ISB/SIB IO is forbidden. Personal imaging devices, such as cell phones for photos by SIB
42                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


  members, may not be used without ISB/SIB President or ISB/SIB IO authorization. For
  release authority of electronic images refer to guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 5.
  5.3.6. Recorded data, data analysis, simulation, and animation tools. The Mishap Analysis
  & Animation Facility (MAAF) at HQ AFSEC is the central Air Force agency for recovery,
  transcription, analysis, simulation, and animation of all data in support of Air Force Safety
  Investigations. The ISB should have downloaded perishable data and sent FDRs, CVRs, or
  other recorded media and devices to the appropriate location. If unsure of where to send
  devices, contact the CA SEF or HQ AFSEC/SEFE at DSN 246-5867 or (505) 846-5867. If
  this has not been accomplished, the SIB will make it an immediate priority.
     5.3.6.1. Transcription and analysis of recorded flight data will be reviewed by HQ
     AFSEC/SEFE to ensure the validity, limitations, and appropriate use are addressed.
     Simulation and animation products and tools, including those generated from contractor
     simulators, test range data systems, training range data systems, tactical data links, and
     companion aircraft used by the SIB for analysis and briefing purposes must meet the
     highest standards of completeness and accuracy to adequately support investigative
     thoroughness. However, the MAAF is not staffed, in either manpower or expertise, to
     provide other services such as the development or editing of multimedia products to be
     used solely as briefing aids.
     5.3.6.2. The MAAF will be the primary source for animations intended to represent the
     actual mishap sequence. If the MAAF cannot produce a specific mishap animation, or if
     additional animations are produced, SIB/SIOs will submit externally-generated mishap
     animations to the MAAF for review. The MAAF will analyze the externally-generated
     animation for any shortfalls, inadequacies, or inaccuracies that may impact accurate SIB
     deliberations or CA conclusions. The CA, through their SE, will decide whether the
     SIB/SIO will use the animation in analysis or briefings. If it is not used, they will not
     enter the animation into the formal report tabs. All animation products must be
     appropriately marked to indicate whether they are privileged or not.
     5.3.6.3. The Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) program, managed
     by HQ AFSEC personnel, has the capability, using flight data recorder information only,
     to provide flight data analysis and animation products for those fleets that currently
     employ MFOQA analyses. There may be times when the MAAF is unable to support
     the analysis/animation requirements of a mishap or incident investigator, or when MAAF
     personnel and the MFOQA program manager determine the MFOQA analysis capability
     is better suited to the investigation requirements. In these cases, MAAF personnel will
     coordinate with the MFOQA program manager to establish investigation support.
  5.3.7. Proactive Aviation Safety programs, such as MFOQA and Line Operations Safety
  Audit (LOSA), can be used to provide evidentiary information to SIBs as part of their
  deliberative processes. Unusual events, threats and errors encountered during routine
  operations and documented through proactive safety programs often are the same factors
  present during a mishap chain of events; contextual factors, such as weather or terrain, may
  determine the severity of the outcome of a chain of events. Mishap investigators can use data
  from proactive programs to determine if and how similar factors found in a mishap were
  encountered during non-mishap events and then can assess what contextual differences
  mitigated the severity of the non-mishap events. Proactive safety data can prove particularly
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            43


   helpful when investigating whether the actions of mishap aircrew constituted isolated events
   or whether such actions form part of a larger pattern of normalization of deviation from
   established procedures.
       5.3.7.1. The MFOQA Program has the capability to analyze historical flight data for a
       given MDS, operating location, or phase of flight. Such analyses may be requested based
       on the SIB/IO needs and may include: analysis of the incident file; animation of the
       incident file; historical analyses of similar operational activities (trends) of data
       associated with the affected aircraft tail number and of the location where the event
       occurred (same and additional tail numbers); and running of interpretive models. MAAF
       personnel will coordinate with the MFOQA program manager to establish investigation
       support.
       5.3.7.2. The LOSA program produces reports of non-punitive and unobtrusive peer-to-
       peer cockpit observations. LOSA reports contain safety-related flight data collected
       during normal operations in order to assess safety margins and improvement measures.
       LOSA reports can be used by a SIB/IO as evidence of previously documented threats and
       errors encountered by aircrew, of how such threats and errors were managed, and of the
       outcome of such events. LOSA reports also may provide excellent insights into training
       and organizational culture. LOSA reports are filed as Class E incidents in AFSAS.
5.4. Safety History Analysis. The SIB should have the AFSEC or safety trained representative
conduct historical research in AFSAS early in the investigation. Specific areas of inquiry may
include, but are not limited to:
   5.4.1. Mishap history (aircraft, unit, individual).
   5.4.2. Similar mishap sequences (all classes of mishaps).
   5.4.3. Prior recommendations to address similar mishap circumstances.
5.5. Surveys. A survey can substitute for observations and interviews. Surveys are particularly
useful when investigators doubt that face-to-face interviews will yield valid answers to their
questions. Surveys are also useful when investigators lack time to interview. Surveys can be
very useful to a SIB, but there are some pitfalls with conducting a survey that SIBs need to
overcome before deciding on a survey. Poorly designed and poorly executed surveys may yield
invalid data and mislead investigators. It is tempting to apply statistics to summarized survey
results. Investigators must recognize the risks of applying statistics to survey data.
   5.5.1. There are many types of surveys. They can be as simple as asking a single yes-no
   question. They can be as complex as multi-item branching questions with combinations of
   forced choice, narrative, and Likert-type responses. In every case, investigators should strive
   to create a survey that meets the requirements of reliability and validity. Investigators should
   take time and care in developing, testing, administering, and interpreting surveys.
   5.5.2. Survey development requires the same attention as every other part of the
   investigation process. There are countless texts and scholarly journals that will offer the
   investigator useful guidance. When considering the use of a survey, understand that it may
   take several hours to learn about survey techniques and several hours more to develop. A
   checklist that serves as a good place to start is included in the SIB Support Documents (AF
   Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Products and Services : SIB Support).
 44                                            AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   The checklist is neither authoritative nor universally accepted, but is provided for reference.
   Contact AFSEC/SEH (DSN 246-0677) for assistance with formal survey development and
   validation.
5.6. Removing Wreckage from the Mishap Scene. The SIB will coordinate wreckage
recovery through the IC/ROC. In most cases the SIB travels to the location of the mishap;
however, combat zones present unique challenges, and in certain cases such as RPA mishaps,
evidence (including data recorders, aircraft components, sections of airframes, etc.) may need to
be shipped out of the AOR to a suitable location for analysis.
   5.6.1. Prior to having mishap parts analyzed/torn down, etc., call the Engineering Tech
   Assist Hotline at the AF Safety Center at DSN 246-5867. They will determine who to
   contact, where to send parts, whether it would be better to have the analysis performed at the
   SIB’s location, etc. Do not send parts for analysis without coordinating with AFSEC/SEFE
   first. Additionally, do not attempt field disassembly of the suspect components without prior
   coordination with HQ AFSEC/SEFE.
   5.6.2. The key to getting a part to a suitable location for analysis is to treat all critical aircraft
   components needing shipment as time critical investigative evidence. AFI 91-204, Chapter
   2, instructs the Commander of the active duty Air Force installation nearest the mishap to
   provide logistical and investigative support as required. In cases where AOR airfields are
   predominately non-Air Force, paragraph 2.5. would be applicable to the Commander of an
   active duty Air Force Wing with an SE office nearest the mishap. Contingency funds will
   reimburse the shipping agency for a mishap that occurred while supporting a contingency
   mission. To ensure reimbursement, the shipping agency must use the appropriate Emergency
   and Special Program (ESP) Code based on their MAJCOM and the AOR.
   5.6.3. Investigative evidence will be shipped via the nearest (local) Traffic Management
   Office (TMO) or Distribution Flight. When laboratory analysis is requested or a deficiency
   report (DR) submitted for components suspected of being critical to the cause of a Class A or
   B mishap, such as data recorders or suspect components, the BP should consider designating
   an individual fully conversant with all factors involved in the mishap to accompany the
   components. This individual should observe the laboratory analysis or teardown and will
   request a preliminary evaluation for the SIB. If a part cannot be hand carried, ship the part
   via commercial carrier (FedEx, UPS, etc.), if possible, to ensure proper tracking and priority
   shipping. If military transport is used to move wreckage, ensure proper tracking information
   (signature service cargo) and priority shipping is obtained. Ensure the SIB receives a copy of
   all wreckage tracking information.
   5.6.4. For non-critical shipment of evidence, use Air Force organization and assets to the
   maximum extent possible. The shipping agency will set the priority of the cargo for channel
   flights IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo, Chapter 3.
   Investigative evidence will be priority coded TP-1. In some instances, the shipping agency
   may also need to provide a priority shipping letter to accompany the request.
   5.6.5. Underwater Salvage. If recovery or salvage of floating debris or submerged wreckage
   is required but is beyond the capabilities of the base concerned, the SIB will request the CA
   contract with commercial salvage operations or request help from the US Navy. The SIB
   will not undertake procuring salvage assets without first coordinating with the CA. Failure to
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             45


   do so may contractually obligate the Air Force without proper approval resulting in
   individual disciplinary action.
       5.6.5.1. (Added-PACAF) If necessary, requests underwater salvage support through
       HQ PACAF/SEF, who will contact Naval Sea Systems Command for assistance.
   5.6.6. Cleanup, restoration, and security of the mishap scene are not SIB functions. Refer all
   questions to the IC/ROC.
5.7. Disposition of Evidence.
   5.7.1. All non-privileged evidence not included in Tabs A through S will be transferred to
   the AIB and acknowledged in writing by the AIB BP or Legal Advisor. The SIB will
   transfer all non-privileged evidence and Part 1 documents to the AIB. The legal board is
   responsible for final disposition of all material released to them by the SIB. If there is no
   follow on legal board, contact the CA staff judge advocate for guidance on disposing of
   materials that may be needed in potential claims or litigation. An example Tab Q transmittal
   letter can be found on the AFSEC Portal page (AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety
   Center : Products and Services : SIB Support). If there are no such requirements, make
   enough copies of pertinent evidence for the safety report and then return the original
   documents and records to their proper custodian. These copies will be disposed of IAW
   guidance in paragraph 5.7. of this manual.
   5.7.2. All hardware sent for analysis must include disposition instructions. The SIB/SIO
   must remind the laboratory to not destroy or release the hardware to anyone until receiving
   written approval from the SIB, a follow-on AIB, or owning unit as applicable. The SIB must
   document the disposition of all evidence that has been shipped for analysis in a MFR and
   provide this listing as an item in Tab Q for handoff to the AIB.
   5.7.3. Ensure the AIB President knows the disposition of all non-privileged evidence, to
   include wreckage and components shipped for analysis. The AIB must acknowledge their
   custodial responsibility in writing. Inform the host installation commander of the transfer.
   If the AIB President is not available and the SIB is prepared to release the evidence, release it
   to the host installation staff judge advocate (SJA), who will maintain custody until the AIB
   President is able to accept. If there is not a follow on AIB, transfer custody of the evidence
   to the host installation commander or, if directed by the host installation commander, to the
   SJA. Transfer may be made to tenant units, as appropriate, with written agreement between
   the installation commander and tenant unit commander. For additional information refer to
   AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations.
   5.7.4. Evidence used by the SIB to construct Part 1 of the report such as pilot training
   records, aircraft maintenance records, etc., must be retained for handover to the AIB.
   Oftentimes the wing will ask that certain records be returned so they can put an aircraft back
   in service, return a pilot to the cockpit, etc. If they require documentation to conduct these
   types of activities, give them copies of the applicable forms and retain the originals for the
   AIB. Before turning anything back over to the wing, contact the AIB President and get
   his/her approval first and document the transaction/conversations in a MFR. Follow these
   same procedures for any servicing equipment tested and ready to be returned to the wing.
   Have the MM draft an MFR and add it to the SIB files after getting approval from the AIB
 46                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   President. If an AIB has not been assigned, document the condition of the equipment via an
   MFR and return it to the owning agency.
   5.7.5. When the SIB is done with usable personal equipment or protective gear that is USAF
   property, return it to the possessor of record or to the issuing authority. Prior to release by
   the SIB, coordinate with the AIB President for approval and document the release via a
   Memo for Record. Clearly mark the item to indicate its involvement in a mishap to ensure
   the necessary inspections are accomplished prior to reissue. Examples include flight helmets,
   g-suits, flight publications, etc.
   5.7.6. Quickly analyze personal items impounded as investigative evidence and return them
   to the owner, summary court officer, or next of kin. Coordinate the releasing of these items
   through the AIB President and document the release via a Memo for Record when no longer
   needed for the investigation. If there is not an AIB, coordinate with the CA. Contact HQ
   AFSEC/JA for assistance if necessary.
   5.7.7. Privileged evidence will not be handed over to the AIB or the host wing. Transfer this
   data (SIB working files, tapes containing privileged witness interviews, staged photographs,
   etc.) to the AFSEC Rep, if assigned to the SIB, or the MAJCOM/SEF. Files will be
   destroyed after the Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) is released.
5.8. Technical Analysis.
   5.8.1. If a premature failure of a component or other deficiency is suspected, submit a
   deficiency report (DR) IAW T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating,
   or other MDS-specific reporting system. Do not attempt field disassembly of the suspect
   components without prior coordination with HQ AFSEC/SEFE. The SIB or SIO must enter
   the DR number in the appropriate field in the Object section of the AFSAS report. This will
   ensure proper tracking throughout the investigation and after the close out of the report.
   5.8.2. Reference T.O. 00-35D-54 for proper classification and instructions. Consider
   initiating a Category I DR for any mishap if a potential exists for the item to cause a future
   Class A mishap. Request priority teardown of suspect components by coordinating with HQ
   AFSEC/SEFE.
       5.8.2.1. If a DR cannot be completed before the final report is to be submitted, confer
       with the convening authority to determine if the SIB should extend in place or de-
       convene until the analysis is complete. If a preliminary DR report is available,
       consideration may be given to submit this report with the investigation final report in
       AFSAS. If the final DR report is significantly different, changes to findings, causes, and
       recommendations can be addressed in the MOFE comments or the investigation can be
       reopened to make changes.
   5.8.3. To determine where to send a DR exhibit, contact HQ AFSEC/SEFE. In most cases,
   teardown and analysis will be conducted by a DoD facility. Do not directly contact
   contractors or vendors for teardown and analysis without first speaking to HQ AFSEC/SEFE
   (DSN 246-5867 or (505) 846-5867). Failure to do so may contractually obligate the Air
   Force without proper approval resulting in individual disciplinary action.
   5.8.4. Handle and ship exhibits IAW T.O. 00-35D-54. In some cases, exhibits will be
   shipped via alternate means and to locations other than identified in the DR system.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            47


   Additionally, T.O. 00-85-20, Engine Shipping Instructions, explains how to ship mishap
   engines. Take follow-up actions to ensure exhibits were received and teardowns progress in
   a timely manner.
   5.8.5. FOD Analysis. If damage occurred from a known foreign object, do not submit a
   DR. Determine mishap costs IAW AFI 91-204 and continue the investigation. If, after a
   thorough investigation, the source of damage is unclear and there is no obvious failed engine
   part upstream, SIBs/SIOs should consult HQ AFSEC/SEFE (DSN 246-5867 or (505) 846-
   5867) for assistance with submitting accessible damaged blades, vanes, or other flow path
   surfaces to a lab for analysis. If damaged blades, vanes, or other flow path surfaces are
   inaccessible, consult HQ AFSEC/SEFE for determination of DR submittal to the Air Force
   Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC). AFLCMC will respond to the DR with their
   analysis of the source of the damage, whether from a foreign or domestic object. In the case
   of FOD, they will administratively close the DR and include a written statement on their
   determination of the source of damage. If their determination includes a domestic object as a
   possible source of the damage, the DR should not be closed without an investigation to
   confirm the source.
   5.8.6. Place a copy of all teardown reports, including all supporting documents (e.g.,
   metallurgical analyses, photographs, test reports, etc.) provided in response to DRs in the
   formal report in Tab J or Tab W, as applicable.
5.9. Coordinating with an AIB. Following a Class A mishap, an AIB is often convened IAW
AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, as the SIB investigation is being closed out (see
paragraphs 5.6 and 6.6 for further instructions regarding information on how to turn over
evidence to the AIB at SIB conclusion).
   5.9.1. Concurrent SIB and AIB. On some rare occasions an AIB and SIB will be working
   concurrently (high visibility mishaps, mishaps with fatalities, etc.). In those situations IAW
   AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, SIBs take priority over any corresponding AIB investigations and the
   SIB has "exclusive first rights" to witnesses and all physical evidence. Note: IAW AFI 91-
   204, Chapter 1, if initiated, OSI investigations take precedence over safety investigations
   until criminal activity, natural causes, and suicide have been ruled out as possible causes of
   damage, injury, or death. Additionally, the SIB must conduct its investigation independent
   of the AIB investigation. However, the SIB BP should coordinate certain activities with the
   AIB BP if there will be an AIB occurring concurrently with the SIB. This includes
   facilitating the initial visit of the mishap site by the AIB or next of kin.
       5.9.1.1. The SIB BP refers all media matters and next of kin matters to the AIB BP
       (including requests from these parties to obtain access to the wreckage or the personal
       property of the deceased). All releases of factual information regarding the status of the
       ongoing safety and/or accident investigation to the media must be coordinated with the
       AIB President IAW AFI 51-503, Chapter 7. The SIB President and AFSEC
       Representative (if appointed) will ensure that any information provided to the AIB
       President for public release does not contain any privileged safety information or
       documents. Ensure the Public Affairs Officer clearly understands that all future releases
       are to be coordinated with the AIB President versus the SIB.
       5.9.1.2. The SIB BP may provide factual (non-privileged) information to the AIB BP or
       Legal Advisor as it becomes available, but not to the detriment of the safety investigation.
48                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


     This information includes aircraft maintenance records, toxicological results, flight
     records, non-privileged technical analysis reports, publications, directives, non-privileged
     photographs, and medical records. Additional examples include recordings and
     transcripts of air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-to-air voice transmissions, as well as
     CVR/FDR tapes, other digital recording media (if available), GCS data and other
     information captured at the time of the mishap. All information turned over to the AIB
     prior to the formal signing of Tab Q, AIB Transfer Documents, (see paragraph 6.4.4.17)
     will be documented with a MFR. Additionally, the SIB will not brief AIB personnel on
     whether the content of the data being turned over was or was not a factor in the mishap.
     This is a violation of safety privilege handling protocol. When determined they are no
     longer needed by the SIB, the SIB President will release witnesses, participants, and
     interviewees (e.g., mishap pilot, mishap maintainer, mishap flight engineer, etc.) to the
     AIB President.
     5.9.1.3. The SIB BP provides certain factual information to the AIB legal advisor as
     soon as possible, as specified in AFI 51-503. However, every effort should be made to
     limit these activities so the efforts of the SIB are not impeded. Do not release SIB
     analysis, findings, causes, recommendations, or references to privileged witness
     statements. Do not release videotapes of simulated, computer-generated, animated, or re-
     enacted portions of the mishap flight if they involved SIB analysis. Do not release the
     SIB medical analysis or any other privileged evidence.
  5.9.2. CVR and other aircrew recordings and transcripts are not privileged. The audio
  recording will be transcribed. Limit the transcript included in Part 1 of the report to
  conversation relevant to the mishap sequence of events. Deletions or omissions will be
  indicated. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or otherwise alter the recording when transcribing.
  AFLOA/JACC determines when the audio from a mishap is releasable under Air Force
  policy. However, the transcripts of these recordings are considered factual and may
  ultimately be released to the public in an AIB report or through the Freedom of Information
  Act.
     5.9.2.1. For fatal mishaps and certain non-fatal mishaps, non-privileged audio recordings
     will be provided to the AIB, and AFSEC/JA (not the CA) will be the authority for
     release. It is Air Force policy that the audio recordings of the voices of the mishap crew
     are not releasable to the public due to the privacy interests of the crewmembers or the
     surviving family members.
  5.9.3. If the recorded voices of the mishap crew are incorporated into an animation,
  simulation, or reenactment video which is not otherwise privileged, the video is provided to
  the AIB for investigative purposes.
  5.9.4. Provide original films, videotapes, or animations created using only factual data to the
  AIB. This includes videotape recordings (VTR) of the HUD. Include copies of non-official
  videotapes or films made by individuals and return originals to the owner (these are personal,
  private property). Ensure the documents are appropriately marked if classified.
  5.9.5. If any SIB analysis was used to produce simulated, computer-generated, animated, or
  re-enacted portions of a mishap flight, those products are privileged. Do not release them to
  the AIB.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                       49


   5.9.6. Provide a complete list of all witnesses to the AIB regardless of whether the
   statements of the witnesses were in the safety report. Do not indicate which witnesses were
   offered a promise of confidentiality. Include contact information such as addresses and
   telephone numbers. Provide the names of witnesses to the AIB only after the SIB has
   completed all interviews of the witnesses (Contact HQ AFSEC/JA for guidance in unusual
   mishaps where the SIB may release witnesses to the AIB before completing interviews of all
   witnesses).
   5.9.7. Notify the AIB in writing if any aircraft parts have not been returned from AF or
   contractor laboratories and provide the AIB with contact and tracking information so they
   may retrieve the parts or track their location.
   5.9.8. Release medical information as discussed below. Properly label and protect
   information subject to the Privacy Act or HIPAA. Do not release medical analyses by the
   SIB. Do not release medical interview narratives gathered by ISB or SIB members if a
   promise of confidentiality was offered. Release the following medical information to the
   AIB BP or Legal Advisor separately from other evidence:
      5.9.8.1. Non-privileged factual photos showing human remains and the autopsy.
      5.9.8.2. Original toxicological test results, coroner’s or autopsy reports, and death
      certificates. If originals are not available, copies may be used.
      5.9.8.3. Medical records, dental records, and other pertinent medical information.
      5.9.8.4. Factual post-mishap radiographs (X-ray, MRI, CT Scan), factual lab reports
      (including toxicology), and factual post-mishap physical examinations (SF88, Medical
      Record – Report of Medical Examination and other appropriate factual medical
      documentation).
      5.9.8.5. 72-hour and 14-day medical histories may or may not be privileged. If not
      obtained with the promise of confidentiality, 72-hour and 14-day medical histories will
      be handed over to the AIB.
      5.9.8.6. If the AIB convenes without a medical officer, return all medical records and
      HIPAA protected medical information to the medical facility responsible for maintenance
      of this information. The AIB can request access to medical records and HIPAA protected
      medical information through the Military Treatment Facility (MTF).
   5.9.9. See paragraph 6.4.4.17 and AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, for additional information on
   coordinating with the AIB.
5.10. Mortuary Affairs. Provide copies of any records or materials required or used in the
identification process and copies of requested photographs of the deceased to the mortuary
officer. Either the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) or the local medical
examiner may generate these products. HQ Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)/MPCCM
carefully controls and maintains these documents on permanent file.
 50                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


                                          Chapter 6

                               REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. Mishap Reporting.
   6.1.1. The following reports and messages are required IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6:
      6.1.1.1. 24-Hour (Preliminary) Message. For Class A and B mishaps, drafted and input
      into AFSAS by the mishap wing or the ISB. Fully releasable and non-privileged, it will
      contain factual information only and will not contain safety-protected or privileged safety
      information such as speculation as to why the mishap occurred, privileged witness
      statements taken from mishap participants, etc. Note: This report is independent of
      OPREP reporting requirements and timelines.
      6.1.1.2. 10-Day Status Message. For Class A and B mishaps, this is usually the first
      privileged report released by the appointed SIB. The intent is for the SIB to
      communicate the status of the investigation and to relay any pertinent information,
      privileged or not, that the SIB deems necessary to report at this time.
      6.1.1.3. Final Message. Upon investigation completion for any class of mishap, this
      message is input into AFSAS and provides a narrative of the mishap/event sequence,
      states the mishap cause, and recommends preventive actions. It contains the
      investigation, analysis, and conclusions of the SIB or SIO. It is written so the reader
      clearly understands how the findings and causes were determined and clearly states who
      or what was found causal in the mishap sequence and the procedures (if applicable) taken
      to mitigate future occurrences. The final message is privileged.
          6.1.1.3.1. For Class A and B mishaps, Tab T sections T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7,
          minus any pictures, figures, or diagrams, will become the narrative section of the final
          message. Ensure all narrative references to any pictures, figures, and diagrams have
          been deleted. Additionally, the report shall not refer to any portion of the formal
          report (e.g., “see Tab W”), nor refer to persons/companies/products mentioned by
          specific name (rather use references such as: mishap pilot, original equipment
          manufacturer, prime/sub-contractor, abraidable coating, etc.). Only plain text (no
          bolding or italics) formatting will be used and all acronyms will be spelled out when
          first introduced due to the stand-alone nature of this message.
          6.1.1.3.2. When entering mishap message narrative data in AFSAS for other than
          Class A or B mishaps, follow the format in Attachment 5, Class C/D/E Sample
          Report Format.
      6.1.1.4. Timeline extensions and Status Messages. If the SIB/SIO was granted a timeline
      extension, a status message is still required at the end of 30 days (and every 30 days after
      that until the investigation is complete). If the investigation cannot be completed within
      the 30 day period or for timeline exemptions as noted below in paragraphs 6.1.1.4.1. and
      6.1.1.4.2., the SIB/SIO will request an extension from the CA. The SIB/SIO will
      annotate the extension and who it was approved by (office symbol) in each status
      message.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          51


         6.1.1.4.1. When an engine or engine module is processed through depot maintenance
         using the Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS), the final report due date is
         initially extended to 90 days for Class B, C, and D mishaps. 30-day status messages
         are still required in AFSAS. All subsequent extensions require CA approval and
         regular status message updates.
         6.1.1.4.2. For all classes of RPA mishaps, investigations should be completed within
         45 days if the mishap occurred in the CONUS or 60 days if the mishap occurred at an
         OCONUS deployed location. 30-day status messages are still required in AFSAS.
     6.1.1.5. Formal reports. A formal report contains all applicable Tabs (A-Z) and is
     uploaded into AFSAS as one individual .pdf file per tab. A detailed explanation of each
     tab’s contents and OPRs is found in paragraph 6.4. Exceptions to the single .pdf file per
     tab rule can be found in paragraph 6.4.3.1. SIBs will ensure that files uploaded to
     AFSAS are not password protected. See paragraph 6.4.2. for formal report and tab
     waiver procedures.
     6.1.1.6. One-liner. The one-liner should be a brief statement that provides a quick
     synopsis about the mishap that can be used for database queries in AFSAS (i.e., what
     happened, what was damaged/broken/injured, and what was the outcome). When
     entering the one line description into AFSAS, ensure it contains no safety privileged
     information and is strictly a factual description of the event.   Example of a non-
     privileged one-liner: Aircraft Right Landing Gear Collapsed On Landing; No Injuries
     (simply describes the facts of the mishap, contains no analysis).
  6.1.2. Changes to Reports. For Class A and B or other mishaps where a formal report is
  prepared, only the primary members of the safety board can make changes to the formal
  report or the SIB final message. This includes the report narrative, findings, causes,
  recommendations, and other findings and recommendations of significance as determined by
  the SIB. Concerns and issues raised by the CA will be considered during the review process
  to produce the MOFE via the CA’s comments message input into AFSAS. If the CA
  determines the final SIB message or formal report needs to be changed after it is completed
  and signed by the board, the BP or IO will coordinate changes with all the primary members
  of the SIB. For changes to reports as a result of AFSEC/SEFO final message rejections, see
  paragraph 6.7.1.6.
     6.1.2.1. For Class C and D mishaps and Class E events, convening authorities and
     MAJCOM safety staffs may make non-substantive changes to the reports to improve
     quality and ensure a thorough investigation. However, the intent of findings, causes,
     recommendations, or the SIB’s deliberations will not be changed in this process.
  6.1.3. Rejecting Reports. Reports will be rejected through AFSAS if they do not meet the
  requirements of AFI 91-204 and this AFMAN. AFSEC and MAJCOM/SE have the authority
  to reject all classes of reports. Additionally, Class B, C, D, and E reports can be rejected by
  the NAF/SE unless investigative authority was retained at the MAJCOM.
  6.1.4. For Class A and B mishaps, SIBs will forward draft copies of Tab T and Tab Y (as
  soon as available) to the CA/SEF for review. Additionally, for Class A and B mishaps that
  are supported by AFSEC (on-site or telephonically), SIBs will forward draft copies of Tab T
  and Y to HQ AFSEC/SEF for review. The target day for this review should be on or before
 52                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   day 25 of the investigation. Delays beyond this are an indication the SIB should consider
   requesting an extension from the CA. This review is solely for quality control purposes. The
   SIB should allow two duty days for the CA/SEF and HQ AFSEC/SEF review and comments
   and at least two days to address the recommended changes if they are substantial. Quality
   control will determine if the conclusions reached are adequately substantiated in the narrative
   and that the findings, cause(s), and recommendation(s) are subsequently supported and
   comply with the requirements of AFI 91-204 and this manual. Reviewing safety specialists
   are to provide suggestions for accuracy and effectiveness and will not supersede the
   judgment of the SIB/SIO or mandate changes to the report, findings, recommendations, etc.
   Other than AFSEC involvement, the investigation will not be staffed outside of the CA safety
   office during this review process.
      6.1.4.1. When e-mailing information that contains privileged safety information (e.g.,
      draft reports/findings to CA or AFSEC for review, specific mishap related questions to
      the AFLCMC for their analysis, etc.), all privileged attachments must be password
      protected and the e-mail should be encrypted if the capability exists. Send the applicable
      password in a separate message or by another mode of transmission. Another option is to
      use the file sharing function of AFSAS, in which case files do not need to be password
      protected. As a last resort, fax the document ensuring that the recipient will receive the
      faxed document immediately upon receipt.
      6.1.4.2. (Added-PACAF) For quality control purposes, all messages for Class B
      mishaps will be submitted by selecting “Pacific Air Forces” under Optional Approval in
      AFSAS. Final messages for Class C Aviation mishaps will be submitted by selecting the
      applicable Numbered Air Force under Optional Approval in AFSAS. Submittal to
      PACAF for Class C/D mishaps and Class E events are optional.
   6.1.5. Unless delegation is withheld by higher authority, the mishap wing commander or
   designated representative is normally the CA for Class C and D mishaps and Class E events.
   6.1.6. The SIB should write an unclassified report if possible. If any portion of a safety
   report contains classified information, the SIB is responsible for marking all documents,
   including Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) message traffic, IAW classification rules.
   Ensure the proper security classification markings from AFI 31-401, Information Security
   Program Management, are applied. All appropriate security requirements must be met in the
   handling and shipment of classified data. Consult the servicing wing’s information security
   officer or intel unit for assistance with determining marking requirements such as: Original
   Classification Authority, Declassify On date, and Classification Rule when the material is not
   derivatively classified.
6.2. AFSAS.
   6.2.1. AFSAS is the primary means for distributing messages. If AFSAS is not available or
   not appropriate due to classification, safety reporting will be via secure, encrypted e-mail. If
   the mishap is classified, release via secure means to the MAJCOM/SE, AF/SE,
   COMAFFOR/SE (if applicable), recommendation office of primary responsibility (OPR),
   and other agencies that have a need to know.
      6.2.1.1. Investigators will need an AFSAS account to accomplish safety messages.
      Contact the CA safety office for access.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        53


       6.2.1.2. AFSAS login is available at https://afsas.kirtland.af.mil/Home.do.
       6.2.1.3. Reference the AFSAS Guide, which can be accessed in AFSAS under the
       “Help” top menu tile. Additional AFSAS help is available through the AFSAS Help
       Desk by phone (DSN 263-8200 or Comm 505-863-8200) or via email
       (AFSASHelpdesk@kirtland.af.mil).
       6.2.1.4. AFSAS mishap number. The AFSAS mishap number is vital to tracking safety
       reports. The AFSAS number should be referenced on all related correspondence, Joint
       Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS), and endorsements. The AFSAS mishap number is
       a randomly generated six digit number assigned to a mishap report upon initiation in the
       AFSAS database.
6.3. Life Sciences Safety Reporting.
   6.3.1. Report aeromedical, AFE, egress, injury, injury mechanisms, and human factors
   related to a mishap as life sciences safety information. Life sciences safety information is
   required for all classes of mishaps and events for all involved personnel (those who are
   injured or whose actions or inactions contributed to the mishap sequence).
       6.3.1.1. Complete physical exams must be performed and documented in the Armed
       Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) or other electronic
       medical record for all involved personnel for all Class A manned mishaps. A post
       mishap AF IMT Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
       Duty, is required to be completed after all mishaps per AFI 48-123, Medical
       Examinations and Standards. Physical examinations for other mishap and event classes
       may be focused physical exams appropriate for the mishap. The extent of these
       examinations is at the discretion of the ISB medical officer (or SIB medical officer if
       there is no ISB). Do not put privileged safety information into these medical records.
       6.3.1.2. For RPA mishaps, directed post-mishap medical history, 72-hour and 14-day
       history, examination, and toxicological testing are only mandatory for the RPA crew or
       associated personnel (including instructors or evaluators performing “over the shoulder”
       duties and technicians who performed maintenance or troubleshooting on the ground
       control station) which operated the RPA during and immediately preceding the mishap
       sequence. This is defined as the last two crews to operate the aircraft. This does not
       negate a commander’s prerogative, IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 2, to test any other person
       involved whose actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have been factors in the
       mishap.
       6.3.1.3. Most USAF medical facilities have personnel with additional life sciences
       expertise (AOP officers, psychologists, etc.) who are valuable resources for ensuring
       accurate interpretation of life sciences safety information. These individuals should be
       consulted to support aviation safety investigations unless they have close connections
       with mishap personnel.
   6.3.2. Life sciences information is reported in Tab T and Tab Y of the formal report in
   AFSAS.
   6.3.3. For mishaps and events without a formal report, report life sciences information by
   populating the appropriate life sciences data fields in AFSAS.
 54                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   6.3.4. Classifying Injuries: See AFI 91-204 Attachment 1, Terms, for definitions of injuries.
   6.3.5. Report Class E Physiological Events per paragraph 1.3.2.1. Include lab test results
   and toxicological test results (when determined necessary by the commander or flight
   surgeon) for involved personnel. For decompression sickness/evolved gas disorders, trapped
   gas disorders, and in-flight incapacitation, also include a 72-hour and 14-day history.
      6.3.5.1. The AF flight surgeon/AOP officer responding to the physiological event will
      assist with the report. In situations where an AF physician does not initially treat the
      mishap individual, the AF flight surgeon with final aeromedical disposition of the case
      will assist the investigator.
      6.3.5.2. Any AFE failure or malfunction contributing to a physiological mishap must be
      documented in the formal report and AFSAS. Describe corrective action taken as
      appropriate.
   6.3.6. Consider human factors from individual human performance, supervisory, and
   organizational influence perspectives. The SIB identifies human factors IAW DoD Human
   Factors Analysis and Classification System (DoD HFACS) in AFI 91-204 Attachment 6.
   Medical officers and human factors representatives are tasked with accomplishing the human
   factors narrative. The human factors analysis is not limited to crew actions but should
   consider all personnel involved in fielding, training, supervising, and maintaining aircraft
   systems. The human factors conclusions must reflect the SIB consensus.
6.4. Formal Reports.
   6.4.1. General Information. Formal reports present both factual and analytical information
   for Class A and Class B mishaps. The SIB normally produces a formal safety report with
   two parts: Part 1, Facts, and Part 2, Board Analysis, Conclusions, and Privileged Material. If
   an out-brief is required, it will be uploaded to Part 3. Part 4 is the Classified Annex, if
   required.
      6.4.1.1. Part 1, Tabs A – S, contains factual non-privileged information collected and
      used in support of the Safety Investigation. The finalized tabs of Part 1 are produced for
      safety purposes. The SIB will conform to this manual in creating Part 1 tabs and will
      only provide finalized tabs to the AIB.
      6.4.1.2. Part 2, Tabs T – Z, contains the privileged portions of the formal report as well
      as portions that are protected for other reasons (proprietary, International Traffic in Arms
      Regulations (ITARS), HIPAA, etc.). Disclosure outside Air Force safety channels
      requires proper authorization and sanitization IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, and other
      applicable guidance. See paragraph 6.4.5.11. for exceptions in Tab Y.
      6.4.1.3. Part 3 will only contain the final version of the out-brief to the CA and a version
      of the out-brief with proprietary and privacy act information removed (if available).
      6.4.1.4. Classified Appendices. If at all possible, safety reports should be written as
      unclassified. However, if classified information is relevant to the mishap, contact the CA
      for assistance in properly marking documents. The classified appendices must use the
      same formatting as the unclassified tab. Ensure the non-classified tabs reference the
      classified appendices. Note: classified information will not be entered into AFSAS;
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            55


     however, it will be sent to HQ AFSEC/SEF. All appropriate security requirements must
     be met in the handling and shipment of classified data.
  6.4.2. Formal report/tab waivers. AF/SE is the waiver approval authority for formal reports.
  Formal report waivers are processed through AFSAS. A formal report waiver does not
  relieve the SIB/SIO of their responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation and write a
  comprehensive final message. Investigations with no data for certain tabs (except Tab T and
  Tab Y) do not require waivers for those tabs (e.g., the aircraft was not equipped with a flight
  data recorder, hence no data was available for Tab L). However, the SIB will include a
  memorandum in the tab signed by the SIB BP documenting why no information was
  included and upload it into the appropriate tab in AFSAS. Tab T is always required unless
  the entire formal report is waived. If a SIB determines human factors were not applicable to
  a mishap and no Tab Y is required, the SIB will request a waiver in AFSAS and provide
  supporting justification using the tab waiver feature.
     6.4.2.1. SIBs will forward their requests for waivers to formal reports/tabs through their
     CA to HQ AFSEC/SEF using AFSAS. SIBs must continue preparation of a formal report
     until receipt of AF/SE approved waiver. Include the following information to clearly
     satisfy the waiver criteria:
         6.4.2.1.1. Known and documented material deficiencies with established corrective
         actions. The formal report/tab may be waived if properly justified by the SIB/SIO.
         This waiver is not automatic and is determined on a case-by-case basis.
             6.4.2.1.1.1. In AFSAS, state the materiel characteristics or mishap attributes that
             were similar to previous mishaps. Summarize any technical analysis done and
             upload supporting documentation. Provide AFSAS numbers of similar mishaps.
             One prior occurrence does not generally constitute a known deficiency.
             6.4.2.1.1.2. In general, a corrective action is considered established if it is funded
             or was considered for funding but consciously unfunded (accepted risk) by the
             appropriate decision authority. State the corrective action, including reference
             information (e.g., Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) number), and the
             organization responsible for implementing the action. State the status of the
             corrective action and the implementation plan or progress, as applicable.
             Additionally, reference AFSAS numbers of previous mishaps showing this is a
             known failure mode, with corrective action in place, or accepted risk.
         6.4.2.1.2. Engine-Confined FOD. A mishap in which an aircraft or RPA engine
         experiences reportable foreign object damage (Class D or higher) that is confined to
         the engine and integral engine components. Damage is considered FOD if it is
         caused by inanimate objects external to the engine (e.g., rocks, tools, safety wire, ice,
         etc.). Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than Class D
         damage external to the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine is
         equal to or greater than the Class D upper damage cost threshold, then the mishap is
         not engine-confined.
             6.4.2.1.2.1. Although a formal report is not required, use the waiver process in
             AFSAS to provide supporting documentation. Within the waiver request,
             summarize any technical analysis performed and upload supporting
56                                          AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


             documentation into AFSAS to confirm the engine-confined FOD.
     6.4.2.2. Only by exception, with strong justification from the SIB, will a formal report
     waiver be granted without fully satisfying either of these criteria (known material
     deficiency or engine confined FOD). Elapsed time since the mishap or the anticipated
     quality of the final message will not be considered in the approval process.
  6.4.3. Assembling The Formal Report. The formal report will be assembled from the
  various tabs that the SIB/SIO uploads into AFSAS. The following instructions will be
  followed in the production of the electronic tabs. Each tab file within the formal report will
  be a single .pdf file containing all information for that tab. For example, Tab R will be an
  individual .pdf document of all the releasable witness testimonies with proper formatting and
  annotations as defined in this manual. Ensure tabs uploaded into AFSAS are not password
  protected.
     6.4.3.1. Exceptions to the single .pdf file per tab rule are:
         6.4.3.1.1. Tab L may contain digital data files (e.g., RPA data logger files). Note: if
         uploading multiple files, do not use the term “AFSAS” in the Tab L table of contents
         for the location of the respective files (e.g., “See Attachment L1.1. Data Logger
         Files.xls.”).
         6.4.3.1.2. Tabs S (non-privileged) and X (privileged) may contain pertinent videos
         and/or final versions of animations. Ensure that files are named so the reader can
         quickly understand what the file contains (e.g., LandingAnime.wmv rather than
         OS1234.wmv). Do not upload pictures as individual files in Tabs S or X. If the SIB
         desires to keep the original format of the photos, use the Adobe Portfolio option
         within Adobe to consolidate individual files into a single .pdf tab. Note: if uploading
         multiple files, do not use the term “AFSAS” in the Tab S table of contents for the
         location of the respective files (e.g., “See Attachment S4.1. Non-privileged
         Animation.wmv.”)
         6.4.3.1.3. Tab U will contain the complete audio/video files for pertinent interviews
         that are only partially transcribed.
     6.4.3.2. Tab Format. Use Times New Roman, 12 point, for text documents. Use past
     tense throughout. Set top, bottom, and side margins to 1.0 inch. Set header margin to 0.5
     inches and ensure the following appears on each page of the report in the header block:
     “Aircraft Type, Aircraft Serial Number, Class, Date, and AFSAS number” (e.g., F-15C,
     85-1717, Class A, 10 February 2009, AFSAS #123456). The header will be in 10 point
     Times New Roman, italicized and page centered.
         6.4.3.2.1. Place a footer on each page in Part 2 of privileged safety reports using the
         Privilege Warning Statement from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3.
         6.4.3.2.2. Place the appropriate statement in the footer on each page for all tabs
         containing FOUO IAW AFI 31-401 or Privacy Act information IAW AFI 33-332, Air
         Force Privacy Program.
         6.4.3.2.3. The best way to produce each tab is to use the templates found on the
         AFSEC Portal page (found on the AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                           57


        Center : Products and Services : SIB Support). See paragraphs 6.4.4. and 6.4.5. for
        what is required in order to complete each individual tab.
            6.4.3.2.3.1. Download the templates for each individual tab.
            6.4.3.2.3.2. Do all work on the tab template as a Word document.
            6.4.3.2.3.3. Copy and paste Word documents (Tab R and Tab U transcribed
            interviews, Tab T, etc.) directly into the applicable portion of the tab template.
            This will work for e-mails as well. Copy the e-mail and paste into the document.
            6.4.3.2.3.4. For hard copy documents such as the pilot’s training folder for Tab
            G, the orders appointing the SIB for Tab A, the aircraft maintenance records for
            Tab D, engine analysis received from the manufacturer for Tab W, etc., scan the
            document as a .jpg and insert (Insert>Picture>From File) into the tab template at
            the appropriate location. Ensure the scanner function is set to the highest
            resolution possible.
            6.4.3.2.3.5. Photos, as well as other .jpg files, can be inserted directly into the
            .pdf tab by using Insert/Picture. Make sure not to compress photos so that the
            quality of the photo becomes grainy or unusable.
            6.4.3.2.3.6. Tabs Created in Single (in-line) .pdf Format: When finished, add
            page numbers and build the finalized Table of Contents for each tab. Number all
            pages in order within the tab. Center page numbers at the bottom of each page.
            Pages should be numbered consecutively through each tab. Numbering will be
            the tab letter followed by a hyphen and the page number (e.g., J-1, J-2, J-3, etc., or
            U-1, U-2, U-3, etc.). Number the page even if there is only one page in the tab.
            6.4.3.2.3.7. Tabs Created in .pdf Portfolio Format: When finished, build the
            finalized Tab Header with Table of Contents for each tab. Name each tab file
            according to the name used in the Tab Header (e.g., “D2. AIRCRAFT AFTO 781
            FORMS”). For Tabs that have 2nd level contents (e.g., “K2.1. FORM F WEIGHT
            AND BALANCE”), create sub-headers and insert them within the Portfolio at the
            appropriate location. If a file is not in a .pdf-convertible format or the SIB desires
            to keep the source document within the Portfolio (e.g., a Flight Data Recorder
            spreadsheet), be sure to create the Portfolio and then convert each document to
            .pdf that needs to be converted.
     6.4.3.3. Sample Tabs (A through Z) and Tab Headers (for .pdf Portfolio format) are
     available in AFSAS and can be found on the AFSEC Portal page (AF Portal : FOAs :
     AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Products and Services : SIB Support) and will be used
     as the template for the formal report.
  6.4.4. Formal Report Part 1 Contents. Factual Information and Releasable Material.
     6.4.4.1. Tab A. Safety Investigator Information.
        6.4.4.1.1. A1. Orders appointing SIB. Include one copy of the orders appointing the
        SIB or SIO. The orders must contain the SIB position, full name, rank/grade,
        organization, assigned base, and whether they are a primary or secondary for each
        appointed person. Do not include administrative specialists or SIB observers on SIB
        orders.
58                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


        6.4.4.1.2. A2. Contact Information for SIB members and all technical advisors who
        participated in the SIB. Include DSN and commercial telephone numbers and e-mail
        addresses for all SIB members and advisors. Use “permanent” rather than TDY
        contact information.
        6.4.4.1.3. A3. SIB Presidents/SIOs will ensure everyone working on their team is
        briefed on the restriction that all information, privileged or not, collected by safety
        investigators is not releasable outside safety channels except in accordance with this
        instruction or upon approval of the CA. The SIB President/SIO is the final point of
        release for all information (including electronic/digital media, photographs, etc.) from
        the safety investigation. Every member of a SIB will sign the memorandum at AFI
        91-204 Attachment 3, Memorandum Documenting Guidance to Investigators on
        Controlling Information, acknowledging the guidance and restrictions. Additionally,
        include non-disclosure agreements for all technical advisors or additional members
        that do not sign the memorandum at AFI 91-204 Attachment 3.
        6.4.4.1.4. The Investigating Officer and Recorder complete this tab.
     6.4.4.2. Tab B. This tab is currently not used for aviation mishap investigations.
     6.4.4.3. Tab C. This tab is currently not used for aviation mishap investigations.
     6.4.4.4. Tab D. Maintenance Report, Records, and Data.
        6.4.4.4.1. D1. Use AF IMT Form 711C, Aircraft/UAV Maintenance and Materiel
        Report, for Class A, B, and C Aircraft and RPA mishaps if a formal report is
        prepared. Use one form for each aircraft or RPA involved.
        6.4.4.4.2. D2. Aircraft Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Forms 781. If they add to
        the report, include copies of the AFTO Form 781K, Aerospace Vehicle Inspection,
        Engine Data, Calendar Inspection, and Delayed Discrepancy Document, and any
        other AFTO 781 series form, or provide a factual summary of the information
        contained in them. Do not simply state that review of maintenance documentation
        determined it was or was not a factor in the mishap. 781 data is also archived in the
        G081/Mobility Air Force Logistics Command & Control (G081/MAF LOG C2) and
        other electronic data storage systems. Ensure this data is reviewed as well as existing
        781 series forms. Include copies of the following if they add to the report:
            6.4.4.4.2.1. AFTO 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
            6.4.4.4.2.2. AFTO Form        781H,    Aerospace    Vehicle   Flight   Status   and
            Maintenance Document.
        6.4.4.4.3. D3. Additional aircraft maintenance records that add to the report.
        6.4.4.4.4. D4. Maintenance records from other involved equipment. Include records
        from equipment such as AGE, fuel servicing equipment, etc., if they were factors in
        the mishap.
        6.4.4.4.5. The Maintenance Member completes this tab.
     6.4.4.5. Tab E. This tab is currently not used for aviation mishap investigations.
     6.4.4.6. Tab F. Weather and Environmental Records and Data.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         59


        6.4.4.6.1. F1. Weather briefings provided to flight crews. Include a copy of the
        actual flight crew weather briefing if available.
        6.4.4.6.2. F2. Actual weather observations and conditions for the event. Include
        weather radar data, Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), and other
        appropriate weather data if available.
        6.4.4.6.3. The Pilot Member completes this tab.
     6.4.4.7. Tab G. Personnel Records.
        6.4.4.7.1. G1. Flight Records. Include a copy of the flight record pages (Individual
        Flight Data and Flying History Report) showing the most recent flight time in all
        aircraft the individual was qualified in and the grand total time. Do not include the
        mishap flight time. The record should be closed out as of the mishap date. Include a
        recap of sorties and hours flown in the last 30, 60, and 90 days. Add an additional
        breakout by “Flight Time Categories” (primary/secondary/instructor/etc.) and “Flight
        Condition Time” (night/instrument/night vision goggle/etc.). Use the “Flight Time
        Categories” and “Flight Condition Time” as defined in AFI 11-401, Aviation
        Management.
        6.4.4.7.2. G2. Flight evaluation and training records. Include a copy of the Record
        of Evaluation (AF Form 942) from the flight evaluation folder. Also include a
        summary of pertinent training records if flight crewmembers are students, were
        recently upgraded in their crew position, or it adds to the report.
        6.4.4.7.3. G3.   Maintenance training records if maintenance was a factor in the
        mishap.
        6.4.4.7.4. G4. Other personnel evaluation and training records. Include these if they
        were factors in the mishap. Examples could include records from personnel in career
        fields such as Air Traffic Control, Airfield Management, Crash-Fire-Rescue, etc.
        6.4.4.7.5. The Pilot Member and/or Maintenance Member completes this tab as
        applicable.
     6.4.4.8. Tab H. Egress, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), Impact, and Crashworthiness
     Analysis. This analysis is accomplished by the AFE member or technical experts and is
     not a product of the SIB’s deliberative efforts. Privileged analysis regarding AFE, egress,
     impact, and crashworthiness will be included in Tab T in Part 2.
        6.4.4.8.1. H1. Egress Analysis. This analysis is accomplished by an egress systems
        specialist if aircrew egress may have been attempted, was attempted, or was
        completed.
        6.4.4.8.2. H2. AFE Analysis. Include a detailed evaluation of performance of AFE
        and protection systems as they pertain to the injuries. Reference the egress
        specialist’s report and identify, where possible, specific injury mechanisms as a result
        of AFE. If there were no injuries due to AFE, simply state so.
        6.4.4.8.3. H3. Impact Analysis. Include technical specialist analysis of impact,
        wreckage, and burn patterns at the crash site, if applicable.
60                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


        6.4.4.8.4. H4. Crashworthiness Analysis. Include technical specialist analysis as
        needed. Ejection seat equipped aircraft typically do not need this evaluation.
        6.4.4.8.5. The AFE Member completes this tab if applicable.
     6.4.4.9. Tab I. Deficiency Reports. Include all DRs or equivalent submitted in
     conjunction with the mishap investigation. Include a copy of the submitted DR report
     containing the following information: Report Control Number (RCN), Cognizant
     Official, name of part (nomenclature), and part number.
        6.4.4.9.1. The Maintenance Member completes this tab.
     6.4.4.10. Tab J. Releasable Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations.
        6.4.4.10.1. Technical support to the SIB will typically come from two sources, the
        manufacturer/contractor that designed, built, or maintained the equipment (such as
        GE, Lockheed Martin, etc.) and from DoD military/civilian personnel (Air Logistics
        Complex (ALC), System Program Office (SPO), AF Labs, etc.). AFI 91-204
        Attachment 4 provides a suggested format for Tab J reports.
        6.4.4.10.2. If DoD military/civilian personnel provided written reports or on-scene
        evaluations, include them in this tab. Do not provide them a promise of
        confidentiality. Instead, DoD personnel sign the Safety Investigation Non-Disclosure
        Agreement (AFI 91-204 Attachment 3) that is kept on file with the SIB.
        6.4.4.10.3. Factual reports or information provided by a contractor/manufacturer
        without a promise of confidentiality are also placed in this tab. The SIB will ensure
        they sign the Memorandum for Contractor Representatives Serving as Technical
        Experts to Safety Investigations (AFI 91-204 Attachment 3) and it is on file with the
        SIB, but it does not need to be included in Tab J.
        6.4.4.10.4. SIBs/SIOs should make every effort to have their technical experts
        (government or contractor) write a non-privileged report for Tab J. Technical experts
        are included in all SIB proceedings; therefore, access and exposure to privileged
        information during the investigation is routine. However, technical experts may not
        use privileged information in a Tab J non-privileged report. Tab J reports are factual
        and should detail observations (what parts are bent, broken, or burned, etc.), analysis
        (whether it happened before, during, or after the mishap, and how), conclusions
        (effect on system function, etc.), and recommendations (methods to prevent the
        observed condition from re-occurring, etc.).              Analysis, conclusions, and
        recommendations will be based on physical evidence, other factual data, and
        statements made without a promise of confidentiality. Do not include any opinion as
        to whether or not a particular failure contributed to or caused the mishap, i.e., these
        reports will not state that certain systems or parts “did or did not cause the mishap.”
        This does not preclude stating a conclusion that a failure would likely create a certain
        condition, even if the mishap was inevitable under such a condition. For example, a
        conclusion could be expressed that a widget failure would have caused trim to move
        to the full nose up position, without making the connecting statement that such a trim
        position would inevitably cause a crash. Analysis that includes or was based on
        privileged information (e.g., privileged witness testimony, board deliberations, etc.)
        or includes speculative opinion of the mishap cause by the technical expert is
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                           61


        considered privileged and will be placed as an addendum in Tab W. The SIB will
        determine what caused the mishap, and that will appear in Tab T. The SIB/SIO will
        thoroughly review all Tab J reports to ensure they do not contain and are not based
        upon privileged information. For questions contact AFSEC/SEFF, DSN 246-1404.
            6.4.4.10.4.1. Prior to placing any reports completed by contractors/manufacturers
            in Tab J, ensure they have identified whether the reports contain proprietary or
            arms export controlled information. If this type of information is present, ensure
            that the contractor has indicated which portions are so protected from public
            disclosure.
            6.4.4.10.4.2. When the SIB requests analysis of a part at the ALC or contractor
            facility, provide disposition instructions for the component after completion of
            analysis. Normally, the component should be returned and placed with the rest of
            the wreckage.
            6.4.4.10.4.3. Ensure none of the information/reports/analysis in Tab J is marked
            with the Privileged warning as found at AFI 91-204 Attachment 3 Privilege
            Warning Statement.

        6.4.4.12.3. L3. Video Recordings. Some aircraft and RPA GCS have devices that
        record flight displays and voice communications. If available, these should be
        included as digital video files, preferably in a common format such as .mpg. If
        additional digital data files are uploaded (in accordance with paragraph 6.4.3), make a
        reference in the Tab L .pdf document. A Privacy Act Warning Statement will
        accompany all recordings of voice communications. Do not upload classified
        information into AFSAS.
        6.4.4.12.4. L4. Reports generated using parametric data. Data generated by the
        aircraft may be used for many purposes, such as structural integrity analyses and
        MFOQA. Standard, periodic analysis reports (e.g., fleet-wide trends) will be
        uploaded here. Analysis reports requested by the SIB for specific data (e.g., over-Gs
        by tail number or unstable approaches at a particular location) show the deliberative
        process and will be placed in Tab V.

             6.4.4.16.3.2. Determining destroyed aircraft or RPA cost. The CA will consider
             an aircraft or RPA destroyed when the man-hours required to repair the aircraft or
             RPA exceed the maximum stated in the "major repair man-hours" column of T.O.
             1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles. If the aircraft or RPA is
             destroyed, flyaway cost from AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
             Factors, Table A10-1, Unit Flyaway Costs, is used by Financial Management.
             Contact AFCAA/FMFF (DSN 222-6013, Comm 703-692-6013) for an official
             compilation of Table A10-1 data. Contact the System Manager to get the cost of
             all modifications done to the aircraft or RPA up to the mishap date. For aircraft
             and RPAs not listed, contact the appropriate System Manager for cost
             information.
             6.4.4.16.3.3. A damaged aircraft or RPA not repaired is not necessarily a
             "destroyed" aircraft or RPA. The asset may still be required to be reported as
             “repairable.” The decision to not return a damaged aircraft or RPA to service is
             independent of the mishap class. When the aircraft or RPA will not be returned to
             service, classify the mishap damage according to the total estimated repair cost as
             if it had been returned to service. In this case, calculate repair cost IAW AFI 91-
             204, Chapter 1. If an aircraft or RPA will not be returned to service but is not
             considered destroyed, the SIB must submit itemized repair cost estimates through
             MAJCOM channels to HQ AFSEC/SEF for validation.
             6.4.4.16.3.4. Only include direct costs when determining the cost of the mishap.
             Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and Non-DoD),
             associated repair labor costs, and environmental cleanup costs. Classify the
             mishap repair cost according to the total estimated repair cost IAW AFI 91-204,
             Chapter 1. All other costs are considered indirect costs. Do not include indirect
             costs related to the mishap such as the TDY costs of the SIB, costs of recovery of
             the mishap aircraft to a site where the mishap investigation is conducted, costs of
             ISB members and mishap site support personnel, etc.
             6.4.4.16.3.5. Do not include the cost of an “opportunity” upgrade or outstanding
             tech order compliance items performed in conjunction with the repairs. If a
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         65


            precautionary replacement is made due to the unknowns from the mishap event, it
            is an additional cost the AF must pay as a direct result of the mishap and should
            be included in the mishap cost. If the precautionary replacement is based on an
            observed condition that can be traced to deterioration over time and clearly
            disassociated from the mishap, it is an opportunity upgrade not related to the
            mishap and should not be included in the mishap cost. If the parts were returned
            to service, do not include them in the mishap cost. If a part is condemned as a
            result of the mishap, even though the part is undamaged, the cost of the part will
            be included in the cost of the mishap.
            6.4.4.16.3.6. The Maintenance Member completes this tab.
     6.4.4.17. Tab Q. AIB Transfer Documents. Include a memorandum from the SIB
     President to the AIB President regarding the location and disposition of all non-privileged
     evidence, wreckage, and components involved in the mishap sequence including items
     sent to an Air Logistics Complex or other locations for analysis and not returned to the
     SIB. The evidence disposition list should include the POC for the part and a phone
     number/email address. Additionally, the SIB will provide the AIB with a witness list that
     includes Name, Grade, Role in the Mishap (e.g., MP, etc.), Organizational Address, Duty
     Phone, and Date (of first interview). The mishap preliminary message, evidence
     disposition list, and witness list should be provided to the AIB and documented in Tab Q.
     For Class B mishaps, or Class A mishaps where no AIB is convened or the AIB President
     is not available, contact the CA staff judge advocate office for guidance on how to
     accomplish the transfer. Work through the CA Safety office for contact information. A
     sample transmittal letter can be found in the SIB Support Documents on the AFSEC
     Portal (AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Products and Services :
     SIB Support). See paragraph 5.9 and AFI 91-204, Chapter 5, for coordinating the
     turnover to the AIB. The AIB will be responsible for final disposition of all material
     released to them by the SIB.
        6.4.4.17.1. The Investigating Officer and Recorder complete this tab.
     6.4.4.18. Tab R. Releasable Witness Testimony. Investigators take testimony from all
     individuals involved in the mishap and those who were witnesses to the mishap.
     Testimony includes both written statements and recorded interviews. Place testimony
     from individuals and witnesses that were not granted a promise of confidentiality in this
     tab. Pertinent recorded interviews placed in this tab will be completely transcribed
     verbatim. Do not include audio recordings in this tab.
        6.4.4.18.1. Non-Privileged Interviews. For non-privileged interviews, whether
        written or recorded, all witnesses sign the form from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, Non-
        Privileged Witness Statement. This only needs to be accomplished once for recorded
        interviews but must be done for ALL written statements whether initial or subsequent
        follow-up.
        6.4.4.18.2. For recorded interviews ensure all interviewees are read the Notice to
        Witness that Recorded Statement is not Confidential, AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, and it
        is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL recorded interviews whether
        initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.

        6.4.4.18.3. It is not necessary to transcribe or publish all testimony. If the testimony
        does not provide any insight into the mishap, do not include it in Tab R, but provide it
        to the AIB. Place the statements and transcribed interviews from applicable
        witnesses together in chronological order starting with the first accomplished. The
        mishap participants are placed first followed by other witnesses.
        6.4.4.18.4. 72-hour and 14-day histories can be either privileged or non-privileged.
        Include 72-hour and 14-day histories obtained without a promise of confidentiality in
        this tab. The non-privileged 72-hour and 14-day history form available as part of the
        AFSEC SIB Support documents includes a non-privileged witness written statement.
        If the 72-hour and 14-day histories are obtained via recorded interview, follow the
        procedures in paragraph 6.4.4.18.2.
        6.4.4.18.5. The Investigating Officer completes this tab.
     6.4.4.19. Tab S. Releasable Photographs, Videos, Diagrams, and Animations.
        6.4.4.19.1. S1. Releasable Photographs. Do not upload pictures as individual files.
        A representative sample of well-defined non-privileged photographs can help in
        mishap documentation. Use them to show damage, impact areas, metal fractures,
        flight path, vehicle travel, etc. Only include photographs that aid in understanding of
        the mishap. Do not unnecessarily show evidence of human injury (e.g., bloody
        aircraft parts). If the SIB absolutely needs to disseminate an injury photo to illustrate
        the mishap, consider using a black and white photo if it will meet the needs of the
        investigation. Label each image to aid reviewers. Do not refer to privileged safety
        information on the page captions or in comments on the index. Where applicable, the
        title should include which direction the photograph is facing (e.g., Debris field
        looking to the west). Photographs are considered privileged if they are staged for the
        board's analysis and will be placed in Tab X. Pointing with a finger or other device at
        a portion of wreckage does not necessarily make the photograph staged. Depictions
        of cockpit indications for a given set of assumptions made by the SIB or described in
        witness testimony are staged photographs. Photographs of deceased personnel or
        injuries are not placed in Tab S due to their sensitivity. They can be placed in Tab Y
        if they support findings or recommendations. Medical pictures, however, can be
        given to the AIB.
        6.4.4.19.2. S2. Releasable videos. Only upload non-privileged videos (e.g., videos
        shot by eye witnesses, etc.) relevant to the investigation (in accordance with
        paragraph 6.4.3) and make a reference in the Tab S .pdf document. Not all videos
        received by the SIB will be relevant. All non-privileged videos will be handed over
        with other evidence to the AIB.
        6.4.4.19.3. S3. Releasable Diagrams (e.g., Fallout, Impact Area, Route-of-Flight,
        etc.). Ensure diagrams are self-explanatory. Format of the tab is up to the SIB
        President. This tab can be accomplished using Civil Engineering plots, aerial
        photographs, topographical maps, etc. Include only those diagrams that add to the
        report. Indicate direction with a northward pointing arrow on each diagram. If
        practical, indicate scale. Ensure the diagrams do not depict the location of human
        remains. If they do, they should be placed in Part 2 (Tab Y2) to protect the privacy
        interests of the decedent’s family.

     6.4.5.1. Tab T. Investigation, Analysis, and Conclusions. The Tab T is the most
     important part of the report. The investigation and analysis in formal reports and final
     messages must support the findings and causes. Clearly show how findings and causes
     were determined and support the logic behind the recommendations. The Tab T draws
     on all of the other Tabs to provide a complete picture of what happened, how it happened,
     and why it happened. Analyze data collected from witness testimony, technical
     evaluations, and other information. Describe each area investigated and discuss its
     significance if it is a factor in the mishap. This section records the opinions of the SIB,
     and it either accepts or rejects scenarios or theories as to the causes and factors in the
     mishap. Only in the case of a minority report are there differing findings, causes, or
     recommendations. Summarize conclusions at the end of each factor or non-factor worthy
     of discussion. Use the guidance below for documenting the investigation and analysis.
     See Figure 6.1 for the Tab T format.
     6.4.5.2. Boards need to pay particular attention to six critical aspects when developing
     the Tab T.
        6.4.5.2.1. The investigation needs to be done in a sequential and consistent manner
        so all relevant facts are collected and analyzed before any conclusions are drawn.
        SIBs need to ensure the facts lead to the conclusion, rather than the other way around.
        6.4.5.2.2. Assessing mishap factors, non-factors and non-factors worthy of discussion
        (NFWODs).
        6.4.5.2.3. Thoroughly and accurately documenting the results of the investigation in
        the Tab T and the final message.
        6.4.5.2.4. Developing concise findings (see AFI 91-204, Chapter 5).
        6.4.5.2.5. Assigning “cause” at the correct points in the mishap sequence (see AFI
        91-204, Chapter 5).
        6.4.5.2.6. Developing well-considered recommendations, assigned to the correct
        OPR, to prevent recurrence (see AFI 91-204, Chapter 5).
     6.4.5.3. Factors. A factor is any deviation, out-of-the-ordinary or deficient action, or
     condition discovered in the course of a mishap investigation that in the board’s opinion
     contributed to the eventual outcome. Determining mishap factors (and eliminating non-
     factors) enables the investigators to focus the investigation from all the issues under
     examination to those specific areas that are significant in the mishap sequence. Mishap
     factors explain why causes, such as pilot error, supervision, or equipment failure
     occurred. Factors are not mutually exclusive but are often interrelated and in some cases
     influence each other. When applicable, include a discussion of related human factors.
     For example, in a spatial disorientation mishap include the human factors that contributed
     to the disorientation, such as channelized attention or distraction and how these were
68                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


     manifested. Note: The human factors codes in the Tab T, Tab Y, and AFSAS must all
     match. A partial listing of possible factors to consider in a mishap includes Supervision,
     Qualifications, Weather, Logistics, Maintenance, Mission Planning, Flight Discipline,
     Currency/Experience, Aircraft Design, Quality Assurance, Aircraft Forms
     Documentation, Maintenance Supervision, etc. Factors are the basis for findings and
     recommendations. Most mishaps involve multiple factors which may be causal or non-
     causal. Examples of non-causal conditions which could be considered factors:
        6.4.5.3.1. Unit leadership failed to correct breaches of flight discipline by unit
        personnel other than the mishap pilot, leading the pilot to attempt an unauthorized
        maneuver (“Unit supervision was a factor in the mishap”).
        6.4.5.3.2. Deteriorating weather conditions resulted in a rushed, inadequate preflight,
        and the mishap flight engineer failed to ensure an engine cowling was properly
        secured (“Weather was a factor in the mishap”).
        6.4.5.3.3. Mishap crewmembers’ sleep was interrupted several times during the night
        by a loud party, and their subsequent poor performance could be at least partially
        attributable to fatigue (“Inadequate billeting and crew rest were factors in the
        mishap”).
     6.4.5.4. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion. NFWODs typically fall into one of three
     categories: areas uncovered during the investigation that did not cause the mishap or
     influence the outcome but that should be fixed due to the potential to be a factor in a
     future mishap (e.g., incorrect information in a maintenance tech order); areas that were
     thoroughly investigated and subsequently ruled out as factors (in order to provide context
     to the audience on why these areas are not factors); and areas that may be considered an
     interest item to the CA (e.g., RM, CRM, etc.). NFWODs usually become OFS which
     will result in an ORS.
        6.4.5.4.1. The following example highlights the difference between Factors and
        NFWODs. A trainer aircraft has an unrecoverable in-flight engine shutdown when
        the student pilot inadvertently pulls the throttle to cutoff at low altitude while
        reducing the power to idle. Poor throttle finger lift design allowed the possibility of
        inadvertent shutdown of engine. After ejection the pilot was unable to contact Search
        and Rescue due to survival radio battery failure but was successfully recovered by
        local police helicopter. “Operations: Survival radio battery” is a Non-Factor Worthy
        of Discussion and would generate an Other Finding and Recommendation of
        Significance because it did not influence the outcome of the mishap. “Logistics:
        Aircraft Design” is a factor because the throttle finger lift design allowed possibility
        of inadvertent engine shutdown. This factor would be a causal finding in the mishap
        and warrant a recommendation to fix the design.
     6.4.5.5. The following conventions will be used in developing the specific language of
     Tab T:
        6.4.5.5.1. Identifying Involved Personnel/Equipment. Do not identify involved
        personnel by name or personal call sign in the narrative; instead, use such terms as
        “the mishap aircraft (MA),” “the mishap maintainer (MM),” “ the mishap pilot 1
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                              69


           (MP1),” etc. Define the acronym the first time it is used. This applies to both the
           narrative discussion and the findings and recommendations.
           6.4.5.5.2. Write findings as full sentences, not bullet points. Use past tense for
           writing both the Tab T and the findings, since the events occurred in the past. Figure
           6.1 is an outline of Tab T.

Figure 6.1. Tab T Outline (See Attachment 4 for an example Tab T).
T1. Glossary of Terms and Acronyms.

T2. Mishap Overview.

T2.1. History of Mishap. The history of the mishap is a narrative, in chronological order, of all
pertinent events from briefing, ground operations, takeoff, etc., through the mishap sequence,
search and rescue, recovery of the pilot, and recovery of the aircraft for analysis, etc. For
maintenance mishaps that do not involve flight, start the mishap sequence from when the
maintainers were assigned the task that resulted in the mishap and continue until the damage is
identified and the aircraft is safe. Times of significant events should be integrated into the write-
ups. The history explains what occurred, but not why.

T2.2. SIB Conclusions. This section contains a brief summary of why the mishap
occurred. Think of this as a “bottom line up front” paragraph(s). This section does not
include detailed explanations; those will be included in the appropriate factors sections of
the Tab T. If human factors are issues in the mishap, be sure to include the name of the
human factor (as defined by the HFACS) and the specific HFACS code (see examples
below). It is not necessary to include the factor definition as listed in HFACS. This will
likely be the last part of the Tab T accomplished after the rest of the Tab T analysis has
been written.

T3. Background Information. Provide background information on the mishap crewmembers,
maintenance personnel, leadership, or others that were factors in the mishap. Do not place
analysis in this section; analysis is included in the appropriate factors section of the Tab T.
Simply describe the facts of the personnel involved in the mishap and do not use names.
Background information includes but is not limited to information on training, upgrades,
promotions, deployments, 30/60/90 day totals, and summary of 72-hour/14-day histories.
Include information on maintenance or logistics personnel if they were factors in the mishap.
Include information on others who may have been factors in the mishap, such as Air Traffic
Controllers, as appropriate. Also always include background information on the mishap aircrew
and mishap aircraft. The level of detail should provide sufficient background to understand the
condition of the vehicle and any significant events in its design, manufacture, procurement,
maintenance, or overhaul.

T3.1. Mishap Pilot (MP).
T3.2. Mishap Instructor Pilot (MIP).
T3.3. Mishap Maintainer (MM).
T3.4. Mishap Aircraft (MA).

If any of the above are not applicable to the mishap, do not include them in the Tab T and re-
number the section. Add others that were factors in the mishap such as Air Traffic Controllers,
AM personnel, Crash/Fire/Rescue, etc., as applicable.

T4. Operations Areas Investigated.

T4.1 Investigative Sources of Data. Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine
the operations factors in the mishap. For example: flight data recorder, interviews, training,
mission preparation, technical assistance provided by contractors, ATC communications, etc.

T4.2. Description of Systems, Processes, Organizations. Describe in narrative format the
normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process involved in the mishap, or the
organizational structures as required. For unusual operational environments involved in the
mishap, such as test or RPA organizations, provide a detailed description. This description may
include organizational charts, etc. Describe what should happen and what went wrong that led to
the subsequent analysis in the factor section below. Do not describe processes, systems, etc., that
had no influence on the outcome of the mishap. This section will contain enough detail so the
reader can understand the SIB’s investigative processes. If operations was not a factor in the
mishap sequence this section can simply state it was not a factor in the mishap.

T4.3. Factors. Analyze the operational factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome. This
section is written in narrative format. Each operations factor will be analyzed in a separate
write-up. Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered most
important to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap. Incorporate
operations human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human factors codes and
definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. In collaboration with the MO or HF member
(if applicable), integrate DoD HFACS nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the
applicable human factor in the operations factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a
detailed analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed to the factor under discussion.
For example, if the SIB is reviewing incomplete checklist guidance available to the pilot as a
factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up should include words to
the effect that “The mishap pilot used the T-156CL-1 which did not specifically state to pull the
fire shutoff T-handle when responding to an engine fire [OP003 – Procedural
Guidance/Publications]” and then explain how the human factor manifested itself or the result
“…which allowed fuel to continue to flow unabated to the burning engine.” (Note: The human
factors codes in the Tab T, Tab Y, and AFSAS must all match.) If there are no operational
factors for the mishap write “The SIB determined there were no operational factors in this
mishap.”

T4.3.1. Area to be discussed (e.g., “Mission Planning”).

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include enough
information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include,
as appropriate, references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Use photos
or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a discussion of how the
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                               71


particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually occurred during the mishap,
and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of each factor analysis will be a brief
summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal in this mishap.” If a
clear determination cannot be made, avoid statements such as “may have been a factor.” Instead
the SIB will use judgment to indicate the area was most likely a factor or not. For example,
“Conclusion: The SIB determined that Mission Planning was a causal factor in this mishap” or
“Conclusion: The SIB determined that Mission Planning was a factor in this mishap.” Do not
provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the conclusion as a
recommendation.

T4.4. Non-Factors.

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the mishap and
not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all-encompassing list, but rather a list of
areas/items the SIB looked at and ruled out. Those areas/items determined not to be factors in
the mishap but warrant command attention and/or may contribute to a future mishap should be
included in section T7, Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion.

T5. Maintenance Areas Investigated.

T5.1. Investigative Sources of Data. Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine
the maintenance factors in the mishap. For example: the mishap aircraft’s history, records,
engine history, relevant maintenance performed, maintenance training, results of technical
teardowns, maintenance supervision, etc.

T5.2. Description of Systems, Processes, Organizations. Describe in narrative format the
normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process involved in the mishap, or the
organizational structures as required. For aircraft systems involved in the mishap, provide a
detailed description of how the system should work. This description may include photographs,
diagrams, technical order quotes, etc. Describe what should happen and what went wrong that
led to the subsequent analysis in the factor section below. Do not describe processes, systems,
etc., that had no influence on the outcome of the mishap. This section will contain enough detail
so the reader can understand the SIB’s investigative processes. If maintenance was not a factor
in the mishap sequence this section can simply state it was not a factor in the mishap.

T5.3. Factors. Analyze the maintenance factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome.
This section is written in narrative format. Each maintenance factor will be analyzed in a
separate write-up. Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered
most important to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap.
Incorporate maintenance human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human factors codes
and definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. In collaboration with the MO or HF
member (if applicable), integrate DoD HFACS nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about
the applicable human factor in the factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a detailed
analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed to the maintenance factor under
 72                                           AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


discussion. For example if the SIB is reviewing incomplete Technical Order Guidance available
to the Crew Chief as a factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up
should include words to the effect that “The Crew Chief used the T.O. 1C-2A-5-01JG-69-2,
Task 07-7, which did not state to pull the widget safety pin after the widget was installed [OP003
– Procedural Guidance/Publications]” and then explain how the human factor manifested itself or
the result “…which allowed the widget to vibrate loose during flight resulting in the wing panel
being ingested into the mishap engine.” (Note: The human factors codes in the Tab T, Tab Y,
and AFSAS must all match.) If there are no maintenance factors for the mishap write “The SIB
determined there were no maintenance factors in this mishap.” Each separate maintenance factor
should be formatted in the following manner:

T5.3.1. Area to be discussed (e.g., “Technical Data Compliance”).

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include enough
information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include,
as appropriate, references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Use photos
or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a discussion of how the
particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually occurred during the mishap,
and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of each factor analysis will be a brief
summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal in this mishap.” If a
clear determination cannot be made, avoid statements such as “may have been a factor.” Instead
the SIB will use judgment to indicate the area was most likely a factor or not. For example,
“Conclusion: The SIB determined that Technical Data Compliance was a causal factor in this
mishap” or “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Technical Data Compliance was a factor in
this mishap.” Do not provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the
conclusion as a recommendation.

T5.4. Non-Factors.

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the mishap and
not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all-encompassing list, but rather a list of
areas/items the SIB looked at and ruled out. Those areas/items determined not to be factors in
the mishap but warrant command attention and/or may contribute to a future mishap should be
included in section T7, Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion.

T6. Logistics Areas Investigated.

T6.1. Investigative Sources of Data. Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine
the logistical factors in the mishap. For example: depot overhaul, depot quality assurance
procedures, depot training, acquisition processes, supervision, etc.

T6.2. Description of Systems, Processes, Organizations. Describe in narrative format the
normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process involved in the mishap, or the
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                             73


organizational structures as required. For logistics processes involved in the mishap, provide a
detailed description of how the process should work. This description may include photographs,
diagrams, work package quotes, etc. Describe what should happen and what went wrong that led
to the subsequent analysis in the factor section below. Do not describe processes, systems, etc.,
that had no influence on the outcome of the mishap. This section will contain enough detail so
the reader can understand the SIB’s investigative processes. If logistics was not a factor in the
mishap sequence this section can simply state it was not a factor in the mishap.

T6.3. Factors. Analyze the logistical factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome. This
section is written in narrative format. Each logistics factor will be analyzed in a separate write-
up. Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered most important
to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap. Incorporate logistics
human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human factors codes and definitions directly
from the Tab Y into the Tab T. In collaboration with the MO or HF member (if applicable),
integrate DoD HFACS nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human
factor in the logistics factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a detailed analysis and
rationale of how human factors contributed to the logistics factor under discussion. For example
if the SIB is reviewing incomplete Work Package Guidance available to logistics center
personnel as a factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up should
include words to the effect that “The ALC worker used T.O. 2J-F510-5-4 SWP 017-17, which
did not state to pull the widget safety pin after the widget was installed on the turbine disk
[OP003 – Procedural Guidance/Publications]” and then explain how the human factor
manifested itself or the result “…which allowed the widget to vibrate loose during flight
resulting in failure of the turbine blade and second and third stage High Pressure Turbine (HPT)
damage.” (Note: The human factors codes in the Tab T, Tab Y, and AFSAS must all match.) If
there are no logistical factors for the mishap write “The SIB determined there were no logistical
factors in this mishap.” Each separate logistical factor should be formatted in the following
manner:

T6.3.1. Area to be discussed (e.g., “Depot Quality Assurance Procedures”).

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include enough
information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include,
as appropriate, references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, human factors, etc. Use photos or diagrams as necessary.
Often it is helpful to organize this section into a discussion of how the particular action should
have been accomplished, how it actually occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to
the mishap. The last portion of each factor analysis will be a brief summary that ties the
discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal in this mishap.” If a
clear determination cannot be made, avoid statements such as “may have been a factor.” Instead
the SIB will use judgment to indicate the area was most likely a factor or not. For example,
“Conclusion: The SIB determined that Depot Quality Assurance Procedures was a causal factor
in this mishap” or “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Depot Quality Assurance Procedures
 74                                           AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


was a factor in this mishap.” Do not provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion.
Do not write the conclusion as a recommendation.

T6.4. Non-Factors.

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the mishap and
not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all-encompassing list, but rather a list of
areas/items the SIB looked at and ruled out. Those areas/items determined not to be factors in
the mishap but warrant command attention and/or may contribute to a future mishap should be
included in section T7, Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion.

T7. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion (NFWOD). NFWODs typically fall into one of three
categories: areas uncovered during the investigation that did not cause the mishap or influence
the outcome but should be fixed due to the potential to be a factor in a future mishap (e.g.,
incorrect information in a maintenance tech order); areas that were thoroughly investigated and
subsequently ruled out as factors (in order to provide context to the audience on why these areas
are not factors); and areas that may be considered an interest item to the CA (e.g., RM, CRM,
etc.). NFWODs usually become Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance for
section T10. If an issue contributed to the mishap, even minimally, it is a factor and should not
be placed in this section. Use the same format (analysis and conclusion) discussed for factors
above in paragraph T4.2.1. Also group NFWODs together by operations, maintenance, and
logistics. In collaboration with the MO or HF member (if applicable), integrate DoD HFACS
nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human factor in the NFWODs
section. Provide a detailed analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed to the factor
under discussion. For example if the SIB is reviewing incomplete checklist guidance available
to the pilot as a factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up should
include words to the effect that “The mishap pilot used the T-156CL-1 which did not specifically
state to pull the fire shutoff T-handle when responding to an engine fire [OP003 – Procedural
Guidance/Publications]” and then explain how the human factor manifested itself or the result
“…which allowed fuel to continue to flow unabated to the burning engine.” (Note: The human
factors codes in the Tab T, Tab Y, and AFSAS must all match.). Each separate NFWOD should
be formatted in the following manner:

T7.1. Area to be discussed (e.g., “AN-PRC-112 Survival Radio Antenna
Cracking/Failure”).

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the issue found during the investigation that led
to the NFWOD. Include enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s
rationale for conclusions. It will include, as appropriate, references to specific technical
orders, publications, training, personnel actions or inactions, results of technical analysis,
human factors, etc. Use photos or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize
this section into a discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished,
how it actually occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The
last portion of each NFWOD analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion
together.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          75


Conclusion: State the issue was a non-factor worthy of discussion in this mishap, and if
it could lead to future mishaps, state “but could be a factor in a future mishap.” For
example, “Conclusion: AN-PRC-112 Survival Radio Antenna Cracking/Failure was a
non-factor worthy of discussion in this mishap, but could be a factor in a future mishap.”
Do not provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the
conclusion as a recommendation.

T8. Findings and Causes. This section is a chronological list of all the SIB’s findings and
causes. Findings are a single event or condition that sustains the mishap sequence. Ensure all
findings and causes are supported by the investigation and analysis section. For additional
guidance reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. Number the findings consecutively using the
following convention: “Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.” Each finding should be a single, active voice
sentence concisely describing the event that sustains the mishap sequence. Writing in the active
voice means constructing sentences where the subject “acts.” For example: Passive – No safety
pins were installed in the widget. Active – The crew chief failed to install safety pins in the
widget as required by tech orders. Passive – Mission planning did not cover en-route obstacles.
Active – The crew failed to address en-route obstacles in mission planning as required.

Causal findings are further identified with the word “Causal” in parenthesis immediately after
the number. Human factors related causes should include those specific human factors attributed
as causal in a “due to” statement. For example: The mishap pilot failed to lower the landing
gear due to channelized attention. When there is no definitive cause, the SIB must use its
experience and knowledge to determine the “most likely” cause of the mishap. When entering
findings into AFSAS, copy only the narrative, not the “Finding 1 (Causal).” AFSAS
automatically populates the finding number and whether it is causal into the final message.

T9. Recommendations.

T9.1. Entering Recommendations into Tab T.

T9.1.1. This is a list of the SIB’s primary recommendations. Each recommendation must
correspond to a finding. However, each finding is not required to have a recommendation. For
example, a finding may be the sortie was uneventful from takeoff until recovery for pattern
work. This finding would not warrant a recommendation. Number the recommendations
consecutively using the following convention: “Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.”
Most causal findings should have recommendations for future prevention or mitigation.
Likewise, findings that are not causal may also have recommendations written against them. For
additional guidance reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5.

T9.1.2. When recommending changes to publications, be specific on the area to be updated. For
example, “Add a ‘Caution’ to T.O. 1T-5A-39-2-6, Task 8-1 after Step 9. Caution should read: ‘It
is possible for the widget pin lever to be in the full locked position and the widget pins not
properly engaged. Damage will result when closing the gear doors if the widget pins are not
engaged.’” Do not simply state “Add a Caution to the tech order for widget pin installation.”
 76                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


T9.1.3. Prior to finalizing any recommendation for any class of mishap, investigators must
contact the proposed OPR and OCR (if applicable) to ensure the correct action agency is
identified. If assistance is required to identify OPRs and OCRs, contact the CA safety office.
The OPR and OCR (if applicable) must be listed immediately following each recommendation in
Tab T. AFSAS will also require the office symbol, name, rank, and phone number or e-mail
address for each OPR/OCR.

T9.1.4. If an AF Form 847 or AFTO 22 was completed, place its tracking number after the
corresponding recommendation in Tab T with the statement “AFTO Form 22 (or AF Form 847)
submitted, tracking # XXXX.”

T9.2. Entering Recommendations into AFSAS.

T9.2.1. After Recommendations are finalized, they are entered into AFSAS for the final
message. AFSAS requires several additional fields beyond what the Tab T requires related to
the specific recommendations to be filled in for the final message. The items below (this is how
the Recommendation will look in the final message) are areas to determine when developing
Recommendations to fulfill the requirements of the final message. A recommendations
worksheet is available in the SIB Support documents on the AFSEC Portal page (AF Portal :
FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Products and Services : SIB Support) that provides
information on how to organize the information required for each Recommendation/ORS.

T9.2.1.1. Related Findings: X. This reflects the Finding(s) that precipitated the
Recommendation.

T9.2.1.2. Hazard/Deficiency: A one-liner related to what hazard precipitated the
Recommendation. The hazard/deficiency should describe a persistent or common hazard, not
merely repeat a finding or unusual one-time occurrence.

T9.2.1.3. Recommendation X. To assist with recommendations validation, see AFI 91-204,
Chapter 5.

T9.2.1.4. AF Form 847: Enter Tracking Number. AFSAS has fields to input AF Form 847
tracking numbers, so do not include them when copying the recommendation narrative.

T9.2.1.5. AFTO Form 22: Enter Tracking Number. AFSAS has fields to input AFTO 22
tracking numbers, so do not include them when copying the recommendation narrative.

T9.2.1.6. OPR: XXX. AFSAS requires the office symbol, name, rank, and telephone number or
e-mail address of an action officer for each OPR.

T9.2.1.7. OCRs: XXX. AFSAS requires the office symbol, name, rank, and telephone number
or e-mail address of an action officer for each OCR.

T9.2.1.8. Baseline Risk Hazard Index (RHI): X. RHIs for each recommendation are determined
by the SIB using the guidance found in AFSAS at the Help Link associated with RHI block for
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          77


the Recommendation being input and expert assistance (e.g., the Program Office Safety
Engineer). This represents the RHI BEFORE the applicable Recommendation is implemented,
i.e., the RHI as it existed at the time of the mishap.

T9.2.1.9. Residual RHI: X. This represents the RHI AFTER the applicable Recommendation is
implemented. This number should be higher than the number in T9.2.1.8 to reflect the reduced
risk.

T10. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS/ORS). Ensure the
rationale for all OFS and ORS is fully discussed in the narrative section (Non-Factors Worthy of
Discussion) of the report and final message. To assist with OFS and ORS validation, reference
AFI 91-204, Chapter 5.

T10.1. Unlike primary findings and recommendations (where not all findings have an associated
recommendation) each OFS must have at least one ORS. This is because some primary findings
only support the mishap sequence. However, since each OFS has the potential to contribute to
another mishap it needs an associated corrective action in the form of an ORS. Additionally, if
the SIB has an OFS with no corresponding ORS, AFSAS will not allow it to be entered.

T10.2. Entering Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS/ORS) into Tab T.

T10.2.1. For Tab T, list the OFS, immediately followed by the ORS. Number the OFS/ORS
consecutively using the following convention: “OFS 1, ORS 1, OFS 2, ORS 2, etc.”

T10.2.2. Prior to finalizing any ORS for any class of mishap, investigators must contact the
proposed OPR and OCR (if applicable) to ensure the correct action agency is identified. If
assistance is required to identify OPRs and OCRs, contact the CA safety office. The OPR and
OCR (if applicable) must be listed immediately following each ORS in Tab T. AFSAS will
require the office symbol, name, rank, and phone number or e-mail address for each OPR/OCR.

T10.2.3. If an AF Form 847 or AFTO 22 was completed, place its tracking number after the
corresponding ORS in Tab T with the statement “AFTO Form 22 (or AF Form 847) submitted,
tracking # XXXX.” When recommending changes to publications, be specific on the area to be
updated. For example, “Add a ‘Caution’ to T.O. 1T-5A-39-2-6, Task 8-1 after Step 9. Caution
should read: ‘It is possible for the widget pin lever to be in the full locked position and the
widget pins not properly engaged. Damage will result when closing the gear doors if the widget
pins are not engaged.’” Do not simply state “Add a Caution to the tech order for widget pin
installation.”

T10.3. Entering ORS into AFSAS.

T10.3.1. After the ORSs are finalized, they are entered into AFSAS for the final message.
AFSAS requires several additional fields beyond what the Tab T requires related to the specific
ORSs to be filled in for the final message. The items below (this is how the ORS will look in the
final message) are areas to determine when developing ORSs to fulfill the requirements of the
final message.

T10.3.1.1. Hazard/Deficiency: A one-liner related to what hazard precipitated the
Recommendation.

T10.3.1.2. ORS X. To assist with recommendations validation, see AFI 91-204, Chapter 5.

T10.3.1.3. AF Form 847: Enter Tracking Number. AFSAS has fields to input AF Form 847
tracking numbers, so do not include them when copying the ORS narrative.

T10.3.1.4. AFTO Form 22: Enter Tracking Number. AFSAS has fields to input AFTO 22
tracking numbers, so do not include them when copying the ORS narrative.

T10.3.1.5. OPR: XXX. AFSAS also requires the office symbol, name, rank, and phone number
or e-mail address of an action officer for each OPR.

T10.3.1.6. OCRs: XXX. AFSAS also requires the office symbol, name, rank, and phone
number or e-mail address of an action officer for each OCR.

T10.3.1.7. Baseline RHI: X. This number is determined by the SIB using the guidance found in
AFSAS at the Help Link associated with RHI block for the ORS being input. This represents the
RHI BEFORE the applicable ORS is implemented, i.e., the RHI as it existed at the time of the
mishap. OPRs can assist in computing severity and probability as required.

T10.3.1.8. Residual RHI: X. This number is determined by the SIB. This represents the RHI
AFTER the applicable ORS is implemented. This number should be higher than the number in
T10.3.1.7 to reflect the reduced risk. OPRs can assist in computing severity and probability as
required.

T11. Authentication Page. Type each primary SIB member’s name, rank, and board role on
the last page of this section. Have each concurring member, including primary members from
other services on joint investigations, sign above their name for authentication of the report or for
any changes to the report. If the formal SIB report needs to be changed after it is completed and
signed by the board, all primary members of the SIB will reconvene. However, the CA may
allow the SIB to make minor changes without reconvening the board.

T12. Minority Reports (if applicable). The primary members determine findings, causes, and
recommendations. Primary members who disagree with the results may submit a separate
minority report. Minority reports must include reasons for disagreement in a narrative format
and will list suggested findings, causes, and recommendations if different from those contained
in the original report. If a SIB member submits a minority report, their signature block still
appears on the Tab T authentication page but they do not sign above it. Instead, they sign the
minority report.
       6.4.5.6. All members of the SIB contribute to this tab as applicable. The Investigating
       Officer is responsible to complete this tab.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         79


     6.4.5.7. Tab U. Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of Confidentiality. If
     testimony was provided under a promise of confidentiality, it will be placed in this tab.
     Select only meaningful testimony (written or verbal). Only pertinent sections of
     interviews need be transcribed. If any interviews are only partially transcribed, the audio
     file must also be uploaded to this tab in AFSAS. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 3 for a
     discussion of promise of confidentiality.
        6.4.5.7.1. Privileged Interviews. For privileged interviews, whether written or
        recorded, all witnesses sign the form from AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, Witness
        Promise of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement. This only needs to be
        accomplished once for recorded interviews but must be done for ALL written
        statements whether initial or subsequent follow-up.
        6.4.5.7.2. For recorded interviews ensure all interviewees are read the Notice to
        Witness Documenting Promise of Confidentiality of Recorded Statements, AFI 91-204
        Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL
        recorded interviews whether initial or subsequent follow-up interviews.
        6.4.5.7.3. Place the statements and transcribed testimony of each witness together in
        chronological order starting with the first accomplished. The mishap participants are
        placed first followed by other witnesses.
        6.4.5.7.4. 72-hour and 14-day histories can be either privileged or non-privileged.
        Include 72-hour and 14-day histories given under a promise of confidentiality in this
        tab. The privileged 72-hour and 14-day history form available as part of the AFSEC
        SIB Support documents includes a privileged witness written statement. If the 72-
        hour and 14-day histories are obtained via recorded interview, follow the procedures
        in paragraph 6.4.5.7.2.
        6.4.5.7.5. The Investigating Officer completes this tab.
     6.4.5.8. Tab V. Other Supporting Privileged Products. This tab contains supporting
     privileged products not otherwise defined.
        6.4.5.8.1. V1.    Applicable Portions of Publications.       Whenever findings or
        recommendations involve deficiencies in or changes to technical orders, flight
        manuals, checklists, local IOs or directives, place highlighted pages or publication
        extracts revealing the deliberative process of the board in this tab. The SIB's
        conclusion that a particular paragraph of a document was or was not a factor is
        privileged.
        6.4.5.8.2. V2. AFTO Forms 22 or AF Forms 847. Include copies of SIB submitted
        AFTO Forms 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply, or AF
        Forms 847. Recommendation for Change of Publication, in this tab. Without
        disclosing the contents of the requested change, obtain a local control number from
        the unit quality assurance (QA) office for AFTO Forms 22 and a MAJCOM/HQ
        control number from the MAJCOM Standardization and Evaluation office for AF
        Forms 847. Additionally, place the mishap’s AFSAS number on the AF Form 847.
        Ensure no privileged safety information generated by the SIB is referenced on or
        included in the forms.
80                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


        6.4.5.8.3. V3. SIB Surveys. If a survey was administered by the SIB, include a copy
        and the results. Coordinate with HQ AFSEC/SEH (DSN 246-0880 or (505) 846-
        0880) prior to conducting any survey.
        6.4.5.8.4. V4. Copies of Opportunity to Submit Additional Comments Letters.
        These are memorandums sent to individuals, but not organizations, found causal
        during the course of a mishap investigation, allowing them the opportunity to provide
        comments for the MOFE process. Place copies signed by the Board President of
        these letters in this section of Tab V. Do not have the causal individual sign a copy
        before departing for the CA briefing; this will be accomplished by the CA safety staff
        following the out-brief. Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, for guidance.
        6.4.5.8.5. V5. Aircraft Weight and Balance. Include DD Form 365-4, Weight and
        Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical, only if the SIB recreated a weight
        and balance form using available data to determine weight and CG at the time the
        mishap occurred. If a copy of the aircrew’s planned weight and balance was on file,
        it is factual data and will be placed in Tab K.
        6.4.5.8.6. V6.  Other supporting privileged products.         Place any privileged
        documents used by the SIB but not included in other Tabs in this section.
        6.4.5.8.7. The Investigating Officer completes this tab.
     6.4.5.9. Tab W. Privileged Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations. If technical
     reports or engineering analysis are provided under a promise of confidentiality or its
     contents are based on privileged material, include the evaluation in this tab. See AFI 91-
     204 Attachment 4, Suggested Technical Expert Report Format, Part 2, for Tab W report
     format. The signed memorandums of acknowledgment, Memorandum for Contractor
     Representatives Serving as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations, AFI 91-204
     Attachment 3, must be placed in this tab in front of the respective technical reports.
     Additionally, include a copy of the report coversheet documenting promises of
     confidentiality to contractor representatives.
        6.4.5.9.1. The Maintenance Member completes this tab.
     6.4.5.10. Tab X. Privileged Photographs, Videos, Diagrams, and Animations.
        6.4.5.10.1. X1. Privileged Photographs. These photos, supporting analysis in Tab T,
        may be included here or imbedded in Tab T for clarity. These typically include
        photos showing deliberative SIB analysis of aircraft parts, photos showing parts
        involved in the mishap with imbedded analysis on the photo, photos showing
        reenactments, parts reconstruction, etc.
        6.4.5.10.2. X2. Privileged Videos. Only upload videos relevant to the investigation
        (in accordance with paragraph 6.4.3) and make a reference in the Tab X .pdf
        document.
        6.4.5.10.3. X3. Privileged Diagrams.
        6.4.5.10.4. X4. Privileged Animations. If applicable, include the final version of the
        privileged animation (in accordance with paragraph 6.4.3), and make a reference in
        the Tab X .pdf document.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            81


           6.4.5.10.5. The Investigating Officer completes this tab.
       6.4.5.11. Tab Y. Human Factors Analysis, Medical Reports, and Protected Health
       Information (PHI). Tab Y is broken up into 2 sub-Tabs: Y1 and Y2. Y1 is Human
       Factors Life Sciences and Medical Analysis and is privileged. Y2 is usually non-
       privileged factual information and may contain PHI. The SIB shall protect PHI with
       prudent safeguards to unauthorized release. Factual non-privileged information, to
       include PHI, is releasable to the AIB; however, PHI should not be released to the public.
       Safety personnel should consult AFSEC/JA or AFSEC/SEH for questions on PHI release.
       Tab Y contains the data substantiating the human factors summaries in the factors
       sections of Tab T. Tab Y templates are available on the AFSEC Portal page (AF Portal :
       FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center : Products and Services : SIB Support). Figure
       6.2 is an outline of Tabs Y1-Y2.

Figure 6.2. Tab Y Outline.
Tab Y1. Human Factors Analysis. The analysis in Tab T will include all relevant human
factors. DoD HFACS nano-codes will be cited in Tab T. Identify causal factors, factors, and
NFWODs using DoD HFACS nano-codes listed AFI 91-204 Attachment 6. The MO and HF
member will provide an analysis of all human factors and contribute to the SIB’s efforts in
writing the factors in Tab T4.2 and/or T5.2 and/or T6.2.

Y1.1. Summary of Injuries. This section is a brief narrative describing the type and mechanism
of injuries.

Y1.1.1. Limit PHI in Tabs T and Y1 to the minimum required to adequately describe the role of
a diagnosis or medication in the mishap sequence. PHI will be placed in Y2. For example, a
mishap member is found to have a previously undisclosed irregular heartbeat being treated by a
civilian doctor with a calcium-channel blocking medication. If this condition did not contribute
to the mishap, this might be mentioned as a NFWOD in Tabs T and Y1, but can be summarized
as “member found to have a previously undisclosed heart condition being treated with a
medication that may reduce heart rate and blood pressure.” Tab Y2 can spell out the diagnosis
and exact medication in detail. However, if this condition directly contributed to the member’s
loss of consciousness and the mishap, then the details may be needed in T and Y1 to more
explicitly explain the mishap sequence. For questions on where PHI may be placed, contact
AFSEC/SEH.

Y1.1.2. In rare instances and with HQ AFSEC approval, photos of human remains may be
included in Tab Y1 if deemed necessary to define injuries; otherwise, include photos in Y2 as an
attachment to the autopsy report. Injury pattern diagrams are preferred over photos in Y1.

Y1.2. DoD HFACS. This section will contain only a list of all DoD HFACS nano-codes that
appear in Tab T and will also include the definition. The analysis of the human factor that was
involved in the factor will be included in the Tab T. The nano-code will be identified either as a
causal factor, factor, or non-factor worthy of discussion as written in Tab T. Cross-reference the
related factor or non-factor worthy of discussion by referencing the number in parenthesis. For
instance, if “inattention” was causal to the mishap, write:
 82                                          AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


       PC101- Inattention (Causal – T4.3.1): Inattention is a factor when the individual has a
       state of reduced conscious attention due to a sense of security, self-confidence, boredom
       or a perceived absence of threat from the environment which degrades crew performance.
       (This may often be a result of highly repetitive tasks. Lack of a state of alertness or
       readiness to process immediately available information).

Y1.2.1. Causal Factors. The SIB should indicate which HFACS were associated with mishap
causal factors.

Y1.2.2. Factors. The SIB should indicate which HFACS were associated with mishap factors.

Y1.2.3. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion (NFWOD). The SIB should indicate which HFACS
were associated with mishap NFWODs.

Y1.3. Human factors consultant reports. If an HF member (i.e. aerospace and operational
physiologist, psychologist) is on the SIB (either as a primary member or consultant), place the
report here. The consultant report only speaks for the consultant’s point of view.

Y1.3.1. If the SIB disagrees or discounts a significant portion of a consultant report this should
be annotated in this section.

Y1.4. Additional Consultant Reports. Include other consultant reports here if applicable.

Tab Y2. Protected Medical Documents. This is usually non-privileged information and might
be given to the AIB. If provided to the AIB, only give the entire record or unmarked factual
documents, but NOT sections, pages deemed appropriate to the mishap, or marked-up records as
those would be considered the workings of the board and privileged. Non-safety privileged
medical documents are protected by other laws and regulations (HIPAA, Privacy Act, etc.).
Include the following in this section:

Y2.1. Toxicology Reports. Scan and paste in the reports from relevant toxicology tests.

Y2.2. Physical Examinations And Medical Condition. Include scanned copies or AHLTA print-
outs of all physical exams, the most recent PHA, the DD Form 2766, any active waivers, and the
person’s current serial profile.

Y2.2.1. Post Mishap Physical and/or Autopsy Report. Factual post-mishap physicals and/or
autopsy reports must be included here. Photos of human remains highlighting fatal injuries may
be included as an attachment to the autopsy report. Also include factual radiology reports,
statements of prognosis, and prescribed medications.
           6.4.5.11.1. The Medical Officer and/or Human Factors Member complete this tab.
       6.4.5.12. Tab Z. SIB Proceedings and BP Comments. Use this tab to provide reviewing
       agencies an assessment of investigation difficulties and make recommendations for
       improving reporting and investigating procedures.
           6.4.5.12.1. The Board President and Investigating Officer complete this tab.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                            83


   6.4.6. Part 3. Part 3 is a part of the formal report and is provided to upload the final SIB
   out-brief slides in AFSAS.
6.5. Temporarily De-convening a SIB
   6.5.1. There may be occasions when a SIB is waiting on technical analysis for a part or for
   wreckage recovery and/or transportation. The CA may elect to temporarily de-convene the
   SIB and have the SIB members return to their home station. However, this does not relieve
   the SIB members of their investigative responsibilities and the SIB remains their primary
   duty when needed for SIB duties.
   6.5.2. Before temporarily de-convening a SIB, the CA/SE office will ensure that the CA has
   approved the temporary de-convening and will release a status message detailing this
   approval. However, the SIB will not de-convene until the investigation is complete up to the
   point that they need the specific part or wreckage to continue further. All tabs and draft final
   message should be finalized or written with placeholders awaiting the results of analysis or
   wreckage recovery.
   6.5.3. Prior to de-convening, a reconvene plan should be developed to allow the SIB ample
   time to finish the investigation and complete the tabs, briefing, and update the final message.
   The SIB must reconvene to deliberate in person or via VTC. If it is more convenient to
   reconvene just prior to the out-brief, the SIB must allow enough time to finish deliberations
   and finalize the tabs, briefing, and final message before the out-brief.
   6.5.4. The CA/SE office should continue to obtain extensions as appropriate and release
   status messages indicating the extension with comments on the status of the delay.
   Additionally, unless board members change, the original SIB orders are valid until the SIB
   has completed the investigation.
6.6. Briefing Investigation Results.
   6.6.1. Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes the formal report (if required),
   the SIB will provide a briefing on the results of the investigation to the CA for Class A and B
   mishaps. All SIB primary members should attend the CA out-brief in-person unless video
   teleconference or a slides-only out-brief has been approved by the CA. SIBs will contact the
   CA safety office for example briefings, briefing templates, and to coordinate the out-brief.
   The out-brief should occur within 15 days after the SIB completes the investigation to avoid
   minimizing the urgency of the safety investigation and to begin implementation of
   recommendations that are aimed at mitigating hazards to avoid future mishaps. For Class A
   or B mishaps that involve aircraft/equipment or personnel from more than one MAJCOM
   (including the ARC), the MAJCOM that is not the convening authority will be allowed to
   have access to the formal mishap report and limited representation at the CA formal out-
   brief.
   6.6.2. All briefings will be given with no prior screening of content except as noted. Board
   independence is critical to the integrity of the SIB process. Historically, SIB independence is
   a Congressional interest item, periodically reviewed by Government Accountability Office
   (GAO) and DoD/IG.
   6.6.3. Per AFI 91-204, Chapter 6 the only briefings authorized for Class A mishaps are to
   the NAF commander and MAJCOM commander (or equivalent such as the Air Warfare
 84                                          AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


   Center Commander, the affected COMAFFOR, etc.). With MAJCOM/CC approval, the SIB
   may brief the NAF/CC (or equivalent such as the Air Warfare Center Commander) and the
   affected COMAFFOR for a contingency mishap, for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES
   ONLY, prior to briefing the MAJCOM/CC. The NAF/CC (and COMAFFOR) and those
   invited to the informational briefing will not direct changes to the SIB report or direct further
   investigation. The briefing must be free from the appearance of undue command influence
   that advice and directions can sometimes create. There will be no intermediate or pre-
   briefings given to MAJCOM or NAF staffs, directorates, the mishap wing commander, etc.,
   except as noted in paragraph 6.6.3.1. No pre-briefing or informational slides will be
   distributed prior to the CA out-brief. However, a read-ahead copy of the briefing may be
   forwarded directly to the CA provided this copy is not coordinated or shared with staff
   members outside the safety staff.
      6.6.3.1. The CA safety staff may be pre-briefed prior to the CA briefing to provide
      suggestions for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These inputs will not override the
      SIB’s deliberations, results, and judgment. This briefing will not include any other CA
      staff members, directorates, etc.
   6.6.4. When CA briefings are accomplished for Class B flight mishaps, no pre-briefings will
   be given to NAF staff, mishap wing staff, etc. However, the SIB may pre-brief the NAF
   safety office per paragraph 6.6.3.1. above.
   6.6.5. SIBs must ensure a copy of the briefing does not remain on the computer used for the
   presentation following any briefings given to the CA, NAF/CC, MAJCOM/SE staff, etc.
6.7. SIB Close-out.
   6.7.1. At conclusion of a SIB, the SIB/SIO will upload Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 (as required)
   of the investigation results into AFSAS and accomplish the following actions:
      6.7.1.1. The IO or BP will keep an electronic copy of all SIB working files, tabs, etc., on
      a portable hard drive, DVDs, or other suitable media from the SIB’s computers in case
      any material is needed between when the SIB de-convenes and the out-brief is complete.
      The IO or BP copy will be erased or destroyed after the CA accepts the results of the
      SIB’s investigation and the final message is accepted by the AFSEC.
      6.7.1.2. SIBs will bring the AFTO Forms 22 and AF Forms 847 to the CA out-briefing.
      CA safety staff will submit them to appropriate agencies at the conclusion of the briefing,
      unless previously submitted for critical safety actions. In the absence of a CA briefing,
      the CA safety staff will coordinate with the SIB to submit the forms to the appropriate
      agencies.
      6.7.1.3. SIBs will bring the Tab V, Opportunity To Submit Additional Comments (if
      applicable) to the CA out-brief. Once the CA accepts the formal report and releases the
      final message, the CA will send a copy of the memorandum to the mishap unit safety
      office.
      6.7.1.4. SIBs will do the following prior to the scheduled out-brief. In AFSAS, load the
      .pdf tabs for Part 1 and Part 2 of the formal report along with any Part 3 materials.
      Prepare the final message in AFSAS, but do not select “Submit for Release” to the CA.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         85


     Notify the CA safety office once the Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 materials and final message
     are loaded.
     6.7.1.5. The CA safety office will review, but not staff, all products for quality control
     purposes (including accuracy and completeness of the investigation) and notify the SIB if
     changes are required to meet AFI 91-204 or AFMAN 91-223 guidance. The SIB will
     make changes prior to de-convening. Following the out-brief, and after any necessary
     changes are made, the SIB will forward the final message to the CA by selecting “Submit
     for Release” in AFSAS. The CA’s safety office will release the final message within
     three duty days of the out-brief.
     6.7.1.6. Following release of the final message, HQ AFSEC/SEF conducts a quality
     control review of the formal report for compliance with AFI 91-204/AFMAN 91-223 and
     accuracy/completeness of the investigation. This process may take up to 10 days to
     accept or reject the final message. If the final message is rejected, further coordination
     between the SIB and the CA will be required. Following a rejection, corrections must be
     completed and a final supplemental message must be released within 10 days.
     6.7.1.7. Signing Tab Q, AIB Transfer Document: Include a memorandum from the SIB
     President to the AIB President (see paragraph 6.4.4.17) regarding the location and
     disposition of all non-privileged (Part 1) evidence (listing of witnessed interviewed,
     photographs, wreckage, other components sent off for analysis, etc.) and place in Tab Q
     of the formal report. A template of this memorandum can be found in the SIB Support
     Documents on the AFSEC Portal (AF Portal : FOAs : AFSEC - Air Force Safety Center :
     Products and Services : SIB Support). This is usually one of the last items completed by
     the SIB and occurs as the SIB is concluding. Ensure the AIB President knows the
     disposition of all non-privileged evidence (including wreckage and components shipped
     for analysis) and acknowledges custodial responsibility in writing. The AIB will be
     responsible for final disposition of all material released to them by the SIB.
        6.7.1.7.1. If the AIB President is not available and the SIB is prepared to release the
        non-privileged evidence, consult with the CA’s SJA to coordinate release to the host
        installation SJA, who will maintain custody until the AIB President is able to accept.
        Transfer may be made to tenant units, as appropriate, with written agreement between
        the installation commander and tenant unit commander. For additional information
        refer to AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations.
     6.7.1.8. Privileged (Part 2) evidence (working files, tapes containing privileged witness
     interviews, draft Tab Ts, staged photographs, etc.) will be sent or hand carried to the CA
     safety office. This evidence must be handled IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, and will be
     destroyed by CA safety personnel or AFSEC Representative, as appropriate, upon release
     of the MOFE message.
     6.7.1.9. Reformat the host wing supplied computers used by the SIB immediately prior
     to the SIBs departure. Alternatively, military approved “wiping” software can be used on
     properly partitioned hard-drives.

     6.7.1.10. Delete all network files, folders, e-mail, and backup copies used by the SIB
     once the investigation is complete.

                           SIB SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS LIST

A2.1. Purpose: This SIB support requirements list is included in this instruction to outline the
recommended type and quantity of support items that are normally required to accomplish a
formal safety investigation of a mishap. This list affords the potential units a chance to assess
their internal capability and their ability to acquire non-possessed items from other sources, as
well as identification of equivalent/alternative sources. Note: This list is extensive, but it is not
all-inclusive. Because of the nature of aircraft mishaps, terrain and local conditions may drive
other requirements. Be prepared to meet SIB requirements as they arise.
A2.2. Facilities.
   A2.2.1. One large room capable of seating 10 to 12 people in a conference-style seating
   plan. This room must also provide desk/computer workspace (around the outside walls) for
   eight personnel plus room for printers, white boards, etc. This is the main SIB room.
   A2.2.2. One or two office(s) for three to five admin personnel (including the Recorder), two
   to three computers, a SIB networked high volume scanner/printer/photocopier, a full-sized
   photocopier, a fax machine, a shredder, two filing cabinets, a safe, office supplies, a
   refrigerator, and a coffeepot with accessories.
   A2.2.3. One small office for the Board President (BP).
   A2.2.4. One small room for interviews.
   A2.2.5. All rooms must be located reasonably close to one another, and all must have their
   locks changed with the several sets of keys being delivered to the BP. No one outside the
   SIB should have copies.
A2.3. Computers.
   A2.3.1. The SIB can get up and running immediately if the computer requirements are met
   before SIB members arrive. All items below can be acquired/installed/configured in the
   several days before the SIB members arrive. Computer support must ensure everything
   works before the SIB arrives.
   A2.3.2. Minimum of one computer for each permanent SIB member plus two to three
   computers in the Admin section. To ensure the computers are fast enough, they must be no
   more than one generation old; do not give the SIB anything older. Notebooks or PCs are
   acceptable. A minimum of four of the computers must have internal or external CD writers.
   Two portable Hard Drives (500GB) for backing-up SIB shared hard drive every night. All
   computers must have Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook, Adobe PRO, WinZip, a graphics
   manipulation program, and virus scanning software.
       A2.3.2.1. Option 1: Allocate the SIB a temporary “Shared Drive” on one of the base
       servers. Configure the shared drive such that only SIB members have access. The
       capacity of the shared drive must be at least 10 GB.
       A2.3.2.2. Option 2: Create a mini-LAN with the SIB computers. Network all computers
       to each other such that any hard drive can be accessed by any of the other computers.
       Note: If this option is used computers must still be connected to the Internet.

                                        SAMPLE TAB T

The purpose of every safety investigation is to determine all factors (human, materiel, and
environmental) that directly or indirectly contributed to the mishap. This information
is used by aircrews, equipment operators, supervisors, commanders, staffs, and designers to
eliminate cause factors and thus help prevent recurrence of similar mishaps. Each safety
investigation adds to the overall USAF mishap experience, providing a basis for corrective
actions and reduced mishap potential. Investigative findings and recommendations may
determine the requirements for additional training, validate a need for increased frequency of
maintenance, justify improvements to materiel, establish future design criteria, and achieve other
long-range results. This places a premium on the accuracy and thoroughness of each
investigation to determine the ultimate actions to be taken to remove or eliminate factors that
cause or contribute to mishaps.

Overall writing tips:

Your goal in Tab T is to clearly show the following:
   1. Areas investigated.
   2. Significant possible factors considered and rejected, with rationale.
   3. Factors accepted, with rationale as to why they are considered most credible as
      appropriate.

When writing to this, it is important to plainly detail why you considered something as a
potential mishap factor, the tools you used for analysis (e.g., parts analysis at XXX laboratory,
simulator tests, human factors consultants, etc.), and how the SIB came to its conclusions. It is
important to provide full disclosure in your rationale (e.g., the Flight Data Recorder did not
record the exact airspeed for a specific event, but the SIB was able to reasonably estimate the
airspeed based on videotape analysis performed by XYZ laboratory and simulator testing). Try
to anticipate questions that may arise from your conclusions and do your best to answer them up
front. Do not leave the reader guessing. Try to fully develop the logic chain used to reach your
conclusion. Always remember you are writing for someone who has no previous knowledge of
the mishap and likely not knowledgeable of the specific aircraft/mission in question. Above all,
use plain English whenever possible.

Writing should be in Times New Roman 12. Use past tense throughout (“The SIB determined,”
“The mishap aircraft departed”). Be consistent with terms and acronyms used throughout (e.g.,
“pounds” or “lbs”). The first time you use an acronym, spell it out followed by the acronym in
parenthesis (e.g., Safety Investigation Board (SIB)). Any time after that you can simply use the
acronym.

Fill in details as much as possible. You can quote applicable regulations/instructions (but don’t
include the entire document in Tab T; include applicable pages in Tab V), interview statements
from mishap participants, etc. If pictures and diagrams help build your case, use them where
appropriate. Don’t forget to research and reference past mishaps if applicable (e.g., The SIB
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        103


determined there have been seven in-flight engine shutdowns for malfunctioning Manifold
Oscillators (MO) in the last four years.).

Above all, try to keep answering the “why” questions until you come to a logical point where the
mishap chain started, and more importantly, one where you can make recommendations to fix
the deficiency/deficiencies to keep the mishap from happening again.

For example:
The Mishap aircraft declared an IFE and recovered to home station uneventfully.
Why?
The Mishap Engine (ME) Manifold Oscillator (MO) failed.
Why?
The ME MO fractured lengthwise abeam the mounting clamp due to high cycle fatigue.
Why?
The ME MO was not properly installed during phase maintenance 6.8 hours prior to the mishap.
Why?
The Technical Order 1-F109JG-2 paragraph 13, Step A, for installing the MO is incomplete and
does not include steps to properly torque the mounting clamp following reassembly.
Why?
The Program Office did not incorporate a Technical Service Bulletin from the ME manufacturer
detailing the proper steps to follow in order to install the MO. (This is where the SIB would
make a recommendation to correct this condition.)

T2. MISHAP OVERVIEW

T2.1. HISTORY OF MISHAP

The history of the mishap is a narrative, in chronological order, of all pertinent events
from briefing, ground operations, takeoff, etc., through the mishap sequence, search and
rescue, recovery of the pilot, and recovery of the aircraft for analysis, etc. Do not include
analysis, just the facts in the mishap sequence. For maintenance mishaps that do not
involve flight, start the mishap sequence from when the maintainers were assigned the
task that resulted in the mishap and continue until the damage is identified and the
 108                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


aircraft is safe. Times of significant events should be integrated into the write-ups.
Remember to define an acronym the first time it is used in the Tab T (e.g., The mishap
sortie (MS)). The history explains what occurred, but not why.

The mishap flight (MF) was scheduled as a two-ship F-15E surface attack (SA),
Continuation Training (CT) sortie to the BT-69 bombing range. The MF accomplished
mission planning the day prior to the mishap sortie. The mishap flight lead (MFL)
selected VR-069. Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) and Aviation Hazard Advisory System
(AHAS) were forecasting LOW bird activity during the planned flight period. The
mission profile included a formation takeoff, enroute navigation to the low-level route,
VR-069 points A – G, Terrain Following Radar (TFR) operations, radar and visual
bombing events on the range, and return-to-base (RTB) for a formation landing.

The MFL re-checked AHAS prior to the briefing and verified the bird LOW condition
was still in effect. The mission briefing was unremarkable and discussed bird hazard and
avoidance procedures on the low level route. The MFL challenged all members of the
flight not to allow low-level entry unless an updated bird condition was obtained within
30 minutes of entering the low altitude structure. The mishap pilot (MP) provided a full
crew briefing to the mishap weapons systems officer (MWSO) to include bird strikes,
emergency procedures, and ejection topics. At the step briefing, the squadron Top-3
briefed bird LOW conditions for VR-069 for the scheduled flight time. The mishap crew
(MC) stepped on time. During ground operations, the MFL developed a hydraulic leak
that required maintenance actions. No spare aircraft were available so the MFL directed
the MC to take off single ship in order to meet their scheduled range time. The MC took
off uneventfully at 1015L.

Enroute to the low-level entry point, the MC initiated medium altitude TFR checks. The
mishap aircraft (MA) would not pass initial TFR checks so the MC continued to
troubleshoot the system. The MC also noticed weather building around the low level
entry point. The MC cancelled Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and continued under Visual
Flight Rules (VFR) while attempting to avoid the building weather. The MC detected a
small rain shower both visually and on the Air-to-Ground (A/G) radar along the intended
route of flight. The MC deviated around the rain shower until they found a suitable
opening in the clouds for their descent. The MC also continued to work the TFR
problems. Unable to fix the TFR problems, the MC elected to fly the low-level route
visually, without TFR assistance.

At 1020L, the bird condition for VR-069 points B through D changed from LOW to
SEVERE.

The MC entered VR-069 at 1100L at 500 ft above ground level (AGL). The MC did not
re-check AHAS with either squadron operations or the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) as
required by the Operations Group (OG) In-Flight Guide (IFG). The IFG requires aircrew
to check current bird conditions within 30 minutes of low-level or range entry. At the
second turn point of VR-069 (point C), the MC encountered numerous blue footed
boobies. An unknown number of birds impacted the MA. In response to the initial
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          109


impact, the MC began an immediate climb reaching approximately 30 degrees nose high.
Shortly after beginning the climb, the MC noticed both engine fire lights illuminated.
The MWSO noticed fire and smoke trailing the MA. The MC also noticed both engines
winding down and began to feel the MA shake violently. As the MA airspeed began to
decay, and as the MA vibrations increased, the MC elected to eject passing through
approximately 3000 ft AGL. Both aircrew ejected successfully and landed in a plowed
field approximately three minutes later. The MA impacted the ground in a remote,
forested area and was destroyed.

After ejection, both the MP and MWSO retrieved their AN/PRC-112 survival radios and
attempted to extend the “whip” antenna. Both antennas had fatigue cracking where the
antenna is attached to the radio unit and broke off as they attempted to extend them. This
did not delay their recovery as local law enforcement officials driving on a remote
country road saw the MC parachuting to the ground and arrived within five minutes. The
MC was transported to a local hospital where they were treated and released for minor
injuries (scrapes and bruises) experienced during the ejection.

T2.2. SIB CONCLUSIONS

This section contains a brief summary of why the mishap occurred. Think of this as a
“bottom line up front” paragraph(s). This section does not include detailed
explanations; those will be included the appropriate factors sections of the Tab T. If
human factors are issues in the mishap, be sure to include the name of the human factor
(as defined by the HFACS) and the specific HFACS code (see examples below). It is not
necessary to include the factor definition as listed in HFACS. This will likely be the last
part of the Tab T accomplished after the rest of the Tab T analysis has been written.

The SIB determined that the MC failed to adhere to OG procedures and “obtain a current
AHAS update (from squadron TOP 3, RCO, or SOF) within 30 minutes of low level
entry” due to two human factors. First the crew channelized their attention [PC102 –
channelized attention] on troubleshooting the TFR problem. Due to what was eventually
determined to be a failed transmitter, the MC experienced a continual fly up any time the
system was turned on. The MC attempted to solve this problem for approximately eight
minutes by accomplishing numerous system and component built-in tests (BITs) and by
turning the system off and back on to try to reset it. None of these actions were
successful (or would be with a bad transmitter).

 MC eventually decided to stop working the TFR problem and turn it off, however they
admitted they were distracted [PC108 – distraction] from their normal habit patterns by
the building weather. These two human factors (distraction and channelized attention)
contributed to the MC’s failure to remember to obtain a revised bird condition update.

In 2008 ACC tested a bird detection and warning system called BIRDFINDER for use on
USAF aircraft that routinely operate in low level environments. Testing revealed that
although the system was very successful in detecting most birds, at speeds between 480
and 540 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS), detection times varied between 1 and 5
 110                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


seconds depending on the size of bird formations. Testing also revealed anything less
than 2 seconds was insufficient for avoidance. COMACC decided not to procure the
system. Although the BIRDFINDER system was not procured, ACC had funded testing
of the BIRDFINDER II system which included improvements on detection ranges/times.
At the time of this mishap, the system was not yet ready for testing.

T3. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Provide background information on the mishap crewmembers, maintenance personnel,
leadership, or others (Air Traffic Controllers, Airfield Management, etc.) that were
factors in the mishap. Do not place analysis in this section; analysis is included in the
appropriate factors section of the Tab T. Simply describe the facts of the personnel
involved in the mishap and do not use names. Background information includes but is
not limited to information on training, upgrades, promotions, deployments, 30/60/90 day
totals, and summary of 72-hour/14-day histories. Include information on additional crew
members, maintenance, or logistics personnel if they were factors in the mishap. Include
information on others who may have been factors in the mishap, such as Air Traffic
Controllers, as appropriate. Also always include background information on the mishap
aircrew and mishap aircraft. The level of detail should provide sufficient background to
understand the condition of the vehicle and any significant events in its design,
manufacture, procurement, maintenance, or overhaul.

T3.1.   Mishap Pilot (MP).
T3.2.   Mishap Instructor Pilot (MIP).
T3.3.   Mishap Maintainer (MM).
T3.4.   Mishap Aircraft (MA).

If any of the above are not applicable to the mishap, do not include them in the Tab T,
and re-number the section. Add others as applicable.

T3.1. MISHAP PILOT (MP)

You can either provide the background information in a narrative or list style. Examples
of both are included below. If there is anything unusual (e.g., significant gaps in
training) briefly explain the reason.

Narrative example:

The MP was a 34 year old F-15E Instructor Pilot (IP). He was a 1997 graduate of the Air
Force Academy. He attended Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) at Vance AFB, OK,
graduating in June 1998. From July to December 1998 he attended the F-15E basic
course at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC. Upon graduation, he was assigned to RAF
Lakenheath, UK. In January 2002, he was assigned as an Air Liaison Officer (ALO) to
Camp Red Cloud, Korea. In January of 2003 he was assigned to the 69 FS at Seymour
Johnson AFB, NC, where he was an Assistant Director of Operations (ADO).

The MP had 1517.4 total hours, of which 1200.4 were in the F-15E. He upgraded to IP in
August of 2003 and had accumulated 469.2 Instructor hours. His 30/60/90 day sortie and
flying hour total were: 7/12.9, 15/24.5, 26/38.2. He was current and qualified in all areas
of the F-15E.

The MP’s medical history, 14-day and 72-hour history was unremarkable. His flight
physical was current with no waivers required. His physiological training was current.

T3.3. MISHAP MAINTAINER (MM)

If maintenance personnel (or other personnel such as Air Traffic Controllers, Airfield
Management, ABMs, etc.) were factors in the mishap, include their information. If any of
the above are not applicable to the mishap, do not include them in the Tab T, and re-
number the section.

The MM was a 26 year old, SSgt avionics specialist. He entered the Air Force in 2001
and completed technical school the same year. His first assignment was to RAF
 112                                         AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014


Lakenheath and he has been assigned to the 69 AMU since 2004. He is a fully qualified
7-level on current Red X orders.

T3.4. MISHAP AIRCRAFT (MA)

Provide the background information in a narrative style. If there is anything unusual
such as significant gaps in flying status for cannibalization status, repeating write-ups,
ground aborts, etc., briefly explain the reason and, if applicable, the corrective action.
Include time since major inspection or overhaul. Do not include analysis, just the facts as
related to the MA history/background.

The SIB reviewed all aircraft records for unusual trends, discrepancies, or circumstances.
The MA’s last major phase inspection was completed on 23 Mar 09 where the only
significant issue was the engine was replaced due to a leaking oil tank. Since 1 Apr
2009, the MA flew a total of 37 sorties consisting of 21 Code-1, 11 Code-2, and 5 Code-3
sorties. On 13 May the MA ground aborted for a Flight Control System (FLCS) self-test
failure where the digital flight control computer was replaced as the corrective action.
Two days later, the MA again ground aborted for a FLCS self-test failure. This time
maintenance found the right stab integrated servo-actuator intermittent and replaced it.
On 19 May the MA again ground aborted for FLCS failure and the left main landing gear
weight-on-wheels (WOW) switch was found to be intermittent and was replaced. The
FLCS problem has not repeated since.

Additionally, the MA experienced a recurring Terrain Following Radar (TFR)
malfunction. On 2 Apr the TFR was inoperative and the Sensor Processor Intervelometer
Key Encryption (SPIKE) unit was replaced. The write-up repeated on 6 Apr and the
SPIKE 2751K2 relay was replaced. On 24 Apr the TFR was inoperative in the “hard
ride” mode and this was signed off as Could Not Duplicate (CND) the malfunction. That
write-up repeated the next day and maintenance found a wire in the left main landing
gear WOW switch crimped and repaired the splice area. On 18 May the TFR system was
inoperative one hour into the flight and the SPIKE unit was again replaced. On 22 May
the TFR inoperative write-up recurred and the #1 Kanuter Radar Relay (KRR) was
replaced. The following day the write-up repeated and the #2 KRR was replaced.

T4. OPERATIONS AREAS INVESTIGATED

T4.1. INVESTIGATIVE SOURCES OF DATA

Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine the operations factors in the
mishap. For example: flight data recorder, interviews, training, mission preparation,
technical assistance provided by contractors, air traffic controller communications, etc.

The SIB analyzed data from numerous sources. The SIB recovered the MA’s Head Up
Display (HUD) videotape from the wreckage, and although damaged in the post-impact
fire, was able to retrieve valuable footage through help from the Air Force Safety Center
(AFSEC) Mishap Analysis and Animation Facility (MAAF). The SIB also retrieved bird
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          113


forecast information from both BAM and AHAS as well as independent regional wildlife
data from the Regional Observatory Directorate of Environmental Nesting Tendencies
(RODENT). The SIB conducted multiple interviews with the MC, MFL, wing and
squadron supervision, and wing aircrew that had flown VR-069 in the hour preceding the
mishap. The SIB collected bird remains and sent them to the Smithsonian Institution for
analysis. The SIB conducted a survey among 5th Fighter Wing (5FW). The SIB received
on-site technical support from the AFSEC Bird/Wildlife Strike Hazard (BASH) branch,
egress expertise from Hill AFB, Utah, and human factors expertise from the AFSEC Life
Sciences branch.

T4.2. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, ORGANIZATIONS

Describe in narrative format the normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process
involved in the mishap, or the organizational structures as required. For unusual operational
environments involved in the mishap, such as test or RPA organizations, provide a detailed
description. This description may include organizational charts, etc. Describe what should
happen and what went wrong that led to the subsequent analysis in the factor section below. Do
not describe processes, systems, etc., that had no influence on the outcome of the mishap. This
section will contain enough detail so the reader can understand the SIB’s investigative processes.
If operations was not a factor in the mishap sequence, this section can simply state it was not a
factor in the mishap.

T4.3. FACTORS

Analyze the operational factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome. This section is
written in narrative format. Each operations factor will be analyzed in a separate write-
up. Multiple factors (e.g., procedures, training, experience, currency, etc.) need to be
analyzed and discussed in separate write ups and should not be grouped within a single
factor. Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered most
important to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap.
Incorporate operations human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human factors
codes and definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. Integrate DoD HFACS
nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human factor in the
operations factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a detailed analysis and
rationale of how human factors contributed to the factor under discussion. For example,
if the SIB is reviewing incomplete checklist guidance available to the pilot as a factor
under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up should include words
to the effect that “The mishap pilot used the T-156CL-1 which did not specifically state to
pull the fire shutoff T-handle when responding to an engine fire [OP003 – Procedural
Guidance/Publications]” then explain how the human factor manifested itself or the
result “…which allowed fuel to continue to flow unabated to the burning engine.” If
there are no operational factors for the mishap write “The SIB determined there were no
operational factors in this mishap.” Each separate operations factor should be formatted
in the following manner:

T4.3.1. MISSION PLANNING
 114                                        AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014



Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap (see
paragraph T4.3.2.below for an example). Include enough information so the reader can
logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include, as appropriate,
references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Use
photos or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a
discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually
occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of
each factor analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal factor in
this mishap.” For example, “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Mission planning
was a causal factor in this mishap” or “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Mission
Planning was a factor in this mishap.” Do not provide further analysis or explanation in
the conclusion. Do not write the conclusion as a recommendation.

T4.3.2. FAILURE TO OBTAIN UPDATED BIRD CONDITIONS

Analysis:

According the 6 OG IFG, aircrew are required to “obtain a current AHAS update (from
squadron TOP 3, RCO, or SOF) within 30 minutes of low level entry.” (FigureT4.1.).
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                       115




FigureT4. 1. AHAS update requirement.




The MC planned to fly VR-69 due to bird condition LOW at the planned time of flight.
They also checked the AHAS just prior to brief, at step brief, and just before takeoff.
Although they took off on time, they were not planning on entering the low level until
40-45 minutes after takeoff which would require them to obtain an AHAS update after
takeoff. The MC, TOP 3, and SOF all testified that this was not accomplished. The SIB
determined that the MC failed to do so for two reasons. First, the MC was having trouble
with its TFR system. The crew developed channelized attention [PC102 – channelized
attention] with trying to fix the problem prior to low level entry. The MP stated in
interviews “We were trying to get the TFR system fixed to complete the sortie. The last
thing I wanted was to airbort.” Additionally, there was building weather near the low
level entry point. Although the MC eventually decided to stop working the TFR problem
and turn it off, they admitted they were distracted [PC108 – distraction] from their
normal habit patterns by the building weather. These two human factors (distraction and
channelized attention) contributed to the MC’s failure to remember to obtain a revised
bird condition update.

Conclusion: The SIB determined that the failure to obtain an AHAS update IAW 6 OG
IFG procedures was a causal factor in this mishap.

T4.4. NON-FACTORS

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the
mishap and not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all encompassing list, but

rather a list of areas/items the SIB looked at and ruled out. Those areas/items
determined not to be a factor in the mishap but warrant command attention and/or may
contribute to a future mishap should be included in section T7, Non-Factors Worthy of
Discussion.

T5. MAINTENANCE AREAS INVESTIGATED

T5.1. INVESTIGATIVE SOURCES OF DATA

Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine the maintenance factors in the
mishap. For example: the mishap aircraft’s history, records, engine history, relevant
maintenance performed, maintenance training, results of technical teardowns,
maintenance supervision, etc.

The maintenance areas investigated for this mishap include technical order compliance,
maintenance documentation, inspections, supervision, tool control, and job performance.
The Safety Investigation Board (SIB) concentrated on what maintenance could have done
to prevent this mishap and what, if anything, they did to cause the mishap.

The SIB investigated maintenance documentation and repair actions for troubleshooting
the Terrain Following Radar (TFR) system. This task was made more difficult since the
active aircraft forms were inside the cockpit and destroyed when the MA crashed.
However, the SIB was able to use the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) to
research maintenance performed on the TFR system.

Although the SIB found the MA’s historical documentation of TFR system maintenance
was in both CAMS and the historical 781As, the documentation was lacking.
Specifically, the Job Standard (JST) for Kanuter Radar Relay (KRR) replacement
requires the maintainer to identify which position (left or right) was changed. The SIB
found only 44% of KRR changes in the last 6 months had the position annotated.

The SIB analyzed Fault Isolation Manuals and Job Guides to determine if they were
sufficient for troubleshooting and maintaining the TFR system and found them to be
adequate for the tasks.

T5.2. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, ORGANIZATIONS

Describe in narrative format the normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process
involved in the mishap, or the organizational structures as required. For aircraft systems
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         117


involved in the mishap, provide a detailed description of how the system should work. This
description may include photographs, diagrams, technical order quotes, etc. Describe what
should happen and what went wrong that led to the subsequent analysis in the factor section
below. Do not describe processes, systems, etc., that had no influence on the outcome of the
mishap. This section will contain enough detail so the reader can understand the SIB’s
investigative processes. If maintenance was not a factor in the mishap sequence, this section can
simply state it was not a factor in the mishap.

T5.3. FACTORS

Analyze the maintenance factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome. This section
is written in narrative format. Each maintenance factor will be analyzed in a separate
write-up. Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered
most important to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap.
Incorporate maintenance human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human
factors codes and definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. Integrate DoD
HFACS nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human factor in
the factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a detailed analysis and rationale
of how human factors contributed to the maintenance factor under discussion. For
example, if the SIB is reviewing incomplete Technical Order Guidance available to the
Crew Chief as a factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up
should include words to the effect that “The Crew Chief used the T.O. 1C-2A-5-01JG-
69-2, Task 07-7, which did not state to pull the widget safety pin after the widget was
installed [OP003 - Procedural Guidance /Publications]” then explain how the human
factor manifested itself or the result “…which allowed the widget to vibrate loose during
flight resulting in the wing panel being ingested into the mishap engine.” If there are no
maintenance factors for the mishap write “The SIB determined there were no
maintenance factors in this mishap.” Each separate maintenance factor should be
formatted in the following manner:

T5.3.1. TECHNICAL DATA COMPLIANCE

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap (see
paragraph T5.3.2.below for an example). Include enough information so the reader can
logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include, as appropriate,
references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Use
photos or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a
discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually
occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of
each factor analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal in this
mishap.” For example, “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Technical Data
Compliance was a causal factor in this mishap” or “Conclusion: The SIB determined
that Technical Data Compliance was a factor in this mishap.” Do not provide further

analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the conclusion as a
recommendation.

T5.3.2. TERRAIN FOLLOWING RADAR (TFR) MALFUNCTION

Analysis: The MC began performing TFR functionality checks approximately 10
minutes prior to low level entry. Due to what was eventually determined to be a failed
transmitter, the MC experienced a continual fly up any time the system was turned on.
The MC attempted to solve this problem for approximately eight minutes by
accomplishing numerous system and component built-in tests (BITs) and by turning the
system off and back on to try to reset it. None of these actions were successful (or would
be with a bad transmitter). As mentioned previously, the MC became channelized with
fixing the problem to the exclusion of other required actions (such as obtaining a bird
condition update prior to low level entry).

The SIB also considered whether an operable TFR system may have detected the
concentration of birds on the low level and provided a fly-up and avoided them.
Numerous aircrew surveyed responded that they had received fly-ups for bird
concentrations although it was not normal. The system was not designed to detect or
avoid birds and would take a large concentration to make the system react. Although the
bird concentration size could not be determined for this mishap, TFR technical experts at
the SPO concluded it was highly unlikely it would have detected them and provided a
fly-up. Even if it did provide a fly-up, it may not have precluded the MA hitting birds in
the vicinity.

The SIB investigated the background of the MA’s TFR system and determined the
system had been fully operational with no write-ups for 12 sorties prior to the mishap
sortie. The squadron was in a phase of training where the TFR system was used on each
of these sorties. The transmitter was considered a fly-to-fail component and simply failed
on the mishap sortie. The SIB determined all MX actions and inspections were
compliant and could not have precluded the failure.

Conclusion: The SIB determined that the malfunctioning TFR system was a factor in
this mishap.

T5.4. NON-FACTORS

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the
mishap and not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all encompassing list, but

T6.1. INVESTIGATIVE SOURCES OF DATA

Explain the sources of data used by the SIB to determine the logistical factors in the
mishap. For example: depot overhaul, depot quality assurance procedures, depot
training, acquisition processes, supervision, etc.

The SIB interviewed personnel from the F-15E SPO and ACC/A8. They also obtained
technical documents on the BIRDFINDER and BIRDFINDER II systems and consulted
with the AFSEC BASH team.

T6.2. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, ORGANIZATIONS

Describe in narrative format the normal operation of complex aircraft systems, the process
involved in the mishap, or the organizational structures as required. For logistics processes
involved in the mishap, provide a detailed description of how the process should work. This
description may include photographs, diagrams, work package quotes, etc. Describe what
should happen and what went wrong that led to the subsequent analysis in the factor section
below. Do not describe processes, systems, etc., that had no influence on the outcome of the
mishap. This section will contain enough detail so the reader can understand the SIB’s
investigative processes. If logistics was not a factor in the mishap sequence, this section can
simply state it was not a factor in the mishap.

T6.3. FACTORS

Analyze the logistical factors that influenced the mishap or its outcome. This section is
written in narrative format. Each logistics factor will be analyzed in a separate write-up.
Topics presented should flow in order from what factors the SIB considered most
important to those the SIB considered least important in contributing to the mishap.
Incorporate logistics human factors from Tab Y but do not simply paste human factors
codes and definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. Integrate DoD HFACS
nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human factor in the
logistics factors analysis section under discussion. Provide a detailed analysis and
rationale of how human factors contributed to the logistics factor under discussion. For
example, if the SIB is reviewing incomplete Work Package Guidance available to
logistics center personnel as a factor under a Procedural Guidance/Publications
heading, the write-up should include words to the effect that “The ALC worker used T.O.
2J-F510-5-4 SWP 017-17, which did not state to pull the widget safety pin after the
widget was installed on the turbine disk [OP003 – Procedural Guidance/Publications]”
then explain how the human factor manifested itself or the result “…which allowed the

and third stage HPT damage.” If there are no logistical factors for the mishap write
“The SIB determined there were no logistical factors in this mishap.” Each separate
logistical factor should be formatted in the following manner:

T6.3.1. DEPOT QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap (see
paragraph T6.3.2.below for an example). Include enough information so the reader can
logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will include, as appropriate,
references to specific technical orders, publications, training, personnel actions or
inactions, results of technical analysis, human factors, etc. Use photos or diagrams as
necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a discussion of how the
particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually occurred during the
mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of each factor analysis
will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal factor in
this mishap.” For example, “Conclusion: The SIB determined that Depot Quality
Assurance Procedures was a causal factor in this mishap” or “Conclusion: The SIB
determined that Depot Quality Assurance Procedures was a factor in this mishap.” Do
not provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the
conclusion as a recommendation.

T6.3.2. LACK OF BIRD DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM

Analysis: In 2007 a USAF F-16C hit a bird while flying a low level in Florida. This
resulted in a Class A mishap and destroyed aircraft (AFSAS #696968). The SIB from
that investigation recommended that ACC procure a commercially available bird
detection and warning system called BIRDFINDER for use on USAF aircraft that
routinely operate in low level environments. ACC funded the program for testing on the
F-16 which was accomplished the following year. Testing revealed that although the
system was very successful in detecting most birds, the range at which it detected them
was often insufficient to allow avoidance measures at speeds most tactical fighters
operate. At speeds between 480 and 540 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS), detection
times varied between 1 and 5 seconds depending on the size of bird formations. Testing
also revealed anything less than 2 seconds was insufficient for avoidance. In light of
these tests, and due to the estimated $5M installation cost per aircraft, COMACC decided
not to procure the system. Although the BIRDFINDER system was not procured, ACC
had funded testing of the BIRDFINDER II system which included improvements on
detection ranges/times. At the time of this mishap, the system was not yet ready for
testing.

Although it is unknown whether the BIRDFINDER system would have alerted the MC in
time to avoid the bird strike, its absence certainly lessened the opportunity for timely
detection. The SIB determined this was not a causal factor in the mishap due to this
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                          121


uncertainty and the fact the MC should have known they were flying in an area
determined to be BIRD SEVERE.

Conclusion: The SIB determined the decision to not procure a bird detection and
warning system was factor in this mishap.

T6.4. NON-FACTORS

List out those areas/items the SIB considered but determined not to be factors in the
mishap and not worthy of additional discussion. It is not an all encompassing list, but
rather a list of areas/items the SIB looked at and ruled out. Those areas/items
determined not to be a factor in the mishap but warrant command attention and/or may
contribute to a future mishap should be included in section T7, Non-Factors Worthy of
Discussion.

T7. NON-FACTORS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION

NFWODs did not contribute to the mishap, but could contribute to future mishaps and/or
warrant command attention. NFWODs frequently provide the background information for
OFSs. For Class A and B mishaps, NFWODs should also include factors significantly
deliberated and rejected, with rationale. Incorporate human factors but do not simply paste
human factors codes and definitions directly from the Tab Y into the Tab T. Integrate DoD
HFACS nano codes (don’t give definitions) and talk about the applicable human factor in the
NFWODs section. Provide a detailed analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed
to the NFWOD under discussion. For example, if the SIB is reviewing incomplete Work Package
Guidance available to logistics center personnel as a NFWOD under a Procedural
Guidance/Publications heading, the write-up should include words to the effect that “The ALC
worker used T.O. 2J-F510-5-4 SWP 017-17, which did not state to pull the widget safety pin
after the widget was installed on the turbine disk [OP003 – Procedural
Guidance/Publications]” then explain how the human factor manifested itself or the result
“…which allowed the widget to vibrate loose during flight resulting in failure of the turbine
blade and second and third stage HPT damage.” NFWODs may become OFS and ORS for
section T10. If an issue contributed to the mishap, even minimally, it is a factor and should not
be placed in this section. Use the same format (analysis and conclusion) discussed for factors
above in paragraph T4.2.1. Also, group NFWODs together by operations, maintenance, and
logistics.

T7.1. AN-PRC-112 SURVIVAL RADIO ANTENNA CRACKING/FAILURE

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the issue found during the investigation that led
to the NFWOD (see paragraphs T7.2. and T7.3. below for examples). Include enough
information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions. It will

include, as appropriate, references to specific technical orders, publications, training,
personnel actions or inactions, results of technical analysis, human factors, etc. Use
photos or diagrams as necessary. Often it is helpful to organize this section into a
discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished, how it actually
occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last portion of
each NFWOD analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State the issue was a non-factor worthy of discussion in this mishap, and if
it could lead to future mishaps state “but could be a factor in a future mishap.” For
example, “Conclusion: AN-PRC-112 Survival Radio Antenna Cracking/Failure was a
non-factor worthy of discussion in this mishap, but could be a factor in a future mishap.”
Do not provide further analysis or explanation in the conclusion. Do not write the
conclusion as a recommendation.

T7.2. TFR KANUTER RADAR RELAY (KRR) DOCUMENTATION

Analysis: It was recommended in the F-15 18 Sep 02 mishap that the remove/replace
Joint Systems Test (JST) should include the specific position be annotated when a KRR
is changed. Although the JST provides a space for such documentation, the SIB
discovered that KRR changes were not adequately documented in CAMS or aircraft
781As. The KRR maintainers failed to check to ensure that the documentation was
correct due to inattention [PC101 – Inattention]. Many corrective actions simply stated a
KRR change occurred without identifying the specific relay. Six months of history was
reviewed for KRR changes. The SIB determined 44% of KRR change documentation did
not include specific position number in the provided space in the KRR change JST.

Conclusion: The SIB determined that KRR maintenance documentation was a non-
factor worthy of discussion in this mishap.

T7.3. TERRAIN FOLLOWING RADAR (TFR) SYSTEM RELIABILITY

Analysis: During the mishap sequence the MC spent approximately 8 minutes trying to
identify why they experienced a continual fly up indication any time the TFR system was
turned on. They spent this time because the MA had a history of TFR discrepancies and
the MC wanted to ensure the system worked correctly prior to entering the low level
route. The SIB researched the MA’s history of TFR discrepancies and found it had
several write-ups since it returned to flying status after the last phase inspection. Even
though there were some repeat write-ups the SIB determined the MA’s TFR system had
been troubleshot and repaired in compliance with technical orders.

The SIB then contacted the TFR System Program Office (SPO) to obtain a fleet-wide
history. In the early 2000s, the F-15 TFR system experienced an inordinate amount of
discrepancies. This continued until 2006 when Operational Flight Profile (OFP) 4 was
released to the field. Since 2006 the F-15 TFR system has had the same reliability as the
F-16 (only 1% of write-ups are TFR related).
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        123


Conclusion: The SIB determined the reliability of the TFR system was a non-factor
worthy of discussion in this mishap, but could be a factor in a future mishap.

T8. FINDINGS AND CAUSES

This section is a chronological list of all the SIB’s primary findings and causes. Ensure
all findings and causes are supported by the investigation and analysis section.
Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. Number the findings consecutively using the following
convention: “Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.” Each finding should be a single, active voice
sentence concisely describing the event that sustains the mishap sequence. Writing in the
active voice means constructing sentences where the subject “acts.” For example:
Passive – No safety pins were installed in the widget. Active – The crew chief failed to
install safety pins in the widget as required by tech orders. Passive – Mission planning
did not cover en-route obstacles. Active – The crew failed to address en-route obstacles
in mission planning as required. Causal findings are further identified with the word
“Causal” in parenthesis immediately after the number. Human factors related causes
should include those specific human factors attributed as causal in a “due to” statement.
For example: The mishap pilot failed to lower the landing gear due to distraction. When
putting findings into AFSAS, copy only the narrative, not the “Finding 1 (Causal).”
AFSAS automatically populates the finding number and whether it’s causal into the final
message. Remember to define an acronym the first time it is used in the Findings (e.g.,
The mishap crew (MC)).

FINDING 1 COMACC accepted the risk of not procuring a bird detection and warning
           system on the F-15E.

FINDING 2 During mission planning for a two-ship surface attack continuation
           training sortie, the Mishap Crew (MC) selected a visual route due to
           forecast BIRD LOW conditions.

FINDING 3 The MC took off single ship due to flight lead’s ground abort.

FINDING 4 The bird condition for points B through D changed from BIRD LOW to
           BIRD SEVERE shortly after takeoff.

FINDING 5 (Causal) The MC failed to obtain current bird conditions for the low level
           route IAW In-Flight Guide procedures due to distraction with building
           weather at the low level start point and channelized attention on a
           malfunctioning Terrain Following Radar system.

FINDING 6 The MC entered the low level at 500 ft AGL and unaware of the bird
           condition.

FINDING 7 At point C, the Mishap Aircraft (MA) struck an unknown number of blue
           footed boobies causing significant damage to both engines.

FINDING 8 The MC began to climb as both engine fire lights illuminated.

FINDING 9 The MC successfully ejected as both engines began winding down and the
           MA shook violently.

FINDING 10 The MA impacted the ground and was destroyed.

T9. RECOMMENDATIONS

This is a list of the SIB’s primary recommendations. Each recommendation must
correspond to a finding. However, each finding is not required to have a
recommendation. For example, a finding may be the sortie was uneventful from takeoff
until recovery for pattern work. This finding would not warrant a recommendation.
Number the recommendations consecutively using the following convention:
“Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.” Each recommendation should be a single,
active voice sentence concisely describing the action to be taken. It will not include
analysis. Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. Prior to finalizing any recommendation for
any class of mishap, investigators must contact the proposed OPR and OCR to ensure the
correct action agency is identified. If assistance is required to identify OPRs and OCRs,
contact the CA safety office. AFSAS requires the office symbol, name, rank, and phone
number or e-mail address of an action officer for each OPR and OCR. If an AF Form
847 or AFTO 22 was completed, place its tracking number next to the corresponding
recommendation. AFSAS has fields to input AF Form 847 or AFTO 22 tracking numbers,
so do not include them when copying the recommendation narrative. When
recommending changes to publications, be specific on the area to be updated. For
example, “Add a ‘Caution’ to T.O. 1T-5A-39-2-6, Task 8-1 after Step 9. Caution should
read: ‘It is possible for the widget pin lever to be in the full locked position and the
widget pins not properly engaged. Damage will result when closing the gear doors if the
widget pins are not engaged.’” Do not simply state “Add a Caution to the tech order for
widget pin installation.” Additionally, the SIB must assess the RHI and input this
information into AFSAS. OPRs can assist in computing severity and probability and
AFSAS also has a tutorial on how to determine RHIs.

Recommendation 1: Require aircrew to communicate any route aborts for birds, or any
bird concentrations that would require a change to bird conditions to both squadron
operations and the Supervisor of Flying (SOF).

       OPR: 6 OG/CC

This recommendation would not require an OCR as the OPR would be solely responsible
for making the required changes. This recommendation would obviously require a
corresponding finding as well.

If the SIB found out there was a technically/economically feasible solution to warn
aircrew of large bird concentrations, an example recommendation would be:
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                        125


Recommendation 2: Develop and install a bird detection and warning system on the F-
15E.

       OPR: ACC/A8                                                OCR: 830 ASG

Once again, the OPR is who would fund this; the OCR would do the work on it. Realize
you may have more than one OCR doing this work, so include as appropriate.

T10. OTHER FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. Ensure the rationale for all OFS and ORS is fully
discussed in the narrative section (Non Factors Worthy of Discussion) of the report and
final message. Unlike primary findings and recommendations where not all findings
have an associated recommendation, each OFS must have at least one ORS. This is
because some primary findings only support the mishap sequence. However, since each
OFS has the potential to contribute to another mishap it needs an associated corrective
action in the form of an ORS. Prior to finalizing any ORS for any class of mishap,
investigators will contact the proposed OPR and OCR to ensure the correct action
agency is identified. If assistance is required to identify OPRs and OCRs, contact the CA
safety office. AFSAS requires the office symbol, name, rank, and phone number or e-mail
address of an action officer for each OPR and OCR. If an AF Form 847 or AFTO 22 was
completed, place its tracking number next to the corresponding recommendation. AFSAS
has fields to input AF Form 847 or AFTO 22 tracking numbers, so do not include them
when copying the recommendation narrative. When recommending changes to
publications, be specific on the area to be updated. For example, “Add a ‘Caution’ to
T.O. 1T-5A-39-2-6, Task 8-1 after Step 9. Caution should read: ‘It is possible for the
widget pin lever to be in the full locked position and the widget pins not properly
engaged. Damage will result when closing the gear doors if the widget pins are not
engaged.’" Do not simply state “Add a Caution to the tech order for widget pin
installation.” Additionally, the SIB must assess the RHI and input this information into
AFSAS. OPRs can assist in computing severity and probability and AFSAS also has a
tutorial on how to determine RHIs.

Example:

OFS 1: The AN/PRC-112 Survival Radio antenna is prone to fatigue cracking at the
base attachment.

ORS 1: Procure a crack-resistant antenna for the AN/PRC-112 Survival Radio.

       OPR: ACC/A4

T11. AUTHENTICATION PAGE

Type each primary SIB member’s name, grade, and position on the last page of this tab.
Have each concurring member, including primary members from other services on joint
investigations, sign above it for authentication of the report or for any changes to the
report. If the formal SIB report needs to be changed after it is completed and signed by
the board, all primary members of the SIB will be reconvened. If a SIB primary member
completed a minority report, insert the text, “SEE MINORITY REPORT” (see below)
instead of a signature.

T12. MINORITY REPORTS

(If Applicable)

The primary members determine findings, causes, and recommendations. Primary
members that disagree with the results may submit individual minority reports. Minority
reports must include reasons for disagreeing, and will include suggested findings, causes,
and recommendations if different from those contained in the report. The minority report
should be signed and placed in Tab T and should be included as part of the final mishap
message. Members submitting a minority report will not sign the authentication page
and the text “SEE MINORITY REPORT” will be inserted in lieu of a signature.

                        CLASS C/D/E SAMPLE REPORT FORMAT

When writing message narratives for Class C or D mishaps, or Class E events, use the
following format; Factual History of the Mishap, Investigation and Analysis, and
Conclusions.

4.1. Factual History of the Mishap.

The factual history of the mishap is a narrative, in chronological order, of all pertinent
events from briefing, ground operations, takeoff, etc., through the mishap sequence. For
maintenance mishaps that do not involve flight, start the mishap sequence from when the
maintainers were assigned the task that resulted in the mishap and continue until the
damage is identified. The history explains what occurred, but not why. Analysis of why
the mishap occurred is in section 4.2.

4.2. Conclusions.

This is a short paragraph summarizing mishap cause and provides a bottom line up front
for the reader.

4.3. Investigation and Analysis.

Investigation and Analysis. This section contains a summary of what the SIB/SIO
investigated, areas determined to be factors, and why the mishap occurred. It should be
broken down into the following sections: 4.2.1 Operations Factors, 4.2.2 Maintenance
Factors, 4.2.3 Logistics Factors, 4.2.4 NFWODs. It describes why supervision, pilots,
maintainers, logistic centers processes, etc., were factors in the mishap. This section
must be written so the reader clearly understands how the findings and causes were
determined and clearly states the role of the factors found causal. It also includes
descriptions of what equipment may have broken, T.O.s that were inadequate, guidance
that was not followed, etc., and why. Report aeromedical, AFE, egress, and other human
factors related to a mishap as life sciences safety information. Life sciences safety
information is required for all classes of mishaps and events for all involved personnel.
Most USAF medical facilities have personnel with additional life sciences expertise (AOP
officers, psychologists, etc.) who are valuable resources for ensuring accurate
interpretation of life sciences safety information. These individuals should be consulted
to support aviation safety investigations. Report life sciences information by populating
the appropriate life sciences data fields in AFSAS. See paragraph 6.3. for more
information.

4.3.1. Operations Factors.

For each factor use the outline below and title it appropriately based on the subject
(replace the words “Factor #1,” etc.). If there were no operations factors state so.
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                         129



Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include
enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIO’s rationale for
conclusions. It will include, as appropriate, references to specific technical orders,
publications, training, personnel actions or inactions, results of technical analysis,
quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Often it is helpful to organize this section
into a discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished, how it
actually occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last
portion of each factor analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State whether the issue was a factor and if causal state “causal in this
mishap.” For example, “Conclusion: Mission planning was a causal factor in this
mishap” or “Conclusion: Mission Planning was a factor in this mishap.” Do not write
the conclusion as a recommendation.

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include
enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIO’s rationale for
conclusions. It will include, as appropriate, references to specific technical orders,
publications, training, personnel actions or inactions, results of technical analysis,
quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Often it is helpful to organize this section
into a discussion of how the particular action should have been accomplished, how it
actually occurred during the mishap, and how this contributed to the mishap. The last
portion of each factor analysis will be a brief summary that ties the discussion together.

For each factor use the outline below and title it appropriately based on the subject
(replace the words “Factor #1,” etc.). If there were no logistics factors state so.

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the factor’s influence on the mishap. Include
enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIO’s rationale for
conclusions. It will include, as appropriate, references to specific technical orders,
publications, training, personnel actions or inactions, results of technical analysis,
quotes from interviews, human factors, etc. Often it is helpful to organize this section

the conclusion as a recommendation.

OR

There were no logistics factors in this mishap.

4.3.4. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion
AFMAN91-223_PACAFSUP_I 13 MARCH 2014                                                       131


NFWODs did not contribute to the mishap, but could contribute to future mishaps and/or
warrant command attention. NFWODs frequently provide the background information
for OFSs. For each non-factor worthy of discussion use the outline below and title it
appropriately based on the subject (replace the words “NFWOD #1,” etc.).

Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the issue and why it did not influence the
mishap. Include enough information so the reader can logically follow the SIO’s
rationale for conclusions. The last portion of each non-factor analysis will be a brief
summary that ties the discussion together.

Conclusion: State the issue was a non-factor worthy of discussion in this mishap, and if
it could lead to future mishaps, state “but could be a factor in a future mishap.” For
example, “Conclusion: Mission planning was a non-factor worthy of discussion in this
mishap, but could be a factor in a future mishap.”
