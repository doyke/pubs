1. Purpose and Objective. An effective dormitory competition provides an incentive for
Airmen Dorm Leaders (ADL) and dormitory residents to improve and maintain their
dormitories. It also provides an opportunity to identify areas for improvements, such as facility
maintenance, health hazards, self-help projects, and quality of life programs. The Quarterly
Dormitory Competition Program gives senior leadership the opportunity to become involved in
the dormitory program and show their support for improving the quality of life for 8th Fighter
Wing junior enlisted members. It will also provide an incentive award to units that demonstrate
a superior dormitory program. Announced inspections will take place quarterly at the discretion
of the 8 FW/CCC.

Housing Management (8 CES/CEAC) are responsible for administering the Quarterly Dormitory
