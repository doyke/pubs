  2.4.1. An officer who submits an unqualified resignation following a period of honorable
  service and who has a remaining Military Service Obligation (MSO) or unfulfilled
  contractual agreement, is discharged if he or she accepts a Reserve appointment in the grade
  held in the RegAF at the time of discharge. HQ ARPC/DAO initially transfers an officer with
  a remaining MSO to the Ready Reserve and assigns the officer to the ORS, ARPC, unless
  they applied for a Ready Reserve participating assignment.
     2.4.1.1. To control contingent resignations, discharge from the RegAF and acceptance of
     the Reserve commission must take place on the same date. The special order announcing
     discharge is also the ResAF appointment instrument. The effective date specified in the
     special order is the last day of duty as a RegAF member. The individual becomes a
     ResAF officer the following day.
  2.4.2. An officer, who has no MSO or unfulfilled contractual agreement and who is
  honorably discharged by reason of unqualified resignation, may request appointment as a
  ResAF officer at the time of resignation.
     2.4.2.1. The unit commander must submit a memorandum of recommendation or non-
     recommendation, which will accompany the request. For non-recommendation, the
     commander specifies the reasons and gives the officer a copy. The commander also
     promptly notifies HQ ARPC/DAO and the servicing military personnel flight (MPF), if,
     after submitting a recommendation for Reserve appointment, the recommendation
     changes. Approval for ResAF appointment may be withdrawn if it is determined that the
     appointment would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
     2.4.2.2. Since accepting a Reserve commission constitutes voluntary assignment to the
     Ready Reserve (IRR or Selected), HQ ARPC/DAO transfers officers appointed under
     paragraph 2.4.2 to the Ready Reserve and assigns them to the Nonobligated
     Nonparticipating Ready Personnel Section (NNRPS), unless they applied for a Ready
     Reserve participating assignment.
     2.4.2.3. The officer accepts the ResAF appointment, by memorandum, and completes the
     oath of office as a Reserve officer on the day after discharge to ensure continuous
     commissioned status. The oath of office must be executed and returned to HQ
     ARPC/DAO within 15 calendar days of discharge or the Reserve appointment is
     canceled. To decline a Reserve appointment, applicants must so state in writing to HQ
     ARPC/DAO within 15 calendar days of discharge, with the reasons for declination.
  2.4.3. An officer who resigns to enter seminary training is not eligible for appointment as a
  ResAF officer. Under law, an individual preparing for the ministry in a recognized
  theological or divinity school may not be required to serve on AD or participate in active
  duty training or service, active duty for training (ADT), or inactive duty training (IDT).
  However, the officer may apply for appointment as a chaplain or chaplain candidate after
  meeting the requirements specified in Chapter 5.
  2.4.4. An officer who does not request a ResAF appointment upon resignation, or who
  originally declined a Reserve appointment, may ask HQ ARPC/DAO for Reserve
  appointment consideration up to 12 months after discharge.
  2.4.5. In addition to other requirements, a former chaplain submits a current DD Form 2088,
  Certificate of Ecclesiastical Endorsement, for appointment as a ResAF.
AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003                                                                            13


2.5. Former Officers of Any of the Uniformed Services. Except for those ineligible under
Table 2.2 appointing authorities may appoint former officers of any of the services for duty in
any specialty for which they qualify and for which there is a procurement quota. They may not
appoint former officers based solely on prior service, except as provided in this instruction.
2.6. Reserve Officers of Other Uniformed Services. Appointing authorities may not tender
ResAF appointment to a Reserve officer of another uniformed service not on EAD whose service
dates, Total Years Service Date (TYSD) and Date of Rank (DOR) place the officer beyond the
mandatory phase point for promotion to the next Reserve grade. They may tender ResAF
appointment to a Reserve officer of another uniformed service, if, in addition to the application
and allied papers, they meet the following requirements:
   2.6.1. Age does not exceed the maximum for the grade (Table 2.1). If applying for flying
   training, the officer must commission in time to enter the program before age 27 1/2 years.
   2.6.2. A Ready Reserve position vacancy exists for which the officer qualifies.
   2.6.3. No ResAF officer with the required qualifications and residing within a reasonable
   distance of the assignment is available for, volunteers for, and will accept the assignment.
   2.6.4. The officer submits AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, in
   triplicate.
   2.6.5. The officer does not have an AD obligation under the Military Selective Service Act
   of 1967.
   2.6.6. The officer obtains a conditional release from the uniformed service or component in
   which he holds an appointment.
   2.6.7. If the officer holds an aeronautical rating, HQ USAF/XOOT (Training and Warrior
   Management Division) must approve the aeronautical rating before processing the
   application to completion. If the officer is in inactive aviation service status, refer to AFI 11-

October 1996. Appointing authorities must use this provision of law as implemented in this
instruction to appoint persons in the Reserves on or after 1 October 1996.
   2.18.1. Service credit includes:

         approval by the President and Senate.
    2.18.3. A period of time, or qualification, counts only once when computing service credit.
    Count constructive service credit listed in Table 2.4, Table 2.5, and Table 2.6 for education
    or professional training. When education or training overlaps other creditable service, count
    the constructive service first, then reduce the other creditable service for any overlapping

    2.18.4. Proportionately credit to the nearest day qualifying periods of less than 1 year except
    where otherwise noted in Table 2.4, Table 2.5, and Table 2.6.
    2.18.5. Service credit does not apply to persons being initially commissioned through OTS
    or AFROTC.
    2.18.6. Without specific congressional direction, appointing authorities cannot apply
    constructive service credit or service credit entitlements (grandfathering) retroactively and a
    member cannot terminate his or her appointment and request reappointment in order to take
    advantage of changes to constructive service credit or service credit rules.

NOTE:
    1. Age restrictions in Table 2.1 apply (see paragraph 2.7.4 for exceptions).
    2. The total amount of appointment grade credit and DOR credit awarded cannot exceed 14
    years except as authorized in paragraph 2.18.2. Also, the awarded DOR may not result in the
    officer being eligible for promotion consideration within the next 12 months. EXAMPLE:
    For officers appointed as first lieutenant, the maximum DOR credit is 3 years; as captain, 6
    years; as major, 6 years.
    3. On reappointment an officer may qualify for the same grade, a higher grade, or a lower
    grade. Compute the TYSD and DOR in these cases based on service credit provisions in
    effect for the Air Force at the time of reappointment. Refer to paragraph 3.8 of this
    instruction for further guidance.
    4. If the officer had prior Reserve commissioned service in the same grade not reflected in
    the DOR, the DOR is adjusted to include prior promotion service in the same grade,
    excluding inactive service.

    5. If the former officer was a physician in another uniformed service, the Principal Deputy
    Assistant SAF (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Environment) (SAF/MI), may
    approve a request for appointing the officer under rule 4 versus rule 5 as an exception to
    policy, if justified. Fully justified requests for exception to policy may be forwarded to HQ
    AFPC/DPAM (for EAD appointments), ANG/MPP (for ANGUS appointments), or HQ
    USAF/REP, Personnel Division, (USAFR Ready Reserve appointments), for disapproval or
    recommended approval. If HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, or HQ USAF/REP recommends
    approval, they forward the request to HQ USAF/DPXF (Force Policy Division) for
    processing to SAF/MI for a final decision.
    6. This rule applies whether or not there is a break in service.

    1. In computing service credit, count a period of time or qualification only once.
    Proportionately credit, to the nearest day, qualifying periods of less than 1 year. Limit total
    service credit awarded to 14 years unless granted a waiver according to paragraph 2.18.2 Do
    not award United States Military Academy (USMA), United States Naval Academy (USNA),
    or Unites States Air Force Academy (USAFA) graduates any credit for education, training,
    service, or experience they gained before graduating from the academy. Attainment of
    permanent certification by the Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG)
    or completion of a Fifth Pathway program is not creditable as an internship.
    2. HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, or HQ ARPC/DAO, as appropriate, approves, on an
    individual basis, any credit awarded under this rule. The advanced education must contribute
    directly to the performance of duty. The advanced degree must not have been earned
    concurrently with the primary credentials (MD, DO, DDS, DMD). Credit may not include
    time spent in attainment of baccalaureate or lower degrees. No additional credit may be given
    for more than one advanced degree in a single, or closely related field. The total credit for
    having both a master’s and a doctorate degree may not exceed the maximum allowed for a

     4. Use the permanent and unrestricted licensure in a state, the DC, the Commonwealth of
     Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, or Canada, to establish the date from which to
     award credit for experience to foreign-trained physicians.
     5. Compute from the day after the officer completed the internship or the education listed in
     rules 3, 4, or 5, as appropriate, until the day before appointment. Do not award credit for
     periods of unemployment of more than 30 days.
     6. HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP or HQ ARPC/DAO, as appropriate, may award credit
     under rule 7 only for a specialty designated critical or urgent. Do not award credit under rule
     7 unless the maximum credit under rule 6 has been awarded.

NOTE:

    1. In computing service, count a period of time or qualification only once. Proportionately
    credit, to the nearest day, qualifying periods of less than 1 year. Limit total service credit
    awarded to 14 years unless granted a waiver according to paragraph 2.18.2 Do not award
    graduates of the USMA, USNA, or USAFA any credit for education, training, service, or
    experience they gained before graduating from the academy.
    2. No additional credit is authorized for a master's level degree in the same or related field.
    3. Must also be nationally certified by the applicable specialty board.
    4. Depending on the official length of the program, award an applicant 12 to 24 months
    credit for a master’s degree. EXAMPLE: 1 year for each school year not to exceed 24
    months. HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, or HQ ARPC/DAO, as appropriate, determines the
    amount of credit awarded.
    5. Do not grant credit under rule 13 if credit has been granted under rule 11 or 12, or if
    certification is required for award of the baccalaureate degree.
    6. If the applicant's Ph.D program required the applicant to complete a 1-year clinical
    psychology internship for award of the doctorate, do not award credit for completing the
    internship. The maximum credit this applicant may receive is 48 months.
    7. Award 48 months service credit to an individual accepted for the USAF Clinical
    Psychology Internship Program who has not received a Ph.D. in psychology.
    8. Do not award any credit to individuals who complete clinical internship affiliation or
    residency training as part of their baccalaureate program.
    9. Do not award any credit for completing the residency to an applicant whose master's of
    pharmacy or PharmD degree program required the 1-year residency for award of the degree.
    The maximum credit this applicant may receive is 24 months.
    10. HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, or HQ ARPC/DAO, as appropriate, approves any credit
    awarded under this rule on an individual basis. Credit may not include time spent in
    attainment of baccalaureate or lower degrees. No additional credit may be given for more
    than one advanced degree in a single, or closely related field. The total credit for having both
    a master’s and doctorate degree may not exceed the maximum allowed for a doctorate.
    11. Credit under this rule applies to individuals appointed as BSC, MSC, or NC officers on
    or after 4 December 1987. Do not award credit for experience of 1/2 year or less or for
AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003                                                                           33


    periods of unemployment of more than 30 days. For those individuals that require a license,
    award experience credit from time of licensure.
    12. Credit under this rule applies to individuals appointed as BSC, MSC, or NC officers on
    or after 4 December 1987. Award credit under this rule only when HQ USAF/SG determines
    that a specialty is critical or urgent. HQ USAF/SG, ANGRC/SG, or HQ USAF/REM, as
    appropriate, determines (on a fiscal year basis) which skills may get credit under this rule and
    sets the limits on the amount of credit awarded. According to DoDD 1312.2, by 1 July of
    each year, the Services provide to ASD(HA) their plan for granting additional credit for
    special experience to certain critically short specialties. HQ AFPC/DPAM, ANG/MPP, and
    HQ ARPC/DAO award credit for special experience accordingly. Do not award credit under
    this rule unless the maximum credit under rule 40 has been awarded. Do not award credit for
    periods of unemployment of more than 30 days. For those individuals who require a license,
    award experience credit from time of licensure.
    13. For competitive category transfers to the BSC, MSC, or NC, award 1 year for each year
    of prior service if constructive service credit under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12207 is not
    going to be awarded (see paragraph 3.8.4).
    14. An individual achieves full time professional experience by being employed 40 hours
    per week in one or more places of employment. EXCEPTION: Individuals employed for 32-
    39 hours per week and considered full time employees must submit a letter from their
    employer verifying they are full time employees.

3.2. Processing Applications and Appointment of Medical Service Officers forAssignment
to the Air Reserve Components. Appointment of medical service applicants (major and
below) who are United States citizens, graduates of accredited United States schools, and desire
affiliation with the Air Reserve components, will be within 30 days after receiving their
complete application.
3.3. Processing Applications to Officer Training Program Examining Centers (OTPEC).
   3.3.1. Continental US (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii. Commanders who receive
   applications under this instruction (except as specified in Table 3.2, rules 2, 4 through 12 and
   18) forward the applications to the OTPEC primary project officer most convenient to the
   applicant. Before forwarding an application to an OTPEC for processing, the commander
   screens it to make sure it is complete and the applicant qualifies. Commanders forward
   applications to OTPECs within 15 workdays after receipt, except when they require
   additional information to complete an application.
   3.3.2. Overseas. The MAJCOM having jurisdiction over applicants in the overseas area
   (except as specified in Table 3.2, rules 2, 4 through 12 and 18) forwards applications to the
   most appropriate OTPEC. MAJCOMs may prescribe administrative channels for receiving
   applications. However, it is the MAJCOM's responsibility to screen all applications for
   completeness and verify applicant qualifications before forwarding applications to OTPECs
   for processing. MAJCOMs screen and forward applications within 15 workdays after receipt,
   except when they need additional information to complete an application.
   3.3.3. Examining Boards. Examining boards recom-mend individuals who have not held an
   appointment and have requested appointment above the grade of major under Title 10,
   U.S.C., Section 12204. The MAJCOM commander having appointment responsibilities for
   requested specialties or, if overseas, the MAJCOM having jurisdiction over the geographical
   area concerned appoints examining boards. If required, HQ AFPC/DPPAO may convene
   examining boards.
   3.3.4. Composition.
       3.3.4.1. The appointing authority convenes examining boards composed of an uneven
       number of officers totaling not less than three. Ensure the majority are Reserve officers
       and all are in a grade equal to or higher than the grades which applicants have requested.
       Ensure one of the board members is female if considering a female applicant. Reserve
       officers appointed to these boards may or may not be on EAD. However, do not appoint
       non-AD officers without their consent. Do not place Reserve officers on AD for this
       purpose.
       3.3.4.2. The MAJCOM forwards the recommendations of these boards to the appropriate
       OTPEC. The OTPEC incorporates the recommendations with the individual's application
       and other allied papers.
   3.3.5. Applications for Appointment and Concurrent Ready Reserve Assignments Under
   Current Procurement Objectives. Do not send these applications to the OTPECs for
   processing. The units having the vacancies a member wishes to fill process them.
3.4. Duties of the Examining Centers. Refer to AFI 36-2001, Officer Training Program
Examining Centers (OTPEC).
AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003                                                                          43


   3.4.1. Unless exempt, each applicant has to take all composites of the AFOQT. See Table
   3.1 for minimum scores.
       3.4.1.1. The following categories are exempt:
          3.4.1.1.1. Former officers.
          3.4.1.1.2. Officers of any of the services, except those applying for entry into pilot or
          navigator training.
          3.4.1.1.3. Individuals applying under Chapter 5 and Chapter 6; Chapter 7,
          paragraph 7.3; and Chapter 8.
   3.4.2. Testing requirements for AFROTC students and individuals applying for entry into
   OTS are in AFI 36-2013.
3.5. Selecting Applicants.
   3.5.1. The selection authorities specified in paragraphs 1.5 through 1.8 and 1.12 through
   1.14 review applications and make selections. Selection boards include at least one Reserve
   officer. They select applicants through the use of a quality-oriented system including, but not
   limited to, factors such as education, experience, test scores, potential, motivation, and, if
   applicable, prior military performance.
   3.5.2. Selection authorities generate accessions data as prescribed in the PDS Documentation
   Handbook 171-130, part one, section 7.
3.6. Personnel Security Investigations (PSI). Prior enlisted personnel selected for
appointment may receive a commission based on a favorable ENTNAC if they have not had a
break in service greater than 24 months. For all others a NAC is required.
   3.6.1. Appointing authorities must review investigations initiated according to AFI 31-501
   before appointment. They may appoint applicants before receiving a completed NAC if:
       3.6.1.1. They receive a NAC request with the application and submit the request to the
       Defense Investigative Service (DIS).
       3.6.1.2. The applicant signs a statement of understanding (Attachment 7, paragraph
       A7.4) agreeing to discharge processing if the results of the NAC are unfavorable.
   3.6.2. If a selectee was the subject of a previous PSI and there has been no break in service
   greater that 24 months, a new PSI is not required or authorized.
   3.6.3. Send applications through the personnel office (AFROTC members), unit security
   manager (active duty airmen), or Reserve servicing MPF (non-EAD airmen). That office
   provides written confirmation of a favorably completed PSI (include the type of investigation
   and date completed). Obtain data from the AF Form 2584, Record of Personnel Security
   Investigation and Clearance, (for AFROTC members), or the PDS (for other members).
   3.6.4. Only HQ 497IG/INS has the authority to record clearance eligibility in the PDS. They
   forward copies of investigations containing questionable information to the appointing
   authority for a suitability determination. After review of the investigation, the appointing
   authority advises HQ 497IG/INS of the applicant's acceptance or rejection for
   commissioning.
 44                                                                  AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003


3.7. Appointing Selectees and Notifying Nonselectees.
   3.7.1. Appointing authorities appoint selectees by memorandum or administrative order.
   They issue appointments as of the current date and make them effective as of the date of
   acceptance.
       3.7.1.1. Refer to Attachment 8, Attachment 9, and Attachment 10 for appoint-ment
       memorandum formats. Do not use an authority line on appointment memorandum.
       3.7.1.2. Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Force Military Training
       Center (AFMTC) appoints USAF graduates of OTS by administrative orders instead of
       appointment memorandums. They appoint USAFR graduates of OTS by memorandum
       according to Attachment 8.
       3.7.1.3. After appointment, the appointing authority forwards a copy of the appointment
       memorandum or order, oath of office, and application with attachments to:
          3.7.1.3.1. HQ AFPC/DPPAOR for all direct appointments as ResAF officers with
          concurrent entry on EAD.
          3.7.1.3.2. HQ ARPC/DSFR (Residual Field Records Branch) for all direct
          appointments as ResAF officers with concurrent Ready Reserve assignments.
   3.7.2. The selection or appointing authority ensures persons who are nonselected, ineligible,
   or found not qualified for appointment, are so advised. They then dispose of application
   documents according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
   3.7.3. When an applicant fails to accept an appointment, the appointing authority cancels the
   appointment by reason of nonacceptance and notifies the appointee. The appointing authority
   enters the declination and date on all retained copies of the appointment memorandum and
   disposes of application documents according to AFMAN 37-139.
   3.7.4. Appointing authorities establish procedures to notify the losing service of the
   acceptance of their members for appointment as ResAF officers. Notification must contain
   complete information.
3.8. Designation To Perform Professional Functions as a Chaplain, Judge Advocate, or
Medical Service Officer. A reappointment action is usually required when a ResAF officer is
designated to perform professional functions. To apply, an officer submits a memorandum
application and attaches documents not already included in the Master Personnel Record Group
(MPerRGp). EXAMPLE: Diploma from medical school, transcript of college work, copy of
license to practice, and any other documents or information the officer desires to submit.
   3.8.1. Accept a certificate of physical fitness instead of a medical examination, if the officer
   has complied with the requirements for a periodic physical examination. However, an officer
   who has not submitted a report of medical examination within 3 years before the date of
   application must submit a current examination.
   3.8.2. The appointing authority reappoints officers of the MSC who are medical or dental
   students as first lieutenants when the students meet the requirements outlined in Chapter 6.
   (See Table 2.1, note 6, for authority to reappoint medical students as captains.)
   3.8.3. The appointing authority may withdraw designation to perform professional functions
   and assign an officer to the LAF if:
AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003                                                                           45


       3.8.3.1. The initial appointment professional functions performed in another category are
       not being used to acquire line officer status.
       3.8.3.2. HQ USAF/SG, HQ USAF/JAX, or HQ USAF/HC, as appropriate, does not
       object to such reappointment or transfer.
       3.8.3.3. A requirement exists in a line specialty for which the officer qualifies and can be
       effectively utilized.
       3.8.3.4. The officer agrees to accept reappointment despite an adjustment of grade or
       DOR. When there is no change in service credit involved, the appointing authority
       assigns the officer to the LAF in the officer's current grade and does not change the
       officer's service dates.
   3.8.4. When the action does not involve the award of service credit and a change in grade or
   DOR does not occur, the appropriate appointing authority designates the officer to perform
   professional functions or withdraws such designation by administrative order.
   3.8.5. When the action involves the award of service credit and a change in grade or DOR
   occurs, reappointment is required. Before reappointment, the appointing authority advises the
   officer, in writing, of potential ramifications of a change in grade, DOR, or the loss of service
   credit. The applicant should sign and date the written advisory.
   3.8.6. When a line officer on flying status with a current effective aeronautical rating accepts
   reappointment in the medical service, or as a chaplain, or judge advocate, the appropriate
   office (AFI 11-402) publishes an order disqualifying the officer from flying status.
3.9. Validity of Oaths of Office and Acceptances.
   3.9.1. Each individual must take and subscribe to an oath of office according to AFI 36-
   2006, Oath of Office (Military Personnel) and Certificateof Commission before entering the
   duties of the office. The appointing authority cancels the appointment if the individual will
   not execute the oath of office without modifications or reservations. In situations described in
   3.9.2 and 3.9.3, when an officer establishes acceptance by another means, the officer must
   submit a properly executed oath of office as a prerequisite for entitlement to full pay and
   allowances.
   3.9.2. Executing and returning the oath of office constitutes a formal acceptance of
   appointment. (Acceptance is "expressed," as by formal acceptance in writing, or "implied,"
   as by performance of the duties of the office pursuant to an order of competent authority or
   an obligated Regular officer who accepts a discharge from active duty, contingent upon
   acceptance of a Reserve appointment.)
       3.9.2.1. If an appointee enters on AD or into active status before executing the oath of
       office, the appointing authority records the date of entry on AD or into active status, as
       applicable, as the implied or constructive date of acceptance. However, the appointing
       authority must obtain an executed oath of office as soon as possible.
       3.9.2.2. The officer executes the oath as of the current date. On receiving the oath from
       the officer, the appointing authority annotates it as follows: Date of entry (on active duty
       or into active status, as applicable) on (date) pursuant to Special Order (#) HQ (Issuing),
       dated (of order), constitutes constructive acceptance of appointment. Acceptance
       officially recorded as of date of EAD or entry into active status, as applicable.
 46                                                                      AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003


    3.9.3. An oath of office properly dated and signed by an appointee, but administered by
    other than an authorized official is not a valid oath, but it is effective as an acceptance and
    recorded as such. In such cases, the appointing authority:
         3.9.3.1. Obtains a valid oath of office dated as the date actually executed.
         3.9.3.2. Forwards both oaths with the application and appointment documents to the
         proper MPerRGp custodian.
    3.9.4. When an individual who is in training to qualify for later reappointment executes the
    oath of office on a date after he or she completes educational requirements, the appointing
    authority annotates the oath as follows: Date of appointment recorded for record purposes as
    the completion date of educational requirements.
3.10. Orders and Records.
    3.10.1. General Information. AFI 37-128, Information Management, tells what series of
    special orders to use and how to number, authenticate, reproduce, and distribute them.
    Appointing authorities publish orders to announce ResAF appointment or reappointment, to
    announce termination or vacation of ResAF appointment, and correction, amendment,
    rescissions, or revocation of ResAF appointment.
    3.10.2. Appointment or Reappointment. Issue AF Form 778, Reserve Appointment Order,
    or a composed order to announce acceptance of appointment or reappointment. Include items
    listed at Attachment 11.
    3.10.3. Changes to Orders--Amendments, Rescissions, and Revocations. Organizations
    publishing the original order, use AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for Change of
    Administrative Orders, or a composed order, if the form is not practical. Publish in the
    same series as the original order; that is, amend a Reserve order with a Reserve order.

requirements for commissioning.
Appointment—The creation of a commissioned status. In this context, an appointment is neither
a promotion nor a demotion. Appointments generally require nomination by the President,
confirmation by the Senate (depending upon the grade and component), tender of the
appointment to the person, and acceptance of the tender. The term appointment as used in this
instruction refers to an "original" appointment as defined in Title 10, U.S.C. 101(b)(10).
Armed Forces of the United States—A term used to denote collectively all components of the
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.
Assignment—An administrative act performed by competent authority to direct an individual to
perform duties in a particular AFSC.
DELETED.—Chaplain Advanced Degrees—Applicants must complete professional education
work at a graduate school listed as an accredited member in the current Directory of the
Association of Theological Schools; a regional accrediting agency or association listed in either
the current Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education Directory; the latest edition of the
Higher Education Directory; or any other education publication which clearly indicates regional
accreditation. If one of the above references does not list the graduate school, the applicant may
be accepted if he or she meets all other educational requirements and if a school listed in one of
the above references submits a statement that the applicant's credits are transferable to the school
issuing the statement.
Conviction or Adverse Adjudication—A conviction is the act of finding a person guilty of a
crime, offense, or other violation of the law by a court, judge, or other authorized adjudication
authority and includes fines and forfeiture of bond in lieu of trial. An adverse adjudication (adult
or juvenile) is a finding, decision, sentence, or judgment, other than unconditionally dropped,
dismissed, or acquitted. If the adjudicating authority places a condition or restraint that leads to
dismissal, dropped charges, or acquittal, the adjudication is adverse. Pretrial diversion, deferred
adjudication, suspension of sentence, pardon, not processed, or dismissal after compliance with
imposed conditions is adverse adjudication. If a person is charged and convicted with violating
any federal (including Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) offenses), state, or municipal
law or ordinance, that conviction is an adverse adjudication.

Degree Criteria—The degree must be accredited by one of the six regional accrediting
associations and listed in the current Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education
Directory (published by the American Council on Education), or the latest edition of the Higher
Education Directory (published by Higher Education Publications, Inc.), or any other education
publication which clearly indicates regional accreditation. An applicant for appointment as a
commissioned officer to the Air Force Reserve Nurse Corps must have at least a baccalaureate
degree in nursing, a health-related field, or in business administration or be a graduate of a

academic discipline specified in AFMAN 36—2105, if appointment will be in a specialty for
which specific degrees are a mandatory entry prerequisite. When AFMAN 36-2105 does not
specify an academic specialization as mandatory, exceptionally well qualified applicants for
initial appointment in the ANGUS may request a waiver of the degree requirement. To be
eligible for a degree waiver, applicants must have completed a minimum of 60 semester hours or
90 quarter hours as reflected on a consolidated transcript from a 4-year degree granting
institution. Individuals initially appointed as officers in the ANGUS after 30 September 1984

the family members have been adopted, the applicant can be determined not to have, and
therefore, eligible to apply for commissioning based on restrictions. NOTE: The Commander,
AFRS (AFRS/CC) has the authority to delegate approval no lower than squadron commander for
persons who apply for appointment to perform on EAD. The Director, ANG (NGB/CF) or HQ
USAF, Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE), as applicable, may delegate approval as
necessary to align enlisted and officer dependency eligibility determination policies for persons
who apply for appointment to fill ANGUS or USAFR Ready Reserve positions.
Designation—A professional status to which competent authority (the designating authority)
selects an individual to perform certain professional functions. Title 10, U.S.C. 8067, specifies
those functions, which include medical, judge advocate and chaplain functions. Designating
authorities (SG, The Judge Advocate General, Chief of Chaplains) are established by appropriate
Air Force instruction.
Extended Active Duty (EAD) (As defined in this AFI only)—A tour of active duty (normally
more than 90 days) performed by a member of the Air Reserve components. Strength
accountability for persons on EAD changes from the Air Reserve components to the active force.
ADT and AD in a service academy or Armed Forces preparatory school are not creditable as
EAD.

                APPLICANT BRIEFING ITEM ON SEPARATION POLICY

A4.1. Brief applicants, prior to the commissioning oath, as follows:
   A4.1.1. As military members, you occupy a unique position in society. You represent the
   military establishment. This special status brings with it the responsibility to uphold and
   maintain the dignity and high standards of the US Armed Forces at all times and in all places.
   The Armed Forces must also be ready at all times for worldwide deployment. This fact
   carries with it the requirement for military units and their members to possess high standards
   of morale, good order and discipline, and cohesion. As a result, military laws, rules, customs
   and traditions include restrictions on your personal behavior
       that may be different from civilian life. Members of the Armed Forces may be
       involuntarily separated before their enlistment or term of service ends for various reasons
       established by law and military regulations. Some unacceptable conduct may be grounds
       for involuntary separation, such as:
       A4.1.1.1. You establish a pattern of disciplinary infractions, discreditable involvement
       with civil or military authorities or you cause dissent, or disrupt or degrade the mission of
       your unit. This may also include conduct of any nature that would bring discredit on the
       Armed Forces in the view of the civilian community.
       A4.1.1.2. Because of parental responsibilities, you are unable to perform your duties
       satisfactorily or you are unavailable for worldwide assignment or deployment.
       A4.1.1.3. You fail to meet the weight control standards.
   A4.1.2. DELETED.
   A4.1.3. The Armed Forces do not tolerate harassment or violence against any service
   member, for any reason.
   A4.1.4. Provide a typed copy of the following to each applicant prior to the commissioning
   oath:
       *RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL CONDUCT IN THE ARMED FORCES

Military life is fundamentally different from civilian life. The military has its own laws, rules,
customs, and traditions, including numerous restrictions on personal behavior, that may be
acceptable in civilian society. These are necessary because military units and personnel must
maintain the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are
essential for combat effectiveness.

The Armed Forces must be ready at all times for worldwide deployment. Military laws and
regulations, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, apply to service members at all
times, both on base or off base, from the time the member enters the service until the member is
discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces.
AFI36-2005 19 MAY 2003                                                                       77



*Members of the Armed Forces may be involuntarily separated before their term of service ends
for various reasons established by law and military regulations, such as: (a) member may be
separated for a pattern of disciplinary infractions, a pattern of misconduct, commission of a
serious offense, or civilian conviction, (b) a member who has been referred to a rehabilitation
program for personal drug and alcohol abuse may be separated for failure through inability or
refusal to participate in, cooperate in, or successfully complete such a program, (c) a member
may be discharged by reason of parenthood, if it is determined the member because of parental
responsibilities, is unable to perform his or her duties satisfactorily or is unavailable for
worldwide assignment or deployment, (d) a member may be separated for failure to meet service
weight control standards, or (e) a member may be separated for harassment or violence against
any service member.
