                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the KC-10 aircraft. It is
   an original source document for many areas, but for efficiency, restates information found in
   aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives.
   When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document
   takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is In
   Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4 For matters where this AFI repeats information in
   another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting KC-10 operations
   shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and
   Base Operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing KC-10 aircraft.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. “NOTE” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is vested
with ultimate mission authority and is responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to the Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
   the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.                 For TRANSCOM/AMC
   operational missions under Operational Control (OPCON) of 18 Air Force, 18 AF/CC is the
   waiver authority. For aircrews that change Operational Control (CHOP) to a COCOM, the
   COMAFFOR is the waiver authority.
       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature.    List MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
       supplement (see para 1.5).

       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). Initiate waivers to deviate from
       provisions in this AFI with HQ AMC Stan/Eval.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the
       Waiver Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-
       notice waivers.
1.5. Supplemental Procedures. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or
operational theater may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures, and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Stipulate unique MAJCOM
procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic document) and publish
MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement.
   1.5.1. Combined Command Operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces
   from multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this AFI. Do not assume or expect aircrews to
   perform MAJCOM theater unique procedures without owning MAJCOM/A3/DO approval
   and advance training.
   1.5.2. Coordination Process. Forward MAJCOM approved supplements (attach AF Form
   673, Request to Issue Publication) to AMC/A3V, 402 Scott Dr., Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL,
   62225-5302.
1.6. Local Supplement Coordination Process. Operations Group commanders (OG/CCs) shall
define local operating procedures to this instruction in a unit supplement. OG/CCs shall obtain
MAJCOM approval prior to releasing their supplement. Send an electronic copy of the approved
version to AMC/A3V.
1.7. Improvement Recommendations. Send comments and suggested improvements to this
instruction on an AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels to

                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air and Operations Center (AOC) (Tanker Airlift Control Center)
( TACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air and
Space Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater AOCs, Air Mobility Division (AMD),
Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division, Office of
Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control
Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency response Elements
(CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander
with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in
command will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last
known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST).      Refer to MAJCOM Instruction for procedures and
   requirements.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
2.3. Pilot-in-Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, Air-to-Air
   Refueling (AAR) or transition training) only after obtaining approval of the execution
   authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC’s behalf.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     17


   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required due to insufficient fuel or en route or terminal weather
   conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR), is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority
   for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground
   service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order DSN, HF, Iridium Phone). For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft
   waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method.
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 AOC (TACC):
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, not later than 1 hour prior to
           landing, to update arrival time and provide AF IMT 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical
           Evacuation Mission Offload Message information.
           2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
           available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. When
           an airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 AOC (TACC)
           upon landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.

     2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
     FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
     plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-
     ALE), Iridium Phone).
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
  Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. AAR Mission Reports.
     2.5.5.1. Tanker AAR Report. On operational missions, pilots will provide the following
     information after a tanker AAR to MAJCOM C2. Under normal circumstances, send
     only one off-load message, completed after the final AAR for the mission. Under
     abnormal circumstances such as receiver diverts, unsuccessful AAR, insufficient off-
     load, or anything else that impacts the overall success of the mission, send a report as
     soon as practical.
         2.5.5.1.1. Call Sign.
         2.5.5.1.2. Fuel off-loaded.
         2.5.5.1.3. Mission status.
         2.5.5.1.4. Next station.
         2.5.5.1.5. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
     2.5.5.2. Receiver AAR Report. On operational missions, report the following AAR
     information to the destination C2 agency after landing. C2 agencies will enter the
     information in the MAF C2 system for missions under their control. The MAJCOM C2
     agency will enter the data for all missions. Include all scheduled AARs not
     accomplished.
         2.5.5.2.1. AAR track.
         2.5.5.2.2. Scheduled On-load.
         2.5.5.2.3. Actual On-load.
         2.5.5.2.4. Reason Code.
         2.5.5.2.5. Additional Comments.
     2.5.5.3. Reason Codes. Reason codes indicate the outcome of air refueling activity.
     Codes are normally used when a problem or situation affects the successful
     accomplishment of the air refueling. The Reason Code “AC” will be used when air
     refueling was complete without delay or mission impact. Additional comments are
     mandatory for all reason codes except AT, WX, and AC.

  2.5.6. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications are the primary method.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase “Pass to Hilda” to Air Traffic Control
     (ATC) position reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew
     flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting
     normal communication methods.
  2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the
  worldwide C2 network.
     2.5.8.1. The secondary HF radio should be operated in Automatic Link Establishment
     (ALE) mode to support voice contacts between the PIC and MAJCOM C2. NOTE:
     Run the ALE system in the silent mode during flights where pilots use the HF radio
     system for communication with ATC.
  2.5.9. Not Used.
  2.5.10. Not Used.
  2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
  transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
  2.5.12. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews
  and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line
  of sight communications do not provide proper security or timeliness.
     2.5.12.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
     2.5.12.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, tanker/receiver AAR, approach, and
     landing. EXCEPTION: If operational necessity requires use of the Iridium phone
     during tanker AAR, the phone should be removed from the cradle and used with the
     portable antenna only.
     2.5.12.3. PICs will ensure Iridium phone numbers are entered as a remark in the GDSS
     Mission Detail.

2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, the MC shall
   coordinate any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not
   later than 24 hours prior to mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
      designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an AAR,
      airdrop, or tactical airland operation. For AMC-tasked missions, the planning agency is
      618 AOC (TACC). The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will designate an MC. The
      MC will be a rated (normally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
      2.6.1.2. For fighter moves, a planner in the tasked unit(s) will coordinate tanker support
      with Air Combat Command (ACC) Air Operations Squadron (AOS) and provide tanker
      flight planning based on ACC AOS/AODX produced profile.
   2.6.2. During MAJCOM AOS planned moves, the tanker MC is the final authority and shall
   ensure tanker aircrew members have properly coordinated mission details for the deployment
   IAW AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery.
      2.6.2.1. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
      The MC and all tanker aircrew members will attend the appropriate MAJCOM
      AOS/Delivery Control Officer (DCO) pre-takeoff briefing. The PIC may excuse boom
      operators and flight engineers from required briefings for preflight duties. Cover tanker
      specific information in the pre-takeoff briefing to coordinate all takeoff, formation, en
      route, AAR, and recovery requirements between tanker and receiver aircraft.
      2.6.2.2. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
      will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
      rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures.
2.7. DUAL ROLE Procedures.
   2.7.1. A valid DUAL ROLE contains the following:
      2.7.1.1. A MAJCOM-validated AAR requirement. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOK must
      receive validated requirement NLT 14 days before mission start date to ensure proper
      mission support.
      2.7.1.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOB
      approved cargo requirement of at least six pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
   2.7.2. Since DUAL ROLE is primarily an AAR mission, the tanker pilot must first meet the
   AAR requirement without regard to accommodating ancillary cargo capability.
   2.7.3. AMC does not guarantee DUAL ROLE ancillary cargo movements and will not
   expend additional tanker sorties or hours to refuel a DUAL ROLE KC-10 (i.e. force
   extension) for the purpose of moving ancillary cargo.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  21


2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Crewmembers may use the 618 AOC (TACC) toll-free
number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL or DSN 312-779-0320 to contact other offices within the 618 AOC
(TACC), including flight managers.
2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-
time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD,
and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.11. Enroute Maintenance Support. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL will support all mobility
aircraft requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance on TRANSCOM/AMC missions. Refer
to paragraph 2.8 for 618 AOC (TACC) telephone numbers.

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1 below
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander, pilot/copilot, flight engineer, and a boom operator. When a mission requires
   more than one aircrew member at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor
   and non-mission ready (NMR) crewmember meet mission requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2KC-10V1, KC-10 Aircrew Training. EXCEPTION: A Non-Mission
   Ready (NMR) pilot may augment provided the other two pilots are MR IP’s. SQ/CC shall
   augment an aircrew for the full Flight Duty Period (FDP). The MAJCOM/A3/DO may
   augment aircrews while the flight is underway. (see paragraph 3.7, Aircrew Management,
   for more on CDT/FDP.)

 NOTES:
 1. An FF will not fly without instructor supervision on local training sorties where
 cargo loading is being accomplished.
 2. A KC-10 FIQ graduate, or FBP graduate that has completed Phase IIA mission
 certification training, may fill the second engineer requirement for augmentation on
 cargo missions only, provided the other engineer is an IF. See AFI 11-2KC-10
 Volume 1, KC-10 Aircrew Training.
 3. Basic crew missions with one boom operator are limited to 40 passengers. Basic
 crew missions with one boom operator and planned tanker air refueling are limited
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 23


 to 10 passengers. The passengers may be monitored by flight deck crew during
 tanker air refueling. The 10 passenger limit may be exceeded if additional mission
 ready crewmembers are onboard to monitor passengers during tanker air refueling.
 4. Two boom operators (MBs) are required on missions with planned cargo
 operations and/or more than 40 passengers. An FB supervised by an IB can be used
 to fulfill a single MB.
 5. Three boom operators (MBs) are required when more than 40 passengers are
 planned and multiple air refuelings are anticipated. An FB supervised by an IB can
 be used to fulfill a single MB.



3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Officer Course (SOC) (restricted AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight
   may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, for procedures and requirements governing senior leader
   flying.
       3.3.1.1. Senior Officers who complete the SOC must adhere to the restrictions listed in
       their AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Officer Course will log “FP” for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log “OP” for
   Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight). EXCEPTION:
FTU instructors comply with AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1 and published FTU syllabi.
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours Flight Duty Period (FDP)
   and designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall brief
   the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Initial qualification pilots enrolled in a MAJCOM approved training course may
   accomplish tanker/receiver AR under IP supervision.
   3.4.3. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board (N/A MEP).
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
       3.4.3.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers or hazardous cargo on
       board. Touch-and-go landings are authorized with Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)
       on board.
 24                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


3.5. Not used.
3.6. Boom Operators and Flight Engineers. A non-current or unqualified boom operator or
flight engineer may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a
qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
   3.6.1. DELETED
   3.6.2. DELETED
   3.6.3. DELETED
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once
   enroute, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot pitch axis fails after departure IAW information below. If
   the autopilot fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best
   course of action to preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of
   action may include diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2,
   coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled to the
       FMS). All tactical events will be accomplished within the first 14 hours of the FDP.
       Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to augmented
       day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment basic crew to
       extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
                 3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
                 the first takeoff of the day.
                 3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
                 rest en route.
          3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
          authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
          mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
          delays. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to exercise this option.
       3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
       (16 hours when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled
       to the FMS). All tactical events will be accomplished within the first 18 hours of the
       FDP. SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion of the aircrew when the autopilot
       pitch axis is inoperative.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                               25


         3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the
         mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en
         route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
            3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 2 intermediate stops after 14 hours of FDP (each
            receiver AAR shall count as an intermediate stop).
            3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4 hour
            legs. NOTE: If the mission profile includes at least one 5 hour leg or two 3 hour
            legs the maximum FDP will be 18 hours. (All other restrictions still apply).
            3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
     3.7.1.3. Not Used.
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training, Tactical, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and
     Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
         3.7.1.5.1. 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the
         autopilot cannot be coupled to the FMS). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP. EXCEPTION: FTU
         missions and flight evaluations.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. AFRC crews may perform all mission-related events on local training
            missions provided their time from start of CDT/FDP does not exceed 16 hours.
                3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
                civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first
                duty period (military or civilian).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT is 18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented
  aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 AOC (TACC) for AMC and AMC gained
     missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate (618 AOC
     (TACC) approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time
     before entering crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for
     duty.
     3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3.
 26                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
   MAF aircrew members may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission
   being flown but required for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the
   AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may
   travel as MEP for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers
   to travel as MEP in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for flight in MEP status).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
      duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember’s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as “get-me-
   downs” following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
   (CM) Program and ensure compliance with its provisions. AMC/SG will provide clinical
   oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation.
   3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
   of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AvORM worksheet. Both the manual and
   automated “MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet” incorporate a fatigue CM risk
   assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the “Pubs” tab,
   “Operational Risk Management (ORM)” section and will be used by all three tiers of mission
   planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase.
   3.9.3. Flight surgeons will use the AMC-approved (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs
   and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate their operational fliers in venues such as
   clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days, pre-deployment briefings, readiness
   training, Commanders' Calls, First-Term Airmen Courses, base orientations and safety
   meetings.
   3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
   their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                               27


  managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
  and exercise.
  3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
  use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
  sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
  home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
  fatigue CM.
  3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
  unbreakable as the “12 hour bottle to throttle” restriction for alcohol consumption:
     3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight.
     3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they wish to
     use for operational purposes, documented using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1, Ground
     Testing of No-Go Pills (attached below). In order to avoid possible drug interactions,
     aircrew members will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications
     and/or nutritional supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members
     will be DNIF on an AF Form 1042 for the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods prescribed in
     paragraph 6.d. below. After ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon
     will complete the bottom half of the Form 1 and a “return to fly” AF Form 1042.
     Successful ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it
     operationally.
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain NoGo Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons can verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the “MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card” all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry.
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. The following are the minimum ‘DNIF’ periods (no
     AF Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill:
         3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
         3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‘DNIF’
         3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
         minimum ‘DNIF’.            NOTE: No-Go medications can affect individuals very
         differently. To comply with the “no aircrew duties while under the effects”
         restriction, it is the responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of
         their own minimum ‘DNIF’ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their
         ground trial results and/or previous experiences.
     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill:
         3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
         greater than four hours duration.
28                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF’s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
        3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
        ‘DNIF’ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4. above.
        3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both.
        3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
        (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
        a 60-day period. To optimally support dynamic AMC mission requirements, flight
        surgeons should provide a prescription for 60 days’ worth of medication (20 pills) at a
        time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
        consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. To optimally support
        dynamic AMC mission requirements, flight surgeons should provide a prescription
        for 60 days’ worth of medication (28 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew
        member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
        types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
        restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
        for Sonata).
        3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
        period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
        will not be consumed while in the minimum ‘DNIF’ period for the previous one.
        3.9.6.6.7. The “MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form” will be used to document No-
        Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member’s medical
        record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
        member’s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
        record. Flight surgeons will discuss any concerns about an aircrew member’s use of
        No-Go Pills with the individual’s commander if there is any question of misuse.
        3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
        follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
  3.9.7. DELETED
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions (with 2000-0530L show times) greater than
     four hours duration.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 29


      3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, air-
      conditioned, and darkened).
      3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
      3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
      flight time duration.
      3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
   3.9.8. DELETED
      3.9.8.1. Restoril (temazepam) – 12 hours minimum DNIF.
      3.9.8.2. Ambien (zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum DNIF.
      3.9.8.3. Sonata (zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum DNIF.
   3.9.9. DELETED
      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for each no-go pill and receive
      flight surgeon clearance prior to using a particular no-go pill in the flying environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate heavy equipment or perform aircrew duties
      during the minimum DNIF period for each no-go pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.8.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
      alcohol, or vice versa.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew members will fill out an AMC-approved (lead command) “No-Go Pill
      Usage Questionnaire” detailing how they used their last prescription when requesting a
      refill from the FS.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril (temazepam) and Ambien (zolpidem) to a maximum of
      seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in a 60-day period. In order to support
      dynamic MAF mission requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60
      days (20 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata (zaleplon) to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no
      more than 28 days in a 60-day period. In order to support dynamic MAF mission
      requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60 days (28 pills) at a time if
      requested by the aircrew member.
      3.9.9.7. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
      supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
      potential interactions.
3.10. Crew Rest/En Route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
   aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
   Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
   first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12
30                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


  hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers
  to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC in accordance with AFI 11-202V3
  and appropriate supplement.
  3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
  before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
     3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
     shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
     members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
     rest period after they complete official duties.
     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
     load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
  17 hours (18+15 hours for dual role missions and en route channel mission stops with a cargo
  download or upload – allows for cargo loading operations upon arrival and 3+15 show for
  departure) ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to
  delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission
  allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
  disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A AFRC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 31


       3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
       suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
       3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
   3.10.6. Crew Chief Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed crew
   chief or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with en
   route/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief can
   safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the crew chief has
   sufficient time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
   criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
   or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew’s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
       location’s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 4+15 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 3+15 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
   increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish
   self-alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and Dash 9
       section V cargo), C2 agents may alert boom operators up to 2 hours before normal alert
       time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the boom
 32                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      operator before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the boom operator more than 1 hour
      before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the boom operator’s show
      time.
      3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
      is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
      aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
      3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
      3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
      aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
      3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
      coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
      missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
      avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
      3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
      agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
      3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
      alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
      12 hours when traveling in MEP status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to
      accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the
      window as necessary to MEP to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time
      (FSRT).
      3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
      during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
      the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
      from the time of notification.
      3.11.2.4. If the mission cannot depart within 4+00 hours of any scheduled takeoff, the
      PIC may continue the mission after a thorough re-evaluation of all ORM factors. The
      controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept a takeoff outside of the 4 hour
      window. The PIC will coordinate with C2 to continue the mission or enter crew rest and
      establish a legal for alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
      3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
      3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
      3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
      3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
      mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  33


   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew’s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for AFRC crews flying unit-equipped aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12
hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management
of Standby Force Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as “cocked on alert”. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be
   placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.
   Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The aircrew preflight portion
   remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew.
   Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished on a
   case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if access
   to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are
   notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during
   normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the
   aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the
   aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if
   required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews or enter them into 12 hours crew rest
   for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
   12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
 34                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
   hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to sp0ecific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff
has notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office
(AF/DPG) prior to any active duty General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews
will use guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS, as well as unique
   systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Each effected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.3. MDS conversion training.
       3.15.3.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion.
       OG/CCs will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will
       include as a minimum a list of affected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are properly
authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized MEP status on any
mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM designated
crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew compliment are
allowed MEP status.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                35


   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization.
3.18. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants (FAs) and
communication system operators (CSOs) may fly as primary crewmembers on designated KC-10
missions and placed on the flight orders using the following procedures:
   3.18.1. Pen-and-ink changes will contain the appropriate information for flight time
   purposes. Each FA/CSO will provide individual data and training summaries (IDS/ITS) to
   validate Go/No-Go. A signed copy of the 781 extract along with a copy of the flight
   authorization is given to the appropriate individuals when they depart the crew. The flight
   authorization will contain pen-and-ink changes and will be annotated with the PIC
   certification of Go/No-Go.

  3.18.2. The FAs/CSOs fall under the authority of the PIC, or MC, if assigned, throughout the
  mission. The lead FA will coordinate with the PIC or MC, if assigned, regarding FA
  prepared aircrew meals, costs associated with those meals and servicing requirements for the
  mission.
  3.18.3. An egress briefing will be given to the FAs/CSOs prior to the first mission leg. The
  remarks section of the 781, to include the extract, will be annotated with the statement “Just
  in time egress training accomplished.”
  3.18.4. FAs/CSOs are included in transportation/billeting arrangements. FA‘s may stay with
  the party and coordinate billeting with the contact officer (only if coordinated with the PIC or
  MC, if assigned, first).
  3.18.5. FAs/CSOs may fly in flight suits or civilian attire as mission requirements/locations
  dictate. Additionally, FAs may also fly in FA uniforms.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  37


                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A
PIC who accepts an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, 4) weather or
   other adverse condition, and 5) the governing directive of waiver request to include volume,
   chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour
   waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
 38                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4 Report deviations (without waiver) through channels
   to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and
   submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
       4.3.2.1. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for active duty or AFRC units flying 618
       AOC (TACC) directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections). The MEL
       waiver authority has been delegated to AMC/A3V. Contact HQ AMC/A3V through 618
       AOC (TACC).
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. AFRC Directed Missions. AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority for AFRC
   directed missions prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew
   operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority.
       The waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue. NOTE: Deviations from the
       flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
   4.3.7. Airworthiness Directives (AD). ADs are legally enforceable rules issued by the
   Federal Aviation Administration. They are issued when an unsafe condition exists in a
   product and that condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type
   design. ADs apply to aircraft maintained using civil standards IAW AFPD 62-6, USAF
   Airworthiness. The aircraft‘s System’s Group (SG) is responsible for bringing ADs to the
   attention of the appropriate maintenance and operations units. When an AD is released the
   aircraft shall be in compliance with the directive.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     39


       4.3.7.1. PICs shall coordinate new ADs containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, etc. with the appropriate MEL waiver authority (see
       paragraph 4.3).
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. Not Used.
4.6. Not Used.
4.7. Not Used.
4.8. One Engine Inoperative Ferry Flights. PICs will only conduct 2-engine ferry operations
after exhausting all other avenues to return an aircraft with an inoperative engine to MC status.
With MAJCOM/A3/DO approval, PICs may fly a 2-engine ferry sortie using the following
procedures. Two-engine ferry flights are restricted to specially trained (Two-Engine Ferry
Course, Q039) and designated crewmembers from AMC Stan/Eval or OG Stan/Eval.
   4.8.1. The PIC shall plan and obtain clearances to fly to the nearest destination possessing a
   usable maintenance support capability (stations with DC-10 or KC-10 common maintenance
   facilities) and alert all en route, alternate, and abort bases along the intended route of flight.
   4.8.2. The PIC shall comply with the aircraft flight manual and T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 and 1C-
   10(K)A-1-5 limitations. Ensure the aircraft is prepared for two-engine ferry according to
   T.O.s 1C-10(K)A-1-4 and 1C-10(K)A-2-5.
   4.8.3. The aircraft MEL (T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-2), does not apply. All primary aircraft systems
   not specifically associated with the failed engine must be fully operational.
   4.8.4. Download cargo, including mission support kits, before ferry operations (may remove
   the onboard cargo handling system to further reduce operational and zero fuel weights).
   Return all cargo and support equipment to the main operating base (MOB) of assignment via
   organic support aircraft or other airlift means.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 do not account for a
   gear-down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable
   assurance that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route
   stops and alternates).
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with MAJCOM
   STAN/EVAL or OG/OGV.
4.10. Fuel System Limitations. Normal fuel flow is tank-to-engine. Since main fuel tanks are
an integral part of the wings, do not fly an aircraft with an empty main tank without an
AMC/A3VK, AMC/A4M, and 544 ACSS waiver. There are no flight restrictions with a body
tank or tanks empty.
   4.10.1. Minimum required ramp fuel load (RRFL) for the KC-10 is 50,000 lbs. Starting
   engines with less than 50,000 lbs of fuel is permissible provided the crew chief or flight
 40                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   engineer validates the fuel levels in the outboard compartments using the dipstick method.
   After takeoff, the aircraft can be operated safely with fuel quantities below 50,000 lbs.
   4.10.2. If fuel quantity gauge indicator errors are noted, the affected fuel quantity gauge will
   be treated as inoperative. T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-2 restrictions apply.
4.11. Slat Profile Flights. Use the following parameters/guide to perform slat profile flights:
   4.11.1. Limit fuel load to approximately 150,000 lbs of fuel (takeoff).
   4.11.2. No cargo.
   4.11.3. Extend slats to takeoff position.
   4.11.4. Approximately 12,000 feet pressure altitude.
4.12. Not Used.
4.13. Passenger Seat Limitations. If a passenger seat is broken (cannot be locked in the full
upright position) do not seat passengers in the broken seat for takeoff/landing. If a seatback
contains a broken tray table that will not stow/lock and cannot be secured by any other means, do
not seat passengers directly behind the seatback with the broken tray table for takeoff/landing.
Affected seats may be occupied during flight. Make every reasonable effort to repair the broken
seat/tray table before turning away passengers. Coordinate seat release changes to the
appropriate C2 agency to avoid over-booking seats.
4.14. Fall Protection. Crew members are prohibited from climbing onto the upper fuselage or
wing surfaces unless there is an operational necessity. When operational conditions dictate that
aircrew members must climb onto upper fuselage or wing surfaces, they will do so only when
conditions are dry and while wearing a maintenance safety harness and properly attached
lanyard. EXCEPTION: MDS aircraft that do not have the ability to anchor the maintenance
safety harness and lanyard are exempt from the harness requirement until a suitable alternative is
available.   Aircraft commanders will ensure no other personnel (excluding qualified
OPS/maintenance personnel) have access to, or be allowed to, climb onto the fuselage or wings.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   41

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. KC-10 checklists are designed as clean up checklists, and items may be
accomplished prior to the checklist being read. A checklist is not complete until all items have
been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions and
deviations specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist
procedures or limitations may be added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember’s
responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs
   shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
   The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots and the flight engineer shall be in their seats during flight. One
of them may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots
in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station
during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert).
   5.2.1. During cruise, boom operators may leave their duty station for longer periods to meet
   physiological needs and to perform normal crew duties. Instructor and evaluator pilots
   performing instructor/evaluator duties may occupy the boom operator’s forward position. In
   all cases, the PIC has final determination on who occupies the boom operator’s forward
   position. Crewmembers occupying the boom operator’s forward position are responsible for
   duties associated with that position IAW T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1.
   5.2.2. The Boom Operator will be seated in the boom operator's forward seat while
   conducting receiver AAR to the maximum extent possible. Any exception to this must be
   approved by the PIC.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to either pilot or flight engineer positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   5.4.2. Not Used.
   5.4.3. Unless the other pilot in the seat is a certified AC or higher, pilots in command (PIC)
   with less than 100 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) hours since AC certification will make all
   takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
 42                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       5.4.3.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 40 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.3.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.3.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot not flying (PNF) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command.
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations, receiver AAR, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
   5.6.1. Aircraft Taxi/Observer Procedures. Aircraft commanders requesting the assistance of
   a crewmember to monitor the taxi from a forward (1 L/R) or mid-cabin (2 L/R) door should
   not commence taxi until communications are established, and cleared to taxi by the observer.
   If communication extension cord or headsets are inoperative, utilize an extra crewmember to
   relay distance calls to the Pilot-In-Command. Prior to opening the door, ensure surrounding
   area is clear of potential FOD and only open the door as much as required to safely monitor
   taxi. Taxi observer will not stand or kneel directly in front of door opening.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Crewmembers will have
   seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.2. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing. Fasten
   shoulder harness unless crew duties dictate otherwise. For tactical/AAR operations, all
   crewmembers and passengers will have seat belts fastened (unless authorized by the PIC or
   crew duties dictate otherwise; shoulder harnesses are not required for tanker AAR).
   Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt
   requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however, they will have a seat
   available with an operable seat belt.
       5.7.2.1. Shoulder harnesses are optional for flight engineers during all phases of flight.
   5.7.3. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system. The only electrical outlets authorized for personal use are
   the outlets located in the aircraft lavatories. They are intended for electrical shavers or other
   small personal electronic devices. Approved vacuum cleaners are authorized for ground use.
   NOTE: Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) approval letters only apply to the common use
   equipment listed on the letter. EMI approval letter(s) are on the AMC/A3V web site.

   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Boom operators will
   ensure passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE
   such as PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 and
   may be used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100 and Garmin
   GPS 35-USB.
       5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
       awareness tool and its use is voluntary.
   5.9.4. Turn off Iridium phones:
       5.9.4.1. Within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
       5.9.4.2. During take-off, approach, and landing.
       5.9.4.3. At the discretion of the PIC, the Iridium phone may be left on during tanker
       AAR operations. The phone should be removed from the cradle and used with the
       portable antenna only.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce intentions for departures, arrivals, approaches, and
when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The PNF will make all advisory
calls except those designated for other crewmembers. Unless otherwise directed, the PNF and
FE will acknowledge all mandatory calls. Mandatory calls are as follows:
   5.11.1. All mandatory calls as directed by the KC-10 Dash One.
   5.11.2. Not Used.
   5.11.3. Deviations.
       5.11.3.1. Any crewmember will immediately notify the PF when deviation of heading
       (+/- 10 degrees), airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 feet) is observed, and no
       attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
       5.11.3.2. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will
       immediately notify the PF.

 NOTES:
 (1) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway environment
 at DA; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The pilot may continue to
 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not descend below 100 feet above
 touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating bars or the
 red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
 (2) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around. Respond
 with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout
 touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 (3) If the pilot flying has stated “landing” then this call is not required.
 (4) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.

5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
   5.12.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
       5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
           5.12.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
           for circling approaches.
           5.12.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
           5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. NOTE: Under certain conditions
           (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs may require greater than a 1000 fpm descent
           rate.
               5.12.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
               descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
               217). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max extent
46                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


             possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not occur.
         5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to T.O.
         guidance.
         5.12.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
         5.12.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
         instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
         5.12.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
         5.12.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PNF will announce the
         deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PNF states “1000 xxxx,”
         where “xxxx” equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which
         clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the aircraft to a stable
         platform. Examples: “1000, fast,” or “1000, half dot low”. If criteria are met, PNF
         will simply state “1000.”
     5.12.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state “500.”
         5.12.1.2.1. Parameters are the same as those at 1000 feet AGL.
     5.12.1.3. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
         5.12.1.3.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
         5.12.1.3.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees from target
         5.12.1.3.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
  5.12.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
  following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
  descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC or
  FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
  When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
  It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
  the planned descent profile.
  5.12.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
  Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
  layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
  will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
  5.12.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
  anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
  specific crewmember duties.
  5.12.5. Not Used.
  5.12.6. FTUs only. FTUs will train students to ensure they understand and are capable of
  complying with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. FTU instructors must use their
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 47


   expertise and experience to deviate from the guidelines of stabilized approach criteria as
   required during appropriate instructional scenarios.
5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared
   prior to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.13.2. Command Radios.
       5.13.2.1. The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
       5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
       unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
       on the inbound and outbound legs.
       5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       5.13.2.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances; the flight engineer
       will also record the clearance.
       5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
       maximum extent possible. EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor
       guard frequencies during tanker or receiver rendezvous and AAR.
       5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
       unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
       5.13.2.7. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication (PLOC) with
       ATC/radio operators.
       5.13.2.8. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, aircrews
       shall change their transponder mode 3/A to 7600. Squawking 7600 highlights the loss of
       two-way radio capability to ATC/radio operators and minimizes the risk of being
       intercepted. Past experience shows aircrews often hear transmissions from other aircraft,
       but not the associated ground ATC exchanges. Therefore, it is recommended that in all
       cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, aircrews attempt to use other aircraft to
       relay messages to ATC controllers.
       5.13.2.9. Aircrews experiencing a prolonged loss of contact event will complete a PLOC
       questionnaire found at: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_537.doc.
       E-mail completed questionnaires to AMC.A3V@scott.af.mil or fax to DSN (312) 576-
       5692.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM)/Threat and Error Management.
   5.14.1. Threat and Error Management provides strategies and tactics to help crews target
   threats to safe flight operations and decreases the potential for crew error. External threats
 48                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   are events that occur outside the influence of the flight crew and require crew attention and
   management to maintain adequate safety margins. Internal threats are crew related and are
   factors that could lead to an error if not recognized and controlled.
   5.14.2. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
      5.14.2.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.14.2.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.14.2.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
      5.14.2.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
      the following actions:
      5.14.2.5. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
      5.14.2.6. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
      5.14.2.7. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
      inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.14.2.8. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
      current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000’
   MSL will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be
   made to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD).
   Sterile cockpit procedures also apply during taxi, and air refueling operations.
   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.14.5. CRM Enhancement. PICs will conduct a CRM exercise on the first suitable segment
   of each mission. This will be done at level off on a non interference basis with other mission
   requirements. Take the exercise to a logical conclusion and ensure crew communications
   and duties are appropriate. Suggested topics are rapid decompression, oceanic contingency
   operation, emergency divert or other MAJCOM or locally generated Special Interest Item
   (SII).
   5.14.6. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and should always be confirmed by two crew members. These actions include, but are
   not limited to, placing fuel levers off, pulling the engine fire handle/discharging agent, and
   dumping fuel. Both crewmembers must verbally and visually identify the affected control,
   (i.e. “CONFIRM NUMBER ONE”). The crewmember performing the action will point to
   the affected control. The crewmember monitoring the action will verbally and visually
   confirm the proper control is selected, (i.e. “NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”). The
   crewmember performing the action then actuates the affected control.
5.15. Use of Automation.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  49


   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) and the Pilot Not Flying (PNF) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly
   the aircraft using the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain
   basic flying skills. However, pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of
   automation consistent with changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. Both
   pilots are responsible for ensuring the aircraft is following the desired flight path.
   5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
   designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PNF.
   VVM consists of the following three step process:
      5.15.2.1. Prior to making any changes in the CDU, altitude, autopilot on/off, and auto
      throttle on/off the pilot making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
      5.15.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution
      5.15.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
      achieved.
      5.15.2.4. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and
      autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible (e.g.
      “Autopilot engaged ”,“Altitude Hold”, “Autothrottles”, “Nav-Capture”, etc.). The PNF
      will acknowledge the call.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor’s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway length is 7,000
   feet. Minimum runway width is 147 feet. Minimum taxiway width is 75 feet.
   5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed Critical Field
   Length (CFL) exceeds runway available, or if takeoff gross weight exceeds Maximum
   Allowable Weight (MAW). Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance based
   on a threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
      5.18.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will
      initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The
      decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
 50                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet on both sides of centerline should be
      cleared. If not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the uncleared portion up to 50 feet
      either side of centerline.
      5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
      if needed.
   5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
      5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
      recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
      to have the cable inspected.
      5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
      5.18.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems with an eight-
      point cable tie-down system are installed. When operating from runways equipped with
      other types of systems, or if it is unknown whether the BAK-12 system includes eight
      point tiedowns, aircrews should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
   5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.18.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
      guidance. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
      5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
      before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
      in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
      specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
      Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A3AS. HQ AMC/A3V is the OPR
      for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-
      AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews that have access
      to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield data base via the HQ
      AMC Aircrew Portal. Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
   5.18.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to the flight manual
   for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative when
   dealing with unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs)). Normally, RCR
   values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the
   taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The runway
   surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.19.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    51


   Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi without marshalers/wing walkers at home station
   along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance
   from any obstruction and the obstruction is permanent. Adjacent aircraft are also considered
   a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is
   not moving. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent
   obstruction, provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated
   by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
   5.19.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on interphone positioned at the cabin door(s) to act as an observer while
   maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshalers will have an
   illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to have one illuminated
   wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or
   windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
      requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.19.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
      5.19.3.3. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If it becomes necessary to accomplish a
      180° turn on a narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a
      link taxiway or at a designated turn around pad.
      5.19.3.4. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
      unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the
      maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case
   of an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility
   of intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate
   recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
 52                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
   5.20.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing using a MAJCOM approved form for unusual occurrence or
   inflight emergency. Submit completed form through unit Operations Group Stan Eval
   (OGV) to MAJCOM/Stan Eval. Unit OGVs will retain forms for 6 months. Document all
   pertinent information, including the following items:
      5.20.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
      5.20.5.2. Actual Duration.
      5.20.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
      5.20.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
      5.20.5.5. Recovery Field.
      5.20.5.6. Runway Available.
      5.20.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
      5.20.5.8. Outside air temperature.
      5.20.5.9. Wind direction and velocity.
      5.20.5.10. Jettison Amount.
      5.20.5.11. Reason for Jettison.
      5.20.5.12. Approval Authority.
5.21. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3. Exceptions. In accordance with applicable tech
orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed below 10,000 feet
to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation members may
exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum maneuver speed of the
heaviest formation member.
5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
      5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
      required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  53


   landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
   Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR
   Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance
   instructions.
   5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). FCFs and ACFs will be accomplished IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance
Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-10(K)A-6CF-1, Acceptance and/or Functional Check
Procedures Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific
technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact
their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
   require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.3. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance
   in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check
   only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.4. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
   5.23.5. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
   5.23.6. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight.
 54                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   5.23.7. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to “VFR on Top” for the
   altitude phase of the flight.
   5.23.8. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release the
   aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
   FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial
Events, AFI 11-246 Volume 6, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, and appropriate MAJCOM
supplements/Aerial Demo CONOPs.
5.25. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
   5.25.1. TCAS event documentation. The PIC will document all pertinent information
   surrounding an RA event on an AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), and
   submit to the nearest Air Force Safety Office.
       5.25.1.1. The investigating Safety Office will determine if the event is, in fact,
       reportable, and will notify the individual or unit submitting the HATR of this
       determination and/or pending actions.
5.26. Not Used.
5.27. Not Used.
5.28. Not Used.
5.29. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews
will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may only
accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the
PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities through
618 AOC (TACC), or appropriate C2 agency.
5.30. Not Used.
5.31. Not Used.
5.32. Aircrew Fatigue. It is the crewmember’s responsibility to be properly rested for each
mission. However, if circumstances prevent this, no MAF/AMC crewmember should feel
pressured to fly when not properly rested. A crewmember who is fatigued shall immediately
notify the aircraft commander, if unable to start or complete a mission safely. Declaring “Safety
of Flight” may be required in this situation.
5.33. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an anonymous, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to
encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non-
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   55


punitive environment for the open reporting of safety concerns and information that might be
critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors to accidents. These safety concerns
may be either observed or experienced by the submitter. The goal is to prevent mishaps by
addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not
identified and/or correctable by other methods or through traditional safety reporting sources.
   5.33.1. The AMC ASAP website is accessible at www.safety-masap.com. Username and
   Password can be obtained from the crewmember’s Wing/Group Safety office. Crewmembers
   can contact the AMC ASAP program manager via email at amc.asap@scott.af.mil.
5.34. Air Driven Generator (ADG) Checks. Aircrew will not conduct in-flight checks of the
KC-10 ADG. If at any time, the aircraft requires a check of the ADG, the crew will coordinate a
ground check with the appropriate agency. This does not preclude the use of the ADG in an
emergency situation.
5.35. Terminal Area RNAV Procedures. Properly trained KC-10 aircrews are authorized to
perform IFR RNAV operations to include instrument departures, arrivals, and approaches using
LNAV minima. RESTRICTION: The KC-10s that are not modified with the CNS/ATM
avionics are NOT authorized to fly any RNAV procedures requiring RNAV 1 or RNAV 2
tolerances (e.g. RNAV SIDs and STARS, Q routes, T routes, etc).
   5.35.1. For departure and arrival procedures based on traditional ground-based NAVAIDs in
   the NAS and constructed by a US government TERPs authority (USAF/FAA/USN), FMS
   NAV mode may be used as the sole source for navigation with the following restrictions:
       5.35.1.1. All terminal RNAV procedures must be retrieved from the navigation database.
       5.35.1.2. RNAV procedures will not be flown with an expired database.
       5.35.1.3. Pilots will tune, identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based
       NAVAIDs whenever practicable.
   5.35.2. KC-10 aircrews are not authorized to fly RNAV(RNP) approaches until aircraft
   equipment is certified and aircrews are trained. This does not affect the authorization to
   RNAV(GPS) approaches. EXCEPTION: KC-10 CNS/ATM certified aircrew operating
   aircraft modified with the CNS/ATM avionics.

   when staging or transiting Elmendorf AFB AK.
6.2. Personal Requirements.
   6.2.1. Refer to current Unit Deployment Manager guidance for applicable deployment
   requirements.
   6.2.2. Passport. Crewmembers will carry a valid passport on all missions outside the
   CONUS. EXCEPTION: Unit commanders may authorize newly assigned personnel who
   have applied for, but not yet received, a passport to act as crewmembers on missions not
   scheduled to transit locations where passports are required.
   6.2.3. Shot Record. Crewmembers must maintain worldwide shot requirements.
   6.2.4. Driver's License. A valid state driver's license is required on each TDY where use of
   US government general purpose vehicles may be required. Crewmembers will contact the
   local airfield manager before driving on the flight line.
   6.2.5. Identification Tags. Crewmembers will carry two identification tags on all flights.
   6.2.6. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, or
   earrings in the aircraft or on the flight line. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may wear plain
   elastic hair fasteners and/or pins, clips, or barrettes providing they do not interfere with the
   wearing of headsets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. They will be accounted for before
   and after flight.
   6.2.7. Not Used
   6.2.8. Flashlights. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight for night flights.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                57


   6.2.9. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on flight lines during hours of
   darkness or periods of reduced visibility.
   6.2.10. AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review and obtain theater-
   specific information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum,
   should include AFI 11-202V3, AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, and the following:
      6.3.1.1. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
      6.3.1.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country
      Risk Assessment (CRA), and FLIP. Obtain and carry this information if required.
      6.3.1.3. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain
      necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
   6.3.2. Obtain required customs forms.
   6.3.3. Obtain worldwide FLIPs and sufficient communications security (COMSEC)
   materials for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.4. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.5. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.6. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
   6.3.7. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
   6.3.8. Passenger Restrictions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible
   unless overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from
   flying on specific missions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
   of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the
   traveling party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
      6.3.8.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
      PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
      passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency
      to release available seats to the passenger terminal. PICs are encouraged to release
      maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
          6.3.8.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency
          (typically a government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the
          aircraft. Space available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours
          in advance by USAF/ CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using
          agency contact officer through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper
          funding and reimbursement. Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in
          doubt. Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
          6.3.8.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally
          not be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express
 58                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


           permission of HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the
           aircraft, which may include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary
           to move aircrew members or support personnel on White House support mission
           aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and
           CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available passengers will usually be permitted
           if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an upgraded security status.
           6.3.8.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
           being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable
           route, depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer
           releases seats, aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability
           for the passengers is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will
           ensure passengers understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to
           boarding.
   6.3.9. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
   appropriate.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry (or have in-flight
access to) the publications specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Units may specify additional
publications in their local unit supplement. Reference AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals
Program, for guidance on electronic publications. Only one crewmember per crew position is
required to carry the publications listed in Table 6.1 (i.e. two flight engineers or boom operators,
or more than one AC/IP/EP) each will carry a checklist but otherwise only one set of
publications is required. Two engine ferry crewmembers will carry publications indicated by
“$”. “E” = Electronic Publications, “P” = Paper Publications.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates
to airfield operability and weight bearing capability. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8 for non-
DoD published approach criteria.
   6.5.1. Crews will use the Performance Manual to manually calculate Weight Bearing
   Capacity (WBC) limits for runways, taxiways and aprons. Discrepancies between manually
   calculated limits and those on the AMC Giant Report should be reported to HQ AMC/A3AS,
   Airfield Suitability Branch.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.7. Global Decision Scheduling System 2 (GDSS2) Account. Pilots will obtain a GDSS2
account prior to operating on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the
GDSS2 account at locations without an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure
GDSS2 account passwords are active prior to departing home station.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
 60                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials.
       6.8.1.1. Electronic signatures or GTIMS may be used for FCIF update/sign-off.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies
concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.
6.10. Mission Kits. Carry mission kits on all operational missions. Publications and forms may
be maintained and carried electronically provided operable in-flight viewing/printing capability
exists. Suggested items include: NOTE: * Indicates mandatory for all AOC (TACC) or AMC

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
   hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
   manuals, and OPORD procedure.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                63


  6.12.2. Pilot in Command Pre-Departure Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the
  operations briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), CRM, and
  ORM levels and mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details if not
  previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing guide.
     6.12.2.1. Pilot in Command Enroute Briefing. In the en route system, the PIC will
     ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a
     minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM,
     and the ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to
     engine start.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
  peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
  Specialized briefings review formation tactics and procedures, AR information, and technical
  instructions for specialized equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend each
  briefing. Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties,
  however the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. Use a MAJCOM approved specialized
  briefing guide.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
     takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
     use 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
     supporting the theater C2 Agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and
     further updates.
     6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
     information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
     their location.
     6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
     weather flight, OWS, or 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, obtain weather through
     any means available prior to mission accomplishment.
     6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
     FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
     6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
     are not required.
  6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established
  buffer zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
  procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
  6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
  peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
  6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
  for IFM sorties. The PIC, or designated representative, will contact the flight manager if
 64                                                         AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   there are discrepancies with the departure papers or to resolve any questions before signing
   the flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training/Evaluation Briefing.         Before all training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners will brief the crew on requirements and objectives for each
   student or examinee.
   6.12.9. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
   obtain a current intelligence briefing.
   6.12.10. Post-Mission Debrief. PICs will debrief all sorties and simulator missions. Use the
   MAJCOM approved MAF Debrief Guide.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the “REACH” call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign “Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared
   call signs when required.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Only
   current, command validated (HQ AMC/A3VK) computer programs will be used for flights
   involving KC-10 aircraft.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    65


       618 AOC (TACC)/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30°
       error in direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. Aircraft World-wide Navigational Databases.
       6.15.2.1. All waypoint data retrieved from a non-current or commercially produced
       database will be verified by one or more of the following methods.
           6.15.2.1.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
           6.15.2.1.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for
           each waypoint.
           6.15.2.1.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
           6.15.2.1.4. For aircraft modified with CNS/ATM avionics, the Tanker, Airlift and
           Special Mission (TASM) Aircraft Weapons and Electronics (AWE) software
           internally compares the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) and the
           Jeppesen database; therefore, any flight plan retrieved from a mission data card need
           not be verified using the methods above. Aircrews will compare waypoint identifiers
           to the filed flight plan.
       6.15.2.2. Aircraft modified with CNS/ATM avionics have a pre-loaded air refueling
       database separate from the Jeppesen world-wide navigational database. There is no
       method of determining the currency of this database once loaded into the FMS; therefore,
       any air refueling waypoint information retrieved from the air refueling database must be
       verified IAW paragraph 6.15.2.1.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. All performance data will be
computed by the flight engineer using T.0. 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or authorized computer software.
Data will be checked by the pilot, or another qualified flight engineer, using T.0. 1C-10(K)A-1-
1, T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1CL-2 tab data or KC-10A Performance Data Computer (slipstick). E-
TOLD will not be verified using the E-TOLD method.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures. NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       procedure for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the sortie is planned as a
       VFR flight. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are
       avoided.
       6.16.1.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 crews are specifically authorized
       to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned
       departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering to the following:
66                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


        6.16.1.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
        ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2).
        6.16.1.2.2. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
        environmental conditions improve.
        6.16.1.2.3. Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance contained in
        AFMAN 11-217V2.
        6.16.1.2.4. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
        must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
        6.16.1.2.5. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
        not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
        discretion.
        6.16.1.2.6. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
        the mission justifies the increased risk.
     6.16.1.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
     ensuring all the following conditions are met:
        6.16.1.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
        departure route.
        6.16.1.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
        emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
        with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions can
        be met.
     6.16.1.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
     CONUS.
     6.16.1.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
     clearance and reaching the IFR MEA.
  6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
  in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
     6.16.2.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
     6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
        6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
        6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet or as
        published.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                              67


        6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet or as
        published.
        6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet or as
        published.
        6.16.2.2.5. All others: 35 feet or as published.
     6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
     all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
     NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
     gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
     6.16.2.4. Use the following departure planning priority to ensure the aircraft can
     vertically clear all obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI.
        6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
        procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
        engine and, where available, should be used for engine-out departure planning.
        Retrieve current SDPs from the SDP website (contact OGV for current username
        password). “Ad hoc” requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through
        OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A3VK authorizes the use
        of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
            6.16.2.4.1.1. SDPs will be used for missions deemed ‘operationally necessary’ by
            the appropriate mission execution authority.
                6.16.2.4.1.1.1. All 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions are
                deemed operationally necessary by AMC /A3 and 18 AF/CC. SDPs are
                authorized.
                6.16.2.4.1.1.2. Training missions with external users (e.g. tanker/receiver
                AAR training, cargo load training, JA/ATT, etc.) are deemed operationally
                necessary. SDPs are authorized.
                 6.16.2.4.1.1.2.1. All other training missions may be deemed operationally
                 necessary by the OG/CC or equivalent (delegated no lower than SQ/DO), to
                 meet mission and/or aircraft performance requirements.
        6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
        ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
        available, or for missions not deemed ‘operationally necessary’ by the mission
        execution authority, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based
        minimum climb gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative.
        Minimum climb gradients may be published as a ‘Trouble T’ restriction in the IFR
        Take-off Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. Minimum climb gradients do not
        take into account low, close in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below),
        which should normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure
        procedure (Trouble T). Crews must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles,
        by computing the climb gradient for the obstacles and comparing it to the climb
        gradient calculated for the climb restriction.
 68                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


             6.16.2.4.2.1. If operational requirements dictate, the mission execution authority
             may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48’/NM from the published (or standard)
             climb gradient for OEI departure planning.
                6.16.2.4.2.1.1. For all 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions, and for
                training missions with external users, the PIC is authorized to subtract up to
                48’/NM.
                6.16.2.4.2.1.2. For all other missions, the OG/CC or equivalent (delegated no
                lower than SQ/DO) may authorize the PIC to subtract up to 48’/NM.
         6.16.2.4.3. Vertically clear all obstacles, using a VFR departure as described in AFI
         11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1/2. When departing locations where neither an
         SDP nor a minimum climb restriction exists (VFR Departure), and when operational
         requirements dictate, crews may use obstacle height and distance to obstacle and/or
         screen height to determine the minimum Gross Climb Gradient (GCG), IAW TO 1C-
         10(K)A-1-1. The PIC must provide all significant obstacle height/distance and screen
         height information to the flight engineer. A significant obstacle is defined as any
         obstacle along the planned departure route which penetrates the 2.5 GCG on the
         performance manual climbout flight path charts. In the absence of significant
         obstacles or screen heights, compute TOLD using a minimum 2.5 GCG IAW TO 1C-
         10(K)A-1-1. WARNING: 2.5 GCG does not equate to a 2.5% climb gradient.
         Because KC-10 climbout is not linear, obstacles which fall below the 40:1 OCS may
         penetrate the 2.5 GCG line and are therefore limiting for engine out takeoff planning.
         Detailed information about obstacles below the OCS is not published and is generally
         not available. When using this procedure, the PIC must thoroughly review all
         available resources to include properly updated terrain charts (TPC, Sectional, JOG),
         FLIP, base operations, local TERPS specialist (USAF base), or other TERPS
         authorities (Naval Flight Information Group (NAVFIG) in Washington, D.C., DSN
         288-3486, commercial (202) 433-3486; Army’s TERPS office, DSN 656-4410,
         commercial (703) 806-4410; FAA office in Oklahoma City, OK, commercial (405)
         954-4787.) NOTE: Use of the provisions of paragraph 6.16.2.4.4 requires prior
         approval from OG/CC, or deployed equivalent. NOTE: If OEI obstacle clearance
         cannot be satisfied by one of the above methods, download cargo/fuel or delay until
         more favorable conditions exist.

MISSION      VIS       REMARKS
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     69


 Operational 1000         When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
             RVR          crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                          dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and
               (305
                          runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600
               meters)
                          RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.




 All others    1600       For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must
                          read 1600 minimum on all.
               RVR
               (488
               meters)


 NOTES:
 If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
 mile (800 meters).
 When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a departure
 alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced. NOTE: For those missions flight
managed by the 618 AOC (TACC), Flight Managers will provide a route of flight to the primary
alternate if greater than 75 miles from the destination. This route of flight is only for providing
an accurate fuel plan and is not part of the route of flight filed with ATC.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for lowest
   suitable approach (at departure aerodrome).
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
 70                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet; or
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not
   exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3 requirements.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel
   (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45 reserve). A remote or island destination is
   defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable
   alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or
   island destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
       precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
       precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
       minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
       considerations to a remote or island destination.
   6.20.4. IAW AFI 11-202V3, the minimum weather for an airfield requiring an alternate is
   waived to a ceiling of 1000 ft and visibility of 2 statute miles when two or more suitable
   independent precision approaches are available and operable for the airport of intended
   landing at ETA (± 1 hour). This weather minimum includes TEMPO and prevailing
   conditions for intended landing destination within one hour of arrival.
       6.20.4.1. Qualifying airfield requirements. Major airports with two or more separate
       runways, each with precision approaches operating at the same time qualify for the
       requirement for reduced weather minimums. Multiple precision approaches to only one
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  71


      end of the runway do not count. Two ILSs that use the same frequencies/antennas do not
      qualify as two independent approaches.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. The KC-10 is a category III aircraft for turbulence. Crews should confirm the
      type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the
      encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. Turbulence category
      charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002,
      Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will confirm
   with weather agencies what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing fog.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
          flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
          associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
          times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
          benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved fluids,
          crews may use published holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing
          Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the AFFSA/A3OF Flight
          Directives Division website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first
          applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine
          when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
          6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
          completed within 5 minutes of departure.
   6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
   avoid them by at least:
72                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


     6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL230.
     6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or
     more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information
     on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
     6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
     6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
     6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
     6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
     6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
     6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
     feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
     or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
     they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
     gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
     observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
     missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
  or below, refer to AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D,
  Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
  6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
  turbulence. Refer to AFI 11-203, Weather for Aircrews, for additional information on
  mountain wave turbulence.
  6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
  flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
  weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
  6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
  volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, pilots shall not
  plan to operate within 5 NM of any hazardous volcanic ash, without MAJCOM/A3 approval.
  6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
  strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   73


       6.21.11.1. Within 8C of freezing.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight.

the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew during takeoff and climb-out.
6.24. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
   6.24.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC’s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.

descent. The primary sources are 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, OWSs, and USAF
weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical
station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at
Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 Support Squadron Weather Flight
(SPTS/WX) at Davis-Montham AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to
en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to the top of descent (TOD), the PIC will identify and discuss mitigation of
associated hazards to the penetration, approach, landing, and airfield. Before descent into
unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational
awareness of obstructions. Every effort will be made to accomplish briefings and appropriate
checklists prior to TOD. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft
operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial
descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions if an approved instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  79


   operational missions require a tactical approach. NOTE: For VFR or visual approaches at
   locations other than home station, an ILS glide slope indicator or a visual glide slope
   indicator (e.g. VASI, PAPI, etc.) is required.
      6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
      traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will
      monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
      6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
      approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The KC-10 is a category "D" aircraft. If approach speeds exceeds
   166 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
      6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
          6.42.3.1.1. IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 8.17.2.1.1, aircrews are permitted to
          execute Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches with less than 2400
          RVR (1800 RVR or greater) at locations without touchdown zone and centerline
          lighting (or when such system is inoperative) as restricted below:
              6.42.3.1.1.1. Approach must be flown using flight director (FD), heads up display
              (HUD), or coupled autopilot (AP) to the Decision Altitude (DA).
              6.42.3.1.1.2. The approach plate itself must have the note authorizing FD, HUD,
              or AP to the DA.
          6.42.3.1.2. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
          meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
      6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
          6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
          required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
          rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
          add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
          which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
          feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
          minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
          visibility.
      6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by 1/2
      SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
      approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not
      to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
      6.42.3.4. Not Used.
80                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


     6.42.3.5. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. If variable visibilities/ceilings are reported,
     pilots may use the greatest value reported. If it is subsequently determined that weather
     is below minimums for the approach, comply with paragraph 6.42.10 Do not attempt
     further approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling reported is at/above approach
     minimums.
  6.42.4. Not Used.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
     6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
     certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Refer to AFI 11-2KC10V1 for certification
     procedures. Comply with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA Air
         Traffic Control System Command Center prior (ATCSCC) to departure time to obtain
         a pre-coordinated arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept
         PRM approach clearance and did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect
         an ATC directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. Not Used.
  6.42.7. Not Used.
  6.42.8. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
  conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR. Back up
  each approach with available NAVAIDs/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the
  FMS.
  6.42.9. RNAV Procedures. Properly trained KC-10 aircrews are permitted to fly RNAV and
  RNAV (GPS) approaches. RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches will be flown only to
  LNAV minima.
  6.42.10. After Beginning Descent or Approach. IAW AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8, after
  beginning an enroute descent or published approach, and the weather is reported or observed
  to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing the approach to the
  missed approach point (MAP)/DH. Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
  amended clearance is received.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 81


       6.42.10.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway
       environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.10.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
       approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
       reserve.
       6.42.10.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.11. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.11.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.11.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. Not Used.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC KC-10 aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incurs an unscheduled delay due to weather, aircraft maintenance, or foreign
diplomatic clearance problems, forcing the members to be lodged at that location until the
aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) and other required support is charged to
   local TWCF funds via the US Bankcorp Government Purchase Card (GPC) account, in
   accordance with locally established procedures. TWCF payment is applicable for only those
   service members in a group travel status aboard any KC-10 aircraft delayed at these
   locations, regardless of the command owning the aircraft, provided the aircraft is flying a
   TWCF mission (SAAM, CJCS Exercise, JA/ATT, or Contingency) with an AMC mission
   identifier.
   6.44.2. If the aircraft delay is at a location where TWCF funds are not available (regardless
   if DoD facilities are available or not), the KC-10 aircraft commander will utilize SF 44,
   Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher (or AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice) authority
   to acquire the necessary meals, quarters, and transportation for only the group travel status
   passengers. Upon return to home station, the aircraft commander will turn in the SF 44 or AF
   IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison/budget office. Supporting documentation should
   include a copy of the service members' group travel orders along with applicable
   invoices/receipts for lodging, meals, and other required support. Upon validation of the SF
   44 or AF IMT 15, the accounting liaison/budget office forwards the bills for these charges to
   the DFAS Field Site for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft incurred the
   delay.
 82                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   6.44.3. This policy does not apply to those passengers traveling on delayed KC-10 aircraft
   flying TWCF missions who are authorized per diem on their individual travel orders or in a
   space available status.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC/AFRC missions, notify 618 AOC (TACC) Logistics
Control (618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL).
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, Border Clearance,
Customs Program, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the boom operator, but the PIC retains
       ultimate responsibility. When a KC-10 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air
       traffic function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
       6.46.2.1. En route, the boom operator will distribute personal customs declarations
       (when not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and
       crewmembers. The boom operator will also brief passengers and crewmembers on
       customs regulations, and prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the
       PIC's signature.
       6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
       ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
       6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
       which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    83


     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (boom operator excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
84                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
     Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
     exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
     and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
     operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
     base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
     6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of CBP Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
         6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
            6.46.4.3.2.1. CBP Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).

                baggage.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
                observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
                certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
                not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
                representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
                officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
                media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854,
                Customs Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
                6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   85


                 representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
                 debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
                 discretionary examination of the baggage.
       6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
          6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the PIC will ensure
          all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
          6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
       6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
          6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
          6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
          civilian passengers.
              6.46.4.5.2.1. One copy of CBP Form 7507 (found at http://www.customs.gov).
       6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
          6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
          6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
              6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
              milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
              and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
              personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
              foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
              equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
              accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
 86                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on CBP Form 7507, or on forms
   provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
   board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent) to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
           6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
           sprayed.
           6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
           loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
           wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
           6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation
           after use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for
           10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify 618 AOC (TACC) or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include
   details of routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or
designated representative will:
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 87


   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew flight equipment and survival equipment have been certified
   as installed by aircrew flight equipment personnel and that configuration documents match
   mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for
   over-water missions carrying children and infants.
       6.50.3.1. Anti-Exposure Suits. Any mission scheduled to conduct operations North of 78
       degrees and South of 60 degrees is required to carry anti-exposure suits.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.       Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM aircrew flight equipment
       office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check

6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and contact the controlling C2 agency for further
instructions.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  89


responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (AFRC command center for AFRC-directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, seal
   the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by
   the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded classified
   information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.56.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized
   DoD personnel.
   6.56.3. PICs will ensure that any classified material entered or loaded into the aircraft FMS
   is zeroized prior to leaving the aircraft.
   6.56.4. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4(ground test
   assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
       6.56.4.1. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor
       cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area
       where safe passage procedures are implemented.
       6.56.4.2. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS
       for overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through
       NORAD on UHF 364.2.
       6.56.4.3. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations.
       Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
       maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
       aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable
       airspace control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
       6.56.4.4. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
       maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation
       of the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form781A).
       6.56.4.5. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate
       the Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for
 90                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local
       COMSEC managers for guidance.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF 364.2.
   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.57.1. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck.
   6.57.2. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be on the throttle quadrant during critical
   phases of flight.
6.58. Not Used.
6.59. Use of Forward Entry Ladder. Use of the forward entry ladder as an alternate means of
aircraft ingress/egress is restricted to operational necessity. Baggage will not be loaded/off-
loaded using the ladder. The ladder‘s use is normally restricted to flight crew members and
maintenance personnel only. Use of the forward entry ladder to load/unload passengers will be
at the discretion of the PIC.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   91


                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the KC-10 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM security
publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning
hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The KC-10 is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, requirements for KC-10 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a “remain over night” (RON) on
   non-secure ramps. See paragraph 7.6.1 for procedures on how to seal the aircraft.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be
present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew
pre-preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management
IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En-route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
 92                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the
   PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team’s welfare (transportation,
   lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing and aircraft
   egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
      7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
      authorities request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15, United States Air Force
      Invoice.
      7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
      remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
      the aircraft vicinity.
      7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
      and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
      FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
      considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
      practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
      their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
      requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
      The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
      protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
      nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
      appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
      7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
      duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
      7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   93


       7.6.1.3. Close and lock door (1L).
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include: aircraft wheel
   wells, center accessory compartment, forward avionics compartment, and ARO aft accessory
   compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a KC-10 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
       7.7.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
       passenger screening and carry-on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
       from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm.
          7.7.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure that thorough screenings are accomplished when
          processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
          7.7.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
          the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
          restrictions do not apply to those not required to process through the passenger
          terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
              7.7.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.2. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
              Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
              7.7.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
          7.7.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
          checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
          is not limited to baggage restrained in the cargo compartment.
          7.7.1.1.4. Brief non-exempt passengers that baggage in these areas is not to be
          accessed in-flight. If any non-exempt passenger attempts to access checked baggage
 94                                                         AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


          in-flight, land the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a military facility)
          with appropriate law enforcement personnel. Request assistance in removing the
          passenger(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law
          enforcement direction.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
      7.7.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
      aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
      weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
      tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
      the order of the troop commander or team leader.
      7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
      of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
      7.7.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
      identified on the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required”.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
      7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
      personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
      7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
      retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, dated 20 Jun 06, and 49 USC 46501
   and 49 USC 44903(e).
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   95


   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
 96                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (two
crewmembers will be armed unless directed otherwise). All crewmembers should know who is
armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                97


   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard that require arming, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a
   satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not
   be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should not normally be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated
with AMC operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local
flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF Form 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and
commanders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous
weather, complete the front side of an AF Form 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety
office. If addressing a computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF IMT 72, Air
Report (AIREP). Send your report so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For
more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF Form 657 is a tool to
report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of
AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center,
   Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety
   allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate)
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.

   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed
   AF Form 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If
   landing airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the
   Air Force base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety
   office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient
   information to prepare AF Form 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     99


8.4. AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. The
AMC Form 97 is a tool to notify appropriate authorities of any mishap involving crewmembers
or aircraft. Unless other MAJCOM guidance directs, PICs shall complete all appropriate areas of
the form in as much detail as possible. When notified, MAJCOM C2 agents will inform their
supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities IAW AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization’s people or equipment caused by PIC’s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
       8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
       flight due to medical or physiological reasons). These include:
          8.4.1.1.1. Proven or suspected case(s) of hypoxia.
          8.4.1.1.2. Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure.
          8.4.1.1.3. Decompression sickness due to evolved gas (bends, chokes,

          episode will see a flight surgeon to report the incident as soon as practical.
       8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
       8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
       suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
       failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
       penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
       substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
       report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon

  8.5.3. In addition to above (when aircraft is equipped), PIC shall download original flight
  plan to a floppy disk and turn it in to the C2 center or parent standardization and evaluation
  office.
  8.5.4. OG/CC shall send the original investigation report to the appropriate MAJCOM
  within 45 days of the event/notification.
  8.5.5. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
  for navigation errors over 24 NMs.
     8.5.5.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the PIC (or agency that receives
     initial notification) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using
     report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3.
     8.5.5.2. Include the following information in the report:
     8.5.5.3. The name and location of agency/unit submitting report.
     8.5.5.4. Affected mission identification number.
     8.5.5.5. Reference OPREPs-3 to determine type of event (i.e., state "navigation position
     error.").
     8.5.5.6. The date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., ARTCC area) of alleged infraction.
     8.5.5.7. Describe facts and circumstances. Include aircraft type and tail number, unit

  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury
  to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2
  agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the “who, what,
  when, where, why, and how” of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference.               PICs who encounter
     electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon
     as practical.

              8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so
              forth).
              8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets,
              reduced intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
              8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
              8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if
              known, otherwise state as unknown.)
              8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
              8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their
              location or distance and bearing from your location.
              8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the
              EMI, with any actions taken to resolve the problem.
              8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level
              of security clearance expert requires).
              8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
              8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
              and Duty hours).
           8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
           intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC’s
           judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
           8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
           adversaries’ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
           accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
           interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
           would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
           in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference DoDM 4140.25-M Chapter 16 for
detailed instructions. Use the U.S. Government Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement (AIR) card
for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The AIR card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                              103


aircraft, state, local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. In most
cases, there will be no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC)
contract locations.        A list of all AIR-accepting merchants can be found at
ttps://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Forms (SF) 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-
Vouc
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:        DoD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD Form 1898, Energy Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for
       purchases at other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and
       place the DD Form 1898 inside the AF Form 644. The PIC or designated representative
       shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a unique invoice along with
       the DD Form 1898, annotate the vendor’s invoice with “DUPLICATE DD FORM 1898
       ACCOMPLISHED.”
       8.6.3.2. The AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
       AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form
       and insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF IMT 664, with
       supporting forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC
       or designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
       8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
       ground services and/or other authorized products when no AIR card contract is in place.

      8.6.3.4. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of
      National Defense have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to
      use the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, when refueling at Canadian airfields with a
      Canadian National Defense Contract (CNDC). Use the AIR for fuel purchases at
      Canadian airports without a CNDC, and for ground handling services at all Canadian
      airports.
      8.6.3.5. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military airfields, including
      “replacement-in-kind” locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identaplate on
      the local form. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664,.
      8.6.3.6. DD Form 791, In-Flight Issue Log, is a tool to log in-flight off-load of fuel.
      Except for gallons transferred, fill out all blocks on the form. Use eight digit tail numbers
      for the tanker and receivers. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664 and turn it in
      IAW local procedures.
      8.6.3.7. Not Used.
      8.6.3.8. AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
      Document, records POL actions for particular airframe IAW applicable directives. The
      PIC or designated representative shall complete the form and submit to maintenance
      debrief.
      8.6.3.9. DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card.
      8.6.3.10. The PIC will verify the AFTO Form 781H is completed and turned in to
      maintenance debriefing following the mission.
      8.6.3.11. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the SF 44,
      AF IMT 664, AFTO Form 781H, DD Form 1898, and associated fuels receipts then place
      them in the AF IMT 664 (use eight digits for all USAF aircraft tail number entries). The
      PIC will transmit all AF IMT 664 information via phone, fax, or message if mission
      causes him/her to be off-station past the last day of the month.
      8.6.3.12. Boom operators will:
         8.6.3.12.1. Use Air Mobility Command Air Refueling Tracker (AMCART) as the
         system of record for fuel offloaded. Accurate AMCART entries are required to
         ensure proper reimbursement for fuel transferred by the tanker unit. Boom operators
         obtain receiver information from the flying schedule prior to flight, verbally/visually
         during flight, or by any means following the flight prior to submitting an AMCART
         entry. In the event of an erroneous tail number given by the receiver in flight, the
         Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) table of US aircraft and
         FMS aircraft can be used to source the required information. In the event a DD Form
         791 is required, collect all pertinent information, to include receiver aircraft MDS,
         unit of assignment, and home station. File the DD Form 791 with post mission
         documentation. NOTE: Boom operators may submit an incomplete DD Form 791
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    105


        only after exhausting all means to obtain the required data. In those cases, boom
        operators must include a brief explanation as to why the data is missing. Unit
        commanders will develop a local procedure to collect required information prior to
        final processing of DD Form 791.
        8.6.3.12.2. Prior to fuel off-load, get receiver aircraft’s eight-digit tail number (use
        interphone radio, boom interphone, or visually if open communication would
        compromise mission during clandestine or covert operations or threaten safety of
        flight. NOTE: EMCON 2 or 3 training does not disqualify inter-plane radio to
        obtain or verify AR data. Do not use inter-plane radios during actual EMCON 2, 3,
        or 4 to obtain or verify AR data unless specifically authorized by the mission
        directive. Consider HAVE QUICK II and secure voice if visual conditions make the
        tail number too difficult to read.
        8.6.3.12.3. Do not use “known/suspected” aircraft serial number that belongs to the
        unit being fueled in lieu of the actual aircraft being fueled. Auditors compare
        receiver unit aircraft serial numbers with fuel load reports at home station. If
        “known/suspected” aircraft tail number billed is incorrect (in maintenance/unable to
        fly), the auditor will reject the fuel bill and the tanker unit is liable for the cost of the
        fuel transferred.
        8.6.3.12.4. Comply with locally established procedures to complete DD Form 791
        for classified in-flight refuelings.
     8.6.3.13. Flight Engineers will accurately record fueling actions on the AFTO Form
     781H, AF Form 4091, Flight Engineers Worksheet, and AF IMT 664. When available,
     record receiver refueling information (i.e., tail number, unit of assignment, and home
     station.)
     8.6.3.14. Maintenance technicians will:
        8.6.3.14.1. Prior to off-station mission or deployment, obtain sufficient fuels
        transaction forms to complete the mission/deployment. Unless directed otherwise by
        the PIC, accurately complete all ground refueling/de-fueling documents and place
        them inside the AF IMT 664.
     8.6.3.15. Wing scheduling will:
        8.6.3.15.1. Provide a member to the AVPOL advisory group.
        8.6.3.15.2. By the 7th of each month, prepare monthly report for invoice control
        officer (ICO). Include organization (squadron), MDS, programmed flying hours for
        previous and current months in the report.
        8.6.3.15.3. Include receivers’ MDS, command of assignment, unit or squadron, and
        home station name (for each in-flight refueling sortie) on the weekly schedule.
        8.6.3.15.4. Compose and transmit classified messages for classified in-flight
        refuelings to HQ AMC/A4REP IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
        8.6.3.15.5. Maintain the wing’s current master list of receiver unit POCs and
        telephone numbers.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty
   bomb,” is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   initial radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a
   nuclear detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
112                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD.
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
      landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
      engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors and
      hatches, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover
      on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack is a missile
      attack, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or
      follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) or Joint Service Aircrew Mask
      (JSAM) “above the shoulder” equipment and the CWU-66/P Aircrew Chemical
      Ensemble (ACE). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask,
      C2 series canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment,
      boots, and gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and
      biological agents. They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or
      nuclear detonation. The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing"
      procedures and Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the
      Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-
      2A series mask.
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                113


         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
     to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
     and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
     zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection; seal
     windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems, and use room above the first floor when
     possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
     10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
     practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
     measures.
     10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful in-flight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
         contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DoD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
     10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
     Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
     method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
 114                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
       environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
       the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
       flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
       exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
       or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
       through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, in-flight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
   (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as
   medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential
   radiological hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman’s Manual (AFPAM 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   “yellow” or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    115


   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
 116                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
   full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A
   more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological,
   Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

NOTES:
1. If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing personal body
armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  117


3. Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not exceed
1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for
at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will vary ±¼ quart/ hour.
4. NL=no limit to work time per hour.

   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
       may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
       with agent residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Table 10 2. Shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
       10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
       case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
       phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                            Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute
KC-10 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in
AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid
equipment capability are rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, crews must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the maximum
       extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, follow the
       communications failure procedures published in the FIH.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
guidance). US Military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their
airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
   11.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas.
   Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.
   Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
   provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by
   the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
   11.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders
   or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of
   the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
 120                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   11.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry point(s).
   11.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.2.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.2.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and will not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2
   and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
   Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due regard.
11.3. Navigation Databases. Separate navigational databases are used for flight planning and
in-flight navigation in the KC-10. Navigation databases are updated on a 28-day cycle.
   11.3.1. Flight Planning Navigation Database. Flight plans created using the Advanced
   Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) or the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) use
   navigation data from the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). Pilots are
   responsible for ensuring the accuracy of flight plan waypoints against current aeronautical
   charts, terminal instrument procedures, or FLIP documents (i.e. AP/1B). These flight plans
   may be saved to a PCMCIA card and loaded directly into the FMS using the FMS data
   loader.
   11.3.2. Aircraft Navigation Database. The FMS uses a navigation database provided by a
   commercial vendor, Jeppesen. This database is stored on a PCMCIA card that is uploaded
   into the FMS prior to flight for aircraft with an FMS-800. The Jeppesen database is stored in
   FMS memory for aircraft modified with the CNS/ATM avionics. (NOTE: Loading/updating
   the Jeppesen database in CNS/ATM modified aircraft is a maintenance function). When a
   terminal area procedure (departure procedure, STAR, instrument approach procedure) will be
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  121


   flown using FMS as the sole source of navigation information, the procedure to be flown
   must be retrieved in its entirety from the aircraft database and the database must be current.
       11.3.2.1. All waypoint data retrieved from the aircraft navigation database will be
       verified IAW paragraph 6.15.2.1.
           11.3.2.1.1. DELETED
           11.3.2.1.2. DELETED
           11.3.2.1.3. DELETED
       11.3.2.2. In some cases, waypoints in the database may differ from the charted
       instrument procedure. Differences less than 0.3nm are acceptable for GPS overlay
       approaches. For stand-alone GPS and RNAV approaches, the maximum allowable
       difference is 0.1nm. If distance information varies by more than these tolerances, the
       procedure shall not be flown. Variation between charted final approach course in the
       instrument approach procedure and the final approach course computed by the aircraft
       should be no more than 5 degrees. If the two differ by more than 5 degrees, the
       procedure is not authorized.
11.4. Oceanic Flight. Maintaining situational awareness during oceanic flight is essential to the
safe conduct of the flight. Situational awareness includes, but is not limited to, positional
awareness and accurate fuel updates. This requires due diligence on the part of all aircrew
members.
   11.4.1. Oceanic Plotting Charts.
       11.4.1.1. Prior to flight, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate chart.
       Annotate the chart with the mission number, PIC‘s name, preparer‘s name, and date. If
       practical, chart may be reused.
       11.4.1.2. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately upon entering the Category I
       Route or over-water segment. Perform a gross error check using available NAVAIDS
       and annotate the position and time on the chart.
       11.4.1.3. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I route, recheck coordinates
       for the next two waypoints.
       11.4.1.4. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot
       the aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
       tolerances.
       11.4.1.5. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart.
       11.4.1.6. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
       computer flight plans to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the charts, computer flight
       plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 3 months.
   11.4.2. Computer Flight Plans.
       11.4.2.1. Aircrews provided with winded flight plans should load planned winds from
       the CFP into the FMS. For Category I routing, aircrews will load planned winds in the
 122                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       FMS. Small changes (less than 30 degree direction change and/or 15 knots wind speed)
       need not be entered for every leg.
   11.4.3. In addition to reviewing AP2, all aircrews planning to operate in Atlantic Oceanic
   airspace will conduct a detailed review of the North Atlantic Minimum Navigation
   Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace operations manual and review the associated
   FIR Oceanic NOTAMS.
       11.4.3.1. In the event that conflicting information is discovered between FLIP and the
       MNPS manual, the MNPS manual takes precedence.
   11.4.4. During mission planning for all oceanic sectors, crews are required to calculate an
   ETP.       Guidance on calculating an ETP can be found on the Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation AF Portal web page in the flight planning section. See paragraph
   14.4.8.3.1
11.5. Navigation Capability. NOTE: Unless otherwise stated below, paragraphs 11.5.1
through 11.5.7 apply to both KC-10 FMS-800 equipped aircraft and those modified with the
CNS/ATM avionics.
   11.5.1. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM). Airspace where RVSM is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type
   must be approved for operations in these areas. The KC-10 is approved for unrestricted use
   in RVSM airspace. Always refer to the appropriate Area Planning (AP) publication for
   specific theatre RVSM requirements. In addition to the requirements established in the
   applicable AP publication, always comply with the following when operating in RVSM
   airspace:
       11.5.1.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. Request a new clearance to avoid this
       airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       11.5.1.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       11.5.1.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.           Record
       readings of both altimeters.
       11.5.1.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree within 200
       feet.
       11.5.1.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       11.5.1.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
       11.5.1.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.
       11.5.1.8. In the North Atlantic Region, Minimum Navigation Performance Specification
       (MNPS) airspace is a subdivision of RVSM airspace. Refer to the MNPS manual and
       FLIP AP/2 for detailed requirements when operating in MNPS airspace.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                123


  11.5.2. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
  is considered special qualification airspace and can be determined by referencing the
  applicable theatre AP publication. The PIC is responsible for a thorough review of the
  aircraft forms and maintenance logs to ascertain the status of RNP equipment. During flight,
  immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RNP airspace
  and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms, malfunctions or failures of
  RNP required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
     11.5.2.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10 NM of actual
     position 95% of the time. KC-10 aircraft may operate in RNP-10 without time
     limitations. If the capability to update the internal navigation solution with the GPS is
     lost, or if receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is lost, the aircraft is limited
     to 6.2 hours of planned operation in MNPS RNP-10 airspace or 5 hours of planned
     operation in any other RNP-10 airspace after the GPS or RAIM is degraded.
         11.5.2.1.1. DELETED
     11.5.2.2. RNP-4. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 4 NM of actual
     position 95% of the time. KC-10 aircraft may operate in RNP-4 without time limitations.
     If the capability to update the internal navigation solution with the GPS is lost, or if
     receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is lost, the aircraft is limited to 2 hours
     of planned operation in RNP-4 airspace after the GPS or RAIM is degraded.
     11.5.2.3. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP-10 (or RNP-4)
     must be operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished
     to identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes.
     Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation
     performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
  11.5.3. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV). The KC-10 is approved for BRNAV operations.
  BRNAV is defined as RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-5 for operations under IFR in
  that European airspace designated for BRNAV/RNP-5 operations. When operating in
  BRNAV airspace, pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails,
  or if unable to meet BRNAV tolerances. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or
  failures of RNP required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV
  tolerances.
     11.5.3.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is one INS capable of
     updates with an approved FMS system. If the capability to update the internal navigation
     solution with the GPS is lost, or if receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is
     lost, the aircraft is limited to 2 hours of planned operation in BRNAV airspace after the
     GPS or RAIM is degraded. Flights entering BRNAV airspace after long overwater flight
     must be especially aware of BRNAV tolerances and update accordingly. Refer to FLIP
     AP/2 for additional requirements.
  11.5.4. Precision Area Navigation (PRNAV). Although the KC-10 is approved for PRNAV
  operations, there is currently no training program in effect for KC-10 aircrews. KC-10 crews
  are not approved to file or fly any procedure requiring PRNAV.
124                                                   AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


  11.5.5. RNAV1/RNAV2. FMS-800 equipped KC-10 aircraft are not approved for RNAV 1
  or RNAV 2 operations. KC-10 aircraft modified with CNS/ATM avionics operated by
  certified aircrews may operate unrestricted on RNAV1 and RNAV2 routings.
  11.5.6. FM Immunity (FMI). The KC-10 is equipped with dual FMI VHF navigation
  receivers and is considered fully compliant and will follow normal procedures. Refer to the
  applicable Area Planning series for more information concerning FMI operations.
  11.5.7. PICs will ensure that aircraft RNAV capabilities are correctly annotated on filed
  flight plans IAW FLIP GP. As a minimum, include the following:
      11.5.7.1. In Block 10 of the DD 1801 include "SDFGHIRTUWXY/S" for FMS-800
      equipped aircraft and “SDE1E2GHIJ4J5RTUWXY/SB1D1” for CNS/ATM modified
      aircraft.
      11.5.7.2. In Block 18 of the DD 1801 include:
         11.5.7.2.1. "PBN/A1B1S1" for   FMS-800       equipped               aircraft    and
         “A1B2B5C2D2L1O2S1” for CNS/ATM modified aircraft.
         11.5.7.2.2. "NAV/RNVE99" for  FMS-800          equipped             aircraft    and
         “NAV/RNVD1E2A1” for CNS/ATM modified aircraft.

                                           Chapter 12

    FLIGHT ENGINEER / AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General: This chapter contains flight engineer procedures not contained in the flight
manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the pilot in command for all
inspections and procedures required by the applicable technical orders and regulations.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X
and qualified maintenance personnel are not available to clear it, the highest qualified flight
engineer on scene may obtain authorization to sign off the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members
are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear Red Xs for
engine covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR drains when qualified maintenance personnel are
not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. The flight engineer is qualified and
authorized to accomplish these duties when maintenance personnel are not available. This policy
is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home station. The
applicable refueling and de-fueling checklists will be used during all refueling and de-fueling
operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft commander will designate
other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. A flight engineer may assist the normal
maintenance function when critical taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not
impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. WARNING: Do not
load/off-load cargo containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during fuel
servicing operations.
   12.4.1. Fuel Servicing Operations. Unless servicing JP-4, simultaneous servicing of fuel
   while loading passengers, cargo, performing maintenance, aircrew members performing
   inspections, or operating aircraft systems is considered to be a normal fuel servicing
   operation. If refueling/defueling with JP-4 Concurrent Servicing operations are required
   IAW TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Aircrew
   members qualified in ground refueling may perform fuel servicing duties. Aircrews will only
   refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be
   delayed.
       12.4.1.1. When aircrew members are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
       refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and
       applicable T.O. 1C-10(K)A-2 series T.O.s. Two other aircrew members are required to
       assist in the refueling, one for safety duties and the other to act as fire guard. Four total
       will be required when the right wing SPR is inoperative and refueling must be
       accomplished from the flight engineer's panel.
       12.4.1.2. Designate a current and qualified aircrew member to remain on the flight deck
       to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request for emergency assistance on
       a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to an emergency response team
       anytime aircrew members are in the aircraft and fuel servicing is being conducted. The
       PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an emergency.
126                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      12.4.1.3. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will
      remain open and stairs in place. Fuel servicing is limited to the right side. Close and arm
      all doors except the open entry door. If entry door is closed due to inclement weather, do
      not arm. Stairs shall remain in place.
      12.4.1.4. With passengers on board a current and qualified aircrew member will be
      designated the passenger compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor
      passengers during fuel servicing operations. PCMs will not perform other duties during
      fuel servicing.
      12.4.1.5. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions, and
      hazards. Passengers will remain seated except for brief physiological needs, but will not
      wear seat belts. When possible, conduct this briefing prior to fuel servicing. If fuel
      servicing is in progress, the briefing will be given immediately after boarding.
      12.4.1.6. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the express
      purpose of loading for departure or off-loading upon arrival. Boarding or exiting must be
      opposite of fuel servicing operations. Once onboard, except for emergencies, passengers
      shall not deplane once fuel servicing commences.
      12.4.1.7. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
      12.4.1.8. The PIC, or designated maintenance/aircrew representative will advise PCMs
      when to evacuate passengers.
      12.4.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
      environment.
      12.4.1.10. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing operations:
         12.4.1.10.1. Electric and electronic equipment may be on and operated to include
         operations performed by aircrew members during required inspections with the
         following exceptions:
             12.4.1.10.1.1. Pull circuit breakers for Radar Altimeters.      TACANs must be
             turned off.
             12.4.1.10.1.2. Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
             12.4.1.10.1.3. IFF/SIF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned
             off.
             12.4.1.10.1.4. FMS/INU may be “on” and may be updated. Do not turn on or off
             during refuel operations.
             12.4.1.10.1.5. Radio operations are authorized. EXCEPTION: Use of HF radios
             is prohibited.
             12.4.1.10.1.6. Do not reset circuit breakers during fuel servicing operations.
      12.4.1.11. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100
      capabilities. AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency
      conditions. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to
      support transient aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the
      following:
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                  127


           12.4.1.11.1. De-fuel the aircraft prior to flight.
           12.4.1.11.2. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry stating “Caution: Aircraft refueled
           using JP-8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.”
   12.4.2. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
   conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235,
   Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations.
12.5. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). The PIC is responsible
for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified maintenance
specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent
mission taskings.
   12.5.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       12.5.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.5.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
       12.5.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       12.5.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       12.5.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       12.5.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       12.5.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   12.5.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   12.5.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
12.6. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. The flight engineer will complete AFTO Form
18, Structural Assessment Record, on every flight. The AFTO Form 18 documents usage data
for the KC-10A Individual Airplane Tracking Program (IATP). IATP determines the current and
projected structural status of each individual KC-10A and provides information for fleet
management; TCTO modifications, inspections, structural maintenance actions and structural
condition.
   12.6.1. Use the following guidance and the abbreviated instructions on the form. This is a
   machine readable document utilizing an optical mark reading system. Do not use
   reproductions of the form to record flight information. Use a number 2 or softer pencil,
   darkening responses completely. Do not use ink or make stray marks outside of the
   REMARKS section. Do not staple or punch holes. The 1C-10(K)A-101 is obsolete,
   disregard reference to this technical order on the AFTO Form 18.
       12.6.1.1. Segment Types.

         Receiver types and number of contacts made ARE recorded.
         12.6.1.1.7. OFFD (FUEL OFFLOAD VIA CENTER LINE DROGUE/WING PODS)
         - KC-10A operating as a tanker. Receiver types and number of contacts made ARE
         recorded.
         12.6.1.1.8. P (PATTERN/PRACTICE) - This segment includes touch & go practice
         (T&G), fullstop-taxi-back and engine-running-crew change landings (FS), missed
         approach practice and aborted approaches (A). The total number of T&G's, FS's,
         and/or A's are recorded in this segment type. Low altitude-cruise and traffic-holding-
         pattern operations are recorded in this segment; however, NO ENTRIES are made in
         T&G, FS, or A.
      12.6.1.2. Segment Guidelines
         12.6.1.2.1. The first segment starts at brake release and will be a climb (CL) or
         pattern /practice (P). Speed and altitude are not required for the climb.
         12.6.1.2.2. The last segment will be a descent (D) or pattern/practice (P).
         12.6.1.2.3. Time spent in a traffic/holding pattern is a pattern/practice (P).
         12.6.1.2.4. In-flight change-of-altitude (climb or descent) beyond an adjacent altitude
         band, as well as take-off climb and penetration descent, should be entered as CL or D.
         12.6.1.2.5. A fuel on-load segment begins when the KC10A is stabilized in the astern
         position, and ends when the KC-10A departs from the tanker aircraft.
         12.6.1.2.6. The off-load segment begins when the first receiver is stabilized in the
         astern position, and ends when the last receiver departs from the KC-10A.
         12.6.1.2.7. A pattern/practice segment begins when the KC-10A enters the traffic-
         pattern for a planned practice (or unplanned with similar actions), reaches the altitude
         for a low altitude-cruise, or is halted in a traffic-holding pattern.
         12.6.1.2.8. A flight consisting of more than eight segments is continued on another
         form.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 129


           12.6.1.2.9. On continuation pages, Blocks 1, 3, 4, and 5 are filled out along with
           segment blocks as required. Blocks 3, 4, and 5 should be the same on all forms for a
           given flight.
           12.6.1.2.10. A new flight is defined and a new form must be completed when
           cargo/fuel are on or off-loaded on the ground, more than one hour elapses between
           landing and subsequent takeoff, or anytime engines are shut down.
       12.6.1.3. Block 15. Receiver type and total number of contacts, wet or dry, made with
       each type. Record method as LP (left pod), B (boom), C (centerline drogue) or RP (right
       pod). Use Block 15 on any or every form as required. Do not enter the modified mission
       symbol (e.g., the "R" in RF-4), except for cases shown below. For AV-8, enter A-008.
       Enter receiver type only as follows. If the receiver is not listed, select a boom or drogue
       example and include actual type in REMARKS. See Table 12.1
       12.6.1.4. REMARKS. Enter name & rank, duty AF base, duty phone, and mission
       number on each form. Enter receiver type if not listed. Track WARP cycles for the left
       and right pods separately and report at maintenance debriefing. The definition of a cycle
       is: fully extending and fully retracting the pod hose. Multiple contacts may be made in
       the interim period between extending and retracting the hose without logging additional
       cycles.
   12.6.2. Complete any open items after landing. Turn in completed forms after each flight or
   upon return to the home station. The Chief Flight Engineer or designated representative will
   review completed forms. Each Monday, forward the past week‘s completed forms to OC-
   ALC/TILO, Attn: KC-10 7851 2nd St. Bldg 3, Tinker AFB, OK, 73145-9145.

effort to record engine performance data on every sortie. Deliver engine coupons to debriefing
as soon as possible (not to exceed 7 days) or faxed in the case of extended missions. Insure
coupons are hand-carried to home station when returning from depot modifications or
maintenance input.
   12.7.1. The primary method of KC-10 engine performance monitoring is the EGT
   divergence method. This compares EGT from one engine to another on the same aircraft
   using number 2 engine as the baseline. Data may be collected with the boom and drogue
   deployed as long as airspeeds remain stable, no climbs or descents are initiated, and the
   receiver is no closer than pre-contact. Discontinue procedure any time safety would be
   compromised.
   12.7.2. Instructions for engine performance monitoring:
       12.7.2.1. Auto throttles off. If possible, allow power to stabilize for 5 minutes.
       12.7.2.2. N1 RPMs aligned to within 0.3% of each other, at not less than 89%.
       12.7.2.3. Stabilized cruise, power stabilized; light turbulence is permissible.
       12.7.2.4. Altitude: 20,000 feet or greater. Above FL 270 is optimum.
       12.7.2.5. Mach: 0.70 or greater.
       12.7.2.6. Record at least one coupon per flight. Two is preferred on long flights.
   12.7.3. Record the following data:
       12.7.3.1. Air Force Serial Number (not tail number).
       12.7.3.2. Zulu date readings are taken.
       12.7.3.3. Zulu time readings are taken.
       12.7.3.4. Flight engineer’s name.
       12.7.3.5. Altitude / 1000.
       12.7.3.6. Total Air Temperature to the closest °C. Ensure positive or negative sign is
       recorded.
       12.7.3.7. Mach: All 3 numbers, within +.001.
       12.7.3.8. Flight engineer‘s flying squadron.
       12.7.3.9. N1 to closest +0.1%.
       12.7.3.10. EGT to the closest degree.
       12.7.3.11. N2 to closest +0.1%.
       12.7.3.12. Fuel flow to nearest 10pph.
       12.7.3.13. Oil pressure to nearest psi.
       12.7.3.14. Bleed configuration (normal is packs on).
       12.7.3.15. Anti-ice configuration (normal is engine and wing anti-ice off).
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                      131


       12.7.3.16. Remarks/Abnormal Configuration: Record non-standard configurations,
       boom and drogue deployed, slats extended, turbulence, alternate method, etc.
   12.7.4. If an indicator becomes erratic or inoperative, record the best estimate of data. Circle
   the estimate and document discrepancy on the form and AFTO Form 781A.
   12.7.5. Alternate method.       If the primary conditions cannot be met, use this alternate
   method.
       12.7.5.1. May be accomplished at any altitude and airspeed/Mach.
       12.7.5.2. Auto throttles must be off. Allow power to stabilize for 1 - 3 minutes.
       12.7.5.3. Align N1 RPMs to within 0.3% of each other.
       12.7.5.4. Record only N1 and EGT.
       12.7.5.5. Fill in all heading information.
       12.7.5.6. Compare EGT data with the engine EGT comparison sheet.
   12.7.6. EGT comparison. EGT is the primary indication of CF-6 engine operating condition.
   Since EGT will never shift downward (unless caused by an instrument error), enter any
   upward shift of more than +15°C in the AFTO Form 781A. For example, if the EGT
   comparison page in the aircraft forms indicates engine #1: +13°C, engine #2: baseline, and
   engine #3: +6°C, then the maximum EGT for the #1 engine is baseline plus 28°C, and the
   maximum EGT for the #3 engine is baseline plus 21°C. Readings above these maximum
   values require a 781A entry. If a shift of more than +15°C is identified (a downward shift of
   both wing engines may indicate a problem with engine #2), confirm by another reading taken
   at a different power setting & altitude. If confirmed, immediately report the condition to
   home station for guidance.
       12.7.6.1. EGT comparison sheets are maintained in each aircraft. Maintenance updates
       this sheet every 60 days based on the engine monitoring data received.
12.8. Performance Data Computations. TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1 is the source for all performance
computations. Use AF Form 4089 or an approved electronic takeoff and landing data (TOLD)
worksheet. Compute TOLD using TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1 or electronically on an HQ AMC
approved KC-10 TOLD calculator. Data is computed (manual or electronic) by the flight
engineer and checked by another current and qualified pilot or flight engineer. Check data using
TO 1C-10(K)A-1-1, TO 1C-10(K)A-1CL-2 tab data or KC-10A Performance Data Computer
(slipstick). If electronic data is found to be out of limits, not due to a data entry error, complete a
manual TOLD card.
   12.8.1. TOLD Check Limits. TOLD verification limits are: speeds +/- 3 KIAS; N1 settings
   +/- 0.3%; distances +/- 500 feet. Critical field length must be equal to or less than runway
   available. Landing distance must be equal to or less than runway length.
   12.8.2. KC-10A Performance Data Computer (Slip Stick). KC-10 Slip Stick tabulated data
   is authorized for use to verify takeoff performance calculations and to compute landing
   speeds, minimum air refueling speeds and other inflight data.
 132                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   12.8.3. Fixed Flap Takeoffs. Fixed flap takeoffs, at 15 or 22 degrees, may be executed for
   initial or full-stop taxi backs from a main operating base. Use optimum flap procedures at all
   other fields.
       12.8.3.1. Compute an optimum flap takeoff setting for the given conditions.
       12.8.3.2. A fixed flap takeoff may be executed if the 15- or 22-degree flap line for the
       Takeoff Gross Weight (TOGW) falls below the Runway Available Limiting Weight
       (RALW) and Climb Gradient Limiting Weight (CGLW) lines (sheet 3 tree chart of TO
       1C-10[K]A-1-1), and the TOGW is less than Maximum Takeoff Gross Weight
       (MTOGW). Use fixed flap setting for all performance computations.
12.9. In-Flight Fuel Management/Monitoring. Fuel consumption will be monitored by
comparing actual to predicted fuel remaining on the flight plan.
   12.9.1. At a minimum, consumption comparisons will be accomplished:
       12.9.1.1. As soon as practical after initial level off; record fuel total, compare to
       predicted total.
       12.9.1.2. Prior to and after each AAR.
       12.9.1.3. During over-water cruise at intervals not to exceed 1.5 hours.
       12.9.1.4. Any time aircraft performance is critical or marginal.
   12.9.2. Fuel monitoring may be discontinued at the discretion of the aircraft commander
   when all of the following conditions have been met:
       12.9.2.1. All AARs have been completed.
       12.9.2.2. The equal time point has been crossed (over-water missions).
       12.9.2.3. The fuel systems and quantity indicators are functioning normally.
       12.9.2.4. There is obvious extra fuel and the + FUEL trend is favorable.
12.10. General Navigation Duties. The flight engineer performs navigation duties using the
FMS. FMS operations may include waypoint loading, updating navigation information for the
various modes of FMS operation, extraction of coordinates from maps for loading into
navigation equipment (e.g. revised AR tracks), recording of latitude and longitudinal coordinates
during AR or emergencies, and use of computer flight plans to maintain a fuel "how goes it" log
when required.
   12.10.1. Mission Planning. The flight engineer assists the pilots in extracting data from
   maps and charts, plotting headings or TACAN and VOR radials, determining wind factors,
   and mission timing.
   12.10.2. Preflight. Time permitting; the flight engineer may load the flight plan into the
   FMS.
   12.10.3. In-Flight. Use the FMS to check flight progress and fuel status at pre-selected
   points along the route of flight. The flight engineer will take an active role in maintaining
   awareness of aircraft location and position along the flight path. This includes assisting
   pilots in loading and verifying new or updated waypoints. Use the FMS to determine time,
   distance, and fuel requirements for all in-flight diversions. The #3 FMS may be used to
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                133


   monitor mission progress in relation to required AR start, end AR, and abort points during
   receiver deploy and re-deployment missions.
12.11. Not Used.
12.12. Weight and Balance. The flight engineer assists the boom operator by positioning fuel
to satisfy ballast requirements for cargo loading operations. The flight engineer has sole
responsibility for aircraft weight and balance after DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance
Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical, is completed and the aircraft is ready for flight. The
flight engineer is responsible for completion of DD Form 365-4, in the absence of a qualified
boom operator.
   12.12.1. Center of Gravity (CG) Computations. CG will be computed and tracked using the
   Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) and ZFW CG provided by the boom operator using AF Form 4087,
   KC-10 CG Graph and AF Form 4088, KC-10 Weight and Balance Fuel Vectors.
12.13. In-Flight Troubleshooting. Flight engineers may accomplish minor troubleshooting in-
flight. However, flight crews will not, nor will they allow, maintenance personnel to perform in-
flight maintenance to include indiscriminately pulling circuit breakers or de-powering aircraft
systems, swapping components, or any other actions that could jeopardize safety of flight.

                        CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The boom operator coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal
operations or the shipping agency; plans loads; provides in-flight services to passengers; and
supervises onloading or off-loading operations.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations:
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required),
       computing load distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled
       departure. Before starting loading operations, they will advise the boom operator of
       destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper
       positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading,
       and assign sufficient aerial port loading personnel for cargo loading. Aerial port
       personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment (MHE) and
       cargo to or from the aircraft cargo door. Under the supervision of the boom operator,
       aerial port personnel will prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading equipment if the
       aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft, tie down cargo and equipment,
       release tie down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The boom operator is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as
       required), certifying load plans, preparing weight and balance documentation, completing
       all required load/tipping computations, operating aircraft equipment, and supervising
       cargo tie down. The boom operator coordinates with the loading crew supervisor to
       validate the cargo against manifests, supervises and directs on/offloading and is
       responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. The boom operator
       will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading personnel are injured or
       cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during on/offloading. The
       boom operator will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo prior to engine start. Boom
       operator’s may be required to assist maintenance personnel to configure the aircraft for
       IAU on/offloading.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft boom
       operator and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval through Stan/Eval channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. EXCEPTION: The boom operator may
       deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo and to alleviate
       unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration without submitting documentation. The boom
       operator must take into consideration the next station’s cargo configuration requirements
       and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and balance, zone and tipping limits. A
       new load plan is not required.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    135


      13.2.1.4. The boom operator is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo
      for airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require
      the boom operator to use his/her best judgment based on training, experience, and
      knowledge to determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When
      difficulties arise, they should seek the advice of other personnel (i.e., squadron, group,
      wing or MAJCOM Stan/Eval personnel).
          13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment that exceed limitations and is not
          contained in the aircraft loading manuals requires certification for air shipment. The
          shipper will provide a copy of the certification to the boom operator prior to loading.
          If the certification letter with loading instructions/requirements is not provided to the
          boom operator the cargo will not be loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test
          Loading Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail
          (937) 255-2330/2547 or MAJCOM Stan/Eval for questions concerning cargo
          certification.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE
   for on/offloading. Boom operator responsibilities and authority are the same as described in
   paragraphs 13.2.1.2. and 13.2.1.3.
   13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
   airlift missions (SAAM), and USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the boom operator
   can accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as valid pre-inspection of
   equipment being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspector
   signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable loading
   checklist. However, this does not relieve the boom operator from ensuring accompanying
   loads are secured prior to takeoff. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document
   preparation of hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper’s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   13.3.1. There must be a reasonable degree of access to the rear of the aircraft, and
   passengers and troops must have ready access to emergency exits. Load aircraft in such a
   manner that allows for movement from the flight deck to the ARO compartment and access
   to cargo for firefighting.
   13.3.2. To assist in emergency evacuation of passengers, extra crew members or
   maintenance personnel knowledgeable of emergency evacuation procedures will occupy a
   seat in the row adjacent to doors 1 L/R and 2 L/R (with IAU installed) which provide
   immediate access to door controls, for all takeoffs and landings. Passengers who meet the
   criteria in paragraph 13.4.2.4 may be used if extra crewmembers or maintenance personnel
   are not available. They will be briefed on emergency evacuation procedures/duties IAW
   Section II of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1. NOTE: All passenger hand carried items must be of a size
   to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the safety aisle(s). Any items that do not fit under a
   seat, or obstruct an aisle way will be stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.3. When in Configuration Code J, no cargo or passengers (N/A MEP) will be carried.
   This is a modified Code D configuration with all four IAU seat pallets removed but Z Lav,
 136                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   IAU storage, track mounted seats, emergency oxygen and exit signs still installed. NOTE:
   Configuration Code J will only be used on local sorties.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions:
       13.4.1.1. The boom operator will coordinate with aerial port personnel to establish
       loading times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence of
       events will be established, with PIC coordination, before the boom operator enters crew
       rest. Loading time is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures
       (bulk, palletized, etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload
       levels. When reporting for duty, the boom operator checks in with the air terminal
       operations center or other designated location to obtain load brief and assist in load
       planning as required.
          13.4.1.1.1. Not Used.
          13.4.1.1.2. Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) on/off load operations are not authorized
          for KC-10 aircraft.
       13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. A consolidated
       statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
       available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
       cargo listing or load plan with transportation control numbers (TCN) will accompany the
       load.
       13.4.1.3. Tiedown equipment will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
       possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist.
       13.4.1.4. Fleet Service Checklist.
          13.4.1.4.1. Boom operators will make every effort to ensure that the AF IMT 4128,
          Fleet Service Checklist, is signed by the fleet service representative and placed aboard
          the aircraft prior to departure.
          13.4.1.4.2. Annotate inventory changes in section III. Place item nomenclature,
          increase/decrease amounts, station, date, and reason for change.
   13.4.2. Passenger Missions: Maximize seat availability on all missions. The fold-down
   observer seat on the flight deck is not normally considered an available seat; the PIC is the
   final authority when releasing this seat for crew or passenger use.
       13.4.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or airfield management personnel manifest
       passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
          13.4.2.1.1. Whenever the aircraft is configured with an increased accommodation
          unit (IAU), ensure that all latch pawls, anti-rattle handles, ramps, and electrical
          connections are serviceable and in their proper configurations.
          13.4.2.1.2. When planning any KC-10 mission that includes more than ten
          passengers, a dedicated baggage pallet is required. Floor loading of passenger
          baggage is not authorized. Floor loading of small amounts of crew baggage,
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                137


        professional gear, meals, water jug or medical litters, etc., as detailed in T.O. 1C-
        10(K)A-9 is authorized.
        13.4.2.1.3. Seat belt extensions are approved for use in the KC-10 and are available
        at various passenger service terminals. Tie-down straps will not be used to restrain
        passengers in aircraft seats. If a passenger is unable to secure his/her seatbelt, notify
        passenger service immediately to determine if a seat belt extension is available. The
        aircraft will not move unless all passengers are secured. PICs will not allow
        passengers to fly unless they can be seated in the seat with seat cushions installed and
        seat belts securely fastened.
     13.4.2.2. The PIC and boom operator are responsible for ensuring all passengers are
     properly manifested.
     13.4.2.3. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity it may be necessary
     for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this
     capability. These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring
     visa/passport requirements are met. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-
     hijack-processing is completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and
     Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO). Do not hesitate to contact 618 AOC
     (TACC)/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center (APCC); DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial;
     618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as who may travel to specific locations or
     pass-port/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other MAJCOMs which have
     operational C2 over that aircraft will contact the appropriate AMOCC for specific details.
     File a copy of the DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, with the flight plan. If not filed
     with the flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-
     202V3.
     13.4.2.4. A passenger service representative or crewmember will assist passengers at the
     bottom of the steps/stairs, and the boom operator will assist in seating passengers. DVs,
     passengers requiring assistance, and families should be boarded first to minimize
     separation. Make every effort to seat families together. Ensure that only adult, English
     speaking, physically capable, and willing passengers are seated next to emergency exits.
     Do not seat mothers with infants or children under 15 years old in seats adjacent to
     emergency exits. Passengers occupying these seats will be briefed on emergency
     evacuation procedures/duties IAW Section II of T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1.
     13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
     has the option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation-
     approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
     AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
     passengers (duty and space-A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own
     seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing
     the use of an ICS at the sponsors discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial)
     standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest child
     restraints.
        13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to the seat
        using the seat belt. Adults will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the
        event of turbulence or emergency landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be
 138                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


          secured in an ICS. To prevent blocking an exit route, the ICS should not be used in
          an aisle seat.
       13.4.2.6. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a passenger with disabilities for
       flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility
       or acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances,
       chronology, names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A4T. For time sensitive problems, telephone
       HQ AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 AOC (TACC)/APCC.
       13.4.2.7. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
       In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with CRG
       or deploying unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
       13.4.2.8. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101 V15,
       Military Airlift—Baggage Service. The boom operator will ensure ATOC provides a
       copy of the AMC Form 70, RUSH Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH
       baggage.
       13.4.2.9. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and
       returned to the flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF IMT
       3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt, is received from fleet service to relieve
       the boom operator of meal accountability.
       13.4.2.10. Pillow and Blanket Distribution. Hand out pillows and blankets only when
       requested by passengers. At enroute locations, leave used pillows and blankets on seats
       for thru-load passengers. Do not mix used and unused pillows and blankets.
       13.4.2.11. Air stairs will be utilized to the maximum extent possible for passenger and
       troop on/offloading. Once passengers have been on-loaded the air stairs may be released
       and a maintenance stand repositioned at the door only after PIC coordination/approval.
          13.4.2.11.1. Use caution when on/offloading passenger without air stairs. The PIC is
          the final authority on whether passengers/troops will be on/offloaded when air stairs
          are unavailable.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The boom operator is a key figure in good passenger relations. The following rules
   should be observed:
       13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
       willingness to help.
   13.5.2. Comments by the boom operator and the manner in which they are made often
   determine passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are
   individuals; address them collectively only when making announcements.
       13.5.2.1. Ensure crewmember’s entertainment media (magazines, DVD, etc.) are of an
       appropriate nature.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                               139


  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures:
     13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
     judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
     one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
     concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to sleep on cargo or cabin/cargo
     floor. Discourage passengers from congregating around galley, lavatory and crew bunk
     areas.
     13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small children,
     and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
     13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with cargo or emergency equipment.
     Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage. The cargo compartment is
     off limits to all passengers unless properly supervised.
     13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
     make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary cabin compartment
     lights.
     13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck or Air Refueling Operators (ARO) station
     only when approved by the PIC. Use good judgment when requesting this authority.
     Passengers must be escorted by a crewmember to and from these areas. Primary
     crewmembers will be notified when passengers are in transit between the passenger
     compartment and the ARO compartment. Brief all passengers visiting the flight deck or
     ARO compartment on the use of the quick-donning mask/oxygen system. The total
     number of individuals on the flight deck or in the ARO compartment at any one time will
     not exceed the number of seats with seat belts and operable oxygen regulators.
     13.5.3.6. Passengers will be supervised for the entire period of flight. Missions with one
     boom operator and planned tanker air refueling are limited to 10 passengers and may be
     monitored by flight deck crew during air refueling. Boom operators will brief passengers
     to remain seated and to observe and comply with advisory signs when flight deck crew is
     monitoring passengers.
         13.5.3.6.1. DELETED
         13.5.3.6.2. DELETED
     13.5.3.7. Notify the PIC of any unusual circumstance relating to the passengers.
     13.5.3.8. When passengers are carried, a Boom operator will be in the passenger
     compartment for all takeoffs and landings. Seat passengers from front to back, using all
     available seats.
  13.5.4. Body Fluid/Bio-Hazard Clean-Up:
     13.5.4.1. Aircrew personnel are the first line of defense when human fluids/waste
     contaminate aircraft. Because of the potential health risk to passengers and crew,
     crewmembers will immediately clean-up, to the best of their ability, all body fluids/waste
     when it does not detract from their primary duties. Boom operators will request troop
     commanders, team leaders, or traveling companions assist with the in-flight clean-up
140                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      whenever possible. The clean-up should be accomplished using kits (when available)
      provided by fleet service and the procedures listed below.
         13.5.4.1.1. Cordon of the contaminated area if possible.
         13.5.4.1.2. Use non-sterile vinyl or nitrile gloves that cover part of the arm.
         13.5.4.1.3. Wear safety goggles or glasses and an N-95 disposable respirator or
         equivalent surgical mask to protect the mucous membranes and inhalation of blood-
         borne pathogens that may exist.
         13.5.4.1.4. Wear disposable coveralls and footwear covers to protect skin, clothing
         and footwear if available.
         13.5.4.1.5. Apply paper towels or other absorbent material to the fluid to absorb the
         fluids and minimize the spill area.
         13.5.4.1.6. Use fluid from clean-up kit.
         13.5.4.1.7. Place all material into bag.
         13.5.4.1.8. Avoid touching the mouth or face area with soiled hands or gloves. Wash
         hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning or clean hands with a alcohol-
         based hand gel (at least 60% alcohol) when soap and water is not available.
         13.5.4.1.9. Annotate type of body fluid/bio-hazard cleaned-up and location in AFTO
         Form 781A, Aircraft Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
         13.5.4.1.10. When it is not possible for aircrew personnel or passengers to clean-up
         during flight, fleet service will be notified prior to landing.
  13.5.5. Meal Service.
      13.5.5.1. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger’s
      AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket.
      13.5.5.2. Box Meals. After takeoff, distribute box meals to passengers who boarded at
      the previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and more
      passengers board at subsequent stations. Frozen/Cooked meals will not be accepted for
      passengers. Box meals should be served in the following sequence:
         13.5.5.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
         13.5.5.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
         13.5.5.2.3. All other passengers.
      13.5.5.3. Do not serve liquids or hot foods during turbulence.
      13.5.5.4. When purchased meals are not furnished to passenger(s), the boom operator
      will annotate the individual’s AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket to reflect
      reimbursement is authorized. Inform the passenger(s) they may receive refunds at the
      passenger service counter at the next station, originating location, or destination terminal.
      13.5.5.5. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
      Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including AFRC flown missions) for
      passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on JA/ATT,
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                141


       Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port operations
       officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC
       stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are placed
       onboard, the boom operator may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-
       flight kitchen.
13.6. En Route and Post-Flight Duties.
   13.6.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound boom operator is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound boom
   operator is responsible for planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.6.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.). If unable to conduct a face to face briefing, leave written
   instructions with the cargo manifest or local C2.
   13.6.3. Assist passengers in deplaning. If BLUE BARK, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are onboard, the boom operator informs the traffic or protocol representative respectively. In
   addition, notify arrival base C2 using Flight Plan VIP Codes from General Planning Flight
   Information Publication.
13.7. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.7.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the boom operator prior to directing personnel to load any weapons.
   13.7.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized palletized location for redistribution on arrival at the
   objective. Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.8. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to
T.O.1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and Addenda A of this AFI. The unit possessing the aircraft
maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current aircraft status and
provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft. The supplemental
handbook should be enclosed in a wear-resistant binder (preferably metal), stenciled “Weight
and Balance” with the airplane model and complete serial number on the cover or a spine.
   13.8.1. The supplemental handbook will include the AFI 11-2KC-10 V3 Addenda A, KC-10
   Aircraft Configuration, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
   Form F—Transport/Tactical, and a certified copy of the current DD Form 365-3, Chart C,
   Basic Weight and Balance Record. Chart C will include the aircraft‘s basic weight, basic
   moment, and center of gravity.
   13.8.2. The boom operator will file the original DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance
   Clearance Form F—Transport/Tactical, at the departure airfield and maintain a physical or
   electronic copy for the duration of the flight.
 142                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   13.8.3. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft will provide the
   information required to maintain current and accurate documents to the appropriate agency.
   13.8.4. Weight balance may be accomplished using anyone of following methods:
       13.8.4.1. Manually using the DD Form 365-4.
       13.8.4.2. Electronically using the HQ AMC/A3VK and KC-10 SG approved handheld
       computer and printer combinations.
13.9. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format
when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo you feel
requires special or specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in T.O. 1C-
10(K)A-9, KC-10 Cargo Loading Manual. After completion, send through standardization
channels to HQ AMC/A3VK.
   13.9.1. General Loading Data:
       13.9.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item; i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.
       13.9.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture
       of the unit pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
       13.9.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate weight
       if possible.
   13.9.2. Number of loading crew personnel and boom operators required to on/offload cargo
   and their position to observe clearances, if required.
   13.9.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to
   on/offload cargo; i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
   13.9.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
   13.9.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or
   reconfigured to on/ offload cargo (i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc.).
   13.9.6. On/offloading Procedures.
   13.9.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.9.8. Comments.
13.10. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Apply the following procedures to ensure a safe,
efficient loading method for the emergency airlift of personnel and aeromedical evacuation (AE)
of litter patients from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian evacuations, or
when directed by the MAJCOM C2.
   13.10.1. Emergency airlift normally is accomplished without the use of individual seats or
   safety belts. The maximum number of personnel who may be airlifted by seating them on a
   pallet sub-floor in the cargo compartment will vary. Seat personnel in rows facing forward
   and load in small groups of 8-10 per pallet so they may be positioned and restrained by
   connecting the pre-positioned tie-down straps from the left and right outboard pallet rings.
   Load personal effects/baggage in any safe available pallet position.
   13.10.2. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 143


13.11. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks.
   13.11.1. During administrative (training) deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on
   deploying vehicles or palletized.
   13.11.2. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will
   be carried by the individuals onto the aircraft. Rucksacks will not fit under the seats without
   obstructing the aisle way. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for loading rucksacks.
   13.11.3. Rucksacks will not be floor loaded.
13.12. Not Used.
13.13. Cargo and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Issues.
   13.13.1. Lithium Batteries and Pyrotechnic Material (Class/Division 1.3G). Aircraft halon
   fire extinguishers are ineffective in fighting fires involving primary (non-rechargeable)
   lithium batteries and pyrotechnic material. Primary lithium batteries shipped as cargo or
   installed/contained in equipment and pyrotechnic material will not be accepted as cargo
   without the shipper providing a suitable fire extinguisher(s). For non-rechargeable lithium
   batteries this may be C02, Class D, or a specialized fire extinguisher (e.g., LITH-X). Dry
   chemical agent is preferred extinguisher for pyrotechnic material. These extinguishers will
   only help reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium and pyrotechnic material expends
   itself. Aircraft halon fire extinguishers are suitable when transporting only rechargeable
   (lithium ion) batteries. Fire extinguisher requirements for non-rechargeable lithium batteries
   and pyrotechnic material do not apply to items being hand carried by troops during Chapter 3
   operations. NOTE: Aircraft potable water will not be used as a fire suppression system for
   lithium batteries or pyrotechnic material. Water presents a hazard to electronic equipment
   located in the center accessory compartment and ARO compartment and water, in less than a
   large quantity, is ineffective.
   13.13.2. Hazardous Materials in ISU-90 Containers. Load plans must allow in-flight access
   in event of an emergency, or hazardous materials will be removed from the container. Some
   containers have built-in “HAZMAT” access panels; however, when these containers are
   utilized, any hazardous materials must be positioned to permit access through the panel.
   EXCEPTION: See AFMAN 24-204 for hazardous cargo not required to be accessible in-
   flight. Hazardous materials in the upper compartment of the container are inaccessible unless
   the adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors. If the person
   responsible for the container is not on board, the key or combination for locks on containers
   must be on the container adjacent to the lock. AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized
   access on all cargo containers placed on AMC aircraft except when waived by HQ AMC/A3
   for security reasons.
   13.13.3. Weissenfel MB-1 Chain and 1998 Davis MB-1 Devices. Effective immediately, the
   Weissenfel MB-1 chain will not be used. The Weissenfel MB-1 chain can be identified by
   the word W-ITALY stamped on the chain hook. The 1998 Davis MB-1 tiedown device will
   not be used. These devices can be identified by a stamp reading contract number SPO470-
   98-C-5103. Remove any Weissenfel MB-1 chain or 1998 Davis MB-1 device from the
   aircraft. Examine chained palletized cargo for these chains and devices. If they are found,
   replace them with other chains and devices. Return the chains and devices to maintenance or
   the aerial port activity.
144                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      13.13.3.1. Davis Aircraft Products MB-1 and CGU-4/E Cargo Aircraft Tiedowns. Do
      not fully extend any Davis aircraft tiedown devices at any time. Davis devices modified
      by the previously authorized repair kit must be adjusted so there is a minimum of 3
      threads visible between the white spacer contacting the anti-rotation bar and the adjusting
      nut located on the inside of the tiedown main body frame. Unmodified Davis devices
      must be adjusted so there is a minimum of 3 threads visible between the anti-rotation bar
      and the adjusting nut located on the inside of the tiedown main body.
  13.13.4. Commercial Cargo Straps. Do not use commercial cargo straps. The only
  authorized cargo straps are the CGU/1b, 5k air cargo strap, PN 1670-00-725-1437, strap,
  webbing universal tiedown, PN 5340-00-980-9277 (army version of the AF CGU/1b, 5k
  strap) and the 10,000-pound restraint assembly cargo, NSN 1670-00-406-2657.
  13.13.5. Ratchet device stamped: PECK & HALE, LLC, CGU-1/B 5000 LBS CAP. 94658
  6MRW/1465B with white unmarked strap will not be used. Remove any deficient devices
  found on the aircraft and turn them in to aerial port personnel for final disposition.
  13.13.6. Removal/Addition of Aircraft Equipment. Missing or removed items that are
  considered part of the normal aircraft configuration, such as cargo loading rails or pieces of
  the walkway, do not constitute a non-standard configuration. If these items are onboard but
  strapped to a pallet or are completely removed from the aircraft, make an adjustment to the
  aircraft weight and balance computation. Carrying more than the normal (4) IAU pallets
  does not constitute a non-standard configuration. When the additional pallets are onboard
  and there is other cargo manifested as hazardous, check its compatibility with regard to the
  oxygen generating units on the IAU. The oxygen generators installed in the IAU seats are
  classified as Hazard Class 5.1, with a UN Identification Number of UN3356. Additional
  IAU pallets are still considered aircraft equipment and do not need to be manifested as cargo,
  nor do they require Shipper‘s Declarations for Dangerous Goods.
  13.13.7. Flight Test Data Acquisition System Pallet. The KC-10 palletized flight test data
  acquisition system does not require a configuration wavier when loaded using TO 1C-
  10(K)A-9 criteria. Use the empty placarded weight of 1700 lbs.

                        FUEL PLANNING AND CONSERVATION

14.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist pilots, flight engineers, and planners in fuel
planning for KC-10 missions. The CFPS Computer Flight Plan (CFP) and TO 1C-KC-10A-1-1
Performance Manual is the primary preflight reference. The planning procedures in this chapter
apply to all AMC-tasked and 618 AOC (TACC)-flight managed missions in addition to local
missions. Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. It is Air Force policy to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with tech order guidance and safety:
   14.2.1. Fuel Loads. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.2.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency.
   14.2.3. APU Usage. Minimize the APU usage to the maximum extent possible. Early
   coordination may be required to ensure external power carts and heating/cooling units are
   available.
       14.2.3.1. When Cockpit Instrument(s) are powered on the ground, the avionics
       compartment cooling fan and the appropriate equipment associated fan(s) must be
       operating. In addition, if cockpit temperature is above 85 degrees F, air conditioning (i.e.
       AGE/APU) must be used.
   14.2.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Load and maintain aircraft at an aft CG whenever possible
   consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions.
   14.2.5. Engine Start. Delay engine start on all departures whenever practical to minimize
   fuel consumption.
       14.2.5.1. Starting the number two engine should be delayed as long as practical prior to
       takeoff unless aircraft gross weight is 500,000 lbs or more.
   14.2.6. Taxi. Consider engine out taxi when permitted by Flight Manual.
   14.2.7. Departure Planning. Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or
   expedite departure routing if winds allow.
   14.2.8. Takeoff. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as reduced power when able. This saves
   fuel and engine wear. Clean up on schedule and don’t delay gear and flap retraction.
   14.2.9. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage.
   14.2.10. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
 146                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   14.2.11. Cruise techniques. Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever
   possible. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible.
       14.2.11.1. When time between air refueling exceeds 10 minutes, the boom/hose will be
       stowed.
   14.2.12. Approach. Fly most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements.
   14.2.13. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.2.14. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel
optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
accomplishment:
   14.3.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required).
   14.3.2. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or AFI 11-2KC-10V3 require the
   filing of an alternate.
       14.3.2.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting
       mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-
       202V3 weather criteria.
       14.3.2.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting AFI
       11-202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
       14.3.2.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
       nautical miles of destination. (The ACFP default distance to an alternate is 75 nautical
       miles. Consequently, where the alternate is less than 75 nautical miles from the primary
       destination, ACFP will assume that the airfield is 75 nautical miles away.)
       14.3.2.4. The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an
       alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
       14.3.2.5. ACFP will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75
       miles from the destination.
       14.3.2.6. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In
       such situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45
       reserve).
   14.3.3. For all missions other than local training missions, calculate 15 minutes of
   contingency fuel using destination gross weights. Local training missions are not required to
   carry contingency fuel. If contingency fuel is carried on local training missions, it should not
   exceed 15 minutes. Contingency fuel is not considered reserve fuel since it can be consumed
   at any point during the mission. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial RRFL
   calculation.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 147


      14.3.3.1. AMC’s ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
      Computer flight plans will have 1+00 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15
      contingency fuel (for remote destinations ACFP will plan 2+15 holding, combining 2+00
      reserve and 15 minutes contingency fuel).
      14.3.3.2. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
      providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an
      alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing
      reserve and contingency fuel for remote destinations, use consumption rates providing
      maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.
   14.3.4. Using all available planning tools (including ACFP and CFP) and guidance in this
   chapter, PICs will determine the RRFL. When actual fuel load exceeds the RRFL by more
   than 5,000 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL.
      14.3.4.1. Identified extra fuel may be added to RRFL:
          14.3.4.1.1. When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops.
          14.3.4.1.2. For known holding delays in excess of standard.
          14.3.4.1.3. For anticipated off course weather avoidance.
          14.3.4.1.4. When reliable wind data or receiver profiles are not available.
      14.3.4.2. Airlift missions. Plan Long Range Cruise (LRC) and optimum altitude.
      14.3.4.3. Tanker Mission. Plan to and from the AAR track or anchor at LRC and
      optimum altitude.
      14.3.4.4. Aircraft Commanders will not add any additional fuel without first discussing
      the reason with their FM and receiving their agreement that additional fuel is justified.
      When an Aircraft Commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
      mission, they will call the appropriate FM to identify and resolve differences. When the
      Aircraft Commander and the FM do not reach agreement, the Aircraft Commander is the
      final authority for adding additional fuel.
   14.3.5. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. MAJCOM C2 or 618 AOC (TACC)-
   sanctioned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the
   RRFL.
      14.3.5.1. Force Extension/AAR. If during mission planning it is determined that
      scheduled AAR is not needed for operational or training purposes, attempt to get it
      cancelled through appropriate C2 channels.
   14.3.6. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618 AOC
   (TACC), deputy director of operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will determine
   which takes precedence. The OG/CC will make this determination when serving as mission
   execution authority.
14.4. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
   14.4.1. Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL). Minimum fuel required at engine start to
   complete tasked mission. RRFL will consist of all fuel required for engine start, taxi, APU
   operation, takeoff, hold down, enroute, enroute reserve, contingency, air refueling,
148                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


  decompression (depressurization), early descent, descent, approach and landing, alternate,
  transition, holding/minimum landing. NOTE: The minimum RRFL is 50,000 lbs.
  Additional fuel required to achieve the 50,000 lb RRFL will be placed in the Identified Extra
  block.
  14.4.2. Start Engines, Taxi, and APU operation. Normally 1500 pounds. When anticipating
  more than 15 minutes ground operation time, add 100 pounds for each minute in excess of 15
  minutes, not to exceed 3000 pounds. If extended APU operations are anticipated, plan 350
  pph.
  14.4.3. Takeoff. Fuel used from the start of takeoff roll (brake release) to the start of climb
  (2000 feet). Normally 2.5 minutes and 2500 pounds.
  14.4.4. Enroute. Fuel from start of climb segment at the departure location to Begin Descent
  Point at destination.
  14.4.5. DELETED
  14.4.6. Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR). Scheduled offload minus scheduled onload.                 If
  scheduled onloads are not completed it may be impossible to complete the mission.
  14.4.7. Identified Extra. Fuel which may be added for unplanned contingencies such as late
  receivers, increased offloads, ATC delays, unplanned holding, weather avoidance, hold
  down, early descent etc. Additionally, this block may include transition fuel at destination
  minus alternate and landing fuel, unusable fuel, or tankered fuel for subsequent sorties. If
  subsequent sortie is a NERCC, the first sortie‘s forecasted thunderstorms, hold down, early
  descent, alternate, holding, and contingency fuel will all be subtracted from the tankered fuel.
      14.4.7.1. Consider 4,500 pounds of main tank fuel (1,500 pounds in each main tank) as
      unusable. Minimum planned final landing fuel at destination or alternate will consist of
      4,500 pounds unusable plus 45 minutes holding fuel.
      14.4.7.2. Use 4,500 pounds if forecasted thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along
      the route of flight, 2,300 pounds if forecast thunderstorms are few along the route of
      flight, and 1,200 pounds if forecast thunderstorms are isolated along the route of flight.
      Thunderstorm forecasts will be based on the DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing or
      equivalent.
      14.4.7.3. 618 AOC (TACC) and local missions add 15 minutes (4,500 lbs) of hold down
      fuel for departures from Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, Westover,
      Yokota and Atsugi. NOTE: Hold down fuel is added as a departure bias and will be
      burned at the top of climb. For Flight managed missions, hold down fuel will be
      annotated on the ACFP as ―Fuel D at the beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in
      the top of climb fuel block on the ACFP.
      14.4.7.4. 618 AOC (TACC) and local missions add 15 Minutes (4,500 lbs) of early
      descent fuel for Andrews, Dover, Martinsburg, McGuire, Stewart, Westover, Yokota and
      Atsugi arrivals. NOTE: Early descent fuel is added as an arrival bias and will be burned
      on the last leg. For Flight managed missions, early descent fuel will be annotated on the
      ACFP as “Fuel I” at the beginning of the ACFP and accounted for in the last leg fuel
      block on the ACFP.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                               149


      14.4.7.5. Transition. Plan fuel for transition training at the destination or authorized
      enroute locations for training sorties. Compute ACFP at 18,000 pounds per hour (this
      includes fuel for the initial approach).
   14.4.8. Decompression Fuel. Additional fuel may be needed to satisfy oxygen requirements
   for flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft exceeds the total
   number of operational flight crew oxygen system stations. Ensure there is sufficient fuel on
   board to allow for a loss of cabin pressurization from any point along the route, and
   emergency descent to 10,000 feet MSL minimum, and continued flight to the nearest suitable
   emergency airfield.
      14.4.8.1. To calculate decompression fuel, the PIC will examine the intended route of
      flight (using aeronautical charts, plotting charts, ACFP, or CFP) to determine the point
      furthest from recovery to a suitable emergency airfield. This may be at the ETP, or at
      another point along the planned route of flight. Compare fuel remaining at that point to
      the fuel required to recover at 10,000’ overhead an emergency airfield with 20,000
      pounds of fuel in tanks. Add fuel, if required.
      14.4.8.2. ACFP Decompression Fuel Calculations. The ACFP calculates decompression
      fuel from the ETP at 10,000‘ altitude. If additional fuel is required from the ETP, the
      ACFP automatically adds it to Block 7 of the ACFP. In all cases, crews will verify
      ACFP decompression fuel calculations using guidance in paragraph 14.4.8.1 above.
          14.4.8.2.1. ACFP Equal Time Point (ETP). ACFP uses a First Suitable Airfield
          (FSAF) and a Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF) when computing an ETP. These are
          airports closest to the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet applicable
          destination alternate requirements.
              14.4.8.2.1.1. ETP Calculation. ETP calculations are required on portions of
              routes when the total time between the LSAF and the FSAF is 3-hours or more.
              This hour requirement was derived from the minimum flight time on a trans-
              Atlantic flight. LSAF and FSAF selected for ETPs calculated in ACFP are
              authorized for use in-flight.
              14.4.8.2.1.2. ACFP uses the following formula for calculating ETP:
                 14.4.8.2.1.2.1. TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF-FSAF)
(WF2 – WF1) + 2TAS

              14.4.8.2.1.3. If the LSAF/FSAF is not on the flight plan course, ACFP will use a
              point 90 deg perpendicular from the LSAF and/or FSAF to the flight plan course
              to determine the total distance between LSAF and FSAF. NOTE: The closer the
              LSAF and FSAF are to the flight plan course the more accurate the ETP solution
              provided by ACFP.
      14.4.8.3. Equal Time Point (ETP). First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and Last Suitable
      Airfield (LSAF) are used in the ETP calculation. These are represented as the First
      Nearest and the Last Nearest airports in the ETP calculation. They are airports closest to
      the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet applicable destination alternate
      requirements.
150                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


         14.4.8.3.1. ETP Calculation. ETP calculations are required on portions of routes
         when the total time between the LSAF and the FSAF is 3-hours or more. This hour
         requirement was derived from the minimum flight time on a trans-Atlantic flight.
         LSAF and FSAF selected for ETPs calculated in ACFP are authorized for use in-
         flight.
         14.4.8.3.2. ACFP uses the following formula for calculating ETP:
TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF-FSAF)
                            (WF2 – WF1) + 2TAS
             14.4.8.3.2.1. If the LSAF/FSAF is not on the flight plan course, ACFP will use a
             point 90 deg perpendicular from the LSAF and/or FSAF to the flight plan course
             to determine the total distance between LSAF and FSAF. NOTE: The closer the
             LSAF and FSAF are to the flight plan course the more accurate the ETP solution
             provided by ACFP.
  14.4.9. Descent, Approach and Landing. ACFP flight plans calculate Descent, Approach
  and Landing Fuel in Block 6. CFP add fuel used from the Begin Descent Point to Initial
  Approach Fix for descent and then add 15 minutes and 3000 pounds for approach and
  landing.
  14.4.10. Alternate. Fuel for missed approach and flight from intended destination to
  alternate aerodrome. Use Time and Fuel to Alternate, or Specific Range charts.
  14.4.11. Reserve Fuel.
      14.4.11.1. Holding Fuel. Fuel for 45 minutes of holding. Compute using planned
      destination gross weight at 10,000 feet. Use the Three-Engine Holding Table with a 25-
      degree bank angle. NOTE: ACFP does not use the Three-Engine Holding Table to
      compute holding fuel. Block 18 on the 4091 will always be less than the holding block
      on the ACFP. This is authorized extra fuel and the difference will be entered in block 21
      of the 4091. If ACFP holding fuel is less than block 18 on the 4091, there is an error in
      your ACFP. Contact your flight manager to resolve.
      14.4.11.2. Remote Destination. When holding is required in lieu of an alternate at a
      remote destination, carry an additional one hour and 15 minutes of holding fuel. A
      remote destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic
      location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. When
      this option is used, calculate Reserve Fuel (Holding, Remote, and Contingency) using the
      Three-Engine Holding table with a 25-degree bank angle, planned destination gross
      weight, 20,000 feet MSL.
      14.4.11.3. Contingency. For missions other than local training missions, calculate 15
      minutes of contingency fuel. Local training missions are not required to carry
      contingency fuel. If contingency fuel is carried on local training missions, it should not
      exceed 15 minutes. In all cases, this fuel is to compensate for unforeseen circumstances
      during any phase of flight (i.e. Unforecasted weather, launch delay, etc). Contingency
      fuel will not be considered reserve fuel since crews may burn some or all of their
      contingency fuel at any time during the mission. Compute using planned destination
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                               151


      gross weight at 10,000 feet. Use the Three-Engine Holding Table with a 25-degree bank
      angle.
      14.4.11.4. ACFP flight plans will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
      ACFP will have 1+00 holding when combined 0+45 reserve and 0+15 contingency fuel
      (for remote destinations ACFP will calculate 2+15 holding, combining 2+00 reserve and
      15 minutes contingency fuel).
   14.4.12. Minimum Planned Fuel at Begin Descent Point. Consists of fuel required for
   descent, approach and landing, alternate/missed approach, and holding/minimum landing
   fuel. Additional fuel may be added to allow crews some flexibility when dealing with
   unplanned contingencies (e.g., late receivers, extra receivers, increased off loads, weather
   avoidance, ATC delays, etc). When dealing with unplanned contingencies, crews will still
   plan to touchdown with minimum landing fuel. Units may develop standard alternate fuel
   requirements for local training missions however; these fuel requirements will not be less
   than those specified in this AFI. Local supplements will not dictate a standard “IAF” or
   “Top of Descent Fuel”.

14.6. Computer Flight Plan. Only AMC-validated computer flight planning software is
approved for use in producing CFPs. The CFP normally serves as the fuel log. AF Form 4090
KC-10 Flight Plan and Fuel Log is used when no CFP is available. It is the crew‘s responsibility
to review each CFP and determine if the planned values chosen by the flight planner are
sufficient and correct for the mission. The CFP fuel calculations must be verified using T.O. 1C-
10(K)A-1-1. This ensures the flight plan has been computed with the correct values. The flight
engineer does this by completing the time and fuel analysis block of the AF Form 4091. Use
Section 5 Specific Range charts or Section 10 Flight Planning Tables to verify the enroute
portion. Confirming each and every segment on the flight plan is not necessary. Every effort
must be made to eliminate unnecessary "padding" of fuel figures.
   14.6.1. When mission requirements dictate a change to the planned mission, the fuel must be
   recalculated to ensure safe completion of the flight. A pilot or flight engineer may insert the
   new FMS waypoints for flight plan changes and determine new leg distances. This distance
   must be converted to air distance by applying the FMS wind factor. When the new leg air
   distance is known, calculate the new leg burn-off and update the flight plan or AF Form
   4090. It is recommended that the fuel difference be applied at the destination, then work the
   plan backwards, applying the new leg burn-offs and any air refueling on-loads or off-loads.
   14.6.2. Drag degradation with WARP hoses deployed and slats and flaps extended can
   increase fuel consumption by nearly 10 percent. These and any other external configuration
   changes (i.e. gear down flights), will require modifications to increase standard fuel planning
   numbers. Consult drag index chart and gear down data in the performance manual.
   14.6.3. Table 14 1. Provides drag index guidance when using PFPS to produce CFPs.
   Refer to T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1-1, Figure 1-14 for additional drag index information.

                                       AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes air refueling guidelines applicable to KC-10 aircraft and
aircrews and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other applicable
directives.
15.2. AAR Limitations. The following limitations apply.
   15.2.1. AAR altitudes. AAR operations will be conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or
   10,000 feet AGL, whichever is higher. EXCEPTION: C-130, CV-22 and A-10 receivers
   may be refueled as low as 5,000 feet AGL, if mission requirements dictate.
       15.2.1.1. AAR operations based at or above 12,000 feet MSL, which momentarily fall
       below 10,000 feet AGL, but no lower than 5,000 feet AGL, due to over flight of
       mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are permissible.
       15.2.1.2. If refueling must be accomplished below 10,000 feet AGL, limit refueling time
       to the minimum required to meet operational requirements and then immediately recover
       to normal refueling altitudes. Crews must ensure thorough knowledge of terrain features
       when operating below 10,000 feet AGL and will limit operations to flat or rolling terrain,
       or over water.
       15.2.1.3. Pilots will fly no lower than an altitude that provides at least 5,000 ft. of
       clearance above the highest obstruction or terrain within 5 nautical miles either side of
       the planned course centerline.
   15.2.2. Refueling During Training Missions.        AAR should not be accomplished during
   training missions when:
       15.2.2.1. Conditions result in marginal control of either aircraft or the boom (in the
       opinion of either the pilot or boom operator).
       15.2.2.2. Either the tanker or the receiver (except B-52) has less than the full number of
       engines operating.
       15.2.2.3. Tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
   15.2.3. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used.
   15.2.4. AAR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect using either the normal
   disconnect system or the independent disconnect system (IDS). AAR (tanker or receiver)
   will not be conducted after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability. EXCEPTION:
   Fuel emergency situations, contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI, receiver over water
   deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance missions, prime nuclear airlift
   force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for
   home base recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive.
   15.2.5. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
   (EBL), Override Boom Latching (OBL), and amplifier override). Normal tanker disconnect
154                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


  capability and automatic disconnect limits are inoperative. Training and evaluation in MBL
  procedures may only be accomplished under the following conditions:
      15.2.5.1. Direct IP supervision is required on board receiver aircraft (if other than fighter
      type).
      15.2.5.2. Limit contacts to the minimum required.
      15.2.5.3. Receiver and tanker AAR systems must be fully operable.
      15.2.5.4. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or practice emergency
      separations while in contact. NOTE: The boom operator and receiver pilot must
      coordinate all actions as required by applicable directives and checklists when making
      AR contacts during the situations listed above. NOTE: MBL with IDS system operative
      may be accomplished without restrictions.
  15.2.6. Reverse Air Refueling. See T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1.
      15.2.6.1. Reverse AAR into a KC-135 is only permitted in an emergency, for operational
      necessity, or IAW FTU syllabus training requirements.
      15.2.6.2. There are no additional restrictions for reverse AAR into another KC-10.
  15.2.7. Practice Emergency Separations.
      15.2.7.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
      coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
      Coordination must include information on when the separation will occur and who will
      give the command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over
      interphone with the boom operator.
      15.2.7.2. Unless an actual breakaway is required, prior to calling for a Practice
      Emergency Separation, ensure the boom nozzle is separated from the receiver's
      receptacle. In this instance, the tanker boom operator will call the breakaway.
      15.2.7.3. Practice emergency separations may be accomplished with passengers on
      board. Ensure all passengers are seated with seat belts fastened.
  15.2.8. Limits Demonstration. KC-135 tanker disconnect capability must be verified by a
  boom operator initiated disconnect prior to receivers conducting limits demonstrations.
  15.2.9. For receiver pilot initial qualification or requalification, the receiver
  instructor/examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the
  controls through all phases of the refueling from astern until post air refueling.
  15.2.10. If a change of receiver pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to
  at least the astern position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor pilot.
  15.2.11. If a tanker or receiver seat change takes place, the receiver will move back to at
  least 100 feet in trail of the tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual
  contact with the tanker until the seat change is complete.
  15.2.12. Receiver A/R Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes copilots,
  aircraft commander upgrade candidates and aircraft commanders refueling from the right
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    155


   seat). In-flight training will be accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following
   procedures apply:
      15.2.12.1. The receiver pilot must inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker.
      15.2.12.2. The boom operator operating the boom controls must be qualified. NOTE:
      This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student boom operator is
      under direct instructor supervision.
      15.2.12.3. If the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker copilot will not fly the aircraft.
      NOTE: This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student receiver
      pilot and the student tanker copilot are under direct IP supervision.
   15.2.13. Boom Operator Qualification or Training. Unqualified and non-current boom
   operators must be under direct instructor supervision to conduct AAR operations.
   15.2.14. Operator Fatigue. If boom operator or receiver pilot fatigue becomes a factor
   during AAR operations, the receiver will maintain no closer than the astern position until
   fatigue is no longer a factor (operator judgment).
   15.2.15. Weather limitations.
      15.2.15.1. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
      15.2.15.2. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe
      refueling operations.
   15.2.16. The normal method of boom control during refueling operations is with the
   automatic load alleviation system (ALAS) "ON". AAR will not be conducted with an ALAS
   malfunction or ALAS inoperative. EXCEPTION: Fuel emergency situations, contingency
   missions, JCS alert, ORI, receiver over water deployment or re-deployment, operational
   reconnaissance missions, PNAF support missions under normal conditions when the
   refueling is essential for home base recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive.
   15.2.17. AAR with Single Rudder Failure. Under normal conditions both boom rudders
   must be operational.       AAR will not be conducted with a single rudder failure.
   EXCEPTION: Fuel emergency situations, contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI, receiver
   over water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance missions, PNAF
   support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for home base
   recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive. NOTE: When conducting AAR with
   a single rudder failure, limit contacts to the minimum number necessary to complete the
   mission. AAR training will not be conducted during single rudder operations.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AAR shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Receiver aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point
   shall exit the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio
   Failure IFR-VFR" as set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
 156                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   15.3.3. Tanker aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall
   exit the track or anchor at the highest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure
   IFR-VFR" set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in
accordance with Chapter 2 of this instruction.
15.5. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA) Applicability
for AAR. MARSA begins between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC that it
is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized term. Query the controlling agency
if in doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is
responsible for.
   15.5.1. After MARSA has been declared, controller-assigned course or altitude changes
   prior to rendezvous completion will automatically void MARSA and are to be avoided.
   15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.3. Upon rendezvous completion, receiver aircraft shall remain within 3 miles of the
   tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.4. After air refueling clearance is received and until rendezvous is completed, aerial
   refueling airspace from the ARIP to the ARCP is sterilized. After rendezvous is completed
   and the tankers or receivers proceed down track, other non-participating aircraft may be
   cleared through the refueling block airspace with proper separation.
   15.5.5. MARSA ends between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC that the
   tanker and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within the air refueling airspace and
   ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservation (ALTRV). An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude
reservation function (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP
under certain circumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. AAR on
operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all,
a portion, or portions of the intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be found
in FAA 7610.4.
   15.6.1. Ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV status may
   be verified through the appropriate AOC (TACC) cell.
   15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations.
   Normal AVANA will be 1 hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time,
   coordinate with the C2 authority as soon as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-
   hour increments after the original schedule.
   15.6.3. ALTRV Procedures. Prior to accomplishing a mission requiring an ALTRV, crews
   will review their respective AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, Flip General Planning, and Area Planning to
   ensure compliance. These publications are the main source of information for aircrews, but
   other pertinent information regarding ALTRVs may exist for the specific country or
   countries in which the ALTRV is established.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 157


       15.6.3.1. FAA Airspace. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time,
       and areas specified in the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or
       descend as specified in the approval. Controllers are not required to issue a climb or
       descent clearance for the various flight segments. They may, however, request that the
       pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude change.
       15.6.3.2. ICAO Airspace. Fundamentally, ICAO acknowledges ALTRVs but they do not
       recognize them in official publications. An ICAO ALTRV may or may not be an actual
       ATC clearance depending on the region. For instance, the United Kingdom requires
       aircraft to obtain ATC approval for all altitude changes. Furthermore, aircraft transiting
       multiple countries need to be aware that ALTRV procedures may change when crossing
       FIR boundaries. In Europe, Letters of Agreement (LOA) maintained at EUCARF explain
       ALTRV procedures and routings for individual countries. LOAs are coordinated on a
       one-to-one basis between EUCARF and each controlling agency/nation, not for the whole
       region. Crews will consult paragraph of the ALTRV message for country-specific
       information and explicitly follow all paragraph instructions. If further clarification is
       required, contact the ALTRV planner first, followed by the appropriate altitude
       reservation facility.
   15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
   15.6.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include the
   name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals
   do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.
   15.6.6. Country-Specific Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP) contains useful
   information for operating within their airspace boundaries. Flip Area Planning documents
   incorporate the procedures in the AIP and remain the primary source of worldwide
   aeronautical information for AMC crews. AIPs can be found on Eurocontrol‘s website for
   the countries that have chosen to provide guidance. EUCARF‘s website also provides
   country-specific guidance. At a minimum, crews should make every attempt to become
   familiar with the specific ALTRV procedures for countries they will land at and overfly.

15.7. Receiver Pilot Responsibilities. Receiver pilots are responsible for:
   15.7.1. Squawking normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
 158                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   15.7.2. Maintaining two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the AAR block
   altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the AAR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged read back are
   required for all flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for
   oceanic clearance procedures are FLIP Area Planning AP/2 and the NAT Minimum
   Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Manual.
       15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and read back oceanic
       clearance. To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own,
       individual clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they
       intend to operate, prior to entering oceanic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance
       prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS
       Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read back prior to rendezvous and
       air refueling.
       15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance read back for receiver aircraft.
       Receiver PICs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always read back to
       the controlling authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic
       controlling authority, prior to entering oceanic airspace.
15.8. Tanker Pilot Responsibilities. Tanker pilots are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be re-occupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (AAR and MARSA have
   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility.                    All
   communications during refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall
   be between the ATC facility or military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical,
   receivers shall establish communications with the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP
   on the specified AAR frequency. The tanker shall assume position reporting responsibility
   for the receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to
       refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
       reservation (ALTRV).
       15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
       ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
       radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
       ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                     159


       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver PIC
       responsibility.
       15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not read back receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a
       receiver PIC responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically positioning aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft’s position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver’s ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
   15.8.9. Accomplishing Search and Rescue (SAR) procedures IAW AFI 11-207. In an
   emergency, the flight leader immediately notifies the tanker commander. The tanker aircrew
   notifies ATC. In the event of a downed or ditched receiver, ATC notifies the Rescue
   Coordination Center, which in turn alerts the nearest SAR assets. The tanker provides cover
   as long as fuel reserves allow. Remaining receivers proceed unescorted to the nearest abort
   base or continue the mission with remaining tankers.
15.9. ATC Clearance. AAR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DoD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AAR outside published areas or
within an ALTRV. The tanker aircraft commander shall receive specific ATC clearance from
the appropriate ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
   15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to
   adverse winds, mission requirements, etc.
   15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
   tobogganing). NOTE: Protected airspace for AR tracks is defined in FAA order 7610.4N
   SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATIONS. If tankers need to exceed these bounds to accomplish
   the rendezvous, they must request clearance from ATC prior to exiting the protected orbit
   pattern airspace.
15.10. Emergency AAR. When an emergency AAR requirement arises, units tasked will
attempt to fill the requirement from available unit resources. Use unit training sorties as first
 160                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


priority and generated alert sorties as second priority. If no capability exists, notify the
controlling agency of the requirement and unit shortfall. The following procedures apply:
   15.10.1. Units will not routinely preposition additional aircraft to satisfy potential
   emergency AAR requirements.
   15.10.2. Time permitting, coordinate emergency AAR requirements with receiver parent
   MAJCOM or NAF.
   15.10.3. The unit command post should coordinate or direct unit actions.
   15.10.4. Identify unit sortie when notified of emergency AAR requirement.
   15.10.5. Coordinate with the OG/CC.
   15.10.6. Notify AOC (TACC) of requirement and proposed actions.
   15.10.7. Notify squadron or aircrew of requirement.             Provide ARCT, rendezvous
   information, altitude, receiver call sign, and communication plan.
   15.10.8. Advise receiver of planned actions.
   15.10.9. Notify the ARTCC liaison of requirement.
15.11. AAR with Commercial or non-USA military Aircraft. All tanker and receiver aircraft
must be technically compatible and have operational authority prior to conducting AAR.
   15.11.1. Confirmation that a receiver technical compatibility assessment has been conducted
   and found to be satisfactory is published in Appendix 6 of Annex ZE. Confirmation that a
   tanker technical compatibility assessment has been conducted and found to be satisfactory is
   published in Annex ZF.
   15.11.2. The authority to undertake AAR with commercial or non-USA military aircraft
   (tanker or receiver) is provided through formal agreements between the participants such as a
   Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case, theatre Air Tasking Order (ATO) and/or Special
   Instructions (SPINS), an Exercise/Operations Order (OPORD) or an Implementing
   Arrangement (IA). Opportune AAR with foreign or commercial aircraft is prohibited.
15.12. Coronet East Mission Over Flights in France. Aircrews must explicitly follow pre-
coordinated mission profiles on missions that transit French airspace. Although ALTRVs are not
formally recognized in the French ATC system, pre-coordinated Coronet East Missions are
afforded a certain degree of additional protection while in French airspace. In exchange for this
special handling, it is absolutely essential that aircrews adhere to pre-coordinated routes and
altitudes to avoid problems (including the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV). Failure to
do so creates difficult diplomatic situations and jeopardizes future authorization for US Military
over flights of France. Aircrews will not request any maneuvers that have not been coordinated
in advance with French ATC. Examples of these maneuvers include formation split up and
rejoin (unless pre-coordinated). During the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV, tanker and
receivers must remain in formation at a single altitude while in French airspace. If a request
(even if pre-coordinated) is denied by the controller, follow their instructions.

                                          Chapter 16

                                    MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter standardizes procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all
missions. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the mission materials. Unit
mission planning facilities should possess essential mission planning material.
   16.1.1. Mission planning is normally conducted the day before the mission. Operations
   group commanders may elect to use a "same day mission plan" option.
   16.1.2. Mission Commander. Chapter 2, paragraph 2.6, of this instruction specifies mission
   commander requirements and qualification criteria. AFTTP 3-3.KC10 contains a mission
   commander's checklist that is intended to assist mission commanders with their duties and
   responsibilities.
   16.1.3. Theater Indoctrination Folders (Part IV of FCIF) should provide additional
   information for aircrew and planning staff review. (Not applicable for ANG or AFRC)
16.2. Briefings.
   16.2.1. Pre-Deployment Briefing. Prior to deployments, the operations officer, mission
   commander, or designated representative should assemble the crew and brief description and
   purpose of the mission, tentative itinerary, aircraft configuration, special equipment, fuel
   load, clothing required, anticipated housing and messing facilities, sufficient money to defray
   individual’s anticipated expenses, personal equipment/field equipment requirements, special
   clearance requirements, and flying safety.
   16.2.2. Other Briefings. In addition to the briefings above, mission participants will also
   conduct briefings as required in paragraph 6.12 of this AFI.
16.3. Mission Debriefing. Hold immediately after the mission if practical.           Include the
following:
   16.3.1. Aircrews will attend the operations and maintenance debriefings as directed by unit
   or mission commander. Maintenance debrief should be conducted ASAP after flight.
   16.3.2. Intelligence debriefings will be accomplished as soon as practical after mission
   recovery, normally within 30 minutes.          Debriefings will be as prescribed in
   USTRANSCOMR 200-3, Intelligence Debriefing and Reporting.
   16.3.3. Aircrew Debrief. Mission critiques and debriefings are perhaps the most important
   learning tool available to aircrews and will be done after each mission. All crewmembers
   will attend. Use this time to review the entire mission.
 162                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


                                          Chapter 17

                                 EMPLOYMENT TRAINING

17.1. General. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.KC-10 and 11-2KC-10 Vol 1 for guidance on tactics
training, specific maneuver descriptions, and tactical maneuver procedures.
17.2. Responsibilities. The tactics training program is a coordinated effort between the unit
intelligence office, wing/group training office, and wing/group weapons and tactics flight, in
order to ensure continuity and the unit‘s specific mission tasking is addressed.
   17.2.1. Tactics Reference Library and Tactics Read File. The unit tactics officer is
   responsible for developing procedures for timely dissemination of tactical information to unit
   aircrew members. See AMCI 11-207, AMC Weapons and Tactics Program, for the Tactics
   Reference Library.
17.3. Tactics Simulator Training.
   17.3.1. Scope. Aircrews should practice all applicable tactical maneuvers in the simulator
   prior to attempting the maneuvers in-flight. Units may attempt any maneuver in the
   simulator.
   17.3.2. Responsibilities. The tactics simulator training is directed by the wing/group
   weapons and tactics flight. Suggestions for tactics simulator profiles must be forwarded for
   approval to DET 1, AMCAOS, prior to incorporating the profile into refresher simulator
   periods. Because no threat specific information is required for this training, the simulator
   training is unclassified.
   17.3.3. Tactical Maneuvers. Spiral Up Departure and Random Steep (Spiral) Arrival are no
   longer continuity training events and will not be flown to satisfy continuation training
   requirements. Tactics training will be primarily accomplished in the simulator.
       17.3.3.1. For continuation training, aircrew members will practice maneuvers as part of
       M050 Basic Tactical Sortie; and this should be accomplished in the simulator.
17.4. Tactics Flight Training.
   17.4.1. Scope. The tactics flight training program is designed to provide KC-10 crew
   members with the training necessary to confidently and successfully survive the wartime
   threat environment without endangering aircrews or aircraft in peacetime. AFTTP 3-3.KC-
   10 details the approved maneuvers applicable to the KC-10 community; however, do not
   attempt any maneuver that is not specifically approved by HQ AMC/A3. NOTE:
   Maneuvers identified under the Aircraft column in Table 17.1 below may be accomplished
   in the aircraft on a non-interference basis during operational or continuation training
   missions. NOTE: All maneuvers and tactical events may be flown in the aircraft when
   operationally directed or required.
   17.4.2. Tactical Maneuvers. Accomplish tactical maneuvers IAW procedures provided in
   AFTTP 3-3.KC-10. Once certified, tactical maneuvers may be flown on continuation
   training and operational missions with passengers on board. Notify passengers prior to
   conducting tactics maneuvers training.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   163


   17.4.3. Flight Training Limitations and Restrictions:
        17.4.3.1. Limitations. The following limitations apply to all in-flight tactics training.
        Events accomplished in the simulator may be accomplished IAW AFTTP 3-3.KC-10
        without restriction. Refer to Table 17.1 to determine which maneuvers are permitted in
        the aircraft.
            17.4.3.1.1. Aircraft tactical arrival and departure (TAD) training is limited to single
            ship, VMC, 30 degree angle of bank maximum, and 1000’ AGL minimum
            ingress/egress altitudes. NOTE: VFR overhead (P061) is limited to no more than
            three-ship formation. Waiver authority for this restriction is the mission execution
            authority and may be delegated no lower than the OG/CC.
            17.4.3.1.2. Aircraft scram training is limited to VMC, 45 degree angle of bank
            maximum, 10,000’ AGL minimum altitude, and 400,000 pound maximum gross
            weight. Scatter turns are limited to two-ship formations.
            17.4.3.1.3. Limit formation in-place turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank and
            90 degrees of turn.
            17.4.3.1.4. Use a maximum of CLIMB power on the thrust rating computer when
            accomplishing scram training in the aircraft.
   17.4.4. Before accomplishing P063 Tactical Arrival in the aircraft, pilots will review the
   following items: Chum, study, and carry a chart (minimum TPC scale) covering the VFR
   route of flight; Civilian sectional or host nation equivalent chart before accomplishing VFR
   training; VFR weather requirements; Airspace and VFR pattern entry requirements; Class B,
   C, and D airspace ATC services; VFR cruising and minimum altitudes and flight following.

                                          Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. This chapter covers basic formation procedures and operations. All procedures
described apply to all KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The broad term formation as used does not
differentiate between specific tactics of en route formation or visual formation. Specific
references to each tactic must be made to ensure complete understanding.
   18.1.1. All formation flights will be planned, briefed, and critiqued in accordance with the
   applicable Technical Order, this chapter, ATP-56 and AFTTP 3-3. KC-10.
   18.1.2. These procedures are standardized with KC-135 formation operations.
18.2. Specified Times. The formation leader determines the sequence of events and mission
times based on mission requirements. Local SOEs for formation training missions may be
established for use at home station. Changes in briefing or mission timing will be relayed to all
formation members at the earliest opportunity.
18.3. Weather Minimums. Comply with weather minimums for takeoff and landing
established in AFI 11-202V3 and Chapter 6 of this instruction.
18.4. Ground Operations. The formation leader should accomplish radio checks and copy
ATC clearance in the chocks. All formation members should make every effort to accomplish
HAVE QUICK and SECURE VOICE radio operations on all local formation training missions.
All participating crews will accomplish as much of the pre-takeoff checklists as possible prior to
taxi. Lead will obtain taxi and takeoff clearance.
18.5. Communications and Radio Procedures. Radio and interphone discipline are critical
factors in maintaining formation integrity. The formation leader will ensure all formation
members have a complete understanding of the radio monitoring plan.
   18.5.1. Formation will not be flown on training sorties without inter-plane voice
   communications capability.
   18.5.2. When radio silent operations are required, the formation leader will pre-brief all
   formation members on specific procedures for frequency changes (i.e. timing, visual signals,
   etc.).
   18.5.3. Visual signals may be used as an alternate or secondary means of communication
   between aircraft.
   18.5.4. The flight lead will initiate all frequency changes. Wingmen should acknowledge in
   order and wait for every flight member to acknowledge before changing frequencies. Lead
   will allow enough time for frequency change to be accomplished before initiating check-in.
   Lead must ensure all flight members are on frequency before initiating any action or making
   any radio calls to ARTCC, etc. If a flight member does not respond, a secondary radio or
   guard may be used to direct the wingman to the proper frequency. Specific procedures
   should be pre-briefed by the flight lead. Crews should maintain non-primary radios during
   silent operations; however, planned frequency changes may be performed on briefed timing
   or visual signals. All flight members must be on a common frequency.
 166                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


18.6. Launch, Departure, and Level-Off.
   18.6.1. Formation Briefing. The formation leader will conduct a detailed briefing for all
   crew members covering the planned activities, procedures, techniques, specific EMCON
   procedures, and division of formation responsibilities. PICs may excuse crew members from
   the formation briefing to perform preflight duties, however the PIC will back brief all
   appropriate items. If lead changes are planned, each formation lead will brief their portion of
   the mission. The recommended formation briefing guide (Attachment 4) should be used to
   conduct the briefing. As a minimum, the briefing must include all applicable items listed in
   the guide. The formation leader will ensure all crew members thoroughly understand their
   responsibilities, to include assumption of formation leadership.
       18.6.1.1. When deviations from the briefed mission are necessary, they will be directed
       by the leader. No actions will be taken until they have been coordinated with and are
       understood by all formation members.
       18.6.1.2. Non-collocated Units. If aircraft depart from separate bases and then
       rendezvous for formation activity, the formation leader should make every effort to
       conduct a telephone briefing with joining tanker and receiver formation leaders. If this is
       not possible, after detailed sortie study, the coordination and briefing between the
       appropriate lead planning agencies or mission commanders will satisfy formation briefing
       requirements. Coordination of these formations will include designation of mission
       commander responsibilities for all phases of the formation operation.
       18.6.1.3. Unit Responsibilities. Each unit will develop post takeoff separation
       procedures and departure separation plans with the local controlling agency. Each plan
       must consider emergency aspects, aircraft performance capabilities, terrain features,
       penetration of weather after takeoff, and local ATC restrictions. Procedures should also
       be developed for items such as aborts, lost communications, EMCON, and the recovery
       of formation aircraft.
   18.6.2. Filing Procedures. Flight plans for all formation members will reflect the same route
   of flight for the portion of flight the aircraft will be in formation. Local procedures for filing
   may be used provided they are coordinated and documented in writing by the unit and local
   FAA (or ICAO) representatives.
   18.6.3. Taxi Procedures. Follow the taxi sequence established in the briefing. Maintain safe
   interval and a safe speed during taxi.
   18.6.4. Takeoff Timing Interval. Defined as the time between initiation of takeoff power for
   each successive aircraft in the formation. Use of takeoff power radio calls is not
   recommended. Minimum takeoff timing interval is 60 seconds between KC-10s and other
   aircraft in the formation. Takeoff intervals may be increased, or sequence may be varied as
   necessary, depending on aircraft acceleration and performance, training requirements,
   weather, airfield conditions, and mission requirements. See AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, Chapter 5
   for more guidance.
   18.6.5. Formation Takeoff Procedure (Hold-Line through Takeoff). Receivers should
   takeoff first. Any time a takeoff is aborted, an abort call will be made by the aborting aircraft
   over the ATC radio frequency being used by the formation. At bases with dual runway
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                 167


  operations, aborting aircraft should identify the runway in use. An additional radio call
  announcing an abort is recommended over the formation inter-plane frequency.
  18.6.6. Departure. Normal planned climb speed below 10,000 feet MSL is 250 KIAS,
  unless a higher speed is required to accommodate the Vmm of the heaviest aircraft in the
  formation. Above 10,000 feet MSL, for KC-10/KC-10 or KC-10/KC-135 cell formation
  departures, the normal planned climb speed is 290 knots (NOTE: this equates to 295 KIAS
  in the KC-135) for formations with KC-10s less than 500,000 pounds gross weight and 310
  knots (NOTE: this equates to 315 KIAS in the KC-135) for formations with KC-10s equal to
  or greater than 500,000 pounds gross weight. Planned climb speeds apply to the lead aircraft
  only. Following aircraft may exceed/lag these speeds as necessary to accomplish the rejoin
  and maintain proper formation position. In all cases, formation leaders may adjust the climb
  speed schedule as mission requirements and aircraft performance dictate. Planned climb
  speed will not be less than Vmm of the heaviest aircraft in the formation. If visual, radar,
  A/A TACAN, TCAS, and radio contact are all lost, and altitude separation cannot be
  ensured, lost wingman and locally developed abort procedures will be accomplished.
     18.6.6.1. Formation Join-Up. Differential airspeed and/or visual cut-off in departure
     turns are the approved methods for formation join-up. The use of visual cut-off is
     restricted to day/VMC operations only. Altitude separation will be carefully monitored
     during closure to enroute spacing. Under other than VMC or when visual contact cannot
     be maintained with all formation members, altitude separation will be accomplished
     using TCAS or by periodically having each aircraft in the formation report its altitude or
     flight level. During night or instrument flight conditions, aircraft should turn at the same
     geographic points as the preceding aircraft.
     18.6.6.2. Buddy Departures. Buddy departures may be used by collocated tanker and
     fighter or bomber units. The intent of this type of departure is to facilitate the join-up of
     receivers with their mated tankers. The procedures below are generalized and may
     require modification based on aircraft and airspace limitations.
         18.6.6.2.1. VMC Procedures. VMC procedures may be used when weather (ceiling
         and visibility) is 3000/5 or greater. Receivers will normally launch first and intercept
         an arc to place themselves on extended (approximately 10 NM) final to the departure
         runway. When the receiver calls 10 NM final, or the last receiver turns cross wind, or
         on predetermined timing, the tanker will launch. Continue with a straight ahead
         rejoin or according to briefed departure routing.
         18.6.6.2.2. IMC Procedures. Under IMC or when weather is less than 3000/5, plan
         to rendezvous the formation at an orbit point along the route of flight. Tankers will
         normally launch first unless mission fuel load and performance considerations dictate
         otherwise. Receivers should be rejoined prior to rendezvous with the tankers.
  18.6.7. Level-Off. An altitude block will be obtained for all intermediate and final level-off
  altitudes. Block altitudes will provide a minimum of 500-foot separation between aircraft. If
  ARTCC will not approve a block altitude, then request IFR separation or hard IFR altitudes
  for each aircraft in formation.
  18.6.8. Airborne Aborts. Any aborting aircraft should clear the planned launch stream and
  take appropriate actions dictated by the reason for abort. Aborting aircraft will obtain ATC
 168                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   clearance prior to altering their route, or declare an emergency and deviate as necessary. The
   formation leader and other formation members should be ready to assist the aborting aircraft
   in any way possible.
18.7. En Route Formation. En route formation consists of multiple tanker aircraft in trail,
stacked up at 500-foot intervals with 1 NM separation (2 NM may be used for contingency
operations). The primary means of maintaining proper formation position are radar under
instrument conditions and visual or radar under visual conditions. When visual conditions
permit, minimize radio transmissions. Heading and airspeed changes need not be announced. In
IMC, the formation leader should ensure all formation members are aware of heading and
airspeed changes, either through thorough pre-briefing, or use of inter-plane communications.
Aircrews will monitor the position of all other aircraft and, on inter-plane, notify any aircraft
excessively out of position.
   18.7.1. Turns. The formation leader should pre-brief specific bank angles for turns. This
   will help reduce inter-plane communications and aid in maintaining formation position. To
   maintain formation position during turns, all aircraft must initiate the turn over the same
   geographic point, unless executing a formation retrograde training maneuver as described in
   AFTTP 3-3.KC-10.
       18.7.1.1. Echelon Formation. Turns greater than 30 degrees into the echelon are
       permitted only in an emergency. Turns into an echelon are limited to 15 degrees of bank.
       All aircraft must execute the turn at the same time, or when time permits, start with the
       last aircraft, then the next to last aircraft, etc. If turns greater than 30 degrees are
       necessary for mission requirements, the formation leader should direct all aircraft to
       assume normal en route trail formation.
   18.7.2. Airspeed and Altitude. Formation climbs and descents will be accomplished using a
   constant airspeed and vertical velocity. The formation leader will ensure enroute airspeed is
   compatible with the most restrictive aircraft in the formation. Pre-brief, or announce on
   inter-plane frequency, rates of climb/descent and airspeed increases/decreases.
   18.7.3. Autopilot Operations. The autopilot should be used to reduce fatigue and aid in
   altitude separation. Consideration should be given to placing an aircraft with an inoperative
   or malfunctioning autopilot in last position in the formation for missions with extended
   duration in formation.
   18.7.4. Visual Station-Keeping. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.KC-10 for visual station-keeping
   techniques. During operational situations requiring EMCON 3 or 4, and marginal visibility
   prohibits normal formation spacing, a compressed trail formation may be used. Formations
   may be compressed, but should not be less than 1/2NM spacing between aircraft.
   18.7.5. Domestic Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (DRVSM). RVSM separation
   standards may be applied to formation flights consisting of all RVSM-compliant aircraft
   operating in DRVSM airspace. NOTE: DRVSM airspace includes the airspace of the lower
   48 states of the United States, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico high offshore airspace,
   and the San Juan FIR between flight level (FL) 290-410 (inclusive).
       18.7.5.1. RVSM formation flights may file for a single altitude if all formation aircraft
       fly the assigned altitude, either offset laterally from each other or in trail.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                    169


       18.7.5.2. RVSM formation flights requiring multiple altitudes should request an altitude
       block. Air traffic control may then apply RVSM separation standards between this
       altitude block and other RVSM aircraft (e.g. an RVSM formation flight is assigned flight
       level (FL) 320-330; ATC assigns other RVSM aircraft at FL310 and FL340).
       18.7.5.3. RVSM formation aircraft must use their automatic altitude control system to
       maintain the assigned altitude. Aircraft maneuvering within an altitude block must ensure
       they do not exceed the vertical boundaries of the block by utilizing the aircraft altitude
       alerting system, altitude capture function (if installed) and automatic altitude control
       system. If unable to maintain autopilot in vertical axis notify ATC of non-compliance
       with RVSM.
       18.7.5.4. Formation flights which do not consist of all RVSM aircraft will continue to be
       considered non-RVSM compliant and will have 2,000-ft vertical separation standards
       applied in DRVSM airspace. In addition, aircraft formations conducting aerial refueling
       will continue to be considered non-RVSM compliant; regardless of the participating
       aircraft's single-ship status.
18.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. These procedures are to be used when visual, A/A TACAN,
TCAS, radar, or radio contact cannot be maintained and altitude separation cannot be ensured.
In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to safety. Upon
losing all contact with the leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the
wingman will simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedure while transitioning
to instruments. The bank angle used to achieve separation should equal the number of degrees to
be turned. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize the effects of spatial
disorientation. Any aircraft, which can maintain contact with an aircraft executing a lost
wingman maneuver will remain in formation with that aircraft until otherwise, directed by the
leader. When lead is notified of a lost wingman, lead will take appropriate action, as the
situation dictates, until positive separation is assured. Lead will establish a reference heading
and altitude after initial separation is assured. During recovery, if the flight has a block altitude
clearance, wingmen should establish appropriate altitude separation.
   18.8.1. Two Aircraft Flights:
       18.8.1.1. In wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new heading for 15
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance if
       required.
       18.8.1.2. In turns (climbing, descending, or level):
           18.8.1.2.1. On the outside of the turn, transition to instruments, roll to wings level
           and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming
           turn. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
           18.8.1.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
           maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
           inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed, and
           acknowledge wingman‘s call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and
           confirms he or she has rolled wings level, the wingman will, after 15 seconds, roll
           wings level, establish 500 feet altitude separation, turn to lead‘s referenced heading
 170                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


          and attempt to acquire lead on radar. If loss of visual contact is not acknowledged by
          lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet altitude separation, roll out
          on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar, and form into enroute formation
          position. If radar contact cannot be re-established, obtain separate clearance from the
          controlling agency.
   18.8.2. Three Aircraft Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the
   procedures above would provide safe separation. However, as it is impossible for number
   three to immediately ascertain that number two still has visual contact with the leader, it is
   imperative number three‘s initial action be based on the assumption number two has also
   become separated. If number two is still in visual or radar contact, he or she will maintain
   position. If number two goes lost wingman, he or she will follow the procedures outlined
   above. Number three will follow the procedures listed below:
       18.8.2.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 30 degrees away, and maintain new heading for 30
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearances as
       required.
       18.8.2.2. In Turns (climbing, descending, level):
          18.8.2.2.1. On the outside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments,
          inform lead and reverse direction of turn for 15 seconds to ensure separation from
          lead and number two. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
          18.8.2.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
          maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 20 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
          inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed and
          acknowledge the wingman‘s call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call
          and confirms he or she has rolled wings level, number three will, after 30 seconds,
          roll wings level, establish 1000 feet altitude separation, turn to lead‘s referenced
          heading, and attempt to acquire lead and number two on radar. If loss of visual
          contact is not acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 1000
          feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar, and
          form into en route formation position. If radar contact is not re-established, obtain
          separate clearance from the controlling agency.
       18.8.2.3. Lost Wingman Procedures During Receiver AR. Depending on the makeup of
       the AR formation, it is possible that in the event of a breakaway, receiver aircraft may
       find themselves co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation. If, during a breakaway,
       the receiver aircraft loses sight of the tanker aircraft, ATP-56(B) requires the receiver
       aircraft to descend to an altitude 1000 feet below the tanker. In the event this places the
       receiver aircraft co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation and visual, A/A
       TACAN, TCAS, or radar contact with the co-altitude aircraft cannot be maintained,
       descend to an altitude that will provide positive separation from other aircraft and
       decrease airspeed to ensure lateral separation.
18.9. Formation Position Changes. Prior to executing any position change, the formation
leader must ensure all formation members understand the procedures to be followed for intra-
formation position changes. Formation position change procedures will be covered in the
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                      171


formation leader‘s briefing. Formation position changes should only be accomplished in straight
and level flight, and once initiated, they will take priority over all other activities. Comply with
the following when accomplishing formation position changes:
   18.9.1. Maintain radar and/or visual contact throughout the formation position change.
       18.9.1.1. If radar and visual contact are lost during a position change, maintain altitude,
       and advise formation lead contact has been lost. Ensure positive separation by any means
       available and do not attempt to rejoin the formation until positive radar or visual contact
       is established.
   18.9.2. Do not attempt to refuel receiver aircraft or obtain individual ARTCC clearances
   during formation maneuver and position changes.
   18.9.3. Altitude Changes. Ensure lateral separation between formation members prior to
   conducting altitude changes. Coordinate altitude changes over inter-plane frequency.
   18.9.4. Aircraft changing positions will assume the call sign of their new intra-formation
   position (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and formation leadership, if appropriate, when all aircraft
   are level at their new altitude and established in their new position. All aircraft will then
   acknowledge with their new intra-formation call sign. Aircraft will not change their
   individual call sign that is filed on the flight plan. Call sign of the flight will be the call sign
   of the lead aircraft, or as directed by ARTCC. The new lead aircraft will squawk the
   assigned mode 3, or as directed by ARTCC.
   18.9.5. VMC Position Change Procedures. The following procedures will be used to affect
   an aircraft lead or position change with other aircraft during VMC. All changes in heading,
   position, and altitude will be pre-briefed and coordinated on inter-plane frequency.
       18.9.5.1. Wingmen will maintain a minimum 1/2 mile in trail and descend or maintain
       500-foot altitude separation. The aircraft to assume the lead will move laterally
       (normally to the right) 1/2 mile. Use 15 degrees of bank to turn 15 degrees from heading
       then turn back to heading using 15 degrees of bank. The wingman will accelerate and
       pass the leader. Maintain 1/2 mile lateral separation.
       18.9.5.2. As the wingman passes the leader, the leader will pass the lead to the
       overtaking aircraft. The wingman will assume lead responsibilities and be directive for
       all formation members to climb, descend, or maintain altitude as required after positive
       visual separation is confirmed.
       18.9.5.3. When directed, the new wingman (old lead) will obtain or maintain a 500-foot
       altitude separation as required, place IFF to STBY or ATC OFF, notify the new lead
       when approaching position in-trail, and confirm his or her altitude. At this time, the new
       leader will decelerate to briefed airspeed.
       18.9.5.4. The wingman will assume trail position behind the leader and make a normal
       closure to proper position.
   18.9.6. IMC Position Change Procedures (Any Aircraft Moves to Lead). The following
   procedures will be used during IMC for position changes requiring any aircraft, or element,
   in the formation to move to the lead position. These procedures are applicable for 2- through
   6-ship IMC formation position changes.
172                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


      18.9.6.1. Lead determines the aircraft or element to move forward (maneuvering
      aircraft). The maneuvering aircraft or element will echelon (normally right) using
      approximately 30 degrees of bank and turning 30 degrees from formation heading. When
      30 degrees off heading, reverse the turn using approximately 30 degrees of bank and
      return to formation heading. This will provide an offset of approximately 2 NMs.
      18.9.6.2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft or element will
      accelerate forward, increasing airspeed a recommended 15 KIAS. The maneuvering
      aircraft or element should then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately 1
      1/4 NMs forward range from the original lead. When the maneuvering aircraft or
      element is in the forward echelon position and positive visual or electronic contact is
      established, conduct the required altitude changes.
         18.9.6.2.1. For 2 NM in-trail formations, the maneuvering aircraft or element will
         accelerate forward, increasing airspeed a recommended 30 KIAS. The maneuvering
         aircraft or element should then resume formation airspeed and stabilize approximately
         2 1/4 NMs forward range from the original lead.
      18.9.6.3. The maneuvering aircraft or element will then move into lead position using no
      more than 15 degree heading corrections.
      18.9.6.4. If applicable, the formation will then establish proper aircraft spacing. The
      formation lead should be advised by the last aircraft after the formation is reformed.
      Assume new intra-formation call signs (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and reset rotating
      beacon or strobe and navigation lights.
  18.9.7. IMC Position Change Procedures (Any Aircraft Moves to Trail). The following
  procedures will be used during IMC for position changes requiring any aircraft, or element,
  in the formation to move to the trail position. These procedures are applicable for 2- through
  6-ship IMC formation position changes.
      18.9.7.1. Lead determines the aircraft or element to move aft (maneuvering aircraft).
      The maneuvering aircraft or element will echelon (normally right) using approximately
      30 degrees of bank and turning 30 degrees from the formation heading. When 30 degrees
      off heading, reverse the turn using approximately 30 degrees of bank and return to
      formation heading. This will provide an offset of approximately 2 NMs.
      18.9.7.2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft or element will
      decelerate toward the end of the formation, decreasing airspeed a recommended 15
      KIAS. The maneuvering aircraft or element should then resume formation airspeed and
      stabilize approximately 3/4 NM aft of the last aircraft or element. When the maneuvering
      aircraft or element is in the aft echelon position and positive visual or electronic contact
      is established, formation lead directs required altitude changes.
         18.9.7.2.1. For 2 NM in-trail formations, the maneuvering aircraft or element will
         decelerate toward the end of the formation, decreasing airspeed a recommended 30
         KIAS. The maneuvering aircraft or element should then resume formation airspeed
         and stabilize approximately 1 3/4 NMs aft of the last aircraft.
      18.9.7.3. The maneuvering aircraft or element will then move into position using no
      more than 15 degree heading corrections.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                             173


       18.9.7.4. If applicable, the formation will then establish proper aircraft spacing. The
       formation lead should be advised by the last aircraft after the formation is reformed.
       Assume new intra-formation signs (TOGA 1, TOGA 2, etc.) and reset rotating beacon
       and strobe and navigation lights.
18.10. Formation Break-Up and Recovery. Formation separation procedures will be
thoroughly planned and briefed by the formation leader. Do not initiate formation separation
procedures without ATC approval.
   18.10.1. If formation descent and arrival is desired, detailed descent profile, airspeed
   reduction, and configuration procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
18.11. Mission Debriefing and Critique. A complete mission debriefing and critique should
be conducted by the formation leader following the mission.

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to all Air Force Aircrews, aeromedical evacuation (AE) aircrews
   and all management levels concerned with operations of the KC-10 aircraft. All operators
   involved in AE missions on KC-10 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. KC-10 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE-V3 series and 41-307, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final (see AFI 11-2KC-10 V3 for a more
   detailed list of PIC responsibilities). In matters of patient care, decisions of the Medical
   Crew Director (MCD) are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
 176                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable). Identify armed crewmembers (as required).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew throughout mission including enroute transportation, dining,
   billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, and egress considerations.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Boom Operator Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, (i.e. doors, emergency exits, etc).
   20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients
   by AECMs.
   20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.5.7. The BO will provide the MCD with an interphone cord when mission requirements
   allow. Ensure MCDs are provided instruction regarding the use of aircraft communication
   equipment and location of cargo/passenger compartment interphone jacks.
20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                   177


   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-
   loading.
   20.6.2. Assist BO/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. The MCD or designated AECM should monitor interphone (headset) during flight.
   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The charge medical technician (CMT) is responsible for all ground operations
   involved with patients. The CMT, in coordination with the boom operator, is responsible for
   vehicle movement and positioning around the aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
20.8. Aircraft Refueling.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients. Fuel servicing will not be accomplished with patients
   onboard the KC-10.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs) and operational AE missions,
   configure the aircraft during pre-flight per TO 1C-10(K)A-9 and AFI 11-2KC-10 V3
   Addenda A.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions. Use floor loading procedures outlined in paragraph 20.15
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin’s
   mission configuration. Seat ambulatory patients and attendants in KC-10 airline seats.
   20.9.4. Therapeutic Oxygen. Therapeutic oxygen is not an integral system on the KC-10
   aircraft. Use the Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PTLOX) system.
   20.9.5. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the
   event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the aircraft drop down/seat back or
   wall mounted Emergency Oxygen System, or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS).
   20.9.6. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. The four portable oxygen cylinders
   located in the crew bunks and one portable oxygen cylinder from the ARO will be made
   available for AE crew use. Bunk occupants will use EPOS in place of portable oxygen
   cylinders. Maximum number of personal in ARO will be two. If portable oxygen cylinders
   are not available, PBE’s may be used as portable oxygen.
   20.9.7. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.8. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
   20.9.9. The electrical cable assembly set (ECAS) provides an approved adapter (pigtail) for
   use on KC-10, 110vac/400hz electrical outlets. The adapter allows the "modified" avionics
   frequency converter to be connected to aircraft power. AE equipment is then plugged into
 178                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


   the frequency converter for use. AE personnel are required to coordinate with the boom
   operator prior to electrical outlet and converter use.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
   will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
   the number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to
   AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product
   special provisions rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions.
   Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for decision. Litter
   patients will be positioned forward of cargo pallets.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. PTLOX may be transported for positioning and de-positioning AE Crews. A
   maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously without Hazmat
   certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping more than six
   PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will prevent potential high
   concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is free from any oil or
   petroleum products.
   20.10.6. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
   with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
   will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
   must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
   cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
   transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
   contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
       20.10.6.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
       transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
       that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
       and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
       suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated “in place” or
       with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
       be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
       medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011                                                                179


       involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
       SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
       20.10.6.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key hubs
       to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
       patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
       below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
       decompression.
   20.10.7. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions except in
   extreme circumstances.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
   Fire Chief. NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance. If a medical emergency occurs during flight,
and is determined by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will
be requested. The PIC may request “AIR EVAC priority” for preferential ATC handling if a
delay will affect a patient’s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of
the flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC’s responsibility to use this option only for
bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF IMT 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Mission Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 a
   minimum of 30 minutes prior to estimated time of arrival.
20.14. Not Used.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of litter patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a
   time critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential.
   Maximum altitude for floor loaded litter patients is FL 350. Patients will have an EPOS pre-
   positioned on their litter when floor loaded. When floor loading litter patients is required,
   comply with the following.
       20.15.1.1. Patients will be floor loaded in the forward passenger area only. Patients are
       positioned with head toward the flight deck, longitudinally on the aircraft floor. Seats
       will need to be removed.
 180                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3 30 AUGUST 2011


       20.15.1.2. In the B or D configuration, a single litter may be placed on the aircraft
       centerline, replacing the first two rows of center seats. Refer to Figure 20.1
       20.15.1.3. Alternatively when in the D configuration, remove the two rows of seats
       immediately aft of the first row of outboard right seats. Refer to Figure 20.1 some
       medical equipment may be placed in the seats aft of the litter.
       20.15.1.4. Use A-7000 tie-down fittings in the seat tracks and 5000 lb tie-down devices.
       Shoring is not required, however the litters should be placed with metal stirrups in the
       seat tracks, or put protective material under the litter stirrups to protect the aircraft floor.
       Use one tie down device at the end of each litter.
       20.15.1.5. Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for additional floor loading litter
       procedures.

         AF FORM 4096, KC-10 RESTRAINT COMPUTATION WORKSHEET
                               INSTRUCTIONS

A3.1. General. The AF Form 4096 is an easy to use form to record and compute restraint
computations. The form contains all the necessary formulas. Simplified instructions follow. The
pallet diagram may be used to sketch out an item and draw the tie-down arrangement. When
used, label each tie-down device numerically.
A3.2. Enter the item weight.
A3.3. Compute vertical restraint requirement and enter its value.
A3.4. Compute FWD, AFT, LEFT, RIGHT, (all others), and enter the value.
A3.5. Take the applicable measurements and record in the appropriate columns. The column
labels correspond to the diagram above the columns.
   A3.5.1. When recording (D) FWD/AFT Effective Length, enter an A or F showing the
   direction of restraint provided.
   A3.5.2. When recording (E) Lateral Effective Length, enter an L or R showing the direction
   of restraint provided.
A3.6. Compute the VERTICAL restraint FIRST. If it is 2,500 pounds or GREATER, enter
2,500. If it is LESS THAN 2,500 pounds, enter the computed value.
A3.7. Based on the results of the Vertical computation, select the applicable formula, 7A or 7B,
and compute the Longitudinal and Lateral restraint.
A3.8. Record the applicable values in the blocks provided.
A3.9. Add the values of each column and enter the totals, TOTAL APPLIED RESTRAINT. If
the applied is LESS THAN the required, additional devices, or a different arrangement of
devices, is required.
