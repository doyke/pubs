                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Basic Philosophy and Enforceability.
   1.1.1. The Air Force philosophy is that the uniform will be plain, distinctive, and
   standardized. This standardization includes a minimum and maximum number of authorized
   badges, insignia, and devices.
   1.1.2. Pride in one‘s personal appearance and wearing the uniform, greatly enhances the
   esprit de corps essential to an effective military force. Therefore, it is most important for all
   Airmen to maintain a high standard of dress and personal appearance. The five elements of
   this standard are neatness, cleanliness, safety, uniformity, and military image. The first four
   are absolute, objective criteria needed for the efficiency and well-being of the Air Force. The
   fifth, military image is subjective, but necessary. Appearance in uniform is an important part
   of military image. Judgment on what is the proper image differs in and out of the military.
   The American public and its elected representatives draw certain conclusions on military
   effectiveness based on the image Airmen present. The image must instill public confidence
   and leave no doubt that Airmen live by a common standard and respond to military order and
   discipline. The image of a disciplined and committed Airman is incompatible with the
   extreme, the unusual, and the fad. Every Airman has a responsibility to maintain an
   ―acceptable military image,‖ as well as the right, within limits, to express individuality
   through his or her appearance.
   1.1.3. A very important part of the military image an Airman projects and the impression
   they create is how he/she wears their uniform. As with other personal appearance standards,
   the Air Force emphasizes a ―       neat, clean, professional‖ image. Member‘s have a
   responsibility to keep their uniform clean, pressed (excluding the Airman Battle Uniform)
   and in good repair. Also, members are responsible for knowing the authorized uniform
   combinations and the correct placement of ribbons, insignia, badges and other uniform items.
   1.1.4. Commanders do not have the authority to waive grooming and appearance standards
   except as identified in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.1.2.3 of this instruction.
1.2. Wear of the Air Force Uniform.
   1.2.1. Except when authorized to wear civilian clothes, Airmen will wear the appropriate Air
   Force uniform while performing military duties.
      1.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) .        The blue service uniform (class B) will be the duty
      uniform on Mondays for all Airmen assigned to HQ PACAF and NAF staffs. Installation
      supplement will determine the appropriate career fields and environments for wearing
      blues at the wing/base level. Commanders are expected to find occasions to meet the
      intent of this policy when weekly wear cannot be accommodated.
   1.2.2. Airmen assigned to non-Air Force organizations will wear the Air Force equivalent of
   the order of dress prescribed. For example, if the non-Air Force organization prescribes a
   utility uniform as the uniform of the day, assigned Airmen will wear the Air Force‘s utility
   uniform (i.e., Airman Battle Uniform or Battle Dress Uniform).
10                                         AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012


  1.2.3. Airmen attending a military event, either social or official, must wear the appropriate
  uniform or civilian attire as requested by the host/hostess or directed by the commander.
  1.2.4. Commanders will not direct the wear of optional items unless they are provided at no
  cost to Airmen. Commanders will not prohibit the wear of optional items, except when
  uniformity is required as identified in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.10.6 of this instruction.
  1.2.5. Airmen may alter uniform clothing to improve fit; however, alterations will not
  change the intended appearance or required function of the uniform as designed. Individuals
  may sew down unused pockets but no policy will be established to make it mandatory. Note:
  Maternity uniforms may be worn for up to six months after delivery
  1.2.6. Airmen who are separated (other than retired ANG or Reserve) with war time service
  and served honorably in the Air Force, may wear the uniform prescribed at the date of
  member‘s discharge or any of the uniforms authorized for current active duty personnel,
  including the dress uniforms . See paragraph 12.6.1
 1.2.7. Airmen who are separated (other than retired ANG or Reserve) without war time
 service, may wear the uniform from place of discharge to home, within three months after
 discharge. They will wear the highest rank authorized at the time of separation. See
 paragraph 12.6.2
 1.2.8. Airmen discharged for bad conduct, undesirability, unsuitability, inaptitude, or other
 than honorably will not wear the Air Force uniform upon discharge.
  1.2.9. While portraying a member of the Air Force, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture
  production may wear the uniform of the Air Force if the portrayal does not tend to discredit
  the armed forces. Refer to Title 10 U.S.C. Section 772 (f).
  1.2.10. While attending a course of military instruction conducted by the Army, Navy, Air
  Force, or Marine Corps. IAW AFI 36-801,Uniforms for Civilian Employees, a civilian may
  wear the Air Force uniform equivalent to the uniform prescribed by that armed force if the
  wear of such uniform is authorized by the Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
  Commander or sister service equivalent. If worn, civilians will conform to the same
  standards of appearance, practices, and conduct in uniform prescribed for active duty
  members.
  1.2.11. An instructor or member of the organized cadet corps of a state university or college,
  a public high school, or an educational institution having a regular course of military
  instruction in military science and tactics from a member of the Air Force may prescribe
  wear of an Air Force uniform if it includes distinctive insignia prescribed by the Secretary of
  the Air Force to distinguish it from the uniform worn by active duty, guard, and reserve
  Airmen. The uniform prescribed will not include insignia of rank the same as, or similar to,
  those prescribed for officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.
  1.2.12. Officers are authorized to wear the rank insignia of the next higher rank if they have
  been frocked to that rank. Refer to Title 10 U.S. Code Section 777 for details on being
  ―frocked‖ to the next higher rank. For ANG State Adjutant Generals, see Chapter 12,
  paragraph 12.2.5; all other Airmen in a ― Title 10‖ status will wear their federally recognized
  rank at all times.

   1.2.13. Authorized headgear will be worn while outdoors unless in an area designated as a

   Hawaii) any authorized combination of uniform, except the flight duty uniform, is

   1.3.5. Those choosing to wear civilian clothing in lieu of a uniform during official travel will
   ensure it is neat, clean, warm enough for in-flight operations, and appropriate for the mode of
   travel and destination. Examples of inappropriate clothing include: ripped, torn, frayed, or

   1.4.13. Air Force personnel may not wear their military uniforms when using frequent flyer
   miles to upgrade to business or first class. Thus, even when an upgrade to business or first
   class accommodations is legitimate, military personnel should avoid wearing the uniform to
   avoid the public perception of the misuse of government travel resources, which generates
   unnecessary complaints.
1.5. How Members Acquire Uniform Items.
   1.5.1. Officers and Enlisted Personnel.
      1.5.1.1. Purchase clothing items from the Army and Air Force Exchange Service
      (AAFES) Military Clothing Sales Stores (MCSS) supplied by the Defense Supply Center
      Philadelphia (DSCP). For optional items such as pumps, purses, etc, commercial vendors
      may be used.
      1.5.1.2. Do not purchase uniform items from unauthorized manufacturers—if it is not
      authorized or mentioned in this AFI, then it is not authorized for wear (Exception:
      Allowance Standard (AS) 016 items authorized by commander). The omission of a
      specific item or appearance standard does not automatically permit its wear.
   1.5.2. Officer Personnel. Procure and maintain all items necessary to meet standards of
   dress for assigned duties and mission requirements.
   1.5.3. Enlisted Personnel. Procure and maintain all mandatory clothing items listed in AFI
   36-3014, Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel. Request a civilian clothing
   allowance in accordance with AFI 36-3014, when required by competent authority to wear
   civilian clothes (for reasons such as safety or security) while performing assigned duties.

                                           Chapter 3

                     GROOMING AND APPEARANCE STANDARDS

3.1. Personal Grooming Standards. This chapter outlines personal grooming while wearing
any Air Force uniform or civilian clothing in an official capacity. Commander‘s discretion may
be used to determine if individual‘s personal grooming is within standards of this instruction.
Commanders do not have authority to waive grooming and appearance standards except as
identified in this instruction. The personal grooming standards listed are minimum standards that
represent common appearance issues and are not all-inclusive. Although Airmen have the right,
within established limits, to express their individuality through their appearance, the Air Force
has defined what is and what is not an acceptable, professional military image for Airmen.
Except for minor variations based on gender differences, all Air Force personnel must comply
with the same personal grooming standards. Supervisors have the responsibility to determine
compliance with the letter and intent of this AFI and to correct the obvious violations regardless
of whether the situation identified is clearly written in this AFI.
   3.1.1. Hair-male and female. Will be clean, well-groomed, present a professional
   appearance, allow proper wear of headgear, helmet or chemical mask and conform to safety
   requirements. Will not contain excessive amounts of grooming aids (e.g. gel, mousse,
   pomade, moisturizer), appear lopsided, touch either eyebrow, or end below an imaginary line
   across the forehead at the top of the eyebrows that is parallel to the ground. If applied, dyes,
   tints, bleaches and frostings must result in natural, human hair colors. The hair color must
   complement the member‘s complexion and skin tone. Examples of natural human hair colors
   are brown, blonde, brunette, natural red, black or grey. Prohibited examples (not all
   inclusive) are burgundy, purple, orange, fluorescent or neon colors. Exception: Commander
   may temporarily authorize cancer patients to wear approved caps (black/tan), wigs or
   maintain baldness due to a temporary medical condition (i.e., radiation/chemotherapy). If
   wigs are worn, they must comply with paragraph 3.1.1.1.
       3.1.1.1. Wigs/Hairpieces/Extensions. Will meet the same standard required for natural
       hair and will be of good quality, fit properly, and comply with safety, functionality and
       professionalism. Synthetic hair or other materials are not authorized when prohibited by
       safety and mission requirements.
       3.1.1.2. Hair-Nets. Worn as required for health or safety reasons. Made of natural or a
       synthetic material; must be conservative (plain and moderate, being within reasonable
       limits; not excessive or extreme), solid color similar to the member's hair color, also
       strong enough to support and control hair and contain no metal fasteners. Hair-nets are
       only authorized when performing related duties.
   3.1.2. Hair-Male. Tapered appearance on both sides and the back of the head, both with and
   without headgear. A tapered appearance is one that when viewed from any angle outlines the
   member's hair so that it conforms to the shape of the head, curving inward to the natural
   termination point without eccentric directional flow, twists or spiking. A block-cut is
   permitted with tapered appearance. Hair will not exceed 1¼ inch in bulk, regardless of length
   and ¼ inch at natural termination point; allowing only closely cut or shaved hair on the back
   of the neck to touch the collar. Hair will not touch the ears or protrude under the front band
18                                         AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012


  of headgear. Cleanly shaven heads, military high-and-tight or flat-top cuts are authorized.
  Prohibited examples (not all inclusive) are Mohawk, mullet, cornrows, dreadlocks or etched
  design. Men are not authorized hair extensions. See Figure 3.1 for sideburns, mustache and
  beard and for graphic examples of male hair standards.
     3.1.2.1. Sideburns. If worn, sideburns will be straight and even width (not flared), and
     will not extend below the bottom of the orifice of the ear opening. Sideburns will end in
     a clean-shaven horizontal line. See Figure 3-1, orifice of the ear opening is at reference
     point A.
     3.1.2.2. Mustaches. Male Airmen may have mustaches; however they will be
     conservative (moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or extreme) and
     will not extend downward beyond the lip line of the upper lip or extend sideways beyond
     a vertical line drawn upward from both corners of the mouth. See Figure 3-1, reference
     points B, C, and D.
     3.1.2.3. Beards. Beards are not authorized (exception in paragraph 3.1.2.3.1) unless for
     medical reasons, when authorized by a commander on the advice of a medical official. If
     commander authorizes, members will keep all facial hair trimmed not to exceed ¼ inch in
     length. Individuals granted a shaving waiver will not shave or trim any facial hair in such
     a manner as to give a sculptured appearance. Commanders and supervisors will monitor
     progress in treatment to control these waivers. If necessary for medical reasons, facial
     hair will be kept neat and conservative (moderate, being within required limits (not more
     than ¼ inch); not excessive or extreme), as defined by the local commander.
         3.1.2.3.1. During tours of less than 30 days, Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air
         National Guard (ANG) chaplains not on extended active duty may request a beard
         waiver for religious observance when consistent with their faith. For AFR waiver
         processing instructions see AFMAN 36-8001, Participation and Training
         Procedures. For ANG waiver process instructions contact ANG/HC.
AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                        19


Figure 3.1. Male Hair Grooming Standards.




   3.1.3. Hair-Female. Minimum length is one inch, unless approved by the commander upon
   recommendation from a military treatment facility for medical reasons, to a maximum bulk
   of three inches from scalp. Hair will end above the bottom edge of collar and any side of an
   invisible line drawn parallel to the ground. When in doubt, assess correct length of hair with
   Airman standing in the position of attention. Except in the physical training uniform (PTU),
20                                          AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012


  hair lengths that would be below the bottom edge of the collar will be pinned-up with no
  loose ends. Bangs will not touch either eyebrow, to include an invisible line drawn across
  eyebrows and parallel to the ground. If worn, hairpins, combs, headbands, elastic bands and
  barrettes must match the hair color (i.e., blonde, brunette, natural red, black, grey), but hair
  must still comply with bulk and appearance standards. Ornaments are not authorized (i.e.,
  ribbons, beads, jeweled pins). Scrunches are not authorized. See Figure 3.2, for women‘s
  hair. Exception: While wearing the PTU, long hair will be secured but may have loose ends
  and may extend below the collar; i.e. ponytails.
     3.1.3.1. The intent is for pinned-up hair to be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends
     from extending upward on the head. For example, when using a clip or hairpins, hair will
     not present the appearance of a ― rooster tail‖; when hair is in a bun, all loose ends must
     be tucked in and secured; when hair is in a pony tail, it must be pulled all the way through
     the elastic band and may hang naturally downward and not extending below the bottom
     of the collar (except while in the PTU). As with all hairstyles, a neat and professional
     image is essential.
     3.1.3.2. Braids, micro-braids and cornrows are authorized. However, they must be a
     natural looking color for human beings similar to the individual's hair color; conservative
     (moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or extreme) and not present a
     faddish appearance. A braid is three or more portions/strands of interwoven hair. When
     worn, multiple braids shall be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approx ¼
     inches), show no more than ¼ inch of scalp between the braids and must be tightly
     interwoven to present a neat, professional and well-groomed appearance. Braids must
     continue to the end of the hair in one direction, in a straight line, and may be worn loose
     or a secured style within hair standards in paragraph 3.1.3 above. Dreadlocks, (defined
     as long strands of hair that have been twisted closely from the scalp down to the tips;
     heavy matted coils of hair which form by themselves, eventually fusing together to form
     a single dread; or unkempt, twisted, matted individual parts of hair), shaved head, flat-
     tops and military high-and-tight cuts are not authorized hairstyles for female Airmen.
     3.1.3.3. Hair color, highlights, and frosting will not be faddish and will be natural
     looking hair color for human beings, similar to the individual‘s hair color (e.g. black,
     brunette, blond, natural red, and grey).
  3.1.4. Body Hair. Female Airmen will remove leg hair that is visibly protruding beyond the
  appropriate hosiery or causes a visibly uneven texture under hosiery.
AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                           21


Figure 3.2. Female Hair Grooming Standards




3.2. Fingernails. Male Airmen are not authorized to wear nail polish. If worn by females, nail
polish will be a single color that does not distinctly contrast with the female Airman‘s
complexion, detract from the uniform, or be extreme colors. Some examples of extreme colors
included, but are not limited to, purple, gold, blue, black, bright (fire engine) red and florescent
colors. Do not apply designs to nails or apply two-tone or multi-tone colors; however, white-tip
French manicures are authorized. Fingernails must not exceed ¼ inch in length beyond the tip of
the finger and must be clean and well-groomed. Fingernails must not interfere with the
performance of assigned duties. Fingernails must not hinder proper fit of prescribed safety
equipment or uniform items.
3.3. Cosmetics. Male Airmen are not authorized to wear cosmetics. Female Airmen may wear
cosmetics; however, if worn, they will be conservative (moderate, being within reasonable
limits; not excessive or extreme) and in good taste. Female Airmen will not wear shades of
lipstick that distinctly contrast with their complexion, that detract from the uniform, or that are
extreme colors. Some examples of extreme colors include but are not limited to, purple, gold,
blue, black, bright (fire-engine) red, and fluorescent colors. Cosmetics will not be worn during
field conditions.

3.4. Tattoos/Brands/Body Markings. For purposes of this instruction, a tattoo is defined as a
picture, design, or marking made on the skin or other areas of the body by staining it with an
indelible dye, or by any other method, including pictures, designs, or markings only detectible or
visible under certain conditions (such as ultraviolet or invisible ink tattoos). A brand is defined
as a picture, design, or other marking that is burned into the skin or other areas of the body.
Body markings are pictures, designs, or other markings as a result of using means other than
burning to permanently scar or mark the skin. Members who violate the prohibitions and
mandatory provisions in paragraphs 3.4.1 and 3.4.1.1, 3.4.2, and 3.4.2.1 are subject to
prosecution under Article 92, UCMJ.
   3.4.1. Tattoos/Brands/Body Markings. (Unauthorized content). Tattoos/brands/body
   markings anywhere on the body that are obscene, commonly associated with gangs,
   extremist, and/or supremacist organizations, or that advocate sexual, racial, ethnic, or
   religious discrimination are prohibited in and out of uniform. AFOSI maintains information
   regarding gang/hate group, etc. on tattoos/brands/body markings. Commanders should
   contact their servicing AFOSI unit for additional information. Tattoos/brands/body markings
   with unauthorized content that are prejudicial to good order and discipline or the content is of
   a nature that tends to bring discredit upon the Air Force are prohibited both in and out of
   uniform.
       3.4.1.1. Members who have or receive unauthorized content tattoos/brands/body
       markings are required to initiate tattoo/brand/body marking removal/alteration. At the
       commander‘s discretion, members may be seen, on a space and resource available basis,
       in a Department of Defense (DoD) medical treatment facility for voluntary
       tattoo/brand/body marking removal. When DoD resources are not available, members
       may have the tattoo/brand removed/altered at their own expense outside of DoD medical
       treatment facilities. Permissive TDY is not authorized for this purpose; therefore, travel
       is at member‘s expense.            Members who fail to remove/alter unauthorized
       tattoos/brands/body markings in a timely manner, or who choose not to comply with
       appropriate military standards, will be subject to a variety of appropriate quality force
       actions, including but not limited to reprimand, UIF, control roster, referral EPRs/OPRs,
       military justice action (Article 15, UCMJ punishment), ineligibility for schools and
       assignments and administrative discharge. If removal at government expense is not
       possible, the member‘s affirmative responsibility for complying with this AFI or the Air
       Force‘s responsibility to enforce it with any or all available options does not change.
   3.4.2. Tattoos/Brands/Body Markings (Excessive). Excessive tattoos/brands/body markings
   will not be exposed or visible (includes visible through the uniform) while wearing any/all
   uniform combination(s) except the PTU. This includes any combination of short sleeve, long
   sleeve, open collar uniform, utility uniform sleeves rolled up or worn down, flight duty
   uniform, etc. This policy does not apply when wearing the PTU. ―     Excessive‖ is defined as
   any tattoos/brands/body markings that exceed ¼ (25%) of the exposed body part and are
   readily visible when wearing any/all uniform combinations(s). The ―    exposed body part‖ is
   defined as the total area, to include front, sides and back of a limb or other body part
   protruding from a uniform item. For example, a tattoo exclusively on the hand cannot
   exceed 25% of the exposed hand since the hand is considered a separate body part when
   wearing a long sleeve uniform item. Any tattoos/brands above the collarbone, i.e. on the
   neck, head, face, tongue, lips, and/or scalp, are prohibited. For example, a tattoo/brand that
AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                            23


      can be seen on the neck while wearing an open collar, front-fastening, blue or utility uniform
      is prohibited. (For cosmetic tattoos see paragraph 3.4.3).
          3.4.2.1. When assessing excessive tattoos/brands/body markings, the member will be
          reviewed while standing at the position of attention. See figure 3.3 for a guide on how to
          measure. To preclude multiple measurements of the same tattoo, commanders should
          photograph borderline or questionable tattoos and document their findings on the Air
          Force Form 4428, Tattoo/Brand/Body Marking Screening/Verification Form (see
          Attachment 7). Both the photo and form will be included in the Airman‘s automated
          personnel records. Air Force members with excessive tattoos/brands/body markings are
          required to (a) maintain complete coverage of the tattoos/brands/body markings using
          current uniform items (e.g. long-sleeved shirt/blouse, pants/slacks, dark hosiery, etc.) or
          (b) remove or alter tattoo(s)/brand(s).

Figure 3.3. Tattoo Measurement Guide
Use the following calculation: (all measurements are to be done in inches; partial inches should
be rounded up to the nearest inch). Member will be measured standing at the position of
attention. If member has multiple tattoos/brands (T/B) that are clearly separate TBs, each will be
measured separately and the cumulative size of the TBs cannot exceed ¼ or 25% of the exposed
body part.
*Step 1- Measure the length of exposed body part.
Arm: measure bottom of shirt sleeve (includes all combinations of uniform items: rolled-up
ABU sleeve, blue shirt, etc.) to the tip of middle finger.
Hand: measure bottom of the long-sleeve shirt to tip of middle finger.
Leg: measure bottom of skirt to top of ankle.
Step 2-           Measure the width of the T/B at its widest point.
Step 3-           Multiply length by width to determine total square inches of the T/B.
Step 4-           Use Figures 1 and 2 above as a guide to measure the exposed body part (arm,
hand, leg).
#1-           Measure the length of exposed body part.
Arm: measure bottom of shirt sleeve (includes all combinations of uniform items:
rolled up ABU/BDU sleeve, blue shirt, etc.) to the tip of middle finger.
Hand: measure bottom of the long-sleeve shirt to tip of middle finger.
Leg: measure bottom of skirt to top of ankle.
#2-        Determine the widest point within the length of the exposed body part. At that point
measure the circumference of the exposed body part. For the hand, this includes both sides.
Step 5-           Multiply #1 by #2 to determine total square inches of the exposed body part.
Step 6-       Divide the total square inches of exposed body part by 4. This figure will be ¼ or
25% of the exposed body part.
Step 7-       Compare the results of Step 3 and Step 6. If the result of Step 3 is a smaller
number than the result of Step 6, the TB does not exceed ¼ or 25% of the exposed body part.

     3.4.2.2. Members who have or receive excessive tattoos/brands/body markings after the
     date of this publication are required to initiate tattoo/brand removal/alteration (unless
     authorized to cover). At the commander‘s discretion, members may be seen, on a space
     and resource available basis, in a Department of Defense (DoD) medical treatment
     facility for voluntary tattoo/brand removal. When DoD resources are not available,
     members may have the tattoo/brand removed/altered at their own expense outside of DoD
     medical treatment facilities. Permissive TDY is not authorized for this purpose;
     therefore, travel is at member‘s expense. Members who fail to remove/alter unauthorized
     tattoos/brands/body markings in a timely manner, or who choose not to comply with
     appropriate military standards, will be subject to a variety of appropriate quality force
     actions, including but not limited to reprimand, UIF, control roster, referral EPRs/OPRs,
     military justice action (Article 15, UCMJ punishment), ineligibility for schools and
     assignments and administrative discharge. That removal at government expense might
     not be possible does not change the member‘s affirmative responsibility for complying
     with this AFI or the Air Force‘s responsibility to enforce it with any or all available
     options.
  3.4.3. Cosmetic tattooing. Tattooing for cosmetic purposes is authorized when directed by
  licensed, qualified medical personnel to correct a medical condition, illness or injury for both
  men and women. When not medically directed, cosmetic tattooing is permitted for women if
  done to apply permanent facial makeup (i.e. eyebrows, eye liner); the cosmetic tattooing
  must have a natural appearance and be conservative, moderate, within reasonable limits, not
  excessive or extreme, not distinctly contrast with their complexion, and in good taste.
  3.4.4. Initial accessions must disclose any tattoos/brands and receive appropriate Air Force
  Component Recruiting Service review (AFRS, AFRCRS, ANG) to determine eligibility
  when questionable for enlistment or appointment.            Complete removal/alteration of
  unauthorized content and/or excessive tattoos/brands/body markings is otherwise required
  prior to being accepted in the Air Force.
  3.4.5. Commanders will use these provisions in determining the acceptability of
  tattoos/brands/body markings displayed by members in uniform. Failure to observe these
  mandatory provisions and prohibitions by active duty Air Force members, USAFR members
  on active duty or inactive duty for training and ANG members in federal service is a
  violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In addition, failure to
  comply with the AFI also subjects the member to adverse administrative sanctions.
  3.4.6. MAJCOM/CCs may impose more restrictive standards for tattoos/brands/body
  markings and body ornaments, on or off duty, in those locations where Air Force-wide
  standards may not be adequate to address cultural sensitivities (e.g., overseas). Additionally,
  MAJCOM/CCs may impose more restrictive standards on those performing highly visible
  special mission requirements or special duty positions (e.g.; more restrictive standards for
  permanently assigned recruiters, reserve officer training corps (ROTC) cadre, Officer
  Training School (OTS) cadre, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) cadre, Military
  Training Instructors (MTI), Military Training Leaders (MTL), instructors in any training
  environment, etc.).

   objects, articles, jewelry or ornamentation to or through the ear, nose, tongue, eye brows,
   lips, or any exposed body part (includes visible through the uniform).
   3.5.2. In civilian attire on official duty on or off a military installation: With the exception
   of earrings for women (see paragraphs 6.3.1.1), all members are prohibited from attaching,

   nose, tongue, eye brows, lips, or any exposed body part (includes visible through clothing).
   3.5.3. In civilian attire off duty on a military installation: With the exception of earrings for
   women (see paragraphs 6.3.1.1) and areas in and around military family and privatized
   housing, all Air Force members are prohibited from attaching, affixing and/or displaying
   objects, articles, jewelry or ornamentation to and/or through the ear, nose, tongue, eye brows,
   lips, or any exposed body part (includes visible through clothing).
       3.5.3.1. (Added-PACAF) . In civilian attire, off duty, and NOT on a military
       installation. There are no prohibitions under these circumstances.
   3.5.4. Dental ornamentation: Teeth, whether natural, capped, or veneered, will not be
   ornamented with designs, jewels, initials, etc. The use of yellow gold, white gold, or
   platinum caps (permanent or temporary) merely to add ornamentation to the teeth and not
   required by dental/medical necessity is prohibited. Waivers are not required for Air Force
   members or recruits with permanent yellow gold, white gold or platinum caps that were
   applied as a result of dental/medical necessity. Members with official documentation that
   they received permanent yellow gold, white gold, or platinum caps which were not applied as
   a result of dental/medical necessity, prior to 13 June 2011, are grandfathered. No other
   dental ornamentation is grandfathered.
       3.5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) .     Commanders can document grandfathered dental
       ornamentation on the Air Force Tattoo/Brand/Body Marking Screening/Verification
       Form (AF Form 4428).
   3.5.5. There are situations where the commander can restrict the wear of non-visible body
   ornaments. Those situations would include any body ornamentation that interferes with the
   performance of the member‘s military duties. The factors to be evaluated in making this
   determination include, but are not limited to: impairs the safe and effective operation of
   weapons, military equipment or machinery; poses a health or safety hazard to the wearer or
   others; or interferes with the proper wear of special or protective clothing or equipment
   EXAMPLE: helmets, flak jackets, flight duty uniforms, camouflaged uniforms, gas masks,
   wet suits and crash rescue equipment).
3.6. Body Alteration/Modification. Intentional alterations and/or modifications to a members
body that result in a visible, physical effect that disfigures, deforms or otherwise detracts from a
professional military image are prohibited. Examples of prohibited conduct include (but are not
limited to) tongue splitting or forking, tooth filing, acquiring visible, disfiguring skin implants,
and gouging (piercing holes large enough to permit light to shine through.)

  3.6.1. Members who intentionally alter and/or modify any part of their bodies in order to
  achieve a visible, physical effect that disfigures, deforms or otherwise detracts from a
  professional military image may be subject to disciplinary action or involuntary separation,
  as determined appropriate by the member‘s commander. Failure to observe these mandatory
  provisions and prohibitions by active duty Air Force members, USAFR members on active
  duty or inactive duty for training and ANG members in Federal service is a violation of
  Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

5.1. Airman Battle Uniform (ABU), Men’s, Women’s, and Maternity. The ABU replaces
both the temperate and hot weather BDU and the desert camouflage uniform. ABUs may be
worn off base for short convenience stops and when eating at restaurants where people wear
comparable civilian attire. Do not wear ABUs off base to eat in restaurants where most diners
wear business attire or at establishments that operate primarily to serve alcohol. Do not starch or
hot press the ABU. Light ironing and center creasing of enlisted chevrons is authorized;
however, repeated hot pressing or heavy ironing will accelerate the overall wear of the fabric.
ABUs purchased by Air Force personnel through Army Air Force Exchange Stores (AAFES)
Military Clothing Sales Stores (MCSS), or issued through Individual Equipment Elements or
contract equivalent, are certified as fully compliant with all specifications. No other suppliers
are approved for organizational/unit purchases, or any appropriated or GWOT funds
expenditures. If personnel choose to use personal funds to purchase from non-AAFES suppliers,
the Air Force is not responsible if the uniform is not fully compliant. Females may wear the
male version of the ABU. NOTE: The 100% cotton ABU is not a ‗summer weight‘ version or
‗light weight‘ alternative for the 50% cotton/50% nylon ABU. The 100% cotton ABU is a
distinctive uniform/equipment item developed and authorized specifically for Airmen in jobs that
have occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) requirements for wear. It is not
authorized or intended for wear by all Airmen.
   5.1.1. ABU Coat (Shirt). The mandatory phase in date for the ABU is 1 November 2011.
   The ABU coat will be 50% nylon and 50% cotton, with button fastenings and an Air Force
   digitized tiger stripe print. The bottom of the ABU coat will rest at the hips. Pockets will be
   secured and items stowed in pockets will not be visible except pens stowed in the pen pocket
   on the sleeve. The top button of the ABU coat will not be fastened; however, all other
   buttons will be secured at all times. Commanders may authorize sleeves to be rolled up on
   the ABU coat; however, the cuffs will remain visible and the sleeve will rest at, or within 1
   inch of, the forearm when the arm is bent at a 90-degree angle. Regardless as to whether the
   sleeves are rolled up or unrolled, the cuffs will remain visible at all times. The ABU coat
   may be removed in immediate work area as determined appropriate by local leadership,
   however, the ABU coat will be worn while interacting with customers/clients. When ABU
   coat is removed, t-shirt (ref paragraph 5.1.3) will be worn. The maternity ABU coat may be
   worn if medically necessary, as determined by competent medical authorities at a military or
   civilian treatment facility and approved by the commander.
       5.1.1.1. Officer Rank Insignia (see Attachment 2). Officers will wear subdued metal or
       cloth rank on the collar. General Officer rank will be centered, perpendicular to, and
       begin 1 inch from the bottom of the collar. General officers will wear 1 inch stars;
       General Officers unable to wear 1 inch stars will wear ¾ inch stars. Colonel rank will be

     must be distinguishable.

        cyberspace badges become optional. All other occupational badges are optional. If
        chaplain badge is worn in conjunction with aeronautical, space or cyberspace badge,
        then the chaplain‘s badge will be in the highest position. Aeronautical, space and

        and cyberspace badges, wear the badge that reflects current job or billet in the highest
        position. Parachutist wings are optional; however, when worn they will be placed

   9.12.1. Airmen may request a waiver to permit wear of neat and conservative (defined as,
   discreet, tidy, and not dissonant or showy in style, size, design, brightness, or color) religious
   apparel. Items may not temporarily or permanently be affixed or appended to any authorized
   article of the uniform. Commanders must grant requests for accommodation of religious
   practices unless they determine and articulate that a ― compelling‖ (i.e., especially important)
   governmental (not just Air Force) interest takes precedence over the requested
   accommodation. If approved, waivers grant the religious accommodation only at the current
   installation of assignment. Authorization does not extend to temporary duty (TDY) or
   subsequent permanent duty assignment locations.
   9.12.2. Military interests in standardized dress and appearance are generally substantial and
   commanders should take the following historic, well-understood functions of and
   considerations about uniforms into account when considering requests for uniform- and dress
   and appearance-related religious accommodation:
       9.12.2.1. Uniforms indicate combatant status under the international laws of armed
       conflict by distinguishing military members of the armed forces from civilians and other
       noncombatants.
       9.12.2.2. In the military culture, uniforms and dress and appearance standards foster a
       strong sense of unit cohesion with consequent positive impact on morale, good order, and
       discipline.
       9.12.2.3. Uniforms and dress and appearance standards, which are traditionally neat and
       conservative, symbolize subordination of self and personal interests to military service
       and national defense interests and to command and ultimately civilian authority.
       9.12.2.4. Uniforms and dress and appearance standards are a powerful symbol to the
       public, whose confidence in the military services in general and in military members in
       particular, is a function of all of the foregoing.
       9.12.2.5. Deviation from standards can be perceived by military members and civilians
       alike as challenge to authority and/or as evidence of disrespect or malcontent. It is
       immaterial whether that conclusion is perceived or real when public confidence in the
       military or service member confidence in the authority or command and/or threat to unit
       cohesion appears to have been undermined. Deviations from standards are inherently
       conspicuous and ―  send a signal‖ of individuality whether intentional or not.
       9.12.2.6. In joint and multi-service environments, a permissive approach to adherence to
       uniforms and dress and appearance standards by one service, whether real or perceived,
       can negatively impact services which adhere to more restrictive standards.
AFI 36-2903_PACAFSUP_I 16 OCTOBER 2012                                                     131


     9.12.2.7. Safety; interference of religious item with wear of protective gear; danger to
     equipment posed by religious gear (e.g., loose fitting items are not permitted around
     aircraft).
     9.12.2.8. Performance of military duties can be hindered by ad hoc additions to the
     uniform or modifications of dress and appearance.
  9.12.3. Religious Apparel Waivers.
     9.12.3.1. Airmen may submit a letter addressed to the installation commander (or
     equivalent) through their chain of command. The request letter includes a photo or
     description of the item, unit commander‘s endorsement, and installation chaplain‘s
     endorsement.
     9.12.3.2. The installation chaplain ensures a base chaplain interview the Airmen to
     assess whether the apparel is in keeping with the doctrinal or traditional observances of
     the member‘s faith. The installation chaplain endorses the Airman‘s letter with those
     findings.
     9.12.3.3. Unit commanders endorse the request and address affect on health or safety and
     impact on duties of the Airman. Recommendations for disapproval should be unusual
     unless for safety or when precluded by a ―       compelling‖ (i.e., especially important)
     governmental (not just Air Force) interest that takes precedence over the requested
     accommodation. Requests should normally be recommended for approval unless
     approval would have an adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, standards, or
     discipline. When requests are precluded by military necessity, commanders and
     supervisors should seek reasonable alternatives.
     9.12.3.4. Force Support Squadrons forward the member‘s letter and photo or description
     of the item to the installation commander and, if appropriate, to the Airman‘s
     MAJCOM/FOA A1 or, if in a joint environment, to the J1 as applicable.

  concealed under military headgear.
     9.12.4.1. Installation commanders may approve requests for wear of religious head
     coverings indoors that are plain and dark blue or black and minimally conspicuous.
     ― Minimally conspicuous‖ mean that the religious headgear is neat and conservative and
     would not, in the commander‘s judgment, draw the focus of an observers‘ attention from
     the uniform as a whole. Also, it does not impair the ability to readily assess compliance
     with hair standards, and can fit under the appropriate uniform headgear. Denials of
     requests for internal workplace wear of minimally conspicuous headgear must be
     forwarded for service headquarters review. Forward complete package through the
     MAJCOM, FOA or DRU A1 to AF/A1S.workflow@pentagon.af.mil to arrive within
     ten calendar days of initial denial. Final review by AF/A1S shall occur within 30
     calendar days following the date of initial denial for cases arising in the United States,
     and within 60 calendar days for all other cases. Exceptions to these deadlines shall be
     limited to exigent circumstances. Airmen are obliged to comply with orders prohibiting
     wear of questionable items of religious apparel pending completion of this review.

      9.12.5.2. AF/A1S recommends approval or disapproval and forwards the request to the
      AF/A1 who approves or disapproves the request. AF/A1S returns the request to the
      MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU A1 to forward to the servicing Force Support Squadron who
