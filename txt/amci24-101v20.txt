1. TRQ - Quality Assurance (QA) Air Transportation Standardization Evaluation
(ATSEV)
     1.1. General Concepts. Air transportation quality and reliability is the responsibility of all
     air transportation personnel. The combined efforts of quality assurance personnel, air
     transportation leaders, and specialists are necessary to ensure high quality process
     performance and reliability. Air transportation leaders are responsible for excellence, safety,
     and quality process performance. The TRQ (ATSEV) staff evaluates the quality of air
     transportation process and task performance within the air transportation organization and
     performs necessary functions to manage the organization’s Quality Assurance program - Air
     Transportation Standardization Evaluation. The ATSEV program provides an objective
     sampling of both the quality of processes and the qualifications of air transportation
     personnel. The ATSEV staff serves as the primary technical advisory agency in the air
     transportation organization, helping supervisors and commanders resolve quality problems.
     The evaluation and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are key functions of quality
     assurance. This activity identifies underlying causes of poor quality and non-standardization
     in air transportation processes. By finding causes of problems and recommending corrective
     actions to supervisors, ATSEV personnel can significantly affect the quality of air
     transportation processes within the air transportation organization. The qualities of air
     transportation processes and personnel proficiency are validated through the ATSEV
     program and shall be recorded using the ATSEV quality assurance database managed by HQ
     AMC/A4TR. Contracted organizations shall use the accepted quality program outlined in
AMCI24-101V20 12 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  3


   their respective contract. If required, submit in writing a request for waiver of any
   requirements of this publication to HQ AMC/A4TR. Waiver request for a Command Process
   Evaluation List (CPEL) task due to unavailability of equipment or work center is not
   required.
       1.1.1. Purpose. The TRQ staff (ATSEV) is to provide commanders and HQ AMC/A4T
       with an assessment of a unit’s ability to perform key air transportation processes ensuring
       standardized, repeatable, technically compliant process execution, while promoting a
       culture of professional excellence and personal responsibility.
       1.1.2. Objective. ATSEV provides the tools to train and evaluate air transportation
       personnel and processes to a single standard. Specific program objectives are to:
          1.1.2.1. Ensure standardized duty position qualification training and performance.

      2.9.10. Provide the unit’s ATSEV Manager a review of QTPs as outlined by HQ
      AMC/A4TR.
3. Program Guidance.
   3.1. Evaluations are AMC’s formal avenue to ensure the effectiveness of air transportation
   processes and identify areas for improvement. They provide leadership with factual
   information about the health and effectiveness of the unit and training. Accurate assessments
   of personnel proficiency and processes are critical to gauging unit effectiveness. This
   program is intended to enhance cross-tell and facilitate benchmarking, while allowing
   latitude to adapt it for local needs.
   3.2. Process evaluations are assessments of procedures required to accomplish the unit’s
   mission. Every effort should be made to conduct personnel evaluations (PEs) of available
   personnel while they are performing their daily transportation duties without disruption of the
   normal work schedule. The focus is on efficient and effective completion of tasks and
   processes within command standards. Safety is inherent in all processes and an integral part
   of evaluations. Whenever safety is compromised, leadership will apply risk management
   principles to prevent mishaps. This may include risk assessments or job safety analysis in
   accordance with AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program or apply an
   increased focus by ATSEV within tasks/processes involved.
      3.2.1. Air Transportation personnel involved in performing the process are subject to
      evaluation. This includes senior NCOs and civilians.
      3.2.2. When conducting evaluations an equal number will be accomplished on each shift
      whenever possible based on workload/operating hours.
      3.2.3. There are four categories of evaluation and three categories of observation:
      Evaluations are Personnel Evaluation (PE), Quality Verification Inspection (QVI),
      Special Inspection (SI), and Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE). Observations are
      Detected Safety Violation (DSV), Technical Data Violation (TDV), and Unsatisfactory
      Condition Report (UCR). Based on the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) PEs QVIs, SIs
      and EPEs will be rated PASS/FAIL.
          3.2.3.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE) are an over the shoulder evaluation of a specific
          individual or team of individuals while actually performing a task. The evaluator
          may start and/or stop the evaluation at any step in the task if a safety issue is
          discovered and further process completion could result in harm to an individual, an
          aircraft delay, and/or damage to equipment. Evaluations will accurately assess the
          proficiency of each individual under evaluation. However, in the case of a team
          evaluation, the success or failure of the evaluation will be assessed against the task
          supervisor.
          3.2.3.2. Quality Verification Inspections (QVI) are an after-the-fact assessment
          following a process or task to verify the proper completion of that action. QVI like
          PE, are attributable to a specific individual or team of individuals and will follow the
          same rules for assignment of a passed/failed inspection as those outlined for a PE.
          Because they are assigned to a specific individual or team of individuals, QVI will be
AMCI24-101V20 12 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              11


        conducted only when reasonable assurance can be obtained through personal
        observation or inference that the environment in which the task was originally
        completed has not been significantly altered.
        3.2.3.3. Special Inspections (SI) are inspections not otherwise covered by QVI or PE.
        SI may include, but are not limited to, vehicle and equipment forms inspection, files,
        housekeeping, etc. Generally, individuals are not assigned responsibility in regards to
        an SI, because they are unknown or identification would be inappropriate.
        3.2.3.4. Detected Safety Violations (DSV) are observations of an unsafe act
        committed by an individual not undergoing a PE at the time. The evaluator will stop
        the unsafe act immediately and notify the individual’s supervisor.
        3.2.3.5. Technical Data Violations (TDV) are observations of any person (not
        undergoing a PE at the time) performing a task without proper technical data
        available and/or in use. The evaluator will stop the task being performed immediately
        and notify the individual’s supervisor.
        3.2.3.6. Unsatisfactory Condition Reports (UCR) are an observed unsafe or
        unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, which cannot be assigned to a specific
        individual; however, it can be charged to a specific work center. Document these
        types of inspection discrepancies as a UCR rather than a DSV when it is not possible
        to determine who created the unsafe condition.
        3.2.3.7. The ATSEV Ratings Standard will be used by an Aerial Port member of the
        LCAP Team designated by the APS Team Lead to evaluate the ATSEV function.
        Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPEs) of ATSEV evaluators and will also be
        conducted by an Aerial Port member of the LCAP Team designated by the APS Team
        Lead. EPEs can consist of an over-the-shoulder evaluation of an ATSEV evaluator
        conducting a PE, an evaluator being asked to accomplish the process themselves,
        and/or an after-the-fact follow-up of a QVI conducted by an ATSEV evaluator.
        Additionally, ATSEV personnel are subject to DSV and TDV observations.
     3.2.4. Rating Criteria. Assign one of the following ratings to every process evaluation:
        3.2.4.1. PASS. A pass rating indicates the process/task met or exceeded the
        acceptable standard.
        3.2.4.2. FAIL. A fail rating indicates the process/task did not meet minimum
        standards due to exceeding the minor finding AQL or identifying a major finding. A
        minor finding is an unsatisfactory condition that requires correction, but does not
        endanger personnel, affect safety of flight, jeopardize equipment reliability, or
        warrant discontinuing a process. Aerial Port AQL is two for all of our tasks. A
        major finding is an unsatisfactory condition that does not qualify as a minor finding.
        Conditions that would warrant a DSV, TDV, or UCR rating during an observation are
        considered major findings and are rated as a fail during a PE.
        3.2.4.3. A DSV/TDV rating indicates an OBSERVATION of a process/task that did
        not meet acceptable standards due to major findings in the areas of safety or technical
        data violations. A major finding is a condition that would endanger personnel,
        jeopardize equipment reliability, warrant discontinuing the process, or that could
12                                                   AMCI24-101V20 12 FEBRUARY 2013


        result in process failure. When a DSV/TDV condition is observed, correct it
        immediately. Under no circumstance will a safety or equipment reliability error go
        uncorrected. The evaluator will consider the seriousness of the error when deciding
        whether or not the member(s) performing the process and the evaluation should
        continue.
        3.2.4.4. A UCR rating indicates the OBSERVATION of an unsafe or unsatisfactory
        condition and it is not possible to determine individual responsibility.
     3.2.5. Suspense evaluations receiving a fail, DSV, TDV or UCR to the appropriate work
     center for corrective action(s). All evaluations defined in this paragraph will be routed
     and returned to the unit’s ATSEV Manager within 5 duty days. Work centers will
     respond to all findings by stating the action taken/planned to resolve the identified
     problem(s) to include an “implementation date or estimate closure date” if applicable.
     Work center responses to findings will be reviewed by the superintendent, flight chief
     and Ops Officer before the ATSEV-QA application suspense date. Unit commanders
     will be briefed on work centers not meeting the suspense and open/closed items monthly.
     3.2.6. Evaluators must review all individuals’ TBA Records for any evaluations
     receiving a fail, DSV or TDV to verify training documentation (i.e., have individuals
     been trained, etc.). Periodically review records of those rated pass (as time permits).
     Identify discrepancies in documentation to the unit training manager for follow-up action.
     At no time will the evaluation ratings be changed based on TBA Record documentation
     discrepancies alone.
     3.2.7. Results of all evaluations will be recorded in the ATSEV evaluations application
     or using the manual reporting method when the ATSEV evaluations application is down.
     Failure to provide data due to computer downtimes and/or problems will not be an
     acceptable reason during unit inspections.
     3.2.8. Evaluations that are rated FAIL and all observations will include a reference to the
     technical order, instruction, and/or command standard violated. Evaluators will review
     evaluation results with the person(s)/supervisor evaluated upon completion of each
     evaluation, and welcome challenges to the factual determination of any given finding.
     3.2.9. Command Process Evaluation List (CPEL). The CPEL is a HQ AMC/A4T
     managed/directed list of critical and non-critical (basic) processes requiring evaluation
     within an air transportation unit. Critical tasks are those which should be assessed more
     often than other tasks. Units must evaluate non-critical processes at least once every
     three months and critical processes monthly unless waived by HQ AMC/A4TR. Current
     CPEL is available at HQ AMC/A4TR web site.
     3.2.10. Command Performance Standard (CPS). The CPS is a command directed task
     compliance and/or performance tool developed to clarify or establish standards for air
     transportation tasks not covered in current AMC Aerial Port guidance. The CPS also
     provides the staff an avenue to address policy shortfalls or A4T interpretation of guidance
     affecting the field. The CPS will be utilized by ATSEV evaluators, trainers, and the
     LCAP inspection team to evaluate individual/team process compliance. ATSEV
     evaluators will determine unit compliance with tasks/processes governed by a CPS and
     enter the results in the ATSEV evaluation application. (See Attachment 4.)
AMCI24-101V20 12 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 13


          3.2.10.1. CPS may be developed by any HQ AMC/A4T staff member and submitted
          to the HQ AMC ATSEV Program Manager.
4. AMC Program Administration/Execution.
   4.1. Commanders are vital to a successful ATSEV program. They establish a separate duty
   section dedicated to the ATSEV quality assurance program. Additional duties must be
   minimized. Additional duties will not take priority over management/evaluation requirements
   of the ATSEV program.
      4.1.1. Manning for the TRQ - ATSEV office is based on assigned personnel. A
      minimum of two 2T2 personnel are required to ensure evaluating all areas of the CPEL is
      possible. One additional person is required for every 50 assigned personnel.
          4.1.1.1. Commanders of small active duty units with 50 or less permanently assigned
          air transportation personnel (including civilian and foreign nationals) are not required
          to establish an ATSEV function; however, personnel are still required to train and
          perform to the QTP standard as directed by AMCI 24-101, Volume 22. Commanders
          that elect to establish an ATSEV function will fully comply with this instruction.
          Units that are not required to maintain an ATSEV function under this instruction are
          still subject to inspection.
   4.2. Evaluators should represent a cross-section of aerial port personnel who are highly
   motivated with above-average communicative skills and a record of excellence. To avoid
   potential conflicts of interest, evaluators will, whenever possible, be assigned to the ATSEV
   program manager for reporting purposes.
      4.2.1. ATSEV evaluators will serve for a minimum of one year, but no longer than 3
      years. Commanders should establish a rotation policy to ensure expertise flows in and
      out of the ATSEV office without disrupting continuity. (Note: Remote (12 month)
      locations are not required to comply with the minimum requirement)
