                                             Chapter 1

                               PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

1.1. Purpose of AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services. Contracted services comprise a
significant portion of Air Force mission support resources. They provide support in diverse
mission areas such as information technology; flight line and depot maintenance; base
operations; advisory and assistance services to our acquisition and logistics managers; and
healthcare. Proper management of these contracted services from requirements definition
through contract execution is critical to Air Force mission success and enhances our ability to
maximize the efficiency of Air Force resources. This AFI will help our mission owners (i.e.
functional commanders and functional directors (FC/FD)) and their program/project leads
become demanding customers. Collectively, we must ensure contractors provide services that
meet all contractual requirements. This AFI defines the responsibilities, reviews/approvals and
performance expectations of all participants responsible for acquiring services in a Better Buying
Power (BBP) environment where expectations are to increase utilization of small businesses in
services while ensuring the exacting delivery of contractor promised performance. The products
and processes may be extensively tailored to meet Services Designated Official (SDO) needs but
shall remain consistent with the intent of this instruction.
     1.1.1. This instruction defines the requirements approval, service acquisition oversight and
     management processes to ensure service requirements are properly vetted and periodically
     re-validated to most efficiently utilize limited Air Force resources. Though requirements
     definition or outsourcing processes are not covered in depth in this instruction, the processes
     herein shall be used in conjunction with sound requirements definition processes and those
     which would govern the proper use of various types of manpower resources.
     1.1.2. Overview. There are three resource components responsible for accomplishing the
     Air Force mission: military personnel, agency civilians, and contractor personnel. Contractor
     support covers a wide range of missions and mission support areas. FAR 37 defines a service
     acquisition contract as one that directly engages the time and effort of a contractor, whose
     primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather than to furnish an end item of
     supply. Mission commanders and FCs/FDs are responsible for contracted services associated
     with their assigned mission. As such, they execute specified management and oversight
     responsibilities of the acquisition process and provide oversight for delivery of acquired
     services.
        1.1.2.1. Objectives. Acquired services shall support and enhance the war-fighting
        capabilities of the Air Force and the Unified Commands.
            1.1.2.1.1. Acquired services shall be based on clear, performance-based requirements
            to the maximum extent practicable; include identifiable and measurable cost,
            schedule, and performance outcomes consistent with mission owner requirements;
            receive adequate planning; and provide for active management by a multi-functional
            team (MFT) to ensure achievement of defined outcomes in cost, schedule and
            performance.
            1.1.2.1.2. Services shall be obtained in the most cost-effective manner, under full and
            open competitive procedures and/or small business set-aside competitions (based on
AFI63-138 21 MAY 2013                                                                           5


        Air Force-wide market intelligence) to the maximum extent practicable.
        Requirements definition and approval must consider socio-economic goals and
        statutes, and must mitigate potential conflicts of interest. Selection of contract type is
        a critical aspect of the planning process and serves to incentivize proper contractor
        performance behaviors and cost control. See Chapter 4 for additional information.
     1.1.2.2. Authorities.
        1.1.2.2.1. Service Acquisition Executive (SAE). Pursuant to HAF Mission Directive
        1-10, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) serves as the
        SAE at the direction of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF). The SAE is
        responsible for establishing management structures to ensure effective
        implementation of service acquisition policy.
        1.1.2.2.2. Single Manager for Services (SMS). The SAE has chosen to utilize a SMS
        for establishing management structures to ensure effective implementation of service
        acquisition policy. SMS responsibilities are defined in paragraph 2.3.
        1.1.2.2.3. Services Designated Official (SDO). SDO authority delegations are
        identified in Table 1.1. SDO responsibilities are defined in paragraph 2.7.
        1.1.2.2.4. Service Advocate (SA). The SA serves as the direct representative of
        AFPEO/CM and acts as a liaison with the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.
     1.1.2.3. Process.
        1.1.2.3.1. Pre-Award. The success of contracted services depends largely on the
        preparation and planning conducted prior to solicitation and award.
            1.1.2.3.1.1. Requirement Approval. Following preliminary market research, the
            acquisition team formulates a solution for the mission requirement. When the
            solution is to contract for a service, senior officials must approve the requirement
            prior to approval of the acquisition strategy. Refer to Table 1.1. and Figure 3.1.
            Approval by an MDA for an ACAT program of record captured within program
            milestone decision documents shall serve as requirements approval for embedded
            services. No further approval for those services is required.
            1.1.2.3.1.2. Early Strategy and Issues Session (ESIS). Early in the acquisition
            process, the acquisition team, to include the SMS, should communicate openly
            and frequently on the details of the acquisition. This communication enables the
            sharing of ideas and best practices prior to the formation of the formal acquisition
            strategy.
            1.1.2.3.1.3. Acquisition Plans. Appropriate acquisition planning is critical for a
            successful acquisition. FAR 7.1, DFARS 207.1, and AFFARS 5307.1 address
            policies related to acquisition planning and development of written acquisition
            plans.
        1.1.2.3.2. Award. The acquiring organization shall comply with the reporting
        requirements in paragraph 5.3.
        1.1.2.3.3. Post-Award. After award of the contract, the multi-functional team must
        monitor contractor performance and the health of the organization’s acquisition and
 6                                                                      AFI63-138 21 MAY 2013


            management of services. See Chapters 5 and 6 for further guidance on management
            and oversight of service acquisitions.
1.2. Applicability.
     1.2.1. This instruction applies to:
        1.2.1.1. All Air Force organizations acquiring services, including HAF, PEOs, TEOs,
        MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs.
        1.2.1.2. Services acquired by and/or for the Air Force.
        1.2.1.3. All organizations involved in writing requirements documents for service
        acquisitions.
        1.2.1.4. All service acquisitions with a contract value greater than or equal to the
        Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) (FAR 2.101) acquired with appropriated funds,
        with the exception of research and development (R&D), construction, architect-
        engineering and utilities.
        1.2.1.5. Embedded services. As used in this AFI, embedded services mean those
        services with a value greater than or equal to the SAT placed on a supply or weapon
        system contract as a separately priced services CLIN. Co-mingled requirements that are
        indistinguishable and not reported as services are not considered services under this AFI.
        1.2.1.6. Advisory and assistance services (A&AS), even if those services support R&D,
        construction, architect-engineering or utility activities.
        1.2.1.7. Information Technology (IT) services.
        1.2.1.8. Any other service (to include R&D, construction, architect-engineering, and
        utilities) or service related acquisition designated as a special interest item by the Under
        Secretary of Defense, Acquisition Technology & Logistics (USD AT&L), the Service
        Acquisition Executive (SAE), or the SMS.
     1.2.2. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers shall follow processes outlined
     in DoD Federally Funded Research and Development Center Management Plan for
     requirements definition, approval and execution and are not bound by the procedures set
     forth in this AFI.
     1.2.3. For service acquisitions and embedded services with a total contract value below the
     SAT, the FAR and applicable supplements govern. Management and oversight principles of
     this instruction shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable.
1.3. Waivers.
     1.3.1. Waivers to this AFI may only be granted by the SAE through the SMS or as specified
     in delegations enumerated in service management agreements (SMA) executed with the
     responsible SDOs. SDOs shall submit waiver requests through the SMS for coordination and
     forwarding to the SAE, unless a unique arrangement is defined in an SMA.
     1.3.2. This instruction shall not impede the ability of the SAE or any SDO from rapidly
     responding to urgent situations. Any urgent situation that requires a deviation from this AFI
     shall be reported in writing to the SMS within 10 calendar days of the action.

                APPROVAL OF SERVICE ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Overview. The requirement approval process provides for coordination, discussion of
alternatives for requirement fulfillment and senior leader approval. The approval of the
requirement is not a funding approval process. Requirement approval documentation and
coordination processes should be as simple as possible while conveying the required information
to senior leaders.
3.2. Applicability. Requirement approval shall be accomplished for:
   3.2.1. All Air Force service requirements with a total anticipated contract value greater than
   or equal to the SAT, including those procured by non-Air Force activities (e.g. General
   Services Administration (GSA)).
   3.2.2. Services embedded in supply or weapon system contracts where the total contract
   value of the service is greater than or equal to the SAT. Approval by an MDA for embedded
   services within an ACAT program of record that are captured within program milestone
   decision documents shall serve as requirements approval for embedded services. No further
   approval for those services is required. The services portion of the acquisition shall be
   managed with the principles of this AFI to this maximum extent practicable.
   3.2.3. Any proposed action that results in an increase of more than 25 percent (cumulative)
   of the total estimated service acquisition value and/or which would change the requirements
   approval authority level as defined in Table 1.1. must be approved by the approval authority
   for the new total service acquisition value.
   3.2.4. Any proposed modification and/or task order that would result in work that was not
   validated and approved in the existing requirement approval documentation for the contract
   shall be revalidated by the appropriate approval authority for the new total service acquisition
   value, based on the amount of the action plus the amount of the original awarded contract, in
   conjunction with a Justification & Approval.
3.3. Documentation. Requirements documents shall be developed consistent with the scope
and complexity of the service requirement. The following shall be provided:
   3.3.1. Explanation of the mission, need for the requirement and the outcomes to be achieved.
   3.3.2. How the requirement was previously satisfied. If not on a previous or current
   contract, an explanation of what changed in the environment, and why the need now exists.
   3.3.3. The nature and extent of market research conducted, to include any applicable benefit
   analysis performed for bundling and/or consolidation.
   3.3.4. Explanation of why the requirement must be filled through a contract and cannot be
   fulfilled organically.
3.4. Process.
   3.4.1. The requiring activity (the organization responsible for obtaining funding or
   developing the Program Objective Memorandum (POM)) shall obtain requirement approval
   from the appropriate requirement approval authority as soon as new requirements, follow-on
AFI63-138 21 MAY 2013                                                                          13


   requirements or changes to recurring requirements are identified. If there are multiple
   requiring activities, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) shall be executed under
   PEO/TEO/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU guidance identifying the lead activity and, if appropriate,
   the lead organization for execution of the acquisition. If the requirement, or the services
   element of the requirement, is estimated to total $100M or more, the MOA shall be staffed
   through the SMS.
   3.4.2. PEO/TEO/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU shall submit a quarterly report of service
   requirements approved during that quarter with an estimated annual value of $10M or more
   to the SMS. The SMS will provide a quarterly report of approved service requirements with
   an estimated annual value of $10M or more to SAF/AQ to forward as follows:
       3.4.2.1. “Operational Requirements” to the VCSAF for dissemination to Combatant
       Commands (COCOMs), providing them awareness of future operational capabilities.
       Operational services requirements are those services directly supporting a COCOM’s
       war-fighting mission.
       3.4.2.2. “Support Requirements” to the SECAF, providing awareness of future support
       capabilities. Support service requirements are all services other than operational
       requirements.
3.5. Approval. Requirements must be validated by the appropriate authority (refer to Table
1.1.) prior to the formation of the acquisition strategy. Requirement approval is not required for
exercising options that were considered and included in the requirement approval during the
original acquisition.
   3.5.1. Requirement approval for new service acquisitions valued at $10M or more but less
   than $100M rests with the PEO/TEO/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU responsible for the execution of
   the associated funding or POM.
   3.5.2. Requirement approval for new service acquisitions valued at less than $10M rests with
   the PEO/TEO/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU responsible for the execution of the funding or POM
   but can be delegated to the Wing Commander, Director or equivalent responsible for
   execution as appropriate.
   3.5.3. When       USD(AT&L)         approval      is   required    (see    Table     1.1.),
   PEO/TEO/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU focal points shall, before the solicitation is issued, or for
   ‘other than full and open’ competition, before negotiations commence, coordinate with the
   SMS and assist in the preparation and submission of the requirements document to
   USD(AT&L). Within 10 working days after receipt of the notification, USD(AT&L) or
   designee may direct a review of the proposed requirement to be accomplished within 30 days
   of such direction. Issues arising from the review shall be resolved in accordance with
   procedures specified by USD(AT&L) or designee, in direct coordination with SAF/AQ
   through the SMS. If USD(AT&L) does not notify the SMS or requiring organization focal
   point within the 10 working days, the acquisition may proceed.

                    ACQUISITION PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

4.1. Initial Considerations.
   4.1.1. Acquisition approaches that maximize competition shall be the norm and
   organizations shall make every effort to achieve the maximum competition possible for both
   current and future requirements.
   4.1.2. Contract type and oversight is critical to the sustainability of a program. Deviations
   from recommended business practices shall be addressed in the acquisition plans.
4.2. Contract Period of Performance.
   4.2.1. The period of performance for acquisitions of A&AS shall be as follows:
       4.2.1.1. Acquisition strategies for single-award A&AS contracts shall limit the period of
       performance to three years, including options, in accordance with 10 USC 2304(b),
       unless, by exception, it is justified for longer periods and approved by the SMS (unless
       otherwise delegated).
       4.2.1.2. Multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) A&AS contracts
       are limited to five years, including options, if on-ramp provisions are included to
       refresh/update the competitor pool. If on-ramp provisions are not included, multiple
       award IDIQ A&AS contracts are limited to a total of three years.
   4.2.2. The period of performance for non-A&AS acquisitions, including service acquisition
   elements within a PEO/TEO portfolio, shall not exceed five years unless approved by the
   SDO. Consideration for periods of performance greater than five years shall be given to
   programs critical to operational readiness (e.g., training simulator systems and programs
   impacting energy savings initiatives).
 16                                                                 AFI63-138 21 MAY 2013

             SERVICE ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT

6.1. Overview. Proper management and oversight is required on all service acquisitions.
Effective service acquisitions have mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of
contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen
mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices. Services shall be performance-based to
the maximum extent practicable. The following elements are critical to the successful delivery of
required performance by contractors:
   6.1.1. Use of MFTs.
   6.1.2. Deliberate acquisition planning.
   6.1.3. Well defined requirements (e.g. Performance Work Statement (PWS), Quality
   Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)).
   6.1.4. Management of service delivery through active surveillance of services.
   6.1.5. Adequate resourcing (personnel, funding, organizational support).
   6.1.6. Accurate and timely CPARS.
6.2. Performance-Based Service Acquisition (PBSA). Performance-based service acquisition
is applicable to all service acquisitions. A performance-based service acquisition consists of the
following:
   6.2.1. Early Strategy and Issues Session. The ESIS is a planning roadmap to the ASP,
   reducing the risk of re-work for the acquisition strategy development. This session facilitates
   an early meeting, typically conducted approximately 120 days before the ASP and early
   enough to support the required contract award date, with senior leaders in the owning
   organization’s chain of command to discuss top level considerations/strategies affecting
   service acquisitions typically valued greater than or equal to $100M. The ESIS is intended to
   be a dialogue; it is not meant to be a strategy decision. The ESIS is most effective when used
   as an informal, open discussion.
   6.2.2. Acquisition Strategy. A service acquisition strategy must develop performance-based
   requirements that align and track mission objectives complemented by a contract
   methodology that optimizes and drives performance. The selected contract type, source
   selection procedures, and contract incentives must align with performance requirements and
   objectives to achieve mission success.
   6.2.3. Market Research. All service acquisitions require market research that demonstrates
   agency reliance on the commercial marketplace for its capabilities, innovation, technologies,
   and competitive forces. Equally important, market research identifies capable small
   businesses to determine the level of small business participation as either a prime or sub-
   contractor. Market research is essential to the government’s ability to buy best-value
   services that deliver mission-critical results.
   6.2.4. Performance Work Statement (PWS). A PWS defines the requirement in terms of
   results rather than the method of performing the work. The requiring activity develops the
 20                                                                    AFI63-138 21 MAY 2013


   PWS jointly with the other members of the MFT. The PWS shall cite reference directives
   (e.g. publications, instructions) by specific process/procedure (e.g. paragraph or chapter)
   rather than the entire publication.
6.3. Multi-Functional Team. The MFT is a customer-focused team instituted under the
authority of senior leadership and responsible for assessing contractor performance and
managing the requirement over the life of the contract. The emphasis is on teamwork, trust,
common sense and agility. Membership may include as few members as the contracting officer,
program manager, quality assurance/COR, and functional/technical representative(s). Upon
contract award, the contractor(s) is included in the MFT.
   6.3.1. Senior Leadership. Senior leaders are responsible for developing, implementing and
   executing service acquisitions. This responsibility includes the RAD, acquisition strategy,
   source selection, and performance/contract management of the service throughout the life of
   the acquisition. Duties are delegable and include:
       6.3.1.1. Developing, implementing and executing a performance management
       assessment program that satisfies mission requirements, fosters innovation, and includes
       defined metrics. To be effective, metrics must provide meaningful objective
       measurements of contractor progress aimed at attaining desired outcomes.
       6.3.1.2. Ensuring performance management focuses on risk management, cost, schedule
       and performance baselines. A dedicated program/project management officer is a proven
       method for managing all assigned service acquisitions.
       6.3.1.3. Appointing a MFT of key stakeholders possessing the necessary set of skills to
       ensure that all service acquisitions integrate the needs of the mission with the requirement
       to procure performance-based services. Fostering the environment needed to successfully
       operate, convey business objectives, monitor progress, and correct/elevate delays or
       problems not resolvable by the MFT. Ensuring personnel on the MFT receive the
       appropriate training, tailored to meet local needs.
6.4. Initial Contract Performance Review. The initial evaluation of contractor performance is
a joint determination by the MFT that the contractor has successfully started performance,
completed transition, is fully operational, and is within the estimated cost, schedule, and
performance parameters of the contract. The initial performance review criteria shall be included
in the QASP or similar documentation. The SDO may waive the initial evaluation for
contractors that have continued performance under a successor contract award (prior incumbent),
or for contractors that have otherwise demonstrated full compliance with contract start-up.
Separate initial contract performance reviews are not required when they would duplicate
existing reviews.
   6.4.1. Scheduling. The review shall take place within 30 days after the contractor assumes
   full performance responsibility (i.e. after completion of transition/mobilization).
   6.4.2. Reports. For acquisitions greater than or equal to $100M, results of the initial
   performance review shall be reported to the SDO. The report shall include an assessment of
   schedule, management, technical, and cost performance. Negative variations in cost,
   schedule, staffing, and performance shall be reported with an assessment of the root causes
   and corrective action plan. Significant modifications to the contract made since contract
   award shall be included in the initial performance report as special interest items.

   6.4.3. Contract Performance Assessment Values.
      6.4.3.1. Green--No issues.
      6.4.3.2. Yellow--Issue(s) but contractor has an adequate mitigation or corrective action
      plan in place.
      6.4.3.3. Red--Issue(s) with inadequate or no contractor mitigation or corrective action
      plan. Any “red” assessment shall include the government proposed actions for the failing
      contractor.
   6.4.4. All service acquisitions with a total estimated value greater than or equal to $1B as
   well as service acquisitions that are categorized as “Special Interest” shall utilize current
   OSD review criteria for the acquisition of services.
6.5. Contracting Officer Representative (COR). CORs shall be trained, nominated and
appointed in accordance with AFFARS MP5301.602-2(d).

                                MIPR’D REQUIREMENTS

8.1. Management and Post-Award Oversight of MIPR'd Requirements.
   8.1.1. MIPRs must be managed in accordance with AFI 65-116. Nothing in this chapter
   should be interpreted as relief from those requirements.
   8.1.2. The SDO shall ensure that effective management and oversight controls are in place
   for the Air Force requirement being procured by an outside agency. “Outside the agency”
   means any acquisition not conducted by the Air Force. When utilizing an outside agency, the
   SDO shall require the same adherence to socio-economic programs (e.g. small business set-
   asides) and competition requirements as if the acquisition was conducted by an Air Force
   organization.
   8.1.3. At a minimum, the SDO shall provide the SMS an annual report on the status of
   MIPR’d Air Force service acquisitions, with a value greater than or equal to the SAT, under
   their portfolio and compliance with management and oversight controls. This report shall be
   provided as part of, or in conjunction with, the AER to the SMS.
   8.1.4. The annual MIPR’d service acquisition report shall address:
      8.1.4.1. Summary of quality assurance findings, either produced by an Air Force COR,
      the outside agency COR, or both.
      8.1.4.2. Summary of any performance or program issues associated with the MIPR’d
      service.
      8.1.4.3. The value of any MIPR fee associated with a service acquisition by an outside
      agency.
      8.1.4.4. The value of small business awards at the prime and subcontract levels.
      8.1.4.5. Degree of outside agency compliance with management and oversight controls.

and technical nature). In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of
information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and
the day-to-day aid of support personnel needed for the successful performance of ongoing
Federal operations. One of the three following definitional subdivisions applies to any A&AS:
(1) Management and professional support services, e.g., contractual services that provide
assistance, advice or training for the efficient and effective management and operation of
organizations, activities (including management and support services for R&D activities) or
systems. There is a direct correlation between the basic responsibilities and mission of the
agency originating the requirement for the acquisition of services by contract. Included are
efforts that support or contribute to improved organization of program management, logistics
management, project monitoring and reporting, data collection, budgeting, accounting,
performance auditing, and administrative technical support for conferences and training
programs.
