This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It establishes procedures for
requesting production of banners and signs used to advertise events, such as fundraising campaigns, cul-
tural awareness activities, and other officially recognized and sanctioned events. This publication is appli-

   tion through 75 CES/CEOS.
   1.3. For banners to be accomplished by other means (other sign shops on base or contract), signatory
