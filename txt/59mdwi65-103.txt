SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated references and format.
1. Overview. In order to streamline and improve the efficiency of TDY travel through the
Defense Travel System (DTS), we have created a 59 MDOG Travel Hub. This Travel Hub will
be the centralized lead for the processing of all DTS travel requests in the 59 MDOG. Members
should be aware of travel requirements in AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders and MDWI 65-
102 Guidelines for Local Staff Travel in addition to the requirements in this instruction.
2. Squadron Commanders. Appoint an adequate number of “Super Users” to meet their
mission requirements. Super Users who are appointed at the squadron and flight level are a
critical component the process. The Super User is an individual who is trained on

establishing/completing a new travel request in DTS and can provide a full spectrum of DTS
assistance to our staff. Group Resource Advisors will ensure each appointed individual receives
the required training to be proficient in DTS.
3. TDY Travel Request Process.
     3.1. WHMC Form 115, Temporary Duty Travel Request will be the approval document for
     TDY travel requests and provides the command authority for the Travel Hub to electronically
     process orders against the appropriate squadron travel funds. Each squadron commander will
     be given a travel budget each fiscal year and will be expected to manage their funds
     appropriately.
     3.2. All travel requests must be submitted 14 days prior to TDY start date to allow sufficient
     time for orders to be processed in DTS. Member will fully complete required blocks on the
     WHMC Form 115 to include an estimate of expenses (per diem, travel, registration etc.).
     The signature of the Squadron Commander is the only signature required for the Travel Hub
     to execute funds for travel, since the Squadron commander has overall responsibility for the
     execution of the unit travel budget. Optional signatures for the supervisor, flight commander
     and Department Chair are included and may be required by the squadron commander to
     ensure proper coordination.
     3.3. Once all proper coordination and approval have been completed, the approved WHMC
     Form 115 along with any background materials such as conference brochures, registrations
     page, fund cite letters, or special authorizations will be uploaded into the electronic DTS
     travel request. Super Users should be able to provide assistance in this process.
     3.4. Members will receive electronic notifications that travel has been approved from the
     Commercial Travel Office. The current standard is that 48 hours prior to travel, airline travel
     authorization and itinerary will be provided. Members will also be able to print out a
     hardcopy of their orders from DTS at this time. Orders are required in-hand before member
     is allowed to proceed on TDY. Upon completion of TDY travel, vouchers should be
     completed in DTS within 5 days. Additionally, Super Users should be able to provide
     assistance with completion of travel vouchers.
4. For specific questions on DTS travel, please contact your Squadron Super Users or the
59 MDOG Travel Hub at 292-0298/0299.
