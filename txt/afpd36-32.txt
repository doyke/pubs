include expanding the explanation of separation incentive programs as well as involuntary

separations and retirement programs to facilitate force management. It also clarifies
responsibilities and codifies that the AF/A1 in collaboration with the Director of the Air National
Guard and Chief of Air Force Reserve, is responsible for developing, coordinating and executing
personnel policies regarding separations and retirement.
1. Purpose and Overview.
     1.1. This directive establishes the Air Force policy on separations and retirements to enable
     it to maintain a vigorous fighting force with high standards of performance and conduct.
     Additionally, the Air Force must be able to meet authorized end strength levels established in
     law.
2. Policy. It is Air Force policy to establish guidance to manage retirement and separation
programs to meet congressionally mandated end strength levels.
     2.1. The Air Force will provide for the voluntary retirement and separation of individuals
     who have fulfilled their commitment.
     2.2. Voluntary retirements and separations include incentive and normal programs.
     Incentive programs encourage members to voluntarily separate from active duty by offering
     payment, benefits and/or early retirement options. Normal programs are those existing
     personnel programs and policies governing retirements and separations (retirement at the
     completion of 20 or more years of service, separation at expiration of an enlistment,
     completion of active duty service commitment, etc.). Incentive programs are used in
     conjunction with retirement and separation programs to meet congressionally mandated
     personnel end strength levels.
     2.3. When appropriate, commanders will take action to separate members who do not meet
     Air Force standards.
     2.4. When necessary, the Air Force will utilize involuntary retirement and separation
     programs.
     2.5. Consistent with force requirements and other personnel programs, the Air Force, in
     reducing its overall end strength, will normally encourage voluntary separations before
     resorting to involuntary separation of qualified members who are not eligible for retirement.
     2.6. Involuntary retirement and separation programs may be required for the Air Force to
     generate additional losses above voluntary separations in order to meet congressionally
     mandated end strength levels or to shape specific specialties. Involuntary retirements and
     separations are any involuntary retirement or separation action consummated earlier than
     desired by an Airman, prior to any mandatory DOS and not for cause.
3. Responsibilities. The following responsibilities and authorities are established:
     3.1. AF/A1 is responsible for policy oversight and advocacy of the Air Force’s retirement
     and separation programs and to interface with the Office of the Secretary of Defense staff
     concerning development of Department of Defense (DoD) policy and legislative initiatives.
     3.2. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
     is responsible for military retirements and separation policy matters as delegated by the
     Secretary of the Air Force. As described in Air Force Policy Directive 90-1, Policy
AFPD36-32 12 MAY 2014                                                                        3


   Formulation, paragraphs 3 and 4, SAF/MR approval is required before this document is
   changed, reissued, or rescinded.
   3.3. The AF/A1, AF/RE and ANG/A1, oversees the execution and development of
   procedural guidance for the Air Force retirement and separation program for their respective
   component.
4. Governance. Governing laws and directives implemented by this policy directive are listed
at Attachment 1.
