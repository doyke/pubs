                                             Chapter 1

                                         BACKGROUND

1.1. Evolution of Publicly Accessible Defibrillators.
     1.1.1. Multiple studies have shown that AEDs increase the chance of surviving from sudden
     cardiac arrest. Publicly accessible defibrillators, like publicly accessible fire extinguishers,
     are designed to be used by any bystander with minimal training.
     1.1.2. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), nearly 383,000 out-of-hospital
     sudden cardiac arrests occur annually. Most arrests are a result of irregular heart rhythms
     (arrhythmias). These lethal arrhythmias cause the pumping action of the heart to stop
     abruptly leading to death. An electrical shock, termed defibrillation, is the best known
     treatment for these arrhythmias. However, defibrillation must be administered within
     minutes of a cardiac arrest to be effective. For every passing minute without defibrillation
     (and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR), a victim’s chance of survival
     decreases 7 to 10 percent. After just 10 minutes, very few resuscitation attempts are
     successful. Historically, the ability to defibrillate was solely in the hands of trained
     emergency medical personnel, who may have a long response time. With modern AEDs, a
     rescuer can quickly and easily defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and potentially save a life.
     Current AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive
     and can be used by nonmedical rescuers with relative ease.
     1.1.3. All AF, Air Reserve and ANG owned facilities (to include space leased for period(s)
     over 179 days) as defined by the Air Force Real Property Agency that choose to implement a
     PAD will comply with this instruction unless otherwise specifically excluded. (T-2)
1.2. The scope of AED training and utilization.
     1.2.1. The CASA was enacted into public law with provisions to encourage AED use in
     federal buildings. This law also provides limited immunity from legal liability for harm
     resulting from use or attempted use of an AED by lay responders. An AED is considered a
     PAD when made available in a public or private location for use by anyone who is NOT a
     first-responder or medical staff. Though AEDs require very little interaction by the user and
     could be operated by any responder having minimal to no training, PAD programs are
     required to identify targeted trained responders. Per the American Heart Association (AHA),
     training is important as early effective CPR is an integral part of providing lifesaving aid to
     people suffering sudden cardiac arrest.
     1.2.2. The intent of PAD programs is to allow AEDs to be accessible similar to the fire
     extinguisher model. Goal is to provide readily available equipment and supplies,
     accompanied by simple instructions, to allow responders with minimal training the
     opportunity to successfully provide assistance to people suffering sudden cardiac arrest.
1.3. Inclusions.
     1.3.1. Facilities identified as at-risk by the host installation PAD Program Coordinator (PPC)
     may be recommended to the base commander for participation in the PAD program. Final
     approval authority rests with the host installation commander.
AFI44-177 5 JUNE 2014                                                                          5


   1.3.2. Any AED in operational use in AF facilities or AF vehicles neither excluded nor
   governed by another AFI, regulation or program is subject to the provisions of this
   instruction.
   1.3.3. Any AED purchased with AF funds that is not otherwise governed by a different AFI,
   regulation or program is subject to the provisions of this instruction.
   1.3.4. Personally-procured AEDs will not be publicly accessible for use on AF property.
1.4. Exclusions.
   1.4.1. Surgeon General (SG)-recognized Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and
   contingency Medical/Dental units.
   1.4.2. Emergency response units for whom emergency response is a primary duty (includes
   but is not limited to police cars, ambulances and fire response vehicles). [Note: To qualify
   for exclusion, these responders must be accredited by the appropriate parent authority having
   regulations which meet or exceed the requirements in this instruction.]
   1.4.3. Airframes certificated under the provisions of Title 49 United States Code Section
   41102. Regulations governing Civil Air Carriers may be found under Title 14, Code of
   Federal Regulations, Part 119, Certification: Air Carriers and Commercial Operators.
   1.4.4. Facilities established for contingency operations lasting less than 179 days.
   1.4.5. Residential units unless the AED is placed in a publicly-accessible location (i.e. an
   AED in an individual’s dorm room is not considered publicly accessible but a day room AED
   must comply with this AFI).
   1.4.6. Open-air areas (AF owned facilities and/or real estate without a permanent cover).
   1.4.7. Infrastructure support buildings not normally occupied during duty hours. Examples
   include but are not limited to: electrical connection (isolation) sheds, computer network
   switching stations, unattended pump stations, or unoccupied storage buildings.

3.1. AED Acquisition.
   3.1.1. With approval from the PMD and consultation with the BMET for base/MAJCOM
   standardization, the PPC should select one (or at most two) models to meet the needs of the
   installation from the AED list developed by AFMOA. (T-2)
      3.1.1.1. AEDs purchased prior to publication of this Instruction may not meet the
      requirements of paragraph 3.1.1
      3.1.1.2. AEDs permanently removed from service will be replaced with AEDs meeting
      this Instruction’s requirements. (T-2)
   3.1.2. AEDs and accessories purchased will be paid for by the requesting unit’s funds. (T-2)
   3.1.3. AED purchases require signature approval by the PMD. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug
   14, 2009)) All such AEDs must comply with current AHA Guidelines for Emergency
   Cardiac Care. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009))
   3.1.4. AED will have capability to store a record of use for review of the PAD event. (T-0,
   74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009)) [Note: The exported record will be handled IAW applicable
   Federal, State, and local regulations.]
   3.1.5. Procurement of all AEDs and their locations will be documented and approved by the
   PMD. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009)) The PMD’s signature on a purchase order or
   location change request meets this requirement.
      3.1.5.1. The PMD will approve only fully automatic or semi-automatic AEDs. Semi-
      automatic AEDs prompt the operator to push the shock button if a shock is required.
      Fully automatic AEDs may reduce delays associated with hesitation to push this shock
      button. (Note: The AED must not be capable of a manual mode or being over-ridden by
      the operator when placed in service.) (T-1)
      3.1.5.2. Tenant units will seek approval/prescription from the host installation PMD prior
      to purchase and must register AEDs with the PPC IAW AFI 41-209. (T-2)
      3.1.5.3. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) without a medical unit should seek
      support of the nearest installation that can provide program oversight and support IAW

   inspect AEDs at least monthly per paragraph 2.9.3.
   3.3.2. When non-end-user maintenance is required, the AED will be sent to the supporting
   Medical Logistics/BMET section for repair. (T-2)
3.4. AED Placement.
   3.4.1. The essential key to surviving ventricular fibrillation is early CPR and defibrillation
   when indicated. The optimal target is less than three minutes from recognition of cardiac
   arrest. Where implemented, participating units will strategically place AEDs throughout the
   facility to allow rapid response to the emergency. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009))
   3.4.2. The location will be approved by the PMD. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009))

      to determine unit participation and strategic placement of AEDs.
      3.4.2.2. AED placement will be determined consistent with the factors outlined in
      “Guidelines for Public Access Defibrillation Programs in Federal Facilities”, 74 Fed Reg
      156 (Aug 14, 2009). (T-0)
   3.4.3. AEDs will be easily accessible in a well-marked and publicized location. (T-0, 74 Fed
   Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009)) (Note: A secure enclosure that minimizes potential tampering,
   theft, damage or inadvertent harm, such as storage in an alarmed AED housing, is highly
   recommended.)
   3.4.4. AED locations will be clearly marked. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009)) Note:
   Optimally, signs should be placed above or around each AED, easily viewed from both direct
   and perpendicular angles to the location. Some locations may benefit from directions signs
   to the nearest AED.)
      3.4.4.1. A means to reliably activate the EMS system should be nearby the AED location
      and clearly marked with instructions. (T-0, 74 Fed Reg 156 (Aug 14, 2009))
      3.4.4.2. Collocation with fire alarms and/or fire extinguishers is suggested.
