2. Explosive Limits.
    2.1. Aircraft Explosive Cargo Parking Areas are pre-designated as L-1 (Lima Pad), K-2 (Kilo Pad),
    and F-40 (Tertiary).
NOTE: Explosive capability of each Explosive Aircraft Parking Area is based on AFMAN 91-201,
Explosive Safety Standards, and Department of Defense (DoD) 6055.9, DoD Ammunition and Explosive
Safety Standards. Each parking area has a formal explosive site plan approved by the Department of
Defense Explosive Safety Board and the Air Force Safety Center.
WARNING: EXPLOSIVE LIMITS LISTED IN PARA. 2.2. WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED.
    2.2. Each parking area is sited for maximum explosive capability as follows:


        L-1 (Lima Pad) 30,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division (12) 1.1
                         25,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.1>450 lbs
                         40,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.2
                         40,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.3

                         Mission Essential Quantity Class/Division 1.4
62AWI91-4 22 APRIL 2008                                                                                  3


        F-40 (Tertiary) 30,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.1 explosives
                         25,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.1>450 lbs
                         40,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.2
                         40,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.2.3
                         100,000 lbs Hazard Class/Division 1.3
                         Mission Essential Quantity Class/Division 1.4
   2.3. Explosive aircraft parking areas will be used as designated by this instruction or as designated by
   62d Airlift Wing Command Post/Airfield Management personnel.
   2.4. K-2 (Kilo Pad) and F-40 (Tertiary) are sited as Explosive Aircraft Parking Areas only. Use F-40
   only when both L-1 and K-2 are occupied or mission requirements dictate the need.
   2.5. L-1 Dock will support L-1 operations only. Explosive quantities on the dock itself will be limited
   to 9,000 lbs Net Explosive weight (NEW) comprised of Joint Inspected (JI) palletized ordnance. Dur-
   ing aircraft loading operations involving Lima pad and the dock, combined NEW for both sites will
   not exceed 30,000 lbs. Ordnance pallets will be rolled from the transport vehicle to a K-loader via a
   built-in roller system; no lifting will be performed during the operations. Explosives will only be
   present at the dock for short periods unless weather conditions interrupt operations. Explosives move-
   ment at the dock will coincide only with aircraft notification to advance for upload and quantities will
   be limited to those for a single airframe.
       2.5.1. When the tertiary Hot Cargo pad F-40 is used, aircraft parking spot F-38 falls within mini-
       mum acceptable Inter-Magazine (IM) aircraft survivability distances. F-38 will not be used for
       aircraft parking until F-40 has been cleared.
       2.5.2. During explosive operations on K-2, the Aircraft Parking Areas listed as F-1 through F-39
       are exposed to less than the protective distance required by Air Force standards. The separation
       distance for aircraft survivability (K-30) required by AFMAN 91-201, Chapter 3, Table 3.3 cannot
       be met. When aircraft explosives operations are conducted on AECPA K-2, no aircraft will be
       parked on parking spots F-1 through F-39, nor will concurrent explosive operations be conducted
       concurrently on any part of the “F” taxiway. 62 AW/SEW will ensure guidelines established by
       this interim change are strictly enforced.

3. Security.
   3.1. When explosive-loaded aircraft are parked on “Hot Cargo Pads” roads passing by these pads are
   outside of the Public Traffic Route (PTR) requirements of AFMAN 91-201 but well within the Inhab-
   ited Building (IB) Quantity-Distance (QD) arcs. Closure of roads is not mandatory but recommended
   by 62 AW Weapons Safety (SEW). Closure of these roads will enhance security of aircraft and elimi-
   nate exposure of personnel to explosive quantity-distance clear-zones.
       3.1.1. Closure of public traffic routes and public walkways adjacent to “Hot Cargo Pads” support-
       ing Primary Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) mission tasking is mandatory. Roads will remain closed
       until mission aircraft are downloaded or cargo is removed from the supporting “Hot Cargo Pad.”
       3.1.2. When roadways and public walkways are blocked to enhance security and safety, the 62d
       Security Forces Squadron (SFS) will block/barricade the junction of Outer Drive and Perimeter
4                                                                          62AWI91-4 22 APRIL 2008


       Road just Northwest of the security forces East gate guard facility. They will also block/barricade
       at the junction of Perimeter Road and Union Avenue just East of the 62d Aerial Port Squadron
       (APS) equipment marshalling yard.
       3.1.3. See 62d Airlift Wing Instruction (AWI) 91-2 for additional guidance and specific require-
       ments for use of facilities within quantity-distance clear-zones.
    3.2. The 62d SFS will determine whether security details are required and who will provide the secu-
    rity details for in transit explosive-laden or PNAF mission aircraft.
    3.3. During explosive operations on L-1 or L-1 Dock, the recreational at Morey Pond and building
    1505 are exposed to less than the protective distance required by Air Force standards. Personnel and
    vehicles not directly related to these operations must be evacuated until hazardous cargo aircraft
    vacate or until Close Air Support Operations (CAS) have terminated. 62 AW/SEW will contact build-
    ing 1505 occupants to evacuate during these operations.
       3.3.1. 62 AW/SEW will notify 62d Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) environmental personnel
       on proposed/anticipated closure dates. A coordinated effort between 62 AW Weapons Safety and
       62 CES environmental personnel will be made to notify the general public of Morey Pond closure
       dates.
       3.3.2. Notification will be posted in the base bulletin, installation newspaper, and electronically
       via the wing intranet when possible.
    3.4. All aircraft parking locations and quantity-distance requirements are annotated and maintained
    on the installation Explosive Quantity-Distance Map, Tab D-8, located in the 62 AW Weapons Safety
    Office.

4. Operations.
    4.1. The 62 AW Weapons Safety Office will be notified when “Hot Cargo Pads” are in use or sched-
    uled for use via a telephone call or MCCHORDAFB Form 14, Hazardous/Dangerous Cargo Check-
    list.
    4.2. The use of F-40 (Tertiary) Hot Cargo Pad, will be granted only when L-1 or K-2 are occupied and
    the mission requires one open “Hot Cargo Pad” to support unforeseen inbound aircraft with hazardous
    cargo.
    4.3. Aircraft configured with Aerial Defensive Systems (ADS) are not required to be parked on “Hot
    Cargo Pads.” These aircraft may be parked on “C”, “D”,“E,” “F”, or “J” aircraft parking ramps, which
    are currently sited for 1,000 lbs of Hazard Class/Division 1.3 explosives and mission essential quanti-
    ties (MEQ) for Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives. Exception: All aircraft parking spots located on
    “B” ramp are sited for 10,000 lbs of Hazard Class/Division 1.3 explosives and MEQ for Hazard Class/
    Division 1.4 explosives.

5. Transportation of Explosives.
    5.1. Transportation of explosives to and from the 800 and 350 Munitions Storage Areas will comply
    with directives outlined in 62 AWI 91-5, Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Program.
