This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance. This instruction extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-2C-130V3, C-130
Operations Procedures, Technical Order (TO) 1C-130H-1, Flight Manual TO 1C-130A-9, Cargo Load-
ing Manual, and TO 00-20-1, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Supplement 1, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Polices, and Procedures. It provides guidance and procedures
for sealing aircraft at home station. It applies to all 908 AW aircrew members and maintenance personnel.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the
field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN3 7-123 (will convert
to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.”
This is the initial publication of 908th Airlift Wing Instruction (908 AWI) 21-107.


1. Procedures:
   1.1. The flight line expediter will supply aircraft seals in coordination with 357th Airlift Squadron
   Flight Engineer Supervisor (357 AS/DOE).
   1.2. Aircraft will be sealed upon completion of the aircrew dash one preflight (loadmaster dash nine
   preflight will normally be accomplished concurrently). The flight engineer or loadmaster crew chief
   will enter an “informational note” (no symbol) into the next open discrepancy block of the AFTO
   Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, stating: “INFO-NOTE: Aircraft sealed
   at ______ hours with seal # __________.”
   1.3. The crew chief will pass the recorded aircrew dash one preflight complete time and seal number
   to the 908th Maintenance Operations Flight, Maintenance Operations Center (MOF/MOC).
2                                                                       908AWI21-107 29 MARCH 2007


    1.4. The aircrew dash one preflight remains valid for 72 hours or until the maintenance dash six pre-
    flight expires.
    1.5. The aircraft must be sealed for the aircrew dash one preflight to remain valid when ground time
    exceeds 12 hours up to a maximum of 72 hours.

2. Preflight Integrity:
    2.1. Aircraft entry control procedures will be strictly adhered to once the aircraft is sealed. 908th Air-
    craft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS/MXA) and 357 AS/DOE will coordinate all aircraft entry activ-
    ity to ensure that the integrity of the aircrew preflight is maintained.
    2.2. When a sealed aircraft is entered (seal broken) and the aircraft is subsequently resealed, the fol-
    lowing will be documented in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
    Line out the current “informational note” and enter a new “informational note” in the next open dis-
    crepancy block: “INFO-NOTE: Seal broken @________ hrs for (Reason) __________________ and
    Aircraft Resealed @________ hrs with seal #________.”
    2.3. The crew chief will report entry time and new seal number to the 908 MOF/MOC.
    2.4. Attachment 2 provides a list of tasks that do not normally jeopardize the integrity of the aircrew
    preflight when 908 AMXS/MXA and 357 AS/DOE coordinate the specific entry activity.
