3. FACILITY PROJECTS. The board reviews and sets facility projects program submissions,
and sets a wing priority order within the various programs listed below. Members who represent
their functional area of the Wing’s mission should advocate their facility needs and assist in
coordinating the impact that proposed projects will have on the Wing mission and the
installation. The board does not approve programming documents for facility projects.
Programming documents for projects are approved by the Wing Commander or delegated
authority. The BCE or a FB-appointed working group may submit a draft project priority list;
however, it is the board’s responsibility as the corporate body to ensure the most urgent facility
needs of the Wing are being met. Board members must become familiar with any applicable
AMC published “goals and rules of engagement” for facility project programs and apply them in
the development of Wing programs.
4. WORKING GROUPS. FB working groups operate to ease the workload of the FB.
     4.1. Real Estate Working Group (REWG). The REWG is chaired by the Deputy
     Commander, 19th Mission Support Group (19 MSG/CD). The REWG addresses both real
     estate and community planning requirements including property in/out-grants, disposal,
     acquisitions, facility occupancy, future land use, facility sitings, transportation networks,
     capital improvements, area development, and air installation compatible use. The REWG
