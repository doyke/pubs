                                                 Chapter 1

                             POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and destroy
its classified information and material consistent with national policy. This general policy statement also
applies to unclassified controlled information (Attachment 2) under the purview of relevant statutes, reg-
ulations and directives [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.1.]

1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the Informa-
tion Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by delegating author-
ity to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk management principles; focusing
on identifying and protecting only that information that requires protection; integrating security proce-
dures into our business processes so that they become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands
their security roles and responsibilities.

1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in its infra-
structure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of our security
policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support of commanders at all
levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)
and security manager system. Both play an integral role in ensuring unit personnel know and understand
their role in protecting classified information against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C1.2.]
    1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/
    AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for ensuring implementation of
    the Information Security Program.
    1.3.2. Air Force Program Manager. The Chief, Information Security Division (HQ USAF/XOS-FI) is
    responsible for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of this program.
    1.3.3. Commanders of Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct
    Reporting Units (DRUs), and Installations. These commanders are responsible for:
       1.3.3.1. Establishing information security programs.
       1.3.3.2. Identifying requirements.
       1.3.3.3. Executing their programs to comply with this policy.
    1.3.4. Information Security Program Managers (ISPM). The installation Chief of Security Forces or
    installation senior security forces official is designated the ISPM at each Air Force installation or site.
    Air Force ISPMs:
       1.3.4.1. Implement the Information Security Program, for the Information, Personnel, and Indus-
       trial Security Programs on behalf of the installation commander. Assist in the program/technology
       protection planning process as it relates to information, personnel and industrial security, to
       include direction on physical security requirements for the protection of assets during the various
       states, i.e., production, deployment, maintenance, test, or undergoing modifications.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                         9


     1.3.4.2. Integrate on-base contractor operations into the installation’s Information Security Pro-
     gram in accordance with (IAW) AFI 31-601.
         1.3.4.2.1. Review pre-award and/or draft solicitations and contract documents associated with
         classified contract efforts; security classification guides and Department of Defense (DD)
         Form 254 to ensure appropriate security clauses and/or language is contained therein which
         address the protection of sensitive government information and resources.
         1.3.4.2.2. Serve as technical OPR for the development and preparation of the Visitor Group
         Security Agreement (VGSA) or other security agreements as determined necessary by the
         installation commander.
         1.3.4.2.3. Conduct security oversight of on-base designated “cleared facilities” as determined
         by the installation commander.
         1.3.4.2.3. (ACC) Contractors located on ACC installations will be designated as integrated
         visitor groups or intermittent visitors unless the Installation Commander deems circumstances
         exist to identify the contractor operation as a cleared facility. However, on-base contractor
         cleared facilities are not recommended for ACC activities.
     1.3.4.3. Provide oversight within their jurisdiction.
     1.3.4.4. Provide and monitor training as required by Chapter 8 of this AFI.
     1.3.4.5. For organizations at the Wing level and below, conduct security manager meetings no
     less than semi-annually.
     1.3.4.5. (ACC) ISPMs will prepare and distribute meeting minutes to security managers and
     other participants attending the security manager meeting.
     1.3.4.6. (Added-ACC) ISPMs will establish files for each activity/unit and maintain the follow-
     ing official records, as appropriate, in accordance with (IAW) the RDS:
         1.3.4.6.1. (Added-ACC) Appointment letters (Security Managers, Top Secret Control Offic-
         ers (TSCO), Top Secret Control Account (TSCA) establishment, etc).
         1.3.4.6.2. (Added-ACC) Copy of the last annual program review report.
         1.3.4.6.3. (Added-ACC) Copy of secure room and/or vault certification letters.
         1.3.4.6.4. (Added-ACC) Security manager training documentation.
     1.3.4.7. (Added-ACC) ISPMs invite non-ACC units on ACC bases to participate in the ACC
     Information Security Program. ACC units located on non-ACC bases will enter into a host-tenant
     support agreement with the host activity and participate fully. In both instances, such participation
     will be limited to Department of Defense and Air Force-level requirements.
  1.3.5. Unit Commanders or Equivalents, and Staff Agency Chiefs. NOTE: For the purpose of this
  instruction, staff agency chiefs are those individuals serving in 2-digit positions reporting to the com-
  mander or vice commander above the Wing level and 2 and 3 digit positions at Headquarters Air
  Force. These commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will:
     1.3.5.1. Appoint a security manager to administer the unit’s information security program. Alter-
     nate security managers may be appointed as necessary. Commanders or equivalents, and staff
     agency chiefs should consider Air Expeditionary Force rotation cycles, TDY, training require-
10                                                             AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


        ments, and other assigned duties. Continuity should receive serious consideration in selection of
        security managers. Military security managers must have a favorable National Agency Check,
        local agency check, and credit check (NACLC); civilians a National Agency Check with written
        inquiries and credit check (ANACI), investigation or higher and eligibility for JPAS access before
        appointment. NOTE: Smaller organizations and staff agencies are encouraged to appoint primary
        and alternate security managers to serve multiple activities.
            1.3.5.1.1. Contractors will not be appointed as primary or alternate security managers. How-
            ever, they can be required to provide other security program support, under Air Force direc-
            tion, such as, assisting the security manager, conducting end-of-day security checks, security
            training/briefings, etc.
        1.3.5.2. Ensure security managers receive training required by Chapter 8.
        1.3.5.3. Notify the ISPM in writing when either primary or alternate security managers are
        changed.
     1.3.6. Security Managers:
        1.3.6.1. Establish and manage the Information Security Program within their unit or staff agency.
        1.3.6.2. Develop and update a unit security operating instruction.
        1.3.6.3. Advise the unit commander or equivalents, and staff agency chief on security issues per-
        taining to the unit or staff agency.

1.4. Oversight. In addition to the reporting requirements of the Information Security Program (see para-
graph 1.7.), the following will be implemented [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.7.]
   1.4.1. MAJCOMs will incorporate information security issues into Inspector General (IG) inspec-
   tions/reviews. In addition, MAJCOM security forces staff will conduct security oversight and assis-
   tance visits in the form of either an Information Security Program Review (ISPR) or Staff Assistance
   Visit (SAV) to subordinate ISPMs at least every 36 months. MAJCOM security forces staffs are
   encouraged to explore oversight options to minimize resource impact.
       1.4.1.1. ISPR.
           1.4.1.1.1. An ISPR is an assistance-oriented oversight visit for the information security pro-
           grams performed by an ISPM, or designated representative(s) on a subordinate ISPM or secu-
           rity manager. It is a non-rated review for policy and program effectiveness to benchmark
           processes/products, identify problem areas and corrective actions. A key component of the
           ISPR is an assessment of the effectiveness of the information security training program.
           1.4.1.1.2. Air Force on-base contractor visitor groups will be integrated into the host installa-
           tion’s Information Security Program unless the mission, operational requirements, autono-
           mous nature or other factors require them to establish and maintain their own security program
12                                                             AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


            as a cleared facility under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NIS-
            POM).
            1.4.1.1.2. (ACC) Contractors located on ACC installations will be designated as integrated
            visitor groups or intermittent visitors unless the Installation Commander deems circumstances
            exist to identify the contractor operation as a cleared facility. However, on-base contractor
            cleared facilities are not recommended for ACC activities.
            1.4.1.1.3. The ISPM will provide the commander or equivalent, and staff agency chief the
            ISPR results in writing.
     1.4.2. Base level ISPMs will conduct ISPRs on an annual basis. EXCEPTION: An extension to 18
     months may be granted by the ISPM for units that have demonstrated highly effective, discrepancy
     free programs during the previous ISPR. ISPRs/SAVs may be conducted every two years for activities
     or units that do not store classified information.
     1.4.3. Security Self-Inspections: Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs involved
     with processing or holding classified information ensure personnel conduct semiannual security
     self-inspections to evaluate information security program effectiveness. EXCEPTION: Activities
     with a small volume of classified material may work with the ISPM to develop an oversight schedule
     consistent with risk management principles.
        1.4.3.1. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will appoint an individual, in
        writing, other than the unit security manager to conduct a semiannual security inspection.
        1.4.3.2. A program review may satisfy the requirement for one of the semiannual self-inspections.
     1.4.4. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will visit MAJCOMs to review their information security programs every
     36 months.

1.5. Special Types of Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.3.]

        they deem necessary for operational efficiency. Officials delegated the authority will sign in the
        “For” block on behalf of the access granting official. Air Force personnel may obtain DoE Form
        5631.20 from the DoE activity they are visiting or at the DoE Forms web site.
        1.5.1.1. (ACC) General. Division Chiefs and above and security managers are delegated the
        authority to sign DOE Forms 5631.20 "For" COMACC in his capacity as the Restricted Data
        access granting official for the command.
            1.5.1.1.1. Activities must notify HQ USAF/XOS-FI through command ISPM channels of
            changes to the list of certifying officials as they occur. When doing so, they must also provide
            the position title, activity and office symbol of the affected authority. NOTE: When the change
            involves an activity name change, access-granting officials will sign forms authorizing access
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          13

         mented on AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action.
         1.5.1.2.3. Protection. Air Force personnel will protect CNWDI in the same manner prescribed
         for collateral classified information. This includes limiting access to containers storing
         CNWDI to only those personnel who have been granted CNWDI access. [Reference DODD
         5210.2, Paragraph 6]
         1.5.1.2.4. (Added-ACC) A sample Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information (CNWDI)
         briefing is provided in Attachment 8 (Added) to this supplement, that may be used when
         briefing individuals prior to granting CNWDI access.

  other material shall be considered FOUO. FOUO is not authorized as an anemic form of classification
  to protect national security interests. [Reference DOD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, DOD Free-
  dom of Information Act Program, C4.1.1] The FOIA exemptions are detailed in DOD Regulation
  5400.7/AF Supplement, Chapter 3.
  1.5.4. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and
  Reconnaissance (HQ USAF/XOI), 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480, is respon-
  sible for SCI policy. The provisions of this publication may not supersede the policies and guidance
  prescribed in the appropriate Director of Central Intelligence Directives governing the control, safe-
  guarding, and dissemination of SCI as promulgated by the Cognizant Security Authority (CSA) for
  intelligence security management. The CSA will, on behalf of the Senior Official of the Intelligence
  Community (SOIC), AF/XOI, ensure appropriate resolution of actual or perceived conflicts regarding
  SCI and the provisions of this publication.

                       ORIGINAL AND DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION

2.1. Original Classification Authority (OCA) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.2.]
   2.1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the OCA and may further delegate this authority.
   2.1.2. The process for delegating OCA authority is as follows:
      2.1.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force delegates Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.2. SAF/AA delegates Secret and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.3. All requests for the delegation of OCA will be forwarded through command ISPM chan-
      nels to the Chief, Information Security Division, HQ USAF/XOS-FI, 1340 Air Force Pentagon,
      Washington, DC 20330-1340, for processing.
          2.1.2.3.1. Address requests for original Top Secret authority to the Secretary of the Air Force.
          2.1.2.3.2. Address requests for original Secret and Confidential authority to SAF/AA.
          2.1.2.3.3. Only individuals in senior military or civilian positions (usually General Officer or
          Senior Executive Service level) at the first or second echelon of command carrying out a
          unique mission with responsibility for one of the eight subject areas prescribed by EO 12958,
          as amended, may be designated as an OCA.
          2.1.2.3.4. OCA is assigned to a position, not a person. OCA will not be delegated other than
          identified in paragraphs 2.1.2.1. and 2.1.2.2. above. However, deputies, vice commanders,
          chiefs of staff and similar other subordinates of an OCA are empowered to act as an OCA
          when they assume the duty position of an OCA in an “acting” capacity and have certified in
          writing that they have been trained in OCA responsibilities and classification principles in
          addition to the basic security training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and
          the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who
          fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure before exercising this
          authority.
      2.1.2.4. All requests will contain the full position title, functional office symbol, a detailed expla-
      nation of why the position requires OCA and an estimate of the annual use of the delegated author-
      ity.
   2.1.3. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will maintain the master list of Air Force OCAs and post that list on the
   AFSFC web site. Periodically, HQ USAF/XOS-FI will request OCA validation from the MAJCOM/
   FOA/DRU ISPMs.
      2.1.3.1. Personnel will submit requests for changes or new requests through ISPM command
      channels as they occur.
      2.1.3.2. See the AFSFC web site for OCA training requirements.

2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information Security
Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
16                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


     2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be expected to
     cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and that the interests of
     the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the Information Security Program
     to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who have been specifically delegated the
     authority to do so, have received training in the exercise of this authority, and have program responsi-
     bility or cognizance over the information [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
        2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that classifica-
        tion guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans or other memo-
        randa.
        2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification decisions.
        2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs’ decision must be rendered verbally due to the
        priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within seven days.
        2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
        2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony in courts
        of law concerning classification of national security information and be prepared to defend and
        justify their original decisions.
     2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or for, or is
     under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered for classification
     only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.

2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in a new
form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material consistent with the
markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily consists of a classified document
or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all cleared personnel can perform derivative
classification.
     2.3.1. Originating Agency’s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an approved
     marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that have been created
     after October 14, 1995.
     2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any originally
     classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
     2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that contains
     OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following information in the Declas-
     sify On line:
        DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is applicable)
                               Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)
     2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date of the
     source document.

2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          17


   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal violation of law,
   inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;
   (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protec-
   tion in the interest of the national security [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD
   5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security Guidance 16 April 2004.]
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information requested under
   the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO 12958, as amended,
   should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]

2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or unneces-
   sarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or equivalent, staff agency
   chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over the
   information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command ISPM channels to HQ
   USAF/XOS-FI.
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain classified
   until a final resolution is reached.

2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7 for
   sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate declassifica-
   tion instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the classified system,
   plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing address, orga-
       nizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions regarding the classifi-
       cation guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be down-
       graded, or not to be declassified.
       2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and, when useful,
       specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one level of classification
       will be annotated for each element of information.)
       2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the applicable classi-
       fication category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
       2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
       2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
18                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


        2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic declassification
        pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
        2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification provi-
        sions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of information to be
        exempted from declassification to include:
            2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when citing the
            exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable statute, treaty or interna-
            tional agreement; and
            2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5.
     2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
        2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification guides to
        facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of their information.
        NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing classification guidance in other
        forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans, system protection guides, AFIs. In these
        cases, the applicable publication will be considered the guide and the publishing requirements in
        paragraph 3.3. still apply.
        2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4. below) their security classification guides
        to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information section:
            2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be taken when
            considering information for release onto publicly accessible or unprotected World Wide Web
            sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned approval provisions, owners and/or
            releasers of information proposed for such release must ensure that it is not susceptible to com-
            pilation with other information to render sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The
            search and data mining capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk manage-
            ment perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or unprotected
            web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication according to AFI 35-101, Pub-
            lic Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any doubts, do not release the information.
        2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before final
        approval.
        2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as circum-
        stances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major changes implemented
        by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force classification/declassification guides will be
        reviewed no later than 31 December 2005, and every five years thereafter.
     2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
        2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the Inter-
        agency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed the guide, the
        document will be sent to HQ USAF/XOS-FI who will forward it to the ISCAP for approval.
        2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/ declassification
        guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using DD Form 2024.
        DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                       19


     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to AF/XOS-FI
     at AFXOS-FI.workflow@pentagon.af.mil and AFDO at AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil
     in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will maintain the master list of all Air Force
  classification/declassification guides and will post all guides on the AF/XOS-FI SIPRNET web page.
  Guides are also located on the DTIC web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC
  account. The URL for this is http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy (DoE) issue
  joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear weapons. The Air Force
  issues security classification policy (AFI 31-407) for nuclear weapons surety information. Most of
  these products are classified and users will require the appropriate security clearance before accessing
  them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users
  forward requests for copies of the Air Force security classification policy to HQ USAF/XOS-FI (1340
  Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through command ISPM channels. Requests must
  include the name, address, and phone number of the activity POC, and the POC’s level of access.
  ISPMs will validate this information before submitting the requests to HQ USAF/XOS-FI. For all
  other Air Force or other agency guides, go direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD
  Index of Security Classification Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons
  classification guidance are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                                 Chapter 3

                     DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the authority
to declassify or downgrade classified information.

3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive Number 1,
Section 2001.21(3)(i).
     3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the duration of pro-
     tection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO Directive Number 1, Section
     2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified, original classifiers will determine which of
     the following four declassification instructions will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declas-
     sification instruction that will result in the shortest duration of classification.
        3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to identify
        such a date or event;
        3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
        3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
        3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
     3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The “Declassify on” line must include one of the follow-
     ing:
        3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
        3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995); or
        3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003); or
        3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
        3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).

3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD or FRD
are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date. RD must be
reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents containing FRD
prior to release.

3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force activities that
possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years old or older should
have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec 2006.
     3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force Declassification
     Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as
     amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old or older as of 31 Decem-
     ber 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have permanent historical value. The Air
     Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm).
     It is critical that records management and information security personnel work together to ensure that
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          21


   requirements of both are met on classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or
   Federal Records Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the exemption categories
   (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved through
   the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security classification/declassification guide.
   (See paragraph 2.6. and Attachment 7.) The Air Force has an approved list of exemption categories
   (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan); however, the specific item must still be annotated in the
   security classification/ declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For
   original classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than “25X1-human,” is permitted on the
   “declassify on” line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event less than 10
   years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking “25X1-human.” This marking
   may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected to reveal the identity of a con-
   fidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the only 25X marking that does not
   require a date or event for declassification to be cited with the 25X marking.

3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough specificity to
   allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
   20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air Force
   Appellate Authority for MDRs.

3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for conducting
systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
3.6. (ACC) Systematic Review for Declassification. ACC activities will review their classified hold-
ings with a view towards declassification during their annual clean out day(s). This review pertains to
classified holdings that were originally or derivatively classified by the activity. Annual clean out days
may coincide with required records conversion at minimum, on or about December 31st or September
30th as applicable. Although they will not reveal classified data, activities will ensure supporting records
managers have approved classified records as maintained and listed on the activity file plan. They will
also ensure proper records retention and disposition in accordance with the AF RDS.
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These records will be
   reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25 years from the date of its
   original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting declassification
   reviews for all other classified records.

3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as amended, Sec-
tion 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34, and has been referred
22                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for processing Air Force referrals.
Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found in the Air Force Declassification Plan.

3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it has been
approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15. The same holds
true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet site that can be accessed
by the public.

3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate when
the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be properly pro-
tected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the information and has
authority over the information may downgrade information.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                         23


                                                Chapter 4

                                              MARKINGS

4.1. General. Air Force personnel who originally and derivatively classify information will mark those
products according to DOD 5200.1-R and the ISOO Marking Booklet. Material other than ordinary paper
documents, e.g., e-mail transmitted over a secure network, must have the same information either marked
on it or made immediately available to holders by other means. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.1.]

4.2. Required Markings. Classified documents are required to have the following markings:
   4.2.1. The overall classification of the document.
   4.2.2. The agency, office of origin, and date of the document.
   4.2.3. The office or source document that classified the information.
       4.2.3.1. If it is originally classified, the document will reference the office. Example:
                                   CLASSIFIED BY: HQ USAF/XO
       4.2.3.2. If a document is derivatively classified, it will reference the source document or the secu-
       rity classification/declassification guide. Example:
                    DERIVED FROM: HQ USAF/XO Memo dated 12 Jan 2003
                                        Subj: Funding Problems
   4.2.4. The reason for classification. Each originally classified document shall bear a concise state-
   ment of the reason for classification, determined by the original classifier. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C5.2.4.] The classification categories are listed in EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.4; DOD
   5200.1-R Interim Information Security Guidance, Chapter 2, Para 1. Example:
                                            REASON: 1.4(e)
       4.2.4.1. If a document is derivatively classified, the “REASON” is not required to be carried over
       to the derivative document.
   4.2.5. Declassification instructions, and any downgrading instructions that apply. Example:
                                 DECLASSIFY ON: 15 MARCH 2010
       4.2.5.1. If marking material that falls within one of the 25-year exemption categories, the correct
       marking will be as follows (NOTE: only derivatively classified documents will carry a 25X mark-
       ing, with the exception of 25X1-human, which is allowed on originally classified documents):
                             DECLASSIFY ON: 25X5, 15 February 2010
   4.2.6. Page and portion markings to identify the specific classified information in the document and
   its level of classification. When marking a document that is derivatively classified, ensure all mark-
   ings and caveats are carried over from the source document to the derivative document.
   4.2.7. Control notices and other markings that apply to the document.
   4.2.8. When a document has been declassified or downgraded, the following markings shall be
   applied:
24                                                               AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


        4.2.8.1. The word “Declassified” or the new classification if being downgraded.
        4.2.8.2. The authority for the action (the OCA’s office symbol and the identification of the corre-
        spondence or classification instruction that required it).
        4.2.8.3. The date of declassification or downgrading action.
        4.2.8.4. The overall classification markings that appear on the cover page or first page shall be
        marked through with a straight line. If downgraded, the new classification will be written in.
        4.2.8.5. Page and portion markings will be remarked as required.
     4.2.9. Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be conspicuously
     marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the appropriate overall classifi-
     cation marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of the notebook, binder, folder, etc.

4.3. Special Control and Similar Notices. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.9.]
     4.3.1. Working Papers. Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created in the
     preparation of finished documents and material. Working papers containing classified information
     will be:
        4.3.1.1. Dated when created.
        4.3.1.2. Marked with the highest classification of any information contained in the document and
        annotated “WORKING PAPER”.
        4.3.1.3. Destroyed when no longer needed.
        4.3.1.4. Protected IAW the assigned classification.
        4.3.1.5. Marked in the same manner as a finished document at the same classification level when
        transmitted outside the facility or if retained for more than 180 days from the original creation
        date.
     4.3.2. Communications Security (COMSEC). See AFI 33-211, Communications Security (COMSEC)
     User Requirements, for guidance on marking COMSEC documents and media.
     4.3.3. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information,
     for guidance on marking and disseminating technical documents. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, para-
     graph C5.2.9.8. and DODD 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents.]
     4.3.4. SAPs. Documentation and information may be identified with the Phrase “Special Access
     Required” and the assigned nickname, codeword, trigraph, or digraph. See AFI 16-701, Special
     Access Programs, for additional guidance on SAP documents.
     4.3.5. Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD). [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1, Subpart A.)
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          25


       4.3.5.1. Documents containing RD shall be marked:


                                         RESTRICTED DATA


      “This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
          Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.”
       4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:


                                 FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA


      “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as
       Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic Energy Act, 1954”
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.

4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69, United States Implemen-
tation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and procedures contained in
C-M(2002)49 and it’s supporting directives take precedence, where they conflict, over the guidelines
expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.

4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification designations. More-
   over, many foreign governments and international organizations have a fourth level of classification
   that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of unclassified information that is protected by
   law in the originating country and is provided on the condition that it will be treated "in confidence."
   A table of U.S. and foreign government classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify the orig-
   inating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification designation has
   been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable U.S. English language
   designation, only the identity of the originating country need be applied to the document. Examples:
      A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU SECRET.
      A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR SECRET.
   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that equates
   to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a DOD Component
   on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked to identify the originating
   government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in confidence." Additionally, they shall be
   marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling". Example:
26                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


                   A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte” would be marked:


                               FRENCH RESTRICTED INFORMATION
                                                 Protect as:
                                 CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling


        4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI provided in
        confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government unclassified informa-
        tion provided in confidence), such information must be classified under EO 12958, as amended.
        Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least equivalent to that required by the foreign govern-
        ment or international organization that provided the information. If the foreign protection require-
        ment is lower than the protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following
        requirements shall be met:
            4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
            need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
            4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling instructions.
            4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.

4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
     4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature declassification or
     unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that contain FGI shall be marked
     on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS (indicate country of origin) INFOR-
     MATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to identify the classification level and the coun-
     try of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed,
     the cover or first page of the document shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOR-
     EIGN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI
     together with the appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
     maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
     4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification sources. If the
     identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line shall contain the mark-
     ing "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the foreign government will be
     maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A U.S. document shall not be down-
     graded below the highest level of FGI contained in the document or be declassified without the written
     approval of the foreign government that originated the information. Recommendations concerning
     downgrading or declassification shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document
     to the originating foreign government.
     4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall be
     marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO CLASSI-
     FIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO information (e.g., NS).
     When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED information is included in otherwise
     unclassified DOD documents, the following statement shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          27


   page containing the information: "This page contains (indicate NATO or country of origin)
   RESTRICTED information." The restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The
   cover, (or first page, if no cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This docu-
   ment contains NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of
   source) and shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69."
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to identify the
   originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that equates
   to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a DOD com-
   ponent, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether they are restricted or
   provided in confidence.

4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original classified
audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include footers/headers showing the
applicable classification markings. However, the required classification markings must be placed on the
outside of the container and reel. All copies made from the original tapes must include headers/footers
that show the applicable classification markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is
not inadvertently erased during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]

4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP Media Clas-
sification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708, Confidential ADP Media
Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP Data Descriptor Label, on remov-
able information systems storage media. These are available through the Air Force Publications Distribu-
tion System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs 5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that precludes
   application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must be permanently
   marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions upon, and
   prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage media for classified
   systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or destruction, procedures for
   unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing takes place. Personally owned infor-
   mation systems storage media are prohibited in areas where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using them for
   storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for accidental loss
   must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these procedures in the
   semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.

4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Informa-
   tion, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of SCI. The
   Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of
28                                                                  AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


     Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy provide criteria for release of
     intelligence to foreign officials.

4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep 2004, sub-
ject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
     4.10.1. “REL TO” identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to be releas-
     able based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign disclosure official or
     has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures and channels, to the foreign
     country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
     4.10.2. “REL TO” cannot be used with “Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals” (NOFORN) on page
     markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions, NOFORN takes prece-
     dence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
     4.10.3. The full marking “REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international organization or
     coalition force tetragraph” shall be used after the classification and will appear at the top and bottom
     of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one, the first page and the outside of the back
     cover, if there is one. “REL TO” must include country code “USA” as the first country code listed.
     After the USA, country trigraphic code shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international
     organization/coalition tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
     4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code separated
     by a space, a lower case “and” and a space,
                          EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO USA, EGY and ISR.
     4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different from the
     countries listed in the “REL TO” at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is releasable to all the
     countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked “REL.”
                                             EXAMPLE: (TS//REL)
     4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the overall
     “REL TO” marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific countries/organi-
     zations listed alphabetically.
         EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is ‘SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.” How-
         ever, the portion marking may be: (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that infor-
         mation contained in this portion is also releasable to Australia.
     4.10.7. “NOFORN” is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW DCID 6/6,
     Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use the “NOFORN” dis-
     semination control marking on any document, including derivatively classified documents, without
     first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and that the marking is actually warranted.
     4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166 tri-
     graphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.

4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail)
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                           29


  4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or unclassified,
  will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not be transmitted on the
  NIPRNET.
  4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of the
  e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified. Following
  this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
  Example:
             Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
  4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an unclassified network.
  4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first line of the
  e-mail message text.
  4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the classification
  marking and the text.
  4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion marking. Use
  the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and subparagraphs.
  4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last line of the
  e-mail message text.
  4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion markings. Indi-
  cate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated classification symbol in parenthe-
  ses before the attachment icon.
  4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the signature block
  on the left margin.

                                             SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for safeguarding classi-
fied information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording, or removing, for any unau-
thorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is prohibited.
     5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing means to
     quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or transmission
     devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information increases the risk to that
     information.
     5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas containing
     Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial Wireless Devices, Services,
     and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession, knowl-
edge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information when required
for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance eligibility according to
AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF 312, Classified Information
Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the information. Those granting access to clas-
sified information must gain the originator’s approval before releasing the information outside the Exec-
utive Branch or as specified by the originator of the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1. of this AFI.
[References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO 12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
     5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with Top
     Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented information to
     make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The verbal attestation must be
     witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who presides over the attestation and
     manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The procedures for personal attestation include:
        5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the Organi-
        zation block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
        5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF 312. The
        witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the Acceptance block.
        5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
     5.2.2. Confirm an individual’s access level. The holder of the information must confirm valid
     need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access to classified
     information will confirm a person's access level by:
        5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person signed the
        SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                         31


       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or commander or
       equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or supervisor. See
       paragraph 5.5. for further guidance.

5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access (see para-
graph 5.2.). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring their
employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee’s personnel records. If they have not
signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement
(Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through
JPAS prior to sending the signed form for retention.
NOTE: When the employee’s access level is passed to another office or activity, that office or activity
can assume the employee has signed one.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will retain the
   NdAs for 50 years.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21, Randolph
       AFB, TX 78150-4723.

           OH 45433-5763
       5.3.1.5. For persons outside the Executive Branch who receive access according to paragraph
       5.4., the servicing ISPM to the activity granting access will file the NdA.
   5.3.2. Refusal To Sign. When a person refuses to sign an NdA, the commander or equivalent, or staff
   agency chief:
       5.3.2.1. Initiates security incident report, in JPAS, that the person refused to sign the NdA.
       5.3.2.2. Denies the individual access to classified information.
32                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


        5.3.2.3. Initiate actions to establish a Security Information File (SIF) according to AFI 31-501.

5.4. Access by Persons Outside the Executive Branch.
     5.4.1. Policy. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits or their designees authorize indi-
     viduals outside the executive branch to access Air Force classified material as follows unless other-
     wise provided in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.2.2.
        5.4.1.1. Authorizing Officials (those cited in paragraph 5.4.1. above) may grant access once they
        have:
            5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information. Normally,
            this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2. below.
            5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security investigation
            as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check (LFC) shows there is no
            unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC must be processed according to
            AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is no current personnel security investigation
            as defined in AFI 31-501, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request
            a National Agency Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is
            complete when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
            (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS. When
            applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501, paragraph 3.11. for
            interim security clearance eligibility.
                5.4.1.1.2.1. Authority to grant access to persons outside the Executive Branch without a
                previous clearance may not be delegated below the listed positions in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.
                5.4.1.1.2.2. Before material is released to persons outside the Executive Branch without a
                previous clearance, the OCA must be contacted and approve the access.
            5.4.1.1.3. Determined granting access will benefit the government.
        5.4.1.2. Requests for access must include:
            5.4.1.2.1. The person’s name, SSAN, date and place of birth, and citizenship.
            5.4.1.2.2. Place of employment.
            5.4.1.2.3. Name and location of installation or activity where the person needs access.
            5.4.1.2.4. Level of access required.
            5.4.1.2.5. Subject of information the person will access.
            5.4.1.2.6. Full justification for disclosing classified information to the person.
            5.4.1.2.7. Comments regarding benefit(s) the U.S. Government may expect by approving the
            request.
        5.4.1.3. The authorizing official will coordinate the processing of the NAC request with the near-
        est Air Force authorized requester of investigations.
        5.4.1.4. Individuals with approval must sign an NdA before accessing information. Upon comple-
        tion of access, individuals must sign an AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                       33


  5.4.2. Congress. See AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress, for guidance when granting
  classified access to members of Congress, its committees, members, and staff representatives. [Refer-
  ence DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.1]
  5.4.3. Government Printing Office (GPO). The GPO processes and confirms their personnel’s access.
  [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.2]
  5.4.4. Representatives of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). See AFI 65-401, Relations
  with the General Accounting Office, for access requirements. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.3.]
  5.4.5. Historical Researchers. AFHRA OL-A/HOR is the authority for granting access to historical
  researchers on behalf of the Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.4.]
     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be processed only in
     exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access will be granted to the
     researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available declassification processes (i.e.,
     the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access clearly supports the interests of national secu-
     rity.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the access. The
         application will fully describe the project including the sources of documentation that the
         researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation security forces
         office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC according to AFI 31-501.
         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves access,
         the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and manuscript(s) for
         security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure the documents do not con-
         tain any classified information and, if so, determine if they can be declassified. Send the SF
         312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified information will not be removed from
         government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
             5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is possi-
             ble. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in the months
             before the end of the original agreement.
             5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
             5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential information but
             does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP information. Access to Top Secret
             or SCI information is not authorized.
             5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO, AFHRA, and the
             National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
34                                                               AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


                5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating offices in the
                Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing by the originating
                offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the researcher to secure this approval.
     5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making positions to
     which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon departure from
     office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons
     may be authorized access to classified information they originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that
     was addressed to them while serving in their official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA:
     [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.2.5.]
        5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of
        national security;
        5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4. of this AFI;
        5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force OCA has
        classification jurisdiction;
        5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the custody of
        the NARA; and,
        5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual’s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit any notes
        and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that the documents do
        not contain classified information or to determine if any classified information should be declassi-
        fied.
     5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information regarding the
     release of classified information in litigation.
     5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1. above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
     C6.2.2.7.]
     5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of classi-
     fied information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international organizations
     only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
     20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified and Unclassified Military Informa-
     tion to Foreign Governments and International Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See
     Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting classified information to foreign governments.
     5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These individuals
     need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or JPAS. (see paragraph
     5.3.1.3.).

5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD and DOD
contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security clearance information
unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
     5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee requires
     access to classified information at:
        5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the office to
        be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                            35


       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE Form
       5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data. Also see
       paragraph 1.5.1. of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority for visits
   to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel, including DOD con-
   tractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs receiving a visit
   request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government, process the
       visit request according to AFI 16-201.

5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for guidance
on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in personal or commercial
articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general publication or distribution.

5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders allow access
under the rules of the originating agency.

5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with Top
   Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These procedures ensure
   stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our most critical and sensitive
   information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and disposes of such administrative
   records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
       5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or equivalents,
       and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch Top Secret material
       establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control Officer (TSCO), with one or
       more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff agency chief will notify the installa-
       tion ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form
       143, Top Secret Register Page, to account for each document (to include page changes and
       inserts that have not yet been incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or
       equipment to include IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs
       must either describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach
       a list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost or stolen.
       EXCEPTIONS:
       5.8.1.1. (ACC) Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders and staff
       agency chiefs provide written notification to the servicing ISPM when establishing a TSCA and/
       or designating TSCOs. When requested, the ISPM provides training to these newly appointed
       officials.
           5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret messages
           kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30 days. Instead, use
           message delivery registers or other similar records of accountability.
36                                                            AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


          5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don’t use AF Forms 143 as a
          receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts suffice for
          accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims Records Disposition
          Schedule.
NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long as all of the required information is included in the
information system.
       5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
          5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet, as the
          disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret material. Each person that
          accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the form prior to initial access.
          5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several hundred doc-
          uments) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the material. NOTE: This
          applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and appropriately cleared personnel
          identified on an access roster.
       5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs:
          5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret material in the
          account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in TSCOs. These officials must
          be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of the TSCA being inventoried. The pur-
          pose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies
          resolved, and its status is correctly reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
          5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the inventory
          report.
          5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are maintained
          with the account.
          5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material in repos-
          itories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents and material be
          limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated below. If account discrepan-
          cies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief must determine if the
          random sample percentage method will suffice or if a higher percentage inventory will be
          accomplished. If the higher percentage inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will
          increase by no less than 20 percent.
              5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
              5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top Secret doc-
              uments.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                       37


              5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top Secret
              documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret documents.
      5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability requirements pre-
      scribed by the AFSAPCO.
      5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring Top Secret
      material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
      5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy of the
      main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the register page and dis-
      closure record will be faxed along with the document to the addressee. The addressee will sign and
      return them immediately to the sender for inclusion in the TSCA.
   5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for internal
   control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution system, a receipt is
   required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
   5.8.2. (ACC) Secret. Enclose the receipt in the inner envelope or container.
   5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked to do so
   by the originating activity.
   5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for receipting
   requirements.
   5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims Records
   Disposition Schedule.
   5.8.6. (Added-ACC) Commanders and staff agency chiefs ensure local security operating instruc-
   tions address facsimile transmissions via secure circuits. Also, conspicuously post quick reference
   operating procedures at equipment authorized to transmit classified information. These procedures
   should outline how facsimile equipment is operated in a secure mode.
   5.8.7. (Added-ACC) Include procedures for handling registered, certified, first class, and express
   mail in agency local operating instructions.

Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
38                                                                 AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


         5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret Cover
         Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1.) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2. above. [Reference
         DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
         5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF Form
         705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through the Air Force
         Publications Distribution system.
         5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services Adminis-
         tration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage rooms.
     5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may pre-
     clude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
     5.9.3. (Added-ACC) Include procedures for the protection, removal, or destruction of classified
     material in case of fire, natural disaster, civil disturbance, terrorist activity, or enemy action, in agency
     local operating instructions or separate policy memorandum and in the Wing or equivalent records
     managers disaster preparedness plan and vital records program.

5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or generates clas-
sified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified material is stored appro-
priately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each working day and record them
on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if the container was not opened that day.
The “Checked By” column of the SF 702 does not require end-of-day documentation. Activities that are
continuously staffed will establish local procedures to provide for daily security checks. Document those
daily security checks on the SF 701. Note: Additional security and safety checks may be added in the
blanks on the SF 701. All security containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.

5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
     5.11.1. SAF/OS and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from designated
     working areas. Requesters send requests through command ISPM channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI
     [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
     5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing Secret and
     Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
     C63.7.2.]
     5.11.2. (ACC) Submit residential storage requests to the Deputy Director of Installations for Security
     Forces (HQ ACC/A7-2 (SF)) for approval. Requests will contain full justification for residential stor-
     age and operating instructions/contingency plans for the protection of classified information at the
     residence.
     5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD 5200.1-R,
     C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up the classified con-
     tainer and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]

5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          39


   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed awareness pro-
   gram ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers, and billeting staff are
   aware of the availability.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-process-
   ing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security container and the
   in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.

5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of meetings,
   conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall be limited to appro-
   priately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor locations. Auditoriums, assembly
   halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be
   used for a classified meeting at which Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even
   though it is located on a portion of the contractor’s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the need to
   establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally, secure conference
   or classified training facilities are only established at locations where frequent classified meetings or
   forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store classified information, secure construction
   requirements are not mandated. However, if installation commanders or their designees determine the
   local threat and security environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use
   DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
   5.13.2. (ACC) Facility Approval Authority. Secure conference facilities are not required when con-
   ducting classified meetings or conferences on government installations. Organizations are highly
   encouraged to use the checklist in Attachment 9 (Added) before conducting conferences, seminars,
   exhibits, symposia, conventions, training courses, or other such gatherings during which classified
   information is disseminated to ensure proper safeguarding and access requirements are met.
      5.13.2.1. (Added-ACC) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all secure conference
      facility requirements. Security forces and civil engineering personnel will inspect all new and
      modified secure conference facilities to ensure security requirements and construction standards
      are met IAW Attachment 10 (Added). Results of the inspection will be documented in writing
      and maintained in the official records repository. The servicing ISPM certifies secure conference
      facilities in writing. The requesting organization maintains the original certification package and
      the security forces maintain a copy IAW the RDS.
      5.13.2.2. (Added-ACC) Proposed structural modifications to secure conference facilities must be
      coordinated with the ISPM and civil engineer. The ISPM and civil engineer must recertify, in
      writing, the structural integrity of secure conference facilities that have been modified.
   5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations, for
   specific guidance.
   5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or equivalents, and
   staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based on mission sensitivity and
   threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Program
   for additional guidance.
40                                                                AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are routinely
carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum standards for the protec-
tion of classified material and components while minimizing the impact on aircrew operations. The fol-
lowing minimum standards are established to provide cost effective security of classified material and
components and to ensure detection of unauthorized access.
     5.14.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified material
     and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian airfield, or when stop-
     ping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9. Aircraft commanders should consult
     with the local ISPM or senior security forces representative for assistance in complying with these
     requirements.
     5.14.2. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on aircraft, park the air-
     craft in an established restricted area or equivalent if the aircraft is designated Protection Level (PL) 1,
     2, or 3. Refer to AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security Program, for details about protection lev-
     els.
        5.14.2.1. Lock the aircraft, when possible, using a GSA-approved changeable combination pad-
        lock (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA at 800-525-8027, under NSN
        5340-00-285-6523 to secure the crew entry door, and/or
        5.14.2.2. Place all removable classified material (e.g., paper documents, floppy disks, videotapes)
        in a storage container secured with a GSA-approved lock. The storage container must be a seam-
        less metal (or similar construction) box or one with welded seams and a lockable hinged top
        secured to the aircraft. Hinges must be either internally mounted or welded. Containers installed
        for storage of weapons may also be used to store classified material even if weapons/ammunition
        are present, provided the criteria listed above have been met.
            5.14.2.2.1. Have the aircraft and container checked for tampering every 12 hours. If unable to
            comply with the 12 hours due to crew rest, perform these checks no later than 1 hour after offi-
            cial end of crew rest.
            5.14.2.2.2. Zeroize keyed COMSEC equipment as required by AFKAG-1N, Air Force Com-
            munications Security (COMSEC) Operations.
        5.14.2.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and is not equipped with a storage container, place the
        removable classified in an approved security container in an authorized U.S. facility. Classified
        components, attached to the aircraft, do not have to be removed.
        5.14.2.4. (Added-ACC) If none of the criteria in paragraphs 5.14.2.1. through 5.14.2.3. can be
        met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide continuous surveillance.
     5.14.3. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on PL 4 or non-PL air-
     craft, park the aircraft in a controlled area. PL 4 and non-PL aircraft should not be parked in a
     restricted area due to use of force limitations.
        5.14.3.1. Lock the aircraft using a GSA-approved changeable combination padlock (Federal
        Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA under NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the
        crew entry door, and
        5.14.3.2. Secure removable classified material IAW paragraph 5.14.2.2. or 5.14.2.3.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                        41


   5.14.4. At non-U.S. controlled locations, host nation restricted/controlled areas may be used only if
   all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the host nation by a
   cognizant foreign disclosure authority. Material should be secured IAW paragraph 5.14.2. for
   restricted areas and paragraph 5.14.3. for controlled areas.
   5.14.5. If the aircraft cannot be parked in a restricted/controlled area:
      5.14.5.1. Place removable classified material in a storage container and secure the container as
      described in paragraph 5.14.2.2. Lock all aircraft egress points or secure them from the inside.
      Seal the aircraft with tamper proof seals such as evidence tape, numerically accountable metal, or
      plastic seals.
      5.14.5.2. If the aircraft can be locked and sealed but there is no storage container, remove all
      removable classified material and store it in an approved security container in an authorized U.S.
      facility. Classified components (e.g., AAR 47, ALE 47, etc.) may be stored in a locked and sealed
      aircraft.
      5.14.5.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and sealed and no storage container is available, off-load
      all classified material and components to an approved security container in an authorized U.S.
      facility.
      5.14.5.4. If none of the above criteria can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide continuous
      surveillance. Foreign national personnel cleared by their government may be used if all material
      and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the host nation by a cogni-
      zant foreign disclosure authority.
   5.14.6. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs determine specific risk management security standards for weather
   diverts and in-flight emergencies. Review AFKAG-1N if the classified information is COMSEC
   material.
   5.14.6. (ACC) During weather diverts and in-flight emergencies, aircraft commanders will determine
   how classified information will be secured using the procedures in AFI 31-401, paragraph 5.14., as
   applicable. When those procedures cannot be met, and U.S. cleared personnel are not available, using
   local guards for area control is an acceptable risk when combined with the use of tamper evident seals
   on aircraft openings. When local guards are not available, the use of tamper evident seals on aircraft
   openings will be the minimum-security requirement. If the seal is subsequently determined to have
   been broken, the aircraft commander inspects the aircraft for damage, theft of equipment, sabotage,
   etc. The aircraft commander will report the incident to their home base servicing security office.
   5.14.7. If evidence exists of unauthorized entry, initiate a security investigation IAW Chapter 9 of
   this AFI.

5.15. Information Processing Equipment.
   5.15.1. Machines with Copying Capability. For copiers and facsimile machines or any machines with
   copying capability (e.g., microfiche machines), personnel consult their unit information manager
   (3A0X1) to determine if the machines are authorized for copying classified, and if so, determine if
   they retain any latent images when copying classified, and how to clear them when they do. Net-
   worked copiers present unique security hazards that require DAA approval. Also see paragraph 5.24.
   for reproduction authority [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.10.]
42                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


     5.15.1. (ACC) Machines with Copying Capability. Copiers with volatile memory, no permanent
     memory, can be approved for classified reproduction. Copiers with permanent memory are not autho-
     rized for classified reproduction. Procedures must be developed to ensure volatile memory is erased
     after each classified reproduction. Depending on the model, memory can be erased by turning off the
     copier and/or unplugging the copier.
     5.15.2. Protect information system equipment or removable hard disk drive and the information sys-
     tem media at the highest security classification processed by the system [Reference Air Force Special

     5.16.5. Retention of Classified Records. Personnel follow the disposition guidance in WebRims
     Records Disposition Schedule.

5.17. Standards for Storage Equipment. GSA-approved security containers must have a label stating
“General Services Administration Approved Security Container” affixed to the front of the container usu-
ally on the control or top drawer.
     5.17.1. If the label is missing or if the container’s integrity is in question, the container shall be
     inspected by a GSA certified inspector.
     5.17.2. Organizations without organic GSA certified inspectors must confirm that contractor inspec-
     tors are GSA certified prior to allowing them to work on GSA-approved containers.
     5.17.3. If the container is found to meet specifications, a new label shall be attached. Information on
     obtaining inspections and recertification of containers can be found in FED-STD-809 on the DOD

AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                        43


5.18. Storage of Classified Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]
   5.18.1. Replacement of Combination Locks. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs
   must ensure all combination locks on GSA-approved security containers and doors are replaced with
   those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the most sensitive informa-
   tion according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
   5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it may be nec-
   essary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or vaults are unsuit-
   able or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be constructed IAW DOD
   5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to preclude unauthorized access.
   Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an appropriate security clearance and a
   need-to-know for the classified material/information within the area. Persons without the appropriate
   level of clearance and/or need to know shall be escorted at all times by an authorized person where
   inadvertent or unauthorized exposure to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively pre-
   vented. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may pre-
   clude the use of cover sheets.
   5.18.2. (ACC) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all vault or secure room require-
   ments. Vaults and secure rooms will not be certified for convenience. Security forces and civil engi-
   neering personnel will inspect all new and modified vaults and secure rooms to ensure security
   requirements and construction standards are met IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7. Results of the
   inspection will be documented in writing and maintained in the official records repository. The ISPM
   certifies secure rooms and vaults in writing. The requesting organization maintains the original certi-
   fication package in the vault or certified room, and the security forces maintain a copy; copies must be
   maintained IAW the RDS.
      5.18.2.1. (Added-ACC) Supplemental controls, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), con-
      tinuous personal surveillance, or 4-hour checks, are required for secure rooms approved/certified
      after 1 Oct 95 storing Secret information.
      5.18.2.2. (Added-ACC) Proposed structural modifications made to vaults and secure rooms must
      be coordinated with the ISPM and civil engineer. The ISPM and civil engineer must recertify, in
      writing, the structural integrity of vaults and secure rooms that have been modified.
      5.18.2.3. (Added-ACC) Requesting organization must develop and maintain IAW the RDS a
      written plan or operating instruction outlining procedures for providing protection and positive
      entry control to the vault or secure room.
      5.18.2.4. (Added-ACC) Organizations must notify the ISPM, in writing, when the vault or secure
      room is no longer used for classified storage. Notify the supporting records manager when
      records that were required to be cross-referenced on the file plan are no longer maintained. Ensure
      classified records moved to a new location are appropriately identified on the file plan.

5.19. Use of Key-Operated Locks [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.3.6.1.]
   5.19.1. The authority to determine the appropriateness of using key-operated locks for storage areas
   containing bulky Secret and Confidential material is delegated to the unit commanders or equivalents,
   and staff agency chiefs having this storage requirement. When key-operated locks are used, the autho-
   rizing official will designate lock and key custodians.
44                                                                AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


     5.19.2. Lock and key custodians use AF Form 2427, (available on the AFEPL) to identify and keep
     track of keys.

5.20. Procurement of New Storage Equipment [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.5.]
     5.20.1. Requesters of exceptions send their requests through command ISPM channels to HQ USAF/
     XOS-FI. HQ USAF/XOS-FI will notify USD/I of the exception [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.2.]
     5.20.2. See AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Standard Base Supply Customer’s Procedures [Reference
     DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.2.]

5.21. Equipment Designations and Combinations.
     5.21.1. See AFMAN 14-304 for guidance on marking security containers used to store SCI [Refer-
     ence DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.1.]
     5.21.2. Use SF Form 700, Security Container Information (available through the Air Force Publi-
     cations Distribution system), for each vault or secure room door and security container, to record the
     location of the door or container, and the names, home addresses, and home telephone numbers of the
     individuals who are to be contacted if the door or container is found open and unattended. Applying
     classification marking to SF 700, Part 1, is not required when separated from Part 2 and 2a.
        5.21.2.1. Affix the form to the vault or secure door or to the inside of the locking drawer of the
        security container. Post SF Form 700 to each individual locking drawer of security container with
        more than one locking drawer, if they have different access requirements.
        5.21.2.2. The SF 700 contains Privacy Act information and must be safeguarded from casual
        view, but must be readily identifiable by anyone that finds the facility unsecured.
     5.21.3. When SF Form 700, Part II, is used to record a safe combination, it must be:
        5.21.3.1. Marked with the highest classification level of material stored in the security container;
        and,
        5.21.3.2. Stored in a security container other than the one for which it is being used.
        5.21.3.3. (Added-ACC) Organizations are highly encouraged to permanently mark each security
        container, using an engraving tool, with the unit and security container number. Place the marking
        on either the top-front or left/right side front of the security container. The purpose of this mark-
        ing is to be able to positively identify security containers in the event of a disaster (e.g., fire, hur-
        ricane, or other natural disaster).

5.22. Repair of Damaged Security Containers [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.7.]
     5.22.1. Locksmiths or technicians must be GSA certified and either have a favorable NAC or must be
     continuously escorted while they are repairing security containers. See guidance for unescorted entry
     to restricted areas in AFI 31-501.

   tion managers (3A0X1) issue procedures for clearing copier equipment of latent images.
   5.24.3. Security managers:
       5.24.3.1. Should display procedures for clearing latent images of equipment used to copy classi-
       fied material in a location clearly visible to anyone using the equipment;
       5.24.3.2. Develop security procedures that ensure control of reproduction of classified material;
       and,
       5.24.3.3. Ensure personnel understand their security responsibilities and follow procedures.

5.25. Control Procedures. Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs designate people/
positions to exercise reproduction authority for classified material in their activities [Reference DOD
5200.1-R, C6.5.1.]

5.26. Emergency Authority. (See EO 12958, as amended, Section 4.2(b) and ISOO Directive No. 1,
Section 2001.51.)
   5.26.1. In emergency situations, in which there is an imminent threat to life or in defense of the home-
   land; Military Department or other DOD Component Agency, MAJCOM/FOA/
   DRU commanders may authorize the disclosure of classified information to an individual or individ-
   uals who are otherwise not routinely eligible for access under the following conditions:

                              TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
     6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand carrying clas-
     sified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in critical situations. When-
     ever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for relaying the data, e.g., mail through
     secure channels or through approved secure electronic means. Authorizing officials must assess the
     risk before authorizing the hand carrying of classified material. Some factors to consider during the
     risk assessment process are:
        6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the chances of the
        material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing AFOSI office should be able
        to assist in determining the risks associated with the environment.
        6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the United States
        if the information was compromised.
        6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight lay-
        overs, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military installation or
        other government facility.
     6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop computers are an
     especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When using laptops to handcarry
     classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks are prepared according to paragraph
     6.6.3. In addition, as required for all classified material, couriers must take special care to ensure lap-
     tops and disks are kept under constant surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
     6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation Policy. HQ
     USAF/XOS-FI establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and transportation of
     classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
     6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation commanders
     approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and procedures provide ade-
     quate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
     6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel may
     acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC information
     and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201, AFI 33-211, AFI
     33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
     6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to owners of
     other agency information to request permission to release the information outside the DoD [Reference
     DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]

6.2. Transmission and Transporting Top Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.]
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                           49


   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via electronic
   means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier service [Refer-
   ence DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport classified
   material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]
      6.2.3.1. Transporting classified material through or within countries hostile to the United States or
      any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic pouch. Person-
      nel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local military postal office.

6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for overnight deliv-
   ery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between DOD Components and
   their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its Territories. This applies to locations
   in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam when overnight delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the con-
   ditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C7.1.3.3., have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
   C7.1.3.3.]
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract overnight
      delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery of Secret
      and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when overnight delivery
      cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC
      information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is
      unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures that the
      package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend. However, the
      security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the receiver has appropriate pro-
      cedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the
      package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that he or she is able to secure the package in
      approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available to
      receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.
   6.3.3. For more information on protective security service carriers see DOD 5220.22-R, Industrial
   Security Regulation, AFI 31-601, AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Materiel, and
   AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.8.]

     6.3.4. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Secret information via electronic
     means from the supporting Information Assurance office.

6.4. Transmitting Confidential Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.4.]
     6.4.1. Since first class mail bearing the “Return Service Requested” notice is an option for transmit-
     ting Confidential material, recipients must protect it as Confidential material unless they determine
     the contents are unclassified. EXCEPTION: Official Mail Center (OMC) and Activity Distribution

Security Program. All Air Force personnel need information security training whether they have access to
classified information or not. All Air Force personnel are individually responsible for protecting the
national interests of the United States. All security infractions and/or violations must be immediately
reported, circumstances examined and those responsible held accountable and appropriate corrective
action taken. Commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring that per-
sonnel are knowledgeable and understand their responsibility to protect information and resources
deemed vital to national security.

8.2. Methodology. The Air Force will provide information security training to its personnel and contrac-
tors, as appropriate, on a continuous basis using government and commercial training sources. Various
training methods will be used to administer training, such as classroom instruction, one-on-one, com-
puter-based, and other distant learning training media. The Air Force will maintain a cadre of trained pro-
fessional career security personnel and security managers to administer, implement, and measure the
program’s effectiveness. When funds and resources permit, professional security personnel and security
managers should attend in-residence type training courses.

          ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
     9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to minimize any
     possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify appropriate corrective actions
     that will be immediately implemented to prevent future security incidents. Further, if the security inci-
     dent leads to the actual or potential compromise of classified information, a damage assessment will
     be conducted to judge the effect that the compromise has on national security.
     9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall be
     reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the suspected disclo-
     sure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and disciplinary action to be
     taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]

9.2. Definitions.
     9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as defined
     in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
        9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
            9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure of classi-
            fied information.
            9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the require-
            ments of this order or its implementing directives.
            9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as amended.
        9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the require-
        ments of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
     9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have had access
     to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals with the appropriate
     security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
     9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official concludes
     that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a result of a security inci-
     dent.

9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving information sys-
tems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to begin an evaluation on the
impact of the incident to national security and the organization’s operations. If COMSEC material is
involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Vol-
ume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).

9.4. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Incidents. Safeguard all SCI material and report
incidents involving SCI to the Special Security Officer.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                        61


9.5. Special Access Program (SAP) Incidents Report security incidents involving DOD SAP materiel
through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).

9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and security
   incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if they contain
   classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable unauthorized indi-
   viduals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In the latter case, the docu-
   mentation must remain classified until the information has been retrieved and appropriately
   safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports pertaining to security incidents that have
   occurred in the information system environment when the system has been appropriately purged and
   the correspondence does not contain other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the classified
       source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
       9.6.1.2. Mark security incident notices, memorandums, and reports using derivative classification
       procedures. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5.
   9.6.2. All security incident reports will, as a minimum, be marked “For Official Use Only.” Refer to
   DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, Freedom of Information Act Program.

9.7. Public Release. Security incident reports cannot be released into the public domain until they have
undergone a security review [Reference AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.] Unauthorized disclosure of classified
information to the public must be processed IAW DODD 5210.50.

9.8. Reporting and Notifications.
   9.8.1. Personnel who learn of a security incident must immediately report it to their commander or
   equivalent, supervisor, or security manager who will in-turn report the incident to the servicing ISPM
   by the end of the first duty day.
   9.8.2. After assigning a case number beginning with calendar year, base, and sequential number for
   tracking purposes, the ISPM will:
       9.8.2.1. Coordinate with the organization security manager to ensure the commander or equiva-
       lent, or staff agency chief has been briefed on the incident. The ISPM will brief the commander or
       equivalent, or staff agency chief if the security manager is unable to do so or when the incident is
       reported directly to the ISPM.
       9.8.2.2. Report compromises/potential compromises for the following incidents through com-
       mand ISPM channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI:
           9.8.2.2.1. Classified in the public media.
           9.8.2.2.2. Foreign intelligence agencies.
           9.8.2.2.3. Criminal activity.
           9.8.2.2.4. NATO classified information.

62                                                               AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


            9.8.2.2.6. RD or FRD.
            9.8.2.2.7. Disclosure to foreign nationals.
        9.8.2.3. Notify the local AFOSI when the circumstances involve criminal activity or foreign intel-
        ligence agencies.
        9.8.2.4. Notify SAF/AAZ through the appropriate SAP channels when the compromise involves
        special access information.
     9.8.3. The appointing authority will notify the OCA, or the originator when the OCA is not known,
     when it is determined there is a compromise, potential compromise, or loss of classified information.
     Refer to paragraph 9.6.1. of this AFI for security classification marking requirements.

9.9. Preliminary Inquiry. An informal inquiry to determine if classified information has been lost or
compromised so that a damage assessment can be completed and the appropriate corrective action can be
taken.
     9.9.1. The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the security
     incident will appoint an inquiry official to conduct a preliminary inquiry. See Attachment 5 for a
     sample appointment memorandum. Refer to paragraph 9.6.1. of this AFI for appointment memoran-
     dum classification requirements. The guidelines for selection of the inquiry/investigative official are
     found in paragraph 9.11.2.
     9.9.1. (ACC) The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the
     security incident will appoint an inquiry official within two duty days to conduct a preliminary
     inquiry.
        9.9.1.1. When security incidents occur because of unauthorized transmission of classified mate-
        rial, the sending activity appoints the inquiry official and conducts the inquiry.
        9.9.1.2. Inquiry officials will coordinate their actions with the servicing ISPM and the staff judge
        advocate’s office.
     9.9.2. The preliminary inquiry will determine if classified material was compromised, the extent of
     the compromise, and the circumstances surrounding the compromise.
     9.9.3. A preliminary inquiry report will be completed using the sample report format at Attachment
     6 and submitted to the appointing official through the ISPM. The ISPM will provide their concur-
     rence/nonconcurrence with the report and forward it to the appointing official for action. Refer to
     paragraph 9.6. of this AFI for report classification requirements.
     9.9.4. The report from the preliminary inquiry will be sufficient to resolve the security incident if:
        9.9.4.1. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has not
        occurred.
        9.9.4.2. The inquiry determines that loss or compromise of classified information has occurred,
        but there is no indication of significant security weakness.
        9.9.4.3. The appointing official determines that no additional information will be obtained by
        conducting a formal investigation.
     9.9.5. If the report from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficient to resolve the security incident, the
     appointing authority initiates a formal investigation. The preliminary inquiry report will become part
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                         63


   of any formal investigation. If the inquiry is closed out as a compromise or potential compromise the
   appointing authority notifies the OCA to perform a damage assessment.
   9.9.6. If the inquiry reveals suspected unauthorized disclosure to the public notify HQ USAF/XOS-FI
   through ISPM channels. [DODD5210.50, Para 5.2.1.] Classify security incident notices, memoran-
   dums, and reports according to the classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD
   5200.1-R, Chapter 3. Specifically address:
      9.9.6.1. When, where, and how the incident occurred.
      9.9.6.2. Was classified information compromised?
      9.9.6.3. If compromise occurred, what specific classified information and/or material was
      involved?
      9.9.6.4. If classified information is alleged to have been lost, what steps were taken to locate the
      material?
      9.9.6.5. In what specific media article or program did the classified information appear?
      9.9.6.6. To what extent was the compromised information disseminated?
      9.9.6.7. Was the information properly classified?
      9.9.6.8. Was the information officially released?
      9.9.6.9. Are there any leads to be investigated that might lead to the identification of the person
      responsible for the compromise?
      9.9.6.10. Will further inquiry increase the damage caused by the compromise?
   9.9.7. Submit a completed Department of Justice (DoJ) Media leak Questionnaire, available from
   https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/ through ISPM channels to USD(I), who will coordinate with
   DOD General Counsel to determine whether a referral to the DoJ for prosecution is warranted.

9.10. Damage Assessment.
   9.10.1. A damage assessment is an analysis to determine the effect of a compromise of classified
   information on the national security. It will be initiated by the OCA upon notification of a potential or
   actual compromise to verify and reevaluate the information involved. Damage assessment reports will
   be classified and marked according to the classification guidance provided on the information being
   addressed in the reports.
   9.10.2. The OCA must:
      9.10.2.1. Verify the classification and duration of classification initially assigned to the informa-
      tion. If the OCA determines the information should be declassified, the reporting activity will be
      notified.
      9.10.2.2. Set up damage assessment controls and procedures.
      9.10.2.3. Provide a copy of the damage assessment to the inquiry or investigating official.

     9.11.1. A formal investigation is a detailed examination of evidence to determine the extent and seri-
     ousness of the compromise of classified information. The formal investigation will fix responsibility
     for any disregard (deliberate or inadvertent) of governing directives which led to the security incident.
     9.11.2. The commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief of the activity responsible for the security
     incident, will appoint an investigative official to conduct an investigation.
        9.11.2.1. The appointment letter provides authority to conduct an investigation, swear witnesses,
        and examine/copy documents, files and other data relevant to the inquiry.
        9.11.2.2. The investigative official is the personal representative of the Appointing Authority and/
        or the Commander. The investigative official must be impartial, unbiased, objective, thorough,
        and available.

   A2.1.1. Access to FOUO Information.
       A2.1.1.1. No person may have access to information designated as FOUO unless that person has
       been determined to have a valid need for such access in connection with the accomplishment of a
       lawful and authorized Government purpose.
       A2.1.1.2. The final responsibility for determining whether an individual has a valid need for
       access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has authorized posses-
       sion, knowledge or control of the information and not on the prospective recipient.
       A2.1.1.3. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DOD Components
       and between officials of DOD Components and DOD contractors, consultants, and grantees to
       conduct official business for the DOD, provided that dissemination is not further controlled by a
       Distribution Statement.
       A2.1.1.4. DOD holders of information designated as FOUO are authorized to convey such infor-
       mation to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and Judicial Branches to
       fulfill a government function. If the information is covered by the Privacy Act, disclosure is only
       authorized if the requirements of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, are satisfied.
       A2.1.1.5. Release of FOUO information to Congress is governed by AFI 90-401, Air Force Rela-
       tions With Congress. If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is authorized if the

        ments may be destroyed by any of the means approved for the destruction of classified informa-
        tion, or by any other means that would make it difficult to recognize or reconstruct the
        information.
     A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute an unau-
     thorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However, appropriate
     administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized disclosure of FOUO when-
     ever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against those responsible. Unautho-
     rized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by the Privacy Act may also result in civil and
     criminal sanctions against responsible persons. The Military Department or other DOD Component
     that originated the FOUO information shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure.

A2.2. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive.
     A2.2.1. Law Enforcement Sensitive is a marking sometimes applied, in addition to/conjunction with
     the marking FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, by the Department of Justice and other activities in the law
     enforcement community. It is intended to denote that the information was compiled for law enforce-
     ment purposes and should be afforded appropriate security in order to protect certain legitimate gov-
     ernment interests, including the protection of: enforcement proceedings; the right of a person to a fair
     trial or an impartial adjudication; grand jury information; personal privacy including records about
     individuals requiring protection under the Privacy Act; the identity of a confidential source, including
     a State, Local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on
     a confidential basis; information furnished by a confidential source; proprietary information; tech-
     niques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions; guidelines for law enforce-
     ment investigations when disclosure of such guidelines could reasonably be expected to risk
     circumvention of the law, or jeopardize the life or physical safety of any individual, including the lives
     and safety of law enforcement personnel.
     A2.2.2. Markings.
        A2.2.2.1. In unclassified documents containing Law Enforcement Sensitive information, the
        words “Law Enforcement Sensitive” shall accompany the words “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY”
        at the top and bottom of the front cover (if there is one), the title page (if there is one), and the out-
        side of the back cover (if there is one).
        A2.2.2.2. In unclassified documents, each page containing FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law
        Enforcement Sensitive information shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforce-
        ment Sensitive” at the top and bottom. Classified documents containing such information shall be
        marked as required by Chapter 5, DOD 5200.1-R except that pages containing Law Enforcement
        Sensitive information but no classified information will be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
        Law Enforcement Sensitive” top and bottom.
        A2.2.2.3. Portions of DOD classified or unclassified documents that contain FOR OFFICIAL
        USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive information shall be marked “(FOUO-LES)” at the
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                         79


       beginning of the portion. This applies to classified, as well as to unclassified documents. If a por-
       tion of a classified document contains both classified and FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law
       Enforcement Sensitive information, the appropriate classification designation is sufficient to pro-
       tect the information.
   A2.2.3. Access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. The criteria for allow-
   ing access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive are the same as those used for
   FOUO information, except that if the information also bears the marking “Originator Control” or
   “ORCON” the information may not be disseminated beyond the original distribution without the
   approval of the originating office.
   A2.2.4. Protection of FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. Within the DoD,
   FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive shall be protected as required for FOUO
   information.

A2.3. Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Information. SBU information is information originated
within the Department of State that warrants a degree of protection and administrative control and meets
the criteria for exemption from mandatory public disclosure under FOIA. When SBU information is
included in DOD documents, it shall be marked as if the information were FOUO [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R,
Appendix 3, Para AP3.3.]

A2.4. Protection of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Sensitive Information. Unclassified

                                 BRIEFING
A8.1. (Added-ACC) CNWDI Definition. DoD 5200.1-R defines CNWDI as "that Top Secret
Restricted Data or Secret Restricted Data revealing the theory of operation or design of the components of
a thermo-nuclear or implosion-type fission bomb, warhead, demolition munition, or test device. Specifi-
cally excluded is information concerning arming, fusing, and firing systems; limited life components; and
total contained quantities of fissionable, fusionable, and high explosive materials by type. Among these
excluded items are the components that DoD personnel set, maintain, operate, test, or replace." The
abbreviation "CNWDI" or its related term is unclassified.
A8.2. (Added-ACC) Granting CNWDI Access:
     A8.2.1. (Added-ACC) CNWDI is vital information and access is limited to the minimum number of
     persons who need it to do their assigned job.
     A8.2.2. (Added-ACC) Individuals granted CNWDI access must have a final Top Secret or Secret
     security clearance, depending on the level of information they will require. Immigrant aliens can be
     certified for access to CNWDI only by select officials at HQ USAF and above levels of command.
     A8.2.3. (Added-ACC) Formal access authorization to CNWDI is given by division chiefs and above,
     and is recorded on AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action. NOTE: Briefer does not
     require CNWDI access to serve as unit briefer.
     A8.2.4. (Added-ACC) AF Form 2583. Complete Section I, blocks 1 through 7; Section II, block 9;
     Section III, blocks 10 through 14; Section VI, blocks 27 through 29; and Section VII by entering the
     following in block 30:
     MEMBER REQUIRES ACCESS TO CNWDI MATERIAL FOR ROUTINE ACCESS.
     Briefed according to DoDD 5210.2 and AFI 31-401. Date of briefing _________________. Signa-
     ture of person receiving briefing ____________________________________________.
     A8.2.5. (Added-ACC) Keep the AF Form 2583 in unit files for duration of the individual's access to
     CNWDI and dispose of IAW RDS.
A8.3. (Added-ACC) Dissemination of Material. CNWDI material can be disclosed only to other per-
sonnel authorized such access. In cases where visitors require access to CNWDI, determine if access is
authorized by verifying JCAVS, official visit requests, or by contacting the visitor's parent organization.
A8.4. (Added-ACC) Procedural Requirements. In addition to those requirements already specified for
other classified information, these procedures apply to CNWDI material:
     A8.4.1. (Added-ACC) Marking Material:
        A8.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Mark portions of classified documents that contain CNWDI with "(N)"
        following the classification; for example, "(S-RD)(N)."
        A8.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Mark the face or front page of documents that contain CNWDI, includ-
        ing unclassified letters of transmittal, with "CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFOR-
        MATION-DOD DIRECTIVE 5210.2 APPLIES." This marking is in addition to the Restricted
        Data warning notice.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          95


      A8.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Mark messages that contain CNWDI with "CNWDI" immediately fol-
      lowing the overall classification, which is the first item of information in the text of electronically
      transmitted messages.

   the level of other classified information; however, limit access to such containers to only those person-
   nel who have been granted CNWDI access. When containers are unlocked, they must be under the
   direct surveillance of a person authorized CNWDI access.
   A8.4.3. (Added-ACC) Compromise of CNWDI Material. Since CNWDI material is Restricted
   Data, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 governs its use. Always send notifications of suspected
   CNWDI compromises through Security Forces channels to the Directorate of Security Forces and
   Force Protection, Information Security Division (HQ USAF/A7SI).
   A8.4.4. (Added-ACC) Transmission of Material. Show on envelopes or other containers enclosing
   CNWDI the Restricted Data warning notice, the DoD Directive 5210.2 notice (see A8.4.1.2. (Added)
   above), and the notation "To be opened only by personnel authorized access to CNWDI material."
   A8.4.5. (Added-ACC) Disposal and Destruction. Ascertain disposal IAW the RDS. In addition to
   the required number of persons to witness destruction of other classified material, persons destroying
   CNWDI or committing this material to a central destruction activity must be cleared for CNWDI
   access.
A8.5. (Added-ACC) CNWDI Debriefings. When access is no longer required, an individual is
debriefed, using AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement. Maintain the AF Form 2587 IAW
RDS.

          CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR SECURE CONFERENCE FACILITIES
A10.1. (Added-ACC) Objectives. To provide guidelines for the achievement of effective security in
ACC facilities in which collateral classified information is discussed and handled on a daily basis. Nor-
mally, secure conference facilities are only set up at locations where daily classified conferences or
forums occur. The guidance provided herein should be considered when building new facilities or reno-
vating existing facilities.
A10.2. (Added-ACC) Secure Conference Facility. For the purpose of this instruction, a secure confer-
ence facility is defined as an area provided special acoustical, technical, and physical security protection,
and designated for the discussion and handling of classified defense information on a continuous basis.
Due to the high costs of building a secure conference facility, the number of secure conference facilities
will be kept to the absolute minimum consistent with mission accomplishment.
A10.3. (Added-ACC) General Approach. The achievement of adequate security for conference facili-
ties so as to protect all classified information therein requires a blend of acoustical, technical, and physical
security measures. This blend is obtained through the coordination of acoustical, electronics, civil engi-
neering, and security personnel from the initial planning stage through construction and inspection
phases. The installation Civil Engineer or Construction Agent is responsible for the design and construc-
tion of secure conference facilities. Qualified persons should be consulted for solutions to acoustical
problems. The installation Civil Engineer, Construction Agent, or a qualified consultant should be able to
help in the solution of acoustical problems. All elements comprising the physical boundaries of the facil-
ity must have a uniformly low transmission of sound through the exterior envelope (walls, ceiling, floor,
and doors) of the secure space. No utilities should serve as a fortuitous probe to electronic or audio sig-
nals emanating from the secure facility. Physical access to the area must be controlled. Secure confer-
ence facilities will not be constructed adjacent to facilities not under U.S. control. After architectural
plans are complete and before a contract is let, physical and technical security specialists will review the
plans for potential security weaknesses. If uncleared personnel accomplish the construction, it is recom-
mended that appropriately cleared owner/user personnel periodically check the facility, with particular
emphasis on monitoring the installation of security items and to preclude the installation of clandestine
surveillance devices.
A10.4. (Added-ACC) Acoustical Security. Acoustical security deals with all measures necessary to
minimize the loss of intelligible information acoustically radiated within an area through proper construc-
tion techniques.
     A10.4.1. (Added-ACC) Acoustical security treatment. The following facets of acoustical treatment
     are provided as a general guide to achieve adequate acoustical security:
        A10.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Doors & Frames. Commercially available doors acoustically rated
        with a proper Sound Transmission Class (STC) Laboratory rating shall be used. This rating
        should be 5 - 7 STC Points higher than the Noise Isolation Class (NIC) objective. One concept
        employs the use of a double door system. In this system two doors are mounted back-to-back with
        wider doorjambs used. This gives the added advantage of a relatively dead air space between the
        inner and outer area and overcomes the direct link from the outside to interior via the door hard-
        ware assemblies, such as locks. Fire rated doors will not be used, as they cannot be made to meet
        the required STC rating. Lead sheets on the inner surface of both doors helps to increase the sound
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                       99


     transmission loss. Any items of hardware installed on such doors should not in themselves create
     a sound leakage path. Doors are the weakest link in the system and because they have moving
     parts, they should be maintained on a scheduled basis. Doors must be acoustically tested bienni-
     ally to ensure continuing compliance with required NIC standards.
     A10.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Doorjambs. Only factory supplied, acoustically rated STC doors that
     are delivered in factory-supplied doorframes and that have been STC rated, as a functional unit,
     shall be used. The doorframe shall be installed per manufacturer’s instruction.
     A10.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Door thresholds. Wooden thresholds are preferred over metal because
     of their lower sound conductivity rating. All thresholds will be sealed at all points of contact with
     the floor and doorframe.
     A10.4.1.4. (Added-ACC) Expansion joints. Conference facilities should not be located where
     building expansion joints will form a part of or be immediately against any portion of the facility
     perimeters. Such joints cannot be effectively soundproofed on a continuing basis, since the joints
     are always subject to gap changes resulting from ambient temperature variations or building
     movements.
     A10.4.1.5. (Added-ACC) Holes or crevices. Holes or crevices in all exterior boundaries should
     be completely sealed with elastomeric caulking cement or equivalent mortar of such sufficiency as
     to prevent sound leakage and maintain the overall uniformity of sound transmission loss.
     A10.4.1.6. (Added-ACC) Pipes, ducts, and conduits. Holes or crevices around pipes, ducts, and
     conduit passing into any part of the facility should be well sealed as discussed above. All pipes,
     ducts, or conduits, must contain a dielectric break (nonmetallic coupling) where passing through
     the perimeter wall, or be treated with structural masking. Those pipes remaining inside the facil-
     ity, which are surface mounted, should be covered with an effective insulating material to attenu-
     ate the coupling of sound vibrations to the pipe (a possible transmission link from the facility).
     However, clean metal-to-metal contact is required where ducts or pipes pass through electrical
     shielding. Likewise, all service boxes connected to pipes and conduits should be covered. When
     necessary, a short length of pipe leaving a service box should be filled with fiberglass to attenuate
     airborne sound transmitted within the pipe.
     A10.4.1.7. (Added-ACC) Metal beams or posts. The presence of metal beams and posts within
     the conference facility should be avoided wherever possible, since they both minimize the utility
     of a facility and require acoustical treatment in essentially the same manner as pipes and conduits
     mentioned above.
     A10.4.1.8. (Added-ACC) Radiators. Hot water or steam radiators will not be installed, as they
     are difficult to make acoustically secure. The best heating system for security is an electrical
     heater within each room, since the electrical power circuits can be more easily made secure.
     A10.4.1.9. (Added-ACC) Air conditioners. If possible, secure conference facilities should be
     equipped with an air conditioning system independent of the master building system. Master
     building systems, with all their air supply and return ducts, are more difficult to make secure. A
     dedicated air conditioning system should be installed in TOP SECRET areas. The background
     noise contribution of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems should not exceed 42
     dB as measured inside the secure area.
100                                                           AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


      A10.4.1.10. (Added-ACC) Air ducts and ventilation grills. Air ducts and ventilation grills create
      severe security problems in that they provide a ready path for the transmission of both airborne
      and structure-borne sound energy. All duct penetrations shall be fitted with commercially avail-
      able duct silencers having a Dynamic Insertion Loss equal to the specified STC rating of the
      secure perimeter it self. The sides of the duct silencer shall have the same STC rating as the
      perimeter. A steel screen with ½ inch square mesh will be installed to preclude the introduction of
      a clandestine listening device. An approved duct silencer manufactured of non-sound conductive
      materials will be used to decouple duct sections where any part of air duct passes through an exte-
      rior boundary of the facility. As an alternative, the ducts may be treated with structural sound
      masking at the inside point of penetration.
      A10.4.1.11. (Added-ACC) Sound system speakers. Speakers should be located as far as practi-
      cable from all air return inlets and, under no circumstances, mounted on perimeter surfaces. They
      should be mounted at a point where the sound transmission loss is the greatest (i.e., on a pillar) and
      likewise, the greatest levels of sound energy must be directed inward, away from any exterior
      walls. , A sound level or volume-unit (VU) meter should be installed as part of the sound system
      to assure sound levels of 75dB or below are maintained to avoid nullifying the acoustical security
      treatment provided the area. Once the 75 dB is achieved, the volume control should be secured.
      Amplified sound shall utilize a well-distributed speaker system (such as speakers suspended from
      the ceiling) so that the sound pressure level does not exceed more than 75 dB at any place within
      the room (certain work areas may require a higher speaker dB).
      A10.4.1.12. (Added-ACC) Communications devices. Telephones, intercoms, or any other com-
      munications devices that transmit clear text audio from an area should be kept to an absolute min-
      imum, consistent with essential operational requirements. Each such device and its planned
      location should be considered carefully, for when in use they transmit from the area all conversa-
      tions conducted within proximity of the device. No cell phones, camera cell phones, cordless tele-
      phones, or wireless microphones, keyboards, or mice, wireless or Infrared Local Area Networks
      (LANs), or devices are allowed in areas where classified information is discussed, briefed, or pro-
      cessed. “Area” refers to a room and/or to a space the size of a 3-meter radius sphere, centering on
      the classified source. In areas where classified information is discussed, briefed, or processed,
      wireless pointer/ mice devices are allowed for presentations only. All other wireless portable/per-
      sonal electronic devices (PEDs) not specifically addressed above, that are used for storing, pro-
      cessing, and/or transmitting information shall not be operated in areas where classified
      information is electronically stored, processed, or transmitted. Classified information could unin-
      tentionally be transmitted from an area over unsecured communications systems because of poor
      planning. Care as to the quantity and location of communications devices, along with acoustical
      shells or booths about various work centers, can greatly reduce undesired sound transmissions via
      unsecured communication links. During planning stages, the use of secure communication
      devices must be considered, i.e. STU III, push to talk, etc.
      A10.4.1.13. (Added-ACC) Alcoves or sound locks. A small room of suitable size can be pro-
      vided at the main entrance door for both access control and the prevention of inadvertent overhear-
      ing whenever the outer door is opened. As an alternative measure, to identify visitors before
      opening a single door, either a closed circuit television system or a miniature, wide-angle optical
      lens (with a suitable hinged, lockable cover over the inside portion) may be installed in the
      entrance door.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                          101


       A10.4.1.14. (Added-ACC) Windows. Windows will not be provided in new construction. When
       present in existing construction, windows will be removed or sealed and covered to provide an
       NIC rating equal to the surrounding wall area. Where windows must exist, venetian blinds and
       masking sound are required in the window area. Installation of man bars outside the windows
       should be considered. Completely eliminating the windows and replacing them with similar con-
       struction, as the surrounding wall is preferable. Where windows must exist, venetian blinds and
       flameproof heavy drapes (11 oz/sq yd or better) are encouraged to cover such windows inside the
       area.
       A10.4.1.15. (Added-ACC) Ceilings, Walls, and Floors. True walls (structural floor to ceiling)
       will be installed in all new construction. For existing structures that do not meet the above
       requirement, a cap must be installed providing an NIC rating equal to the walls of the room. The
       presence of false ceilings, walls, and floors in new or old construction must be carefully compared
       against the total transmission loss afforded.
       A10.4.1.16. (Added-ACC) Floor trenches. Service or utility trenches of any type under the floor
       should be filled, if possible, with concrete. If this cannot be done, masking sound is required.
   A10.4.2. (Added-ACC) Sound Transmission Class: STC is a numerical rating system for laboratory
   determined transmission loss. In this rating system, acoustical security is determined solely by the
   attenuation (transmission loss) of airborne speech between the source and a potential listener outside
   the perimeter of the facility. The sound transmission loss (TL) of a partition is measured in 16
   third-octave bands between 125 Hertz and 4000 Hertz, with each specific TL figure plotted in decibels
   on a graph. The resulting curve should be normalized against a standard curve, with the overall sound
   transmission loss expressed as a single figure value called STC (reference: ASTME E90, E-336, and
   E-413). The NICs provided in Table 1 are recommended minimums for secure conference facilities,
   depending on the level of classification discussed therein, the sound power level of speech within the
   area, and the ambient noise level in outside adjacent areas. Noise reduction tests in accordance with
   the ASTM E-413 in-to-out test procedures shall be performed after construction is completed and
   when modifications are made to the perimeter surface. The test data should be plotted per ASTM
   E-413 and expressed in a single number NIC. NIC is the same as STC except that an STC test is per-
   formed on partitions in an acoustical laboratory, and a NIC test is of a completed structure such as a
   finished secure facility. Thus, STC ratings are used to select the wall construction, doors, etc., and
   NIC is what you get when the facility is fully assembled. AN ASTM E-336 test procedure shall be
   conducted on each wall, floor, ceiling, and perimeter door within the facility. The lowest NIC among
   the test points shall be that of the entire facility. Because ambient noise outside an area is a variable,
   i.e., day vs. night, duty hours vs. nonduty hours, etc, it may be necessary to employ sound masking
   techniques. Such units consist of electronically controlled noise systems or vibration transmitters
   installed within the perimeter. The employment of such noise generators in wall voids, doors, win-
   dows, and overhead ducts is a more economical technique to achieve acceptable transmission losses.
A10.5. (Added-ACC) Technical Security. Technical security encompasses those measures necessary to
deny the use of existing technical equipment that may have compromising emanations or the installation
of clandestine technical surveillance devices to collect intelligence from within an area. The servicing
communications activity and Office of Special Investigations should be contacted for guidance regarding
technical security issues during the initial planning stages of the secure facility. Some guidelines for tech-
nical security treatment are as follows:
102                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


      A10.5.1. (Added-ACC) Electrical services. All electrical wiring should, if at all possible, be run
      from a common distribution panel located within the secure discussion area. A single feeder circuit
      entering the area should service the panel. Radio frequency filters should be included if any equip-
      ment is located within the secure conference facility that may have possible compromising emana-
      tions. Final determinations of the requirement (or lack thereof) for filters will be made by the Air
      Force Communications Agency Certified Technical TEMPEST Authority (AFCA/CTTA).
      A10.5.2. (Added-ACC) Communications services. All wires or cables that transmit information to
      or from a secure conference facility should be routed to a common distribution frame from which a
      single multi-pair cable leaves the area. All obsolete wires should be removed. Unused wires required
      for future expansion should be electrically grounded at the distribution frame within the secure area.
      All communications systems installed should be the minimum necessary consistent with essential and
      efficient operations. All voice systems, incoming or outgoing, secure or unsecured, should be
      designed such that when not in use (turned "on") they do not transmit clear text conversation from the
      area. Line disconnect jacks on outgoing circuits and isolation amplifiers on incoming circuits are an
      effective means to render such systems secure when not in use. Radio frequency filters should be
      included if any equipment is located within the secure conference facility that may have possible com-
      promising emanations.
      A10.5.3. (Added-ACC) Telephones. All telephones should be equipped with an automatic discon-
      nect device or a manual plug-type disconnect to disconnect the telephone from the outgoing line.
      When disconnects are employed nonresonant external ringers are required. See paragraph
      A10.4.1.12. (Added) above for further guidance.
      A10.5.4. (Added-ACC) Shielding. If equipment that unintentionally radiates clear text intelligence
      is used in a secure conference facility to process classified information, consideration must be given
      to Radio Frequency (RF) shielding the equipment or the facility to contain the compromising emana-
      tions. Although technical security surveys do provide a determination if any clandestine technical
      surveillance devices were or currently are in place, they do not provide protection against future
      installations or unwitting carriers unless very stringent physical security and access controls are in
      effect. One countermeasure, which commanders may consider to combat clandestine RF transmitters,
      is the utilization of RF shielding about sensitive conference sites.
A10.6. (Added-ACC) Physical Security: Physical security encompasses those measures necessary to
deny the physical access of unauthorized personnel to a designated area. Physical security can be
achieved through the employment of physical barriers, locking devices, and IDS, or combinations thereof.
Since secure conference facilities are located on Air Force installations and are not used to store classified
information, secure construction requirements IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7, are not mandated.
However, if ISPMs determine the local threat and security environment dictates more stringent construc-
tion requirements, they may use DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7, as a guide for constructing the secure con-
ference facility. Some physical security guidelines that can be followed for normal threat environments
are as follows:
      A10.6.1. (Added-ACC) Facility Structure. The floor, walls, and roof must be of permanent con-
      struction materials offering resistance to, and evidence of unauthorized entry into the area. Walls shall
      be extended to the true ceiling and attached with permanent construction materials. Windows should
      not be installed in new secure conference facility construction. Follow the guidance in paragraph
      A10.4.1.14. (Added) above for windows in existing construction. Clean, straightforward construc-
      tion techniques should be employed. Whenever possible, all utility pipes, conduits, and related com-
AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006                                                                              103


   ponents should be run exposed on interior wall or ceiling surfaces to minimize exploitation, while
   facilitating their periodic examination. Likewise, access ports or doors should be provided to permit
   the periodic examination within concealed areas, i.e., above false ceilings, under stages, etc. In gen-
   eral, the secure conference facility should be kept orderly, with only furniture necessary to minimize
   concealment locations.
   A10.6.2. (Added-ACC) Locking Devices. Entrances to the secure conference facility should be kept
   to an absolute minimum commiserate with local fire and safety codes. Doors will be substantially
   constructed of wood or metal. Doors will be equipped with a locking mechanism to prevent unautho-
   rized entry into the facility when not in use. Built-in, manipulation-proof, three position combination
   locks with an interior safety release turn knob that conforms to GSA Federal Specifications,
   FF-L-2740, will be used on entry doors to provide maximum security. Panic hardware will be
   installed on the inner side of all emergency doors. Emergency doors will not have any hardware on
   the outside of the doors.
   A10.6.3. (Added-ACC) Door hinges. Door hinges should be installed to deny access to the pivot
   pin, as its removal often makes an otherwise very secure door highly susceptible to being opened. If
   the hinge pin must be exposed, then it should be fixed to preclude its removal or the door additionally
   secured on the hinge side from within.
   A10.6.4. (Added-ACC) Openings. All openings large enough to permit a person to gain unautho-
   rized access into an area, 96 square inches or greater, should be appropriately sealed. Either physical
   security bars or complete and permanent blockage of the opening is desirable. Special care is neces-
   sary to ensure all utility areas such as steam tunnels, air ducts, air shafts, utility shafts, are secure, as is
   the area above a false ceiling. All windows and other openings which exist in boundary surfaces of a
   secure conference facility and which adjoin areas of lesser security must be covered or sealed to deny
   optical and audio surveillance of classified information therein. Optical surveillance techniques
   include the unaided and aided human eye (binoculars, etc,), photographic and TV cameras, infrared
   scanners, etc. Audio surveillance techniques include lip reading, infrared pick-off devices, etc. Pro-
   tective coverings over all openings should include glass opaque to infrared or ultraviolet band energy,
   venetian blinds, and flameproof heavy drapes (11 oz/sq yd or heavier).
   A10.6.5. (Added-ACC) Intrusion Detection Alarm System (IDS). Since classified information is not
   stored in secure conference room facilities, Intrusion Detection Alarm Systems are not required. The
   inclusion of IDS is only recommended when the local threat and security environment dictates more
   stringent security requirements to prevent the installation of clandestine technical surveillance
   devices. The system should include volume, perimeter, and point sensors. Proximity and motion
   detectors provide protection for unique problems. All intrusion alarm systems should include electri-
   cal line supervision between the protected area and monitoring location. Further, all systems should
   be capable of sustaining normal operation for 24 hours after a commercial power loss. All sensors
   employed must detect an intrusion and be immune to normal bypass techniques. When used, all intru-
   sion detection alarm systems should be of the type, and so installed, that they do not transmit intelli-
   gence from an area.
A10.7. (Added-ACC) Masking Sound Applied to Speech Security. In order to make it impossible to
understand speech outside the secure area, the system design goal must be to reduce speech intelligibility
in all situations, whether it is the result of human listening or listening with detection devices. Techni-
cally, the purpose of masking sound is to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of a sound to zero at all pertinent
frequencies. In this context, the signal is the speech and the noise is the masking sound. When the speech
104                                                              AFI31-401_ACCSUP1_I 7 APRIL 2006


intelligibility is zero, the privacy is total and the signal to noise ratio is zero. This is adequate for direct
human listening, but when detection devices are used and signal-processing techniques are used on the
derived signal, it is possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and recover meaning. To keep speech
intelligibility at zero, the masking should be amenable to signal processing techniques that could reduce
its effectiveness. This can be done with a masking signal that is the result of a stationary random process.
The masking signal becomes not only unknowable but cannot be processed with statistical techniques.
Standard masking generators are digital using components in which the signal repeats itself after one
minute. They are called pseudo random controlled noise generators. The sound created by them may
appear random to the listener, but is in fact a deterministic process. Sophisticated techniques can make
use of this deterministic property to increase the speech intelligibility and thus recover speech. Analog
masking generators are somewhat better in that they create a truly random signal, but suffer from the fact
that the signal is Gaussian and stationary, statistical properties that make signal processing easier. This
aspect of the problem is handled in the equipment generating the masking sound. The most effective
method for structural masking is when random signal vibrations are introduced directly to the perimeter
barrier surface to control background sound levels at potential listening points. The sound masking sys-
tem and all wires and transducers shall be located within the perimeter of the facility. Speakers can be
located outside the facility and directed outward as close as practicable to the facility’s perimeter where
the sound transmission loss is the greatest (i.e. doors, windows, HVAC ducts, electrical and plumbing
conduit, etc.) to achieve the required/desired STC rating. The sound masking system should only be uti-
lized when the required/desired STC rating is not achievable through physical security means.
