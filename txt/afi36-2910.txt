This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1 TO AFI 36-2910. This change incorporates
interim change (IC) 2002-1 (Attachment 9). This change requires an informal line of duty
determination to be initiated in the case of each active duty death in order to fulfill requirements
for Survivor Benefit Plan and Educational Assistance Death Benefits (sections 1.2.8; 1.5.1;
2.3.2). See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2002-1, for the complete IC. A “|” indicates
revised material since the last edition.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change authorizes automated/electronic line of duty (LOD) determination
processing (paragraph 3.2.). HQ AFPC/JA previously approved the Air Force Reserve
Command‟s development and fielding of automated processing. This interim change
implements 10 U.S.C. Section 1207a‟s “eight year rule,” which states members of the Air
Reserve Component (ARC) called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days,
who have incurred a disabling condition and have at least eight years of active service, shall have
the disability considered incurred while entitled to basic pay for the purpose of determining
whether the condition was incurred in the line of duty (paragraph 3.4.1.2.3.). This interim
change also implements IC-1, 13 November 2008, to DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6495.02, Sexual
Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, 23 June 2006, which mandates modified
line of duty (LOD) procedures for ARC members who choose restricted reporting of sexual
assaults so they may continue to access medical care and psychological counseling (paragraphs
3.3.5.; 3.3.5.1.; 3.3.5.1.1.; 3.3.5.1.2.; 3.3.5.1.3.; 3.3.5.2.; 3.3.5.2.1.; 3.3.5.2.2.; 3.3.5.2.3.; 3.3.5.3.;
3.3.5.4.; and 3.4.2.1.7.). A margin bar (/) indicates newly revised material.

                                            Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM ELEMENTS

1.1. The Line Of Duty (LOD) Determination and Its Objective. A service member who dies
or sustains an illness, injury, or disease either while absent from duty, or due to his or her own
misconduct, stands to lose substantial government benefits. An LOD determination is a finding
made after an investigation into the circumstances of a member‟s illness, injury, disease or death.
The finding concludes (1) whether or not the illness, injury, or disease existed prior to service
(EPTS) and if an EPTS condition was aggravated by military service, (2) whether or not the
illness, injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent from duty and (3)
whether or not the illness, injury, disease or death was due to the member‟s own misconduct.
The LOD determination protects the interests of both the member and the United States
Government.
1.2. Use of the LOD Determination. An LOD determination may impact the following:
   1.2.1. Disability Retirement and Severance Pay. A member‟s entitlement to disability
   compensation from the Air Force may be lost or reduced if the disability occurred during a
   period of unauthorized absence or resulted from the member‟s own misconduct. (Title 10,
   U.S.C. 1201, Regulars and members on active duty for more than 30 days: retirement; 1203,
   Regulars and members on active duty for more than 30 days: separation; 1204, Members on
   active duty for 30 days or less or on inactive-duty training: retirement; 1206, Members on
   active duty for 30 days or less or on inactive-duty training: separation; and 1207, Disability
   from intentional misconduct or willful neglect: separation).
   1.2.2. Forfeiture of Pay. A member may not be entitled to pay if he or she was absent from
   regular duties for a continuous period of more than one day because of injury or disease that
   was directly caused by or immediately follows his or her intemperate use of drugs or alcohol.
   (Title 37, U.S.C. 802, Forfeiture of pay during absence from duty due to disease from
   intemperate use of alcohol or drugs).
   1.2.3. Extension of Enlistment. An enlisted member‟s period of enlistment may be extended
   to include that period of time he or she was unable to perform duties because of his or her
   intemperate use of drugs or alcohol. (Title 10, U.S.C. 972, Members: effect of time lost).
   1.2.4. Veteran Benefits. The Department of Veteran Affairs may use a member‟s official
   military records, including an LOD determination, when determining veteran benefits. (Title
   38, U.S.C. Section: 1110, Wartime Disability Compensation, Basic Entitlement; 1131,
   Peacetime Disability Compensation Veterans’ Benefits).
   1.2.5. Survivor Benefit Plan. If the member dies on active duty and in the line of duty, a
   member‟s surviving dependents may be eligible for benefits under the Survivor Benefit Plan.
   (Title 10, U.S.C. Section 1448, Application of Plan; Section 643 National Defense
   Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, Public Law 107-107, December 28, 2001).
   1.2.6. Medical Benefits for Members of the ARC. ARC Members may be entitled to hospital
   benefits and medical pensions in certain circumstances. (Title 10, U.S.C. 1074a, Medical and
   dental care for members and certain former members, Title 32, U.S.C. 318 Compensation for
   disablement during training, and Title 37, U.S.C. 204, Entitlement).
6                                                                 AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


    1.2.7. Incapacitation Pay for ARC Members. ARC members may be entitled to
    incapacitation benefits in certain circumstances. (Title 37, U.S.C.).
    1.2.8. Basic Educational Assistance Death Benefit. Certain survivors of deceased members
    entitled to basic educational assistance may be entitled to death benefits (Title 37, U.S.C.
    3017, Death Benefit).
1.3. Limits on Use of an LOD Determination. An LOD determination shall not be used for
the following purposes:
    1.3.1. Disciplinary Action. The LOD determination is separate and distinct from judicial
    processes or other disciplinary actions. In some instances it may be appropriate to conduct
    disciplinary actions simultaneously with the LOD determination.
    1.3.2. Reimbursement of Medical Expenses. An active duty member cannot be denied
    medical treatment based on an LOD determination. An LOD determination does not
    authorize the United States to recoup the cost of medical care from the active duty member.
1.4. Personnel Who May Be Subject to LOD Determinations.
    1.4.1. Active duty Air Force members.
    1.4.2. Members of the ARC who die, incur or aggravate an illness, injury, or disease while:
       1.4.2.1. On published orders for any period of time, or while on inactive duty.
       1.4.2.2. Traveling directly to or from the place the member performs active duty, or
       inactive duty for training (IDT).
    1.4.3. United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) cadets.
    1.4.4. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets who die, or incur or
    aggravate an illness, injury, or disease while performing military training.
1.5. When an LOD Determination is Required. The LOD determination process must be
initiated when a member, whether hospitalized or not, has an illness, injury or disease that results
in:
    1.5.1. The death of a member. In every case where a member dies on active duty, at a
    minimum, an AF Form 348 must be completed. An administrative determination is not
    sufficient in a case of death.
    1.5.2. The member‟s inability to perform military duties for more than 24 hours,
    1.5.3. The likelihood of a permanent disability, or
    1.5.4. Medical treatment of a member of the ARC regardless of the member‟s ability to
    perform military duties.
    1.5.5. The likelihood of an ARC member applying for incapacitation pay.
1.6. Presumption of LOD Status. An illness, injury, disease or death sustained by a member in
an active duty status or in IDT status is presumed to have occurred in the line of duty.
1.7. Rebuttal of LOD Presumption. The presumption that a member‟s illness, injury, disease
or death occurred in the line of duty may be rebutted if:
    1.7.1. A medical officer diagnoses that the illness, injury or disease existed prior to service.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                          7


   1.7.2. A formal investigation determines that the illness, injury, disease or death,
      1.7.2.1. Occurred while the member was absent without authority; or
      1.7.2.2. Was proximately caused by the member‟s own misconduct.
1.8. Evidence.
   1.8.1. Evidentiary Standard. A preponderance of evidence is required to find that an illness,
   injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent without authority or was due
   to a member‟s own misconduct. A preponderance of evidence is the greater weight of
   credible evidence.
   1.8.2. Evidence Considered. When weighing the evidence consider all available evidence
   including:
      1.8.2.1. Direct evidence, i.e., that is based on actual knowledge or observation of
      witnesses, and
      1.8.2.2. Indirect evidence, i.e., facts or statements from which reasonable inferences,
      deductions, and conclusions may be drawn to establish an unobserved fact, knowledge, or
      state of mind.
   1.8.3. Weighing Evidence. The weight of the evidence is not determined by the number of
   witnesses or exhibits but by considering all the evidence and evaluating factors such as a
   witness‟ behavior, opportunity for knowledge, information possessed, ability to recall and
   related events and relationship to the matter being considered.
1.9. LOD Determinations. One of the following four findings will be applied to the member‟s
illness, injury, disease or death:
   1.9.1. In Line of Duty. The illness, injury, disease or death did not occur while the member
   was absent without authority and was not due to the member‟s own misconduct. For ARC
   members, the illness, injury, disease or its aggravation, or death occurred while the member
   was in a duty or direct travel status, and was not due to the member‟s own misconduct.
   1.9.2. Existed Prior to Service, EPTS, LOD Not Applicable. A medical diagnosis determined
   that the death, illness, injury or disease, or the underlying condition causing it, existed before
   the member‟s entry into military service or between periods of service and was not
   aggravated by service. Further LOD determination is not required.
   1.9.3. Not in Line of Duty, Not Due to Own Misconduct. A formal investigation determined
   that the member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent
   from duty.
   1.9.4. Not in Line of Duty, Due to Own Misconduct. A formal investigation determined that
   the member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death was proximately caused by the member‟s own
   misconduct. If the member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death occurred both while the
   member was absent from duty and was proximately caused by the member‟s own
   misconduct, the case should be finalized as Not in Line of Duty, Due to Own Misconduct.

                                            Chapter 2

       LOD DETERMINATION PROCEDURES FOR ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS

2.1. Processing the LOD Determination for a Member on Active Duty. When processing a
Line of Duty Determination for a member on active duty, apply the procedures outlined in this
chapter.
2.2. Administering the LOD Determination Process.
    2.2.1. Responsibilities in the LOD Determination. Medical Officers, Commanders, and Staff
    Judge Advocates (SJA) who learn of a member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death that
    occurred under circumstances that may warrant an LOD determination shall take an active
    role in ensuring that a determination is initiated.
    2.2.2. The Military Personnel Flight (MPF). The MPF/DPMPE, Career Enhancements, that
    serves the immediate commander is responsible for directing the LOD determination to the
    required authorities, monitoring suspenses, and disposing of final documentation.
    2.2.3. Prompt and Accurate Processing. The LOD determination must be processed promptly
    and accurately. Parties shall comply with suspense requirements set out in Table 2.1
    Members should not be separated or retired while an LOD determination is pending.
2.3. Medical Officer’s Review. The LOD determination process is initiated with a medical
officer‟s review of the member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death. The medical officer
conducting the review should be the medical officer that first provided treatment, or who is
assigned nearest to the civilian facility that first provided treatment. He or she will initiate the
LOD determination through either an administrative determination or an Air Force Form 348,
Line of Duty Determination.
    2.3.1. Administrative Determination. The medical officer makes the LOD determination
    with an administrative determination in the following circumstances:
       2.3.1.1. When the medical diagnosis is that an illness, injury or disease or the underlying
       condition causing it, existed prior to entry into military service, or between periods of
       service, and was not aggravated by service, the medial officer documents this finding in
       the member‟s medical records with an entry of “EPTS, LOD Not Applicable.”
       2.3.1.2. If the illness, injury, disease, or death falls into one of the following conditions,
       the medical officer makes an administrative determination by finding the member‟s
       condition to be in the line of duty. In these instances, the medical officer does not have to
       make any entries in the member‟s records or initiate any forms.
           2.3.1.2.1. Characterized as a hostile casualty.
           2.3.1.2.2. Incurred as a passenger in a common carrier or military aircraft.
           2.3.1.2.3. An illness or disease clearly not involving misconduct or caused by abuse
           of drugs or alcohol.
           2.3.1.2.4. A simple injury, such as a sprain, contusion or minor fracture, which is not
           likely to result in permanent disability.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                       9


      2.3.1.3. An LOD determination that is processed by an administrative determination is
      finalized and no further inquiry is required.
   2.3.2. AF Form 348, Initiating an Informal Determination. If an LOD determination is
   required, but an administrative determination is not appropriate, the medical officer initiates
   AF Form 348. An Informal LOD must be initiated on AF Form 348 in every case of a
   member dying on active duty. The medical officer provides a narrative description of the
   member‟s medical condition but does not make an LOD determination. See Attachment 2,
   Instructions, AF Form 348.
      2.3.2.1. Documentation. The medical officer processes and signs the AF Form 348 and
      forwards it to the Line of Duty-Medical Focal Point (LOD-MFP). The LOD-MFP
      distributes the AF Form 348 as follows:
          2.3.2.1.1. Send the original for further processing to the member‟s immediate
          commander through the MPF/DPMPE serving the member‟s immediate commander,
          2.3.2.1.2. File one copy in the member‟s medical record, and
          2.3.2.1.3. File one copy in the LOD-MFP Office.
2.4. Commander’s Review. Use Table 2.2 to determine who is the immediate commander for
purposes of the LOD determination.
   2.4.1. Informal Determination. The commander will process the LOD determination as an
   informal determination unless a formal determination is required by paragraph 2.5.2 An
   Informal Determination is processed completely on AF Form 348. See Table 2.3, Overview
   of Informal Determination Process.
      2.4.1.1. The commander investigates the circumstances of the case to determine if the
      member‟s illness, injury, disease or death:
          2.4.1.1.1. Occurred while the member was absent without authority, or
          2.4.1.1.2. Is due to the member‟s own misconduct.
      2.4.1.2. If a preponderance of evidence does not support either of these circumstances,
      the commander finds the illness, injury, disease or death to be “In the Line of Duty.” He
      or she indicates this on the AF Form 348. See Attachment 2, Instructions, AF Form 348.
   2.4.2. Formal Determination. A formal determination is made by higher authorities based
   upon a thorough investigation conducted by a specially appointed investigating officer. DD
   Form 261, Report of Investigation, Line of Duty and Misconduct Status, is used to
   supplement AF Form 348. See Table 2.4, Overview of Informal Determination Process. If a
   formal determination is required, or if the commander believes an investigation should be
   conducted into the circumstances of member‟s illness, injury, disease or death, he or she
   recommends such on AF Form 348. See Attachment 2, Instructions, AF Form 348.
      2.4.2.1. When Required. A formal determination is required to support a determination
      of “Not in Line of Duty.” Also, the immediate commander will recommend a formal
      determination when the member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death apparently occurred:
          2.4.2.1.1. Under strange or doubtful circumstances, or due to the member‟s
          misconduct or willful negligence,
10                                                               AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


            2.4.2.1.2. While the member was absent without authority, or
            2.4.2.1.3. Under circumstances the commander believes should be fully investigated.
     2.4.3. Documentation. The commander forwards AF Form 348 to the SJA for review for
     legal sufficiency.
2.5. Staff Judge Advocate Review. The SJA reviews the commander‟s recommendation for
legal sufficiency.
     2.5.1. If the SJA concurs with the commander‟s recommended finding of “In the Line of
     Duty,” the LOD determination is complete.
        2.5.1.1. Forward the finalized documentation to MPF/DPMPE.
     2.5.2. If the SJA nonconcurs with the commander‟s finding of “In the Line of Duty,” he or
     she indicates such on AF Form 348, and forwards it to the appointing authority.
     2.5.3. If the SJA concurs or nonconcurs with the commander‟s recommendation for an
     investigation, he or she indicates such on AF Form 348, and forwards it to the appointing
     authority.
     2.5.4. If a formal determination is initiated, the SJA serves as a legal advisor to the
     investigating officer. The SJA will review the investigating officer‟s findings and
     recommendations for legal sufficiency.
2.6. The Appointing Authority. Use Table 2.2 to determine who is the appointing authority.
     2.6.1. If the appointing authority concurs with the commander and not the SJA, and finds the
     member‟s illness, injury, disease, or death was “In the Line of Duty,” the case is complete.
        2.6.1.1. Forward the finalized AF Form 348 to MPF/DPMPE.
     2.6.2. Appoint Investigating Officer. Otherwise, the appointing authority appoints an
     investigating officer (IO) to investigate the circumstances surrounding the member‟s illness,
     injury, disease, or death.
        2.6.2.1. Appoint the investigating officer in writing, cite this instruction as authority,
        state the reason for the appointment and designate a suspense date for submission of the
        report.
        2.6.2.2. The investigating officer should be a disinterested officer in the grade of captain
        or above, and senior to the member being investigated. If the IO cannot meet these
        criteria, include a memo in the case file justifying the IO‟s appointment.
        2.6.2.3. When an incident occurs at a location remote from the appointing authority,
        coordinate with the commander of the installation nearest to where the incident occurred
        to appoint an investigating officer.
2.7. Investigating Officer. The Investigating Officer conducts the investigation in accordance
with the rules set out in Attachment 3, Guide for Investigating Officers.
     2.7.1. After completing the investigation, the IO obtains a legal review from the SJA and
     then forwards the investigation report and its supporting attachments to the appointing
     authority.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                     11

  LOD DETERMINATION PROCEDURES FOR MEMBERS OF THE AIR RESERVE
                         COMPONENT

3.1. ARC Procedures. This chapter governs the processing of LOD determinations for
members of the Air Reserve Component. This includes members of the Air Force Reserve and
members of the Air National Guard.
3.2. Prompt and Accurate Processing. An LOD must be completed promptly, as the
determination will impact the member‟s eligibility to benefits, such as military medical care and
incapacitation pay. Members should not be separated or retired while an LOD determination is
pending. The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) may
authorize and mandate automated/electronic LOD determination processing.
3.3. Responsibilities in the LOD Determination. Medical Officers, Commanders, SJAs and
Air Staff members who learn of a member‟s illness, injury, disease or death that occurred under
circumstances that may warrant an LOD determination shall take an active role in ensuring that a
determination is initiated and completed in a timely manner
   3.3.1. Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) and Participating Individual Ready
   Reservists (PIRR) are processed by the active duty command to which they are assigned or
   attached. When an IMA or PIRR member dies or incurs an illness, injury, or disease that
   warrants an LOD determination, the active duty command should contact HQ ARPC/DPSSP,
   6760 E Irvington Pl #4000, Denver CO, 80280-4000, for administrative oversight. Use Table
   3.1 through Table 3.4 to determine who is responsible for reviewing the LOD determination
   for an IMA or PIRR. Upon completion of an LOD determination for an IMA or PIRR,
   forward the file to HQ ARPC/DPSSP, 6760 E Irvington Pl #4000, Denver, CO 80280-4000.
   3.3.2. The Military Personnel Flight. The ARC MPF has overall responsibility for the
   management and processing of LOD determinations as outlined in this instruction.
   3.3.3. For non-participating reservists assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve ordered to
   perform muster duty, an LOD will be accomplished at the nearest military medical facility.
   The AF Form 348 and all medical documents will be forwarded to HQ ARPC/DPSSP for
   processing.
   3.3.4. ARC Medical Unit. The ARC medical unit is responsible for ensuring that the LOD
   process is initiated. This responsibility includes initiating the AF Form 348 or making an
   administrative LOD determination as appropriate when neither has been accomplished by the
   initial treating military medical facility (MTF).
   3.3.5. Modified LOD Processing for Injuries or Illnesses Incurred by Sexual Assault.
   Unique LOD processing procedures will apply in cases where an ARC member has sustained
   injuries or illness as a result of a sexual assault that occurred while the member was in duty
   status and where the member has chosen restricted reporting of the crime. DoDI 6495.02,
   Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, requires that in such cases
   LODs be established, so the member is eligible to receive medical care and psychological
   counseling (travel and per diem not authorized) for conditions stemming from the sexual
   assault. In particular, the LOD is to be processed so as to ensure that the identity of the
16                                                               AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


     member and the details of the assault are not released to law enforcement or command
     channels. Therefore, LODs for these situations will not be processed according to either
     paragraphs 3.4 through 3.14, or Tables 3.1. through 3.4. of this chapter, but by the following
     procedure:
        3.3.5.1. Air National Guard (ANG). The servicing State JFHQ Sexual Assault Response
        Coordinator (SARC) has the primary responsibility for ensuring the LOD is initiated and
        processed. Members will contact their State JFHQ SARC program office for assistance.
        Upon learning an ANG member has been sexually assaulted and has elected restricted
        reporting, the State JFHQ SARC will obtain official documentation substantiating the
        member‟s military duty status at the time of the sexual assault. The State JFHQ SARC
        will initiate and assign a tracking number, verify member duty status, the date of the
        incident, and any injuries sustained. If the member has any medical documents to
        substantiate injuries or illnesses, the member will provide those to the State JFHQ SARC.
        If the member has no medical documents to substantiate injuries or illnesses, the State
        JFHQ SARC will initiate the LOD, the State JFHQ SARC will then immediately refer the
        member to either a military treatment facility (MTF) or a civilian care provider for the
        necessary medical personnel verification and initial diagnosis (See DODI 1241.2,
        Reserve Component Incapacitation System Management, paragraph 6.4.1.). The State
        JFHQ SARC will accomplish AF Form 348, Line of Duty Determination, or the
        electronic LOD. If the AF Form 348 is used rather than automated/electronic LOD
        determination processing, he or she will complete Blocks 4 thru 8; and sign and date the
        form at Block 12. In Block 6, put either ICD-9 diagnostic code E968.8 (Assault by Other
        Specified Means) or 969.9 (Poisoning by Unspecified Psychotropic Agent; for “ruffie”
        cases) to reflect the initial diagnosis and state whether the condition requires continued
        medical care, counseling or evaluation (without referring to the sexual assault incident).
        The State JFHQ SARC will expeditiously forward the case file to the ANG Restricted
        Review Authority.
            3.3.5.1.1. The ANG Restricted Review Authority is the Restricted Reporting NCO,
            ANG/SG and ANG/A1. The ANG Restricted Review Authority cannot be delegated
            without the written authorization of the Director, ANG. These offices will review the
            case file to establish the member‟s duty status at the time of the incident and review
            the member‟s medical condition and diagnosis. If further documentation is required,
            the State JFHQ SARC will be contacted to provide the information as soon as
            possible. Case files will not be returned but will be retained until the additional
            information is received. Upon establishing the member‟s military status, a medical or
            psychological health condition attributable to the sexual assault, and an appropriate
            diagnosis of care, the ANG Restricted Review Authority finalizes the LOD. If the AF
            Form 348 is used, rather than automated/electronic LOD determination processing,
            the ANG Restricted Review Authority makes a finding of “In Line of Duty” at Block
            19A and completes Block 19. Mark out the words “Appointing Authority” and
            replace with the words “Restricted Review Authority”.
            3.3.5.1.2. The ANG Restricted Review Authority returns the approved LOD
            determination to the State JFHQ SARC, who will ensure the MTF or Military
            Medical Support Office (MMSO) and the medical records custodian receive the
            approved LOD determination. The State JFHQ SARC will provide the member a
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                    17


        copy of the approved LOD determination. The State JFHQ SARC is also responsible
        for providing the approved LOD determination to MMSO along with the Request for
        Pre-Authorization for LOD Health Care.
        3.3.5.1.3. Follow-on treatment will require pre-authorization from MMSO. The
        State SARC will forward to MMSO the completed MMSO Worksheet 02, Pre-
        Authorization Request for Medical Care, for review and approval, indicating the
        additional treatment required. MMSO will provide an authorization within seven
        working days. Subsequent claims for the authorized care will be sent by the provider
        of care to the TRICARE Regional Office for the state in which the Guard member
        resides.
     3.3.5.2. Air Force Reserve. The servicing Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC)
     has the primary responsibility for ensuring the LOD is initiated and processed. Upon
     learning an AF Reserve member has been sexually assaulted and has elected restricted
     reporting, the SARC will obtain official documentation substantiating the member‟s
     military duty status at the time of the sexual assault. The Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) is
     responsible for identifying the condition requiring continued medical care or counseling.
     The RMU will make this determination by relying on the documentation provided by the
     member or obtained as a result of an examination of the member. The RMU will utilize
     the automated LOD processing system to initiate the LOD, identifying the case as a
     restricted reporting sexual assault. The automated system will generate the AFRC Form
     348; and use of the AF Form 348 is not required. The RMU will provide a brief
     diagnosis and input an ICD-9 diagnostic code (without referring to the sexual assault
     incident) for the condition, as well as an indication of whether continued care, counseling
     or evaluation is required. Following completion by the medical officer, the LOD will be
     routed directly to the Restricted Review Authority at the HQ AFRC LOD Board.
        3.3.5.2.1. The Restricted Review Authority for AFRC is the LOD Review Board at
        Robins AFB, Georgia. The case file will be reviewed to establish the member‟s duty
        status at the time of the incident and the member‟s medical condition and diagnosis.
        If further documentation is required, the RMU will be contacted to provide the
        information as soon as possible. Case files will not be returned but will be retained
        until the additional information is received. Upon establishing the member‟s military
        status, a medical or psychological condition attributable to the sexual assault, and an
        appropriate diagnosis of care, the Restricted Review Authority finalizes the LOD.
        3.3.5.2.2. The AFRC Restricted Review Authority returns the approved LOD
        determination to the RMU, which will ensure the MTF or Military Medical Support
        Office (MMSO) and the medical records custodian receive the approved LOD
        determination. The RMU will provide the SARC and the member a copy of the
        approved LOD determination. The RMU is also responsible for providing MMSO
        the Request for Pre-Authorization for LOD Health Care.
        3.3.5.2.3. Follow-on treatment will require pre-authorization from MMSO. The
        RMU will forward to MMSO the completed MMSO Worksheet 02, Pre-
        Authorization Request for Medical Care, for review and approval, indicating the
        additional treatment required. MMSO will provide an authorization within seven
        working days. Subsequent claims for the authorized care will be sent by the provider
18                                                                 AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


            of care to the TRICARE Regional Office for the state in which the Reserve member
            resides.
        3.3.5.3. Military Medical Support Office (MMSO). For Reserve and Guard members
        who are not in the servicing area of an MTF, the SARC will mail or fax to MMSO a copy
        of the LOD determination, orders, drill schedule or commander‟s memorandum, and the
        MMSO Worksheet 01, Reserve Component Medical Eligibility Verification. MMSO will
        document eligibility within 48 to 96 hours and provide authorization. The information
        provided will enable MMSO to assign an authorization number that will allow claims for
        authorized health care to be paid by the Regional TRICARE contractor. The MMSO
        address and the fax number are on page 2 of the MMSO Form 01. The website for
        MMSO is www.tricare.mil/MMSO, and the required forms are available on the website.
        If emergency care is required, MMSO may be called directly and the Service Point of
        Contact can assist with ensuring the costs associated with the episode of care are paid.
        3.3.5.4. Individuals in designated positions responsible for processing modified LOD
        determinations are specifically authorized to receive covered communications, as
        outlined in DoDI 6495.02, and will receive guidance from the member‟s servicing SARC
        regarding restricted reporting procedures and the limitations of disclosure of covered
        communications. These individuals will be held accountable for unauthorized disclosure
        of covered communications, as stated in AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and
        Response (SAPR) Program, dated 29 September 2008, paragraph 3.1.9.: “Failure to
        protect restricted reports and specified confidentiality is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ,
        for military members and AF civilian employees may be subject to administrative
        disciplinary action.”
3.4. Military Medical Officer’s Review. The LOD determination process is initiated with a
military medical officer‟s review of the member‟s illness, injury, disease, death or the underlying
condition causing it. The military medical officer conducting the review should be the medical
officer that first provided treatment, or who is assigned nearest to the civilian facility that first
provided treatment. He or she will initiate the LOD process through either an administrative
entry in the patient‟s medical record or an Air Force Form 348.
     3.4.1. Existed Prior to Service. The military medical officer must determine whether the
     illness, injury, or disease or the underlying condition causing it, existed prior to the period of
     service in which the member exhibited symptoms.
        3.4.1.1. A clear distinction between the symptoms and the actual medical condition
        causing the symptoms is crucial in making an EPTS determination. An LOD
        determination is based upon the onset of the disease, illness or injury process, not the
        existence of symptoms. EPTS conditions include chronic disease, illnesses, injuries and
        illnesses or disease with an incubation period that would rule out a finding that they were
        incurred during periods of active duty (AD), active duty for training (ADT), or IDT.
        3.4.1.2. Aggravation by Military Service. If the determination is the medical condition
        existed prior to service, then the military medical officer must determine whether the
        condition has been aggravated by military service (i.e., the member had a preexisting
        condition documented in their medical record and was allowed to perform duty).
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                        19


         3.4.1.2.1. If the condition has been aggravated by military service, an AF Form 348
         must be initiated.
         3.4.1.2.2. If the condition has not been aggravated by military service, the medial
         officer documents this finding in the member‟s medical records with an entry of
         “EPTS, LOD Not Applicable.” When the member has a condition that is EPTS and
         not aggravated by service, only the initial treatment is covered by the military.
         3.4.1.2.3. Eight Year Rule. IAW 10 U.S.C. Section 1207a, a disabling condition will
         be found to be in the line of duty, even though the condition existed prior to service
         (EPTS), if the member has at least eight years of active service (8 years do not have
         to be consecutive), and the member was on active duty orders specifying a period of
         more than 30 days at the time the condition became unfitting, as subsequently
         determined by the Physical Evaluation Board.
  3.4.2. Administrative Determination. The medical officer may make an administrative
  determination to document a medical condition that is EPTS and not service aggravated or a
  minor in line of duty condition if there is no likelihood of permanent disability,
  hospitalization, requirement for continuing medical treatments, or a request for incapacitation
  pay. The military medical officer makes an administrative determination by finding the
  member‟s condition to be in the line of duty and noting this with an entry in the member‟s
  medical record. If an administrative determination is made, no further action is required.
     3.4.2.1. An Informal Line of Duty, AF Form 348, rather than an administrative, must be
     initiated for the following cases:
         3.4.2.1.1. When there is a likelihood an ARC member may apply for incapacitation
         pay.
         3.4.2.1.2. When the case involves service aggravated EPTS medical conditions.
         3.4.2.1.3. When the medical condition involves a disease process such as coronary
         artery disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, etc. or,
         3.4.2.1.4. All cardiac conditions, including heart attacks, rhythm disturbances, etc.
         3.4.2.1.5. When the member has been hospitalized.
         3.4.2.1.6. When the member requires continuing medical treatment or treatment in a
         civilian hospital.
         3.4.2.1.7. When the member is a sexual assault victim and has initiated restricted
         reporting of the crime. See paragraph 3.3.5 for guidance on required modified line of
         duty determination processing.
  3.4.3. Informal LOD Determination - AF Form 348. If an LOD determination is required,
  but an administrative determination is not appropriate, the military medical officer initiates
  an informal Line of Duty Determination by completing the medical portion of the AF Form
  348. The medical officer provides a narrative description of the member‟s medical condition,
  signs the form, but does not make an LOD determination. See Attachment 2, Instructions,
  AF Form 348 and Attachment 5, LOD Determinations for Various Situations.
     3.4.3.1. Disposition of Documentation. The ARC medical unit is responsible for
     forwarding the original AF Form 348 to the ARC/MPF. The ARC medical unit files the
20                                                               AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


        interim or finalized copy from the ARC/MPF in the member‟s medical records and
        destroys the incomplete form. The finalized AF Form 348 replaces the interim AF Form
        348 for filing in the member‟s medical records.
3.5. Immediate Commander’s Review. Use Table 3.1 to determine who is the immediate
commander for purposes of the LOD determination.
     3.5.1. Interim Line of Duty Determination. The immediate commander may request the
     appointing authority issue an interim LOD determination if the informal or formal
     determination cannot be finalized within 7 days of notification, and it is possible the member
     requires continuing medical care or is entitled to incapacitation benefits. Do not make an
     interim LOD if there is clear and convincing evidence showing an EPTS condition or it
     appears that misconduct was the proximate cause of the illness, injury or disease.
        3.5.1.1. The interim LOD is comprised of the completed medical portion of AF Form
        348 which must contain a description of the member‟s illness, injury or disease, and the
        date it occurred, the commander‟s preliminary finding of the member‟s military status at
        the time the medical condition occurred, as well as the commander‟s signature. When
        requesting approval of an interim LOD the commander should explain the member‟s
        current military status and the reason for delay in processing the LOD determination.
        3.5.1.2. The ARC/MPF forwards a copy of the approved interim LOD to the ARC
        medical unit for filing in the member‟s medical record and to ensure no disruption in the
        member‟s medical care.
     3.5.2. Informal Determination. The commander will process the LOD determination as an
     informal determination unless a formal determination is required by paragraph 3.5.3.1
        3.5.2.1. The commander investigates the circumstances of the case to determine if the
        member‟s injury, illness, disease, or cause of death:
            3.5.2.1.1. Occurred while the member was absent without authority,
            3.5.2.1.2. Was due to the member‟s own misconduct, or
            3.5.2.1.3. Existed prior to the period of military service the member was performing
            at the time symptoms were exhibited and, if so, whether or not the medical condition
            was service aggravated.
        3.5.2.2. If a preponderance of evidence does not support any of these circumstances, the
        commander finds the illness, injury, disease or death to be “In the Line of Duty.” He or
        she indicates this on the AF Form 348. See Attachment 2, Instructions, AF Form 348.
     3.5.3. Formal Determination. A Formal Determination is made by higher authorities based
     upon a thorough investigation conducted by a specially appointed investigating officer. DD
     Form 261, is used to supplement AF Form 348. If a formal determination is required, or if the
     commander believes an investigation should be conducted into the circumstances of
     member‟s illness, injury disease, or death, the commander recommends on the AF Form 348
     that an investigation be conducted. See Attachment 2, Instructions, AF Form 348.
        3.5.3.1. When Required. A formal determination is required to support a determination
        of “Not in Line of Duty.” Also, the immediate commander will recommend a formal
        determination when the member‟s illness, injury, disease or death apparently occurred:
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                       21


          3.5.3.1.1. When directed by the reviewing or higher authority.
          3.5.3.1.2. Under strange or doubtful circumstances, or due to the member‟s
          misconduct or willful negligence.
          3.5.3.1.3. While the member was absent without authority, or
          3.5.3.1.4. Under circumstances the commander believes should be fully investigated.
   3.5.4. Disposition of Documentation. The commander forwards AF Form 348 to the SJA.
3.6. Staff Judge Advocate Review. The SJA reviews the commander‟s recommendation for
legal sufficiency.
   3.6.1. The SJA either concurs or nonconcurs with the commander‟s finding on AF Form 348
   and forwards it to the appointing authority.
   3.6.2. If a formal determination is initiated, the SJA serves as a legal advisor to the
   investigating officer. The SJA will review the investigating officer‟s findings and
   recommendations for legal sufficiency.
3.7. The Appointing Authority. Use Table 3.3 to determine who is the appointing authority.
   3.7.1. Interim LOD. The appointing authority approves or disapproves the commander‟s
   request for an interim LOD determination.
       3.7.1.1. Forward approved memorandum by fax to ARC/DP with other required
       documents, for a control number.
   3.7.2. Informal LOD. If the appointing authority finds the member‟s illness, injury, disease
   or death to be “In the Line of Duty,” he or she indicates such on Air Force Form 348. This
   Informal LOD Determination is then forwarded for disposition as outlined in paragraph
   3.12.1.1
   3.7.3. Initiating a Formal LOD Determination. If the appointing authority determines the
   case should be investigated, he or she appoints an IO to conduct an investigation of the
   circumstances surrounding the member‟s illness, injury, disease or death. This case is now
   processed as a Formal LOD Determination.
       3.7.3.1. Appoint the investigating officer in writing, cite this instruction as authority,
       state the reason for the appointment and designate a suspense date for submission of the
       report.
       3.7.3.2. The investigating officer should be a disinterested officer in the grade of captain
       or above, and senior to the member being investigated. If the IO cannot meet these
       criteria, include a memo in the case file justifying the IO‟s appointment.
       3.7.3.3. When an incident occurs at a location remote from the appointing authority,
       coordinate with the commander of the installation nearest to where the incident occurred
       to appoint an investigating officer.
3.8. Investigating Officer. The investigating officer conducts the investigation in accordance
with the rules set out in Attachment 3, Guide for Investigating Officers.
22                                                                    AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


     3.8.1. After completing the investigation, the IO obtains a legal review from the SJA and
     then forwards the investigation report and its supporting attachments to the appointing
     authority.
3.9. The Appointing Authority. The appointing authority reviews the complete investigation
file. The appointing authority may
     3.9.1. Return the file to the IO for further investigation, or
     3.9.2. Complete DD Form 261, Block 13, and if applicable Block 19. Forward the file to the
     reviewing authority.
3.10. The Reviewing Authority. Use Table 3.4 to determine who is the reviewing authority.
The reviewing authority reviews the complete investigation file. He or she may
     3.10.1. Return the file to the IO for further investigation, or
     3.10.2. Complete DD Form 261, Block 14, and if applicable Block 20. NOTE: Base
     approval or disapproval on the preceding finding of the appointing authority.
        3.10.2.1. If the reviewing authority is also the approving authority, note this in block 15
        of DD Form 261. Forward the case to the Career Enhancements Actions branch of the
        MPF serving the immediate commander.
        3.10.2.2. If the reviewing authority is not also the approving authority, forward the file to
        the approving authority.
3.11. The Approving Authority. Use table 3.5. to determine who is the approving authority.
The approving authority reviews the complete investigation file. He or she may
     3.11.1. Return the file to the IO for further investigation, or
     3.11.2. Approve a final determination.
        3.11.2.1. Forward the file to HQ ARC/DP for distribution.
3.12. ARC/MPF. ARC/MPF disposes of LOD determinations as follows:
     3.12.1. Informal LOD determinations.
        3.12.1.1. Cases finalized at the Wing (Appointing Authority) level. Informal
        determinations are finalized at the Wing level if they do not involve “questionable
        circumstances.” Forward those cases as follows:
            3.12.1.1.1. Forward original AF Form 348 for filing in the member‟s master
            personnel records group (MperRGP).
            3.12.1.1.2. Forward a copy of the AF Form 348 to the member‟s immediate
            commander.
            3.12.1.1.3. Forward a copy to the ARC medical unit for filing in the member‟s
            medical records.
        3.12.1.2. Cases finalized at the HQ ARC (Approving Authority) level. Forward cases
        involving questionable circumstances to HQ ARC/DP. These cases are not considered
        finalized until they have been reviewed and approved by the ARC approving authority.

                    REINVESTIGATION OF FINAL DETERMINATION

4.1. Basis for Reinvestigation. A final LOD determination may be opened for reinvestigation
only if new and significant evidence indicates a likelihood of error. The reinvestigation may be
limited to address only those issues raised by new evidence.
4.2. Initiating Reinvestigation.
     4.2.1. The appointing authority or higher authority, including HQ AFPC/JA, may direct a
     reinvestigation of a final determination.
     4.2.2. The subject or the next of kin of the subject of a final LOD determination may request
     reinvestigation of a final determination. To do so the member must
        4.2.2.1. Within 45 days of receipt of a copy of the final determination, make a written
        application to the appointing authority who directed the first investigation,
        4.2.2.2. Attach the new and significant evidence to the member‟s copy of the final
        determination, and
        4.2.2.3. Send a copy of this package to the MPF/DPMSC that processed the first LOD
        determination.
4.3. Processing a Request for Reinvestigation.
     4.3.1. Denying a request for reinvestigation. Only the approving authority may deny a
     request for reinvestigation.
     4.3.2. The MPF forwards the package requesting reinvestigation to the appointing authority.
     4.3.3. The appointing authority may either:
        4.3.3.1. Grant the request and direct reinvestigation, or
        4.3.3.2. Forward the case to the reviewing authority, with the recommendation the
        request be denied.
     4.3.4. The reviewing authority may either:
        4.3.4.1. Grant the request and direct the appointing authority to reinvestigate the case, or,
        4.3.4.2. Forward the case to the approving authority with the recommendation that the
        request be denied.
     4.3.5. The approving authority may either:
        4.3.5.1. Grant the request and direct the appointing authority to reinvestigate the case, or
        4.3.5.2. Deny the request. Notify the member that the request is denied. Return the
        package requesting reconsideration to the member.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                   27


4.4. Conducting the Reinvestigation.
   4.4.1. If reinvestigation has been directed, the appointing authority directs the IO to
   reinvestigate the case. The appointing authority may appoint a new investigating officer if
   necessary.
   4.4.2. The IO ensures he or she has the complete file of the original investigation and the
   request package with its new evidence.
   4.4.3. The reinvestigation is conducted under the same procedures used for an initial
   investigation. It is processed on a second DD Form 261. The IO prepares an addendum to the
   original IO summary. The addendum should address the new evidence and its impact on the
   case. The IO may render a new recommended finding if necessary.
   4.4.4. The approving authority takes final action on the reinvestigation on the second DD
   Form 261.
4.5. Documentation of Reinvestigation.

   Duty to an adverse determination, MPF/DPMSC disposes of the documentation as shown in
   paragraph 2.12.1 or 3.12.2, whichever is applicable. Forwards a copy of the finalized second
   DD Form 261 to the member.
   4.5.3. When the final determination of the reinvestigation changes an adverse finding to an

Terms
Active Duty—Full-time duty in the active military of the United States. A general term applied
to all active military service with the active force without regard to duration or purpose.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty that is used for training members of the
Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed
Forces in time of war or national emergency and such other times as the national security
requires. The member is under orders that provide for return to nonactive status when the period
of ADT is completed. It includes annual training, special tours of ADT, school tours, and the
initial duty for training performed by nonprior service enlistees.
Absent Without Authority—Consider member “absent without authority” if he or she is
voluntarily absent without leave for more than 24 hours, or was voluntarily absent from a
scheduled duty or formation, a restriction, or an arrest. Scheduled duty or formation means doing
a specified task at a specified time and place for a specified purpose. It is not the same as
regularly scheduled duty. Consider the member “absent without authority” if not excused and
absent from duty in civil confinement for more than 24 hours. The term “absent without
authority” is the same as “unauthorized absence.”
30                                                                 AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


Administrative Determination—A determination by a medical officer that a member‟s death,
illness, injury or disease occurred in the line of duty. This process can be used for only a limited
number of instances including battle casualties, disease of natural origin, simple injury and
conditions that existed prior to service.
Alcohol Abuse—The illegal or improper use or possession of alcohol, on or off duty, that results
in, but is not limited to, impaired duty performance, intoxicated driving, domestic disturbances,
assault, aberrant behavior, altercations, underage drinking, or other behavior inconsistent with
Air Force standards.
Alcoholism—A psychological or physical dependence on alcohol.
Disease—A condition of an organ, part, structure, or system of the body in which there is
incorrect function resulting from the effect of heredity, infection, diet, or environment. It is the
same as illness, sickness, or ailment.
Drug Abuse—The illegal or improper use, possession, sale, transfer, or trafficking of any
controlled substance included in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V in Title 21, United States Code,
Section 812, drug abuse paraphernalia, or any intoxicating substance, other than alcohol, that is
inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or
function.
Drugs—Any controlled substance included in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V in 21 U.S.C. 812,
including anabolic or androngenic steroids, or any intoxicating substance other than alcohol, that
is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or
function.
Existed Prior to Service (EPTS)—Terms added to a medical diagnosis where there is clear
evidence that a illness, injury, or disease, the underlying condition causing it, existed before the
member‟s entry into military service, and was not aggravated by service. EPTS diseases include
chronic diseases and diseases with an incubation period that rule out a finding that they started
during inactive duty training, active duty training, or tours of active duty.
Hostile Casualty—A person who is the victim of a terrorist activity or who becomes a casualty
“in action.”
Inactive Duty Training (IDT)—Authorized training performed by a member of a Reserve
Component not on active duty or active duty for training and consisting of regularly scheduled
unit training assemblies, additional training assemblies, periods of appropriate duty or equivalent
training, and any special additional duties authorized for Reserve Component personnel by the
Secretary concerned, and performed by them in connection with the prescribed activities of the
organization in which they are assigned with or without pay. Does not include work or study
associated with correspondence course. Also called IDT.
Incapacitation Benefits—Entitlement for Reserve members to compensation for incapacitation
or loss of civilian earnings as a result of an injury, illness or disease incurred or aggravated in the
line of duty.
Injury—includes such conditions as fractures, wounds, strains, sprains, dislocations,
concussions, and compressions. In addition, it includes conditions resulting from extremes of
temperature or prolonged exposure. Acute poisoning (except those due to contaminated food)
resulting from exposure to toxic or poisonous substances are also injuries.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                        31


Intoxication—Maladaptive behavior such as aggressiveness, impaired judgment, and impaired
social or occupational functioning, because of recent ingestion, inhalation, or injection of any
substance into the body. Signs include flushed face, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lack of
coordination, impaired attention, irritability, euphoria or depression.
In Line of Duty—A death, illness, injury or disease suffered by a member is presumed to be in
the line of duty, unless a preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that the member‟s
death, illness, injury, or disease happened while the member was absent from duty without leave
or due to the member‟s own misconduct. Confine the meaning of “line of duty” in this
instruction to the purpose of this instruction. It is completely distinct from usage under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2671, and has no bearing on the meaning or
application of the phrase “acting within the scope of his office or employment” as used in that
Act.
Intentional Conduct—An act, by commission or omission, done on purpose.
Intervening Cause—An independent action occurring between the original wrongful act or
omission and the death, illness, injury or disease, that turns aside the natural sequence of events,
and produces a result which would not otherwise have followed and been foreseeable.
Lost Time—Time (if more than 24 hours) which must be made up (served) by an enlisted
member who is unable to perform military duties because of intemperate use of drugs or alcohol,
or because of illness, injury or disease resulting from misconduct.
Mental Responsibility—The capacity to understand when ones conduct is wrong and to
conform ones conduct to the requirement of the law. All members are presumed mentally
responsible for their acts, unless there is contrary evidence. This presumption usually means it is
unnecessary to pursue the issue of mental responsibility unless there is credible evidence of lack
of mental responsibility. Such evidence may consist of the circumstances surrounding the death,
illness, injury or disease, previous abnormal or irrational behavior, expert opinion, or other
evidence directly or indirectly pointing toward lack of mental responsibility. Members are not
responsible for their misconduct and its foreseeable consequence if, as a result of mental disease
or defect, they lack substantial capacity either to appreciate that their conduct is wrong or to
conform the conduct to the requirements of law. The term “mental disease or defect” does not
include an abnormality manifested only by repeated wrongful or otherwise antisocial behavior.
Members with impaired mental faculties as a result of their own prior misconduct, such as by
taking a hallucinogen, other illegal (controlled) substance, or deliberately ingesting any
harmful/dangerous substance, are mentally responsible.
Misconduct—Intentional conduct that is wrongful or improper. Also, willful neglect or gross
negligence.
Not in Line of Duty, Due to Own Misconduct—A determination supported by a preponderance
of the evidence that the member‟s death, illness, injury or disease, was proximately caused by the
member‟s own misconduct, regardless of whether the member was absent without authority.
Not in Line of Duty, Not Due to Own Misconduct—A determination supported by a
preponderance of the evidence that the member‟s death, illness, injury or disease happened while
the member was absent without authority, and the death, illness, injury, or disease was not
proximately caused by the member‟s own misconduct.
32                                                           AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


Proximate Cause—It is the cause that, in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken by an
independent and unforeseeable new cause, results in the death, illness, injury or disease and
without which the death, illness, injury or disease would not have occurred.
Preponderance of the Evidence—The greater weight of credible evidence. That evidence that,
when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression and is more convincing as to its truth
when weighed against the opposing evidence.
Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs—Any intoxication caused by alcohol or by drugs that
is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mental or physical faculties.
Willful Neglect—An act or acts of omission or of commission that evidence a reckless or
wanton disregard for their attendant consequences. Conduct that indicates a member exhibited a
reckless or wanton disregard for his or her own personal well-being or for the well-being of
another. The same as gross negligence.

              INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING AIR FORCE FORM 348

A2.1. Medical Officer. Completes Items 1 through 12 on the front of AF Form 348 and signs
the form.
   A2.1.1. Enter the organization and location of member‟s immediate commander in the “TO”
   block.
   A2.1.2. Enter the organization and location of the MPF/DPMP that supports the member‟s
   immediate commander in the “THRU” block.
   A2.1.3. Item 9-10. If the member was first seen by a civilian healthcare provider or a
   medical officer from another military installation, obtain these initial medical records.
   A2.1.4. Item 11. Give a complete description of alleged circumstances as the available
   information permits.
   A2.1.5. The medical officer must sign the form. In those locations where only a medical
   technician is in attendance at the Air Force unit, the technician may sign the form but must
   note there is no AF medical officer assigned at the remote location.
   A2.1.6. The medical officer does not make a recommendation of whether or not the death,
   illness, injury or disease was in the line of duty.
A2.2. Immediate Commander. Completes Items 13 through 17 on the back of AF Form 348.
   A2.2.1. Enter the organization and location of the appointing authority in the “To” block.
   A2.2.2. Enter the organization and location of the SJA who supports the immediate
   commander in the “Thru” block.
   A2.2.3. Item 13. Relates to the actual duty status of the member at the time the death, illness,
   injury or disease occurred. A member who performs duty or who is on the installation in an
   off-duty status is “present for duty.” A member who is away from the installation and not
   performing assigned duty is either “absent with authority;” is “absent without authority” as
   defined in Attachment 1; or the member fits one of the special situations which apply only
   to ARC members. Commanders of newly arriving members with treatment for an illness,
   injury or disease prior to the move, but before the initiation of an AF Form 348, may have to
   consult with the member‟s former organization to determine the member‟s duty status at the
   time.
   A2.2.4. Item 14. Record completely and concisely the circumstances surrounding the death,
   illness, injury or disease based on the immediate commander‟s informal investigation. DO
   NOT SAY “SEE ITEM 11.” If you need more space, use plain bond paper and identify it as
   item 14. Include the type of tour and the inclusive tour dates for ARC members.
   A2.2.5. Item 15. Check appropriate block. If intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the
   member was not the proximate cause, check “neither of these” and specify the proximate
   cause. Refer to Attachment 1 for explanation of terms.
   A2.2.6. Item 16. Do not give “names and addresses” if the source of the information is the
   member or the police. Do not repeat names and addresses already appearing in item 12.
34                                                              AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002

     A2.3.1. Concur or non-concur with the immediate commander‟s recommended findings, and
     date and sign the form.
     A2.3.2. For active duty members, if the SJA concurs with the immediate commander‟s
     recommended finding of “In the Line of Duty,” this recommendation is finalized. The form
     should be returned to the commander. In all other cases, the form is forwarded to the
     appointed authority.
A2.4. Item 19. Appointing Authority Instructions:
     A2.4.1. For active duty members, if the appointing authority finds “In Line of Duty,” this is
     a final determination and the form is returned to the commander.
     A2.4.2. If the appointing authority opts to appoint an investigating officer a formal
     investigation must be initiated.
     A2.4.3. For ARC members, the appointing authority checks one of the four blocks.

                        GUIDE FOR INVESTIGATING OFFICERS

A3.1. Duty. The IO will attempt to determine all the facts leading up to and connected with a
death, injury, illness, or disease and render a comprehensive detailed report, which includes
recommended findings of whether or not the death, illness, injury or disease occurred in the line
of duty. The report must contain enough pertinent data to enable later reviews to be made
without additional information.
A3.2. Investigating the Circumstances. The IO will ascertain dates, places, persons and
events definitely and accurately.
   A3.2.1. Consult with the Staff Judge Advocate. The IO should consult with the SJA before
   beginning the investigation and as often as necessary during the investigation.
   A3.2.2. Secure Reports. The IO should obtain copies of all pertinent records including:
       A3.2.2.1. All relevant facts with respect to the duty, leave, pass or unauthorized absence
       status of the member at the time of the incident resulting in death, illness, injury or
       disease. When the subject is a member of the USAFR or ANGUS, include information as
       to his or her status in relation to EAD, ADT, IDT, etc., at the time of the incident.
       A3.2.2.2. All relevant military police reports, including extracts of summaries of the
       OSI.
       A3.2.2.3. All relevant civilian police reports. While civilian agencies will make traffic
       investigations available to an IO, OSI assistance may be necessary to obtain civilian
       reports of criminal investigations.
       A3.2.2.4. All relevant medical reports including analysis of blood, breathe, urine and
       tissue.
       A3.2.2.5. When relevant, information concerning the site and terrain at which the
       incident in question occurred, and photographs, maps, charts, diagrams or other exhibits
       which may be helpful to a complete understanding of the incident.
       A3.2.2.6. For cases involving suicide attempts or suicide gestures, obtain a copy of the
       mental health evaluation. If there has been no evaluation and one is necessary, have the
       member‟s commander or the appointing authority request one. Collect evidence bearing
       on the mental condition of the member, including evidence of actions or moods
       immediately before the incident, and any problems that might motivate the act.
   A3.2.3. Secure Statements.
       A3.2.3.1. Statement of Subject. The report of investigation must contain the sworn
       statement of the subject of the investigation or an explanation why the statement could
       not be obtained.
       A3.2.3.2. Advising Subject of Rights.
           A3.2.3.2.1. Section 1219 Rights. In all cases, the subject of the investigation must be
           advised before being interviewed that Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1219 states:
36                                                               AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


“A member of an armed force may not be required to sign a statement relating to the origin,
incidence, or aggravation of a disease or injury that (he)(she) has. Any such statement against
(his)(her) interests, signed by a member, is invalid.” A member‟s right to make a statement is
violated if a person, in the course of the investigation, obtains the member‟s oral statements and
reduces them to writing, unless the above advice was given first.
            A3.2.3.2.2. Article 31 Rights. Advise the subject of his or her rights under Article 31,
            UCMJ, only if you suspect the commission of an offense. Consult with the SJA on
            the form of the advice.
        A3.2.3.3. Witness Statements. Obtain statements of witnesses with relevant information.
        If witnesses are not available for personal interview, obtain copies of available sworn or
        unsworn statements made by those witnesses to other investigators. If no such statements
        are available, arrange where possible, for others to take the statements. See Attachment
        4, Sample Format for Statements.
        A3.2.3.4. Advising Witnesses.
            A3.2.3.4.1. Section 1219 Rights. Do not apply to witnesses.
            A3.2.3.4.2. Article 31 Rights. Do not apply to civilian witnesses. Advise a military
            witness of his or her rights under Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice
            (UCMJ) only when you suspect the commission of an offense. Consult with the SJA
            on the form of the advice.
     A3.2.4. Develop the Facts. When alcohol is concerned in an investigation, thoroughly
     explore the part it played. Pertinent questions which should be resolved are the amount and
     type of liquor consumed; period of time during which it was consumed; outward appearance
     of the person before the incident (staggering, bellicose, unable to speak rationally, etc.).
     Include the results of any alcohol tests taken shortly after the incident in question.
A3.3. Making the Determination. A member‟s death, illness, injury or disease is presumed in
line of duty unless the preponderance of the evidence shows that the death, illness, injury or
disease, occurred while the member was absent without authority or was proximately caused by
the member‟s own misconduct.
     A3.3.1. Duty Status Determination. A death, illness, injury or disease incurred while a
     member is absent without authority is “not in line of duty.” It does not matter whether the
     death, illness injury or disease was or was not the result of the member's misconduct.
        A3.3.1.1. Rely on the immediate commander‟s finding (AF Form 348, item ____ or
        ____) that the member was “present for duty” or was “absent with authority” unless there
        is evidence to the contrary.
        A3.3.1.2. Inquire further into the facts and circumstances of the member‟s duty status
        when the immediate commander finds (AF Form 348, item ____ or ____) the member
        was “absent without authority,” or where there is evidence to indicate the commander‟s
        finding of “present for duty” or “was absent with authority” is incorrect. For the
        definition of the term “absent without authority” see Attachment 1, Terms.
     A3.3.2. Misconduct Determination. Determine whether misconduct was or was not the
     proximate cause of the member‟s death, illness, injury or disease. For explanation of the
     terms “misconduct” and “proximate cause” see Attachment 1.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                         37


A3.4. Compiling the Report.
   A3.4.1. DD Form 261, Report of Investigation, Line of Duty and Misconduct Status.
   Serves as a cover sheet and forwarding document. Complete lines 1-12 of the form.
   A3.4.2. IO Report. At the conclusion of the investigation, the IO prepares a narrative report.
   The report should include a statement of the authority under which the investigation was
   conducted, identification of any duty time lost, the matter investigated, the facts, a discussion
   of those facts as they relate to the issues under investigation, conclusions, and a statement of
   findings. The IO should clarify any discrepancy in the date and place of death, illness, injury
   or disease or in the evidence as to the duty status of the member. When relevant, comment on
   the credibility of statements of witnesses.
   A3.4.3. Supporting Documents. All documents in the report must be of good quality.
   Original documents should be in the report if at all possible. The documents should be
   assembled as follows:
              DD Form 261 as cover sheet - two copies
              Tab A - Index of exhibits
              Tab B - IO summary - two copies
              Tab C - IO appointing documents
              Tab D - AF Form 348
              Tab E - Subject‟s sworn statement, or IO certificate explaining why subject‟s
statement
              unavailable.
              Tab F - Statements of witnesses.
              Tab G - Copies of orders or other documents relating to duty status
              Tab H - Copies of other investigative reports prepared by military or civilian
authorities
              Tab I - Maps, photographs or sketches
              Tab J - Medical records relevant to the LOD determination
       A3.4.3.1. The IO may add additional tabs as needed. If more than one exhibit appears
       under a given tab, label the exhibits separately; for example, F-1, F-2 and F-3. Where
       there are no exhibits to include behind a given tab, the tab letter should still appear in the
       index with the notation “No exhibit, this tab.”
A3.5. Forwarding the Documentation. The IO will send the completed report to the
appointing authority.
38                                                                 AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002

                            SAMPLE FORMAT FOR STATEMENTS

A4.1. Statement of Subject of Investigation. I,             (name)           ,     (grade)    ,
(address)                , am aware that I may submit a sworn statement in connection with this
investigation concerning my _____________ (specify what the disease or injury is).
I have been advised that Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1219 provides as follows:

          “A member of an armed force may not be required to sign a statement relating to the
origin,
          incurrence, or aggravation of a disease or injury that (he) (she) has. Any such statement
against
          (his) (her) interests, signed by member is invalid.”

I understand that I cannot be required to sign any such statement but that if I willingly do so it
may be considered in determining whether or not my injury or disease occurred in the line of
duty.


(I have also been advised of my rights under Article 31of the UCMJ [see note 1]).

I make and sign the following sworn statement voluntarily and with this understanding:

                LOD DETERMINATIONS FOR VARIOUS SITUATIONS

A5.1. Alcohol Abuse. Drinking, drunkenness, and alcoholism by themselves are not illnesses,
diseases or injuries requiring an LOD determination to be initiated. They may more properly
require punitive or other administrative action.
   A5.1.1. Initiate an LOD determination when the member suffers an illness, injury or disease
   because of alcohol abuse.
       A5.1.1.1. An injury incurred during the intemperate use of alcohol should be found to be
       “due to misconduct” if it is proven that the intemperate use of alcohol was the proximate
       cause of the injury.
       A5.1.1.2. Any acute or transient disease directly caused by or immediately following the
       intemperate use of alcohol should be found to be “due to misconduct.” However, an
       organic chronic disease that is secondary to alcoholism, such as Laennec‟s cirrhosis, fatty
       metamorphosis of the liver, and chronic brain syndrome, should be found to be “in line of
       duty.”
A5.2. Drug Abuse. Drug abuse itself is not considered to be a disease or an injury for the
purpose of requiring an LOD determination to be initiated.
   A5.2.1. Initiate an LOD determination when the member suffers an illness, injury, disease,
   or death because of drug abuse.
   A5.2.2. Drug abuse is strong evidence of misconduct. Illness, injury, disease or death
   proximately caused by drug abuse should be found to be “due to misconduct.” This includes
   the debilitating effect the drug has on the body and the effect the drug has in impairing the
   member‟s mental or physical faculties affecting his or her actions. The fact that the member
   may have a preexisting physical condition causing him or her to be more susceptible to the
   effects of the drug does not, of itself, excuse any resulting misconduct.
       A5.2.2.1. Illness, injury, disease or death resulting from drug abuse may be found “due
       to own misconduct” even though the drug abuse was made known as a result of the
       limited privilege communication program, identification through urinalysis, or incident to
       medical care for other than drug abuse.
A5.3. Explosives, Firearms, and Dangerous Substances. Unexploded ammunition or other
objects, firearms, and highly flammable liquids are inherently dangerous and their handling
necessitates a high degree of care. Tampering with, attempting to ignite, or otherwise handling
such objects in disregard of their dangerous qualities is strong evidence of misconduct.
A5.4. Fights. Aggression or voluntary participation in a fight or similar encounter, where a
member is at least equally at fault with the adversary in starting or continuing the fight, is
evidence of misconduct. Additional evidence of misconduct includes provocative actions or
language taken or uttered under circumstances where a reasonable person would anticipate
retaliation.
   A5.4.1. There is no misconduct if a member is a victim of an unprovoked assault or acts in
   self-defense. Misconduct may not always be the proximate cause of injury caused by
42                                                                AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002


     excessive means. For example where a fight is underway and an adversary uses an excessive
     means that, under the circumstances, could not reasonably be foreseen.
        A5.4.1.1. However, there can be a causal connection between the misconduct and the
        injury or death where a member persists in a fight or other encounter knowing that an
        adversary has produced a dangerous weapon. Determine each case on its own facts.
A5.5. Joint Ventures, Imputed Misconduct. A member can be held responsible for the
misconduct of another if the member exercises control over, and is responsible for, the conduct
of the principal actor, or if the circumstances demonstrate coordinated action sufficient to
establish a joint enterprise. Mere presence of the member is not sufficient to establish a joint
enterprise or to give a basis for holding the member responsible for the misconduct of another.
There is no obligation to exert a positive or constructive influence over the conduct of the
principal actor.
A5.6. Motor Vehicle Accidents.
     A5.6.1. A member who operates a motor vehicle in an intentionally wrongful or negligent
     manner that was the proximate cause of an illness, injury, disease or death may be found to
     have engaged in misconduct.
     A5.6.2. A member who knew or should have reasonably knew he or she was unfit to drive,
     and who is injured as a result of driving a motor vehicle when unfit to do so, may be found to
     have engaged in misconduct. The test for misconduct is whether a reasonable person, under
     circumstances and conditions similar to those under which the member drove, would or
     would not have undertaken to drive and whether having elected to drive, the member‟s
     actions constitute intentional misconduct or willful neglect.
        A5.6.2.1. Voluntary intoxication, use of drugs, or other circumstances that affect the
        member‟s mental or physical faculties cause a member to be unfit.
        A5.6.2.2. It is not necessarily misconduct when a member has a motor vehicle accident
        because he or she fell asleep while driving.
     A5.6.3. Illness, injury, disease or death incurred while not wearing safety devices such as
     seat belts or safety helmets is one factor to consider. Standing alone, the violation of a safety
     standard or regulation constitutes only simple negligence. The violation must, under the
     circumstances, amount to gross, willful, or wanton carelessness to constitute misconduct.
        A5.6.3.1. The failure to use safety devices may have nothing to do with the proximate
        cause of the illness, injury, disease, or death. For example, the failure to wear a safety
        helmet may have nothing to do with a motorcyclist who breaks a leg.
        A5.6.3.2. In other cases, failure to use safety devices can aggravate the illness, injuries,
        or disease but will not be the proximate cause of the illness, injuries, disease or death.
        A5.6.3.3. Do not focus solely upon whether or not the member was wearing seat belts or
        other protective devices at the time of the accident, instead carefully examine the facts
        and circumstances of each case.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                         43


A5.7. Participation in Inherently Hazardous Off-Duty Activities. An LOD Determination
for a member who participated in inherently hazardous off-duty activities is evaluated the same
way as any other case. Consider the nature of the activity, its inherent hazards, and the prior
training and experience of the member.
A5.8. Pregnant Members. Do not perform an LOD determination for pregnancy or for any
diagnosis associated with pregnancy. Make an LOD determination if the member is unable to do
her duties for more than 24 hours; or there is a likelihood of a permanent disability, or in cases
involving an induced abortion in violation of the law of the location of the abortion.
A5.9. Refusal or Failure to Seek Medical or Dental Treatment. Consider as misconduct,
unreasonable refusing, or failing through willful neglect or by design to submit to medical,
surgical, or dental treatment, which proximately causes illness, injury, disease or death even
though misconduct did not cause the original condition.
A5.10. Residual Effects of Surgery or Treatment. Normal disability resulting from the
surgery or treatment incurred “not in line of duty” is likewise “not in line of duty”. However, you
may find unanticipated residuals from the surgery or treatment, as incurred “in line of duty.”
A5.11. Resisting Arrest/Escape From Custody. Consider any illness, injury, disease or death
resulting from resisting arrest or trying to escape from custody a result of the member‟s own
misconduct. The member can reasonably anticipate the use of necessary force, even excessive
force, to restrain him or her. One who engages in such activities acts in disregard of personal
safety.
A5.12. Suicide Attempts and Suicidal Gestures. When a member makes a suicide attempt or
suicidal gesture, obtain evidence on the question of mental responsibility including an expert
psychiatric evaluation. Consider all evidence bearing on suicide attempt or suicidal gesture and
any problem that might serve as motivation for the incident.
   A5.12.1. A bona fide suicide attempt, in the absence of any intervening misconduct, raises a
   strong inference of lack of mental responsibility because of the instinct for self-preservation.
   A bona fide suicide attempt is sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the member
   was mentally responsible.
   A5.12.2. Intentionally self-inflicted illness, injury or disease, not prompted by a bona fide
   suicide attempt, is at most, a suicidal gesture. Such illness, injury or disease may be the result
   of the member‟s own misconduct, unless a lack of mental responsibility can be shown.
A5.13. Venereal Disease. The fact that a member has a venereal disease is not, by itself,

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1 TO AFI 36-2910. This change incorporates
interim change (IC) 2002-1 (Attachment 9). This change requires an informal line of duty
determination to be initiated in the case of each active duty death in order to fulfill requirements
for Survivor Benefit Plan and Educational Assistance Death Benefits (sections 1.2.8.; 1.5.1.;
2.3.2.). See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2002-1, for the complete IC. A “|” indicates
revised material since the last edition.
OPR: HQ AFPC/JA (Maj Richard Desmond)
Supersedes AFI 36-2910, 16 April 2002.
Certified by: HQ AFPC/JA (Col Margaret McCord)
1.2.8. Basic Educational Assistance Death Benefit. Certain survivors of deceased members
entitled to basic educational assistance may be entitled to death benefits (Title 37, U.S.C. 3017,
Death Benefit).
1.5.1. The death of a member. In every case where a member dies on active duty, at a minimum,
an AF Form 348 must be completed. An administrative determination is not sufficient in a case
of death.
2.3.1.2.3. An illness or disease clearly not involving misconduct or caused by abuse of drugs or
alcohol.
2.3.2. AF Form 348, Initiating an Informal Determination. If an LOD determination is required,
but an administrative determination is not appropriate, the medical officer initiates AF Form 348.
An Informal LOD must be initiated on AF Form 348 in every case of a member dying on active
duty. The medical officer provides a narrative description of the member‟s medical condition but
does not make an LOD determination. See Attachment 2, Instructions, AF Form 348.

Terms
Active Duty—Full-time duty in the active military of the United States. A general term applied
to all active military service with the active force without regard to duration or purpose.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty that is used for training members of the
Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed
Forces in time of war or national emergency and such other times as the national security
requires. The member is under orders that provide for return to nonactive status when the period
of ADT is completed. It includes annual training, special tours of ADT, school tours, and the
initial duty for training performed by nonprior service enlistees.
Absent Without Authority—Consider member “absent without authority” if he or she is
voluntarily absent without leave for more than 24 hours, or was voluntarily absent from a
scheduled duty or formation, a restriction, or an arrest. Scheduled duty or formation means doing
a specified task at a specified time and place for a specified purpose. It is not the same as
regularly scheduled duty. Consider the member “absent without authority” if not excused and
absent from duty in civil confinement for more than 24 hours. The term “absent without
authority” is the same as “unauthorized absence.”
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                              51


Administrative Determination—A determination by a medical officer that a member‟s death,
illness, injury or disease occurred in the line of duty. This process can be used for only a limited
number of instances including battle casualties, disease of natural origin, simple injury and
conditions that existed prior to service.
Alcohol Abuse—The illegal or improper use or possession of alcohol, on or off duty, that results
in, but is not limited to, impaired duty performance, intoxicated driving, domestic disturbances,
assault, aberrant behavior, altercations, underage drinking, or other behavior inconsistent with
Air Force standards.
Alcoholism—A psychological or physical dependence on alcohol.
Disease—A condition of an organ, part, structure, or system of the body in which there is
incorrect function resulting from the effect of heredity, infection, diet, or environment. It is the
same as illness, sickness, or ailment.
Drug Abuse—The illegal or improper use, possession, sale, transfer, or trafficking of any
controlled substance included in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V in Title 21, United States Code,
Section 812, drug abuse paraphernalia, or any intoxicating substance, other than alcohol, that is
inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or function.
Drugs—Any controlled substance included in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V in 21 U.S.C. 812,
including anabolic or androngenic steroids, or any intoxicating substance other than alcohol, that
is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or
function.
Existed Prior to Service (EPTS)—Terms added to a medical diagnosis where there is clear
evidence that a illness, injury, or disease, the underlying condition causing it, existed before the
member‟s entry into military service, and was not aggravated by service. EPTS diseases include
chronic diseases and diseases with an incubation period that rule out a finding that they started
during inactive duty training, active duty training, or tours of active duty.
Hostile Casualty—A person who is the victim of a terrorist activity or who becomes a casualty
“in action.”
Inactive Duty Training (IDT)—Authorized training performed by a member of a Reserve
Component not on active duty or active duty for training and consisting of regularly scheduled
unit training assemblies, additional training assemblies, periods of appropriate duty or equivalent
training, and any special additional duties authorized for Reserve Component personnel by the
Secretary concerned, and performed by them in connection with the prescribed activities of the
organization in which they are assigned with or without pay. Does not include work or study
associated with correspondence course. Also called IDT.
Incapacitation Benefits—Entitlement for Reserve members to compensation for incapacitation
or loss of civilian earnings as a result of an injury, illness or disease incurred or aggravated in the
line of duty.
Injury—includes such conditions as fractures, wounds, strains, sprains, dislocations,
concussions, and compressions. In addition, it includes conditions resulting from extremes of
temperature or prolonged exposure. Acute poisoning (except those due to contaminated food)
resulting from exposure to toxic or poisonous substances are also injuries.

Intoxication—Maladaptive behavior such as aggressiveness, impaired judgment, and impaired
social or occupational functioning, because of recent ingestion, inhalation, or injection of any
substance into the body. Signs include flushed face, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lack of
coordination, impaired attention, irritability, euphoria or depression.
In Line of Duty—A death, illness, injury or disease suffered by a member is presumed to be in
the line of duty, unless a preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that the member‟s
death, illness, injury, or disease happened while the member was absent from duty without leave
or due to the member‟s own misconduct. Confine the meaning of “line of duty” in this
instruction to the purpose of this instruction. It is completely distinct from usage under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2671, and has no bearing on the meaning or
application of the phrase “acting within the scope of his office or employment” as used in that
Act.
Intentional Conduct—An act, by commission or omission, done on purpose.
Intervening Cause—An independent action occurring between the original wrongful act or
omission and the death, illness, injury or disease, that turns aside the natural sequence of events,
and produces a result which would not otherwise have followed and been foreseeable.
Lost Time—Time (if more than 24 hours) which must be made up (served) by an enlisted
member who is unable to perform military duties because of intemperate use of drugs or alcohol,
or because of illness, injury or disease resulting from misconduct.
Mental Responsibility—The capacity to understand when ones conduct is wrong and to
conform ones conduct to the requirement of the law. All members are presumed mentally
responsible for their acts, unless there is contrary evidence. This presumption usually means it is
unnecessary to pursue the issue of mental responsibility unless there is credible evidence of lack
of mental responsibility. Such evidence may consist of the circumstances surrounding the death,
illness, injury or disease, previous abnormal or irrational behavior, expert opinion, or other
evidence directly or indirectly pointing toward lack of mental responsibility. Members are not
responsible for their misconduct and its foreseeable consequence if, as a result of mental disease
or defect, they lack substantial capacity either to appreciate that their conduct is wrong or to
conform the conduct to the requirements of law. The term “mental disease or defect” does not
include an abnormality manifested only by repeated wrongful or otherwise antisocial behavior.
Members with impaired mental faculties as a result of their own prior misconduct, such as by
taking a hallucinogen, other illegal (controlled) substance, or deliberately ingesting any
harmful/dangerous substance, are mentally responsible.
Misconduct—Intentional conduct that is wrongful or improper. Also, willful neglect or gross
negligence.
Not in Line of Duty, Due to Own Misconduct—A determination supported by a preponderance
of the evidence that the member‟s death, illness, injury or disease, was proximately caused by the
member‟s own misconduct, regardless of whether the member was absent without authority.
Not in Line of Duty, Not Due to Own Misconduct—A determination supported by a
preponderance of the evidence that the member‟s death, illness, injury or disease happened while
the member was absent without authority, and the death, illness, injury, or disease was not
proximately caused by the member‟s own misconduct.
AFI36-2910 4 OCTOBER 2002                                                                       53


Proximate Cause—It is the cause that, in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken by an
independent and unforeseeable new cause, results in the death, illness, injury or disease and
without which the death, illness, injury or disease would not have occurred.
Preponderance of the Evidence—The greater weight of credible evidence. That evidence that,
when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression and is more convincing as to its truth
when weighed against the opposing evidence.
Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs—Any intoxication caused by alcohol or by drugs that
is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mental or physical faculties.
Willful Neglect—An act or acts of omission or of commission that evidence a reckless or
wanton disregard for their attendant consequences. Conduct that indicates a member exhibited a
reckless or wanton disregard for his or her own personal well-being or for the well-being of
another. The same as gross negligence.
