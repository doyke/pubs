                                             Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides standardized airfield, heliport, and airspace criteria for
the geometric layout, design, and construction of runways, helipads, taxiways, aprons, and
related permanent facilities to meet sustained operations.
1.2. Scope. This instruction prescribes dimensional and geometric layout criteria for safe
standards for airfields, landing zones (LZ), heliports and helipads, related permanent facilities, as
well as the navigational airspace surrounding these facilities. Criteria in this instruction, which
are a compilation of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), and Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Facility Code (UFC) 3-260-01,
Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design criteria, pertain to United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE) airfields within the European Command (EUCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).
Criteria within this instruction should be applied to the maximum extent practicable. If a written
agreement exists between a host nation and DoD that requires application of other standards,
those standards shall apply. Procedures for pavement structural design and pavement marking
and lighting are beyond the scope of this instruction.
     1.2.1. USAFE Host Nation Agreement Policy. If a USAFE airfield follows a host nation
     agreement that stipulates standards other than standards in this instruction, the installation
     shall maintain official and written documentation of that agreement. Written agreements
     shall be furnished to USAFE/A7 upon request. Failure to produce written documented proof
     of criteria in violation of these standards shall result in non-compliance of that airfield for
     each standard within this instruction that is not met.
     1.2.2. Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS or PANSOPS). In addition to a local
     Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) review, modifications to existing facilities,
     temporary construction, airfield surface modifications, maintenance or construction requiring
     equipment on or near the airfield flying environment, and construction of new facilities must
     be closely coordinated with Air Operations Command and Control (HQ USAFE/A3Y) to
     determine the impact to existing and planned instrument approach and departure procedures.
     The criteria in this instruction do not address instrument flight procedures. TERPS
     evaluations and processes are described in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-230, Instrument
     Procedures; Air Force Manual (AFMAN) (I) 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal
     Instrument Procedures (TERPS). TERPS criteria shall be considered when designing or
     modifying airfields and facilities on airfields that are used under Instrument Flight Rules
     (IFR). For main operating bases (MOBs) in Germany, a PANSOPS review by host nation air
     forces Amt für Flugsicherung der Bundeswehr (AFSBw) is required for new construction of
     facilities that might impact the Air Traffic Act Permit (ATAP).
     1.2.3. Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. Modifications to existing facilities and
     construction of new facilities must consider navigable airspace and may require coordination
     with host nation civil, military or construction authorities. The criteria for determining
     obstructions to navigable airspace have been identified in this instruction. The designer must
     consult this instruction during the design process to identify obstructions to airspace.
     Designers will coordinate with the airfield manager (AFM) and safety officer, and then host
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                         9


   nation civil, military or construction authorities, as required. If the criteria in this instruction
   are more stringent than host nation criteria, this instruction should be used to the maximum
   extent practical.
   1.2.4. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS) and Lighting. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS) and
   airfield lighting are integral parts of an airfield and must be considered in the planning and
   design of airfields and heliports. NAVAID location, airfield lighting, and the grading
   requirements of a NAVAID must be considered when locating and designing runways,
   taxiways, aprons and other airfield facilities. Refer to UFC 3-260-01, Table B16-1 in
   Appendix B Section 16, Navigation Aids Design and Support, for a list of design documents
   governing NAVAIDS and lighting and the agency where siting and design information can
   be obtained.
   1.2.5. Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing (V-STOL) Aircraft (V-22 Osprey). At shore
   establishments, the V-22 will be considered a fixed-wing aircraft, and the runway planned
   according to critical field length. If operational requirements allow for reduced loads and a
   vertical takeoff pad is desired, contact the appropriate agency aviation office that can provide
   airfield safety waivers. V-22 apron requirements are provided in Chapter 6. Information on
   the V-22 aircraft may be obtained by contacting:

1.3. References. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information contains a
list of documents referenced in this instruction.
1.4. Application of Criteria:
   1.4.1. Existing Facilities. The criteria in this instruction are not intended to apply to
   existing facilities located or constructed under previous standards. This includes cases where
   runways may lack paved shoulders or other physical features because they were not
   previously required or authorized. Existing airfield facilities need not be modified or
   upgraded to conform to the criteria in this instruction if these facilities meet current mission
   requirements. If a change in mission necessitates reconstruction, an upgrade to current
   standards shall be accomplished where practical. Once a facility has reached the end of its
   useful life, it will not be renovated. The facility must be replaced with a facility that meets
   the requirements in this instruction. Upgraded facilities must be maintained at a level that
   will sustain compliance with current standards.
   1.4.2. Modification of Existing Facilities. When existing airfield facilities are modified,
   construction must conform to the criteria established in this instruction unless waived in
   accordance with paragraph 1.6. Modified portions of facilities must be maintained at a
   level that will sustain compliance with current standards. Modification of an existing
   facility, which alters the exterior dimensions of a facility, must be coordinated with Logistics,
   Installations and Mission Support Directorate, Programs Division (HQ USAFE/A7P) to
   determine if an airfield waiver is required. For additional requirements, see Attachment 2,
 10                                                       USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


   United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Airfield and Airspace Waiver Program,
   paragraph A2.1.
   1.4.3. New Construction. The criteria established within this instruction apply to all new
   facility construction unless the appropriate waivers are obtained, as outlined in Attachment
   2. New facilities must be maintained at a level that will sustain compliance with current
   standards.
   1.4.4. Metric Application. Geometric design criteria established in this instruction are
   expressed in the International System of Units (SI) units. These metric values are based upon
   aircraft specific requirements rather than direct conversion and rounding. This results in
   apparent inconsistencies between metric and inch-pound (English) dimensions. For example,
   150-foot-wide runways are shown as 46 meters (m), 150-foot-wide aircraft wash racks are
   shown as 45 m. Runways need the extra meter in width for aircraft operational purposes;
   wash racks do not. SI dimensions apply to new airfield facilities, and where practical, to
   modification of existing airfield facilities, unless waived in accordance with paragraph 1.6.
   Inch-pound measurements are included in the tables and figures in this instruction only to
   permit reference to the previous standards. To avoid changes to existing airfield obstruction
   maps and compromises to flight safety, airfield and heliport imaginary surfaces and safe
   wingtip clearance dimensions are shown as a direct conversion from inch-pound to SI units.
1.5. Integration of Security Measures into Design. Protective features such as barriers,
fences, lighting, access control, intrusion detection and assessment must be integrated into the
airfield planning and design process to minimize problems with aircraft operations and safety
requirements. The protective measures should be included in the design based on risk and threat
analysis, and should comply with security-related requirements. Detailed discussion of security-
related requirements, such as Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection, is beyond the scope of this
instruction. Designers should refer to the applicable security regulations in Table 1.1. for
planning and design guidance.
1.6. Waivers to Criteria. Waivers to the criteria contained in this instruction will be processed
in accordance with Attachment 2. If a waiver affects instrument approach and departure
procedures as defined in TERPS (AFMAN (I) 11-226) or PANSOPS, the DoD Service
component processing the waiver must also coordinate its action with the applicable
TERPS/PANSOPS approving authority. PANSOPS applies to German MOBs only. Approval
authority for PANSOPS review is AFSBw.
1.7. Notice of Construction. Notify your host nation, NATO or ICAO construction authority
so an assessment of impact to civil aviation may be performed. For German MOBs, this
authority is AFSBw.
1.8. Zoning. Existing facilities should be modified, and new facilities should be sited and
constructed in a manner that is compatible with flight operations as defined in Department of
Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4165.57, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program.
1.9. Construction Phasing Plan. A construction phasing plan, as discussed in UFC 3-260-01,
Appendix B, Section 14, Construction Phasing Plan and Operational Safety on Airfields During
Construction, shall be included in the contract documents. This is a mandatory requirement
whether work will be accomplished by contract or in-house (see UFC 3-260-01, Section 14).
Also see the procedures for obtaining temporary waivers for construction in Attachment 2.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 11


1.10. Associated Design Manuals. The planning and design of airfields and heliports is
intricate and may require additional criteria, such as pavement design and pavement marking, not
addressed in this instruction. Additional manuals, which the designer/planner may need to
consult, are listed in Table 1.1.
1.11. Use of Terms. The following terms, when used in this instruction, indicate the specific
requirements:
Will, Shall or Must – A mandatory and required action.
Should – A recommended, advisory or desirable action.
May or Can – A permissible action.

                          AVIATION FACILITIES PLANNING

2.1. Applicability. Aviation facilities planning in United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)
shall follow the criteria of Chapter 2 of the UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and
Design, with the following variations:
   2.1.1. Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Programs. AICUZ programs are
   only required within base boundaries of USAFE installations. Lands outside of the
   installation boundary are exempt from AICUZ.
   2.1.2. Accident Potential Zones (APZ). APZ do not apply in USAFE when they extend
   outside of the installation boundary.
   2.1.3. Environmental Studies. Section 2-4.3 of the UFC 3-260-01 does not apply. At
   USAFE installations, environmental studies are conducted in accordance with Air Force
   Instruction (AFI) 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and USAFE
   Supplement 1 to AFI 32-7061.

               RUNWAYS (FIXED-WING) AND IMAGINARY SURFACES

3.1. Contents. This chapter presents design standards and considerations for fixed-wing
runways and associated imaginary surfaces.
3.2. Requirements. The landing and take-off design considerations for an airfield include
mission requirements, expected type and volume of air traffic, traffic patterns such as the
arrangement of multidirectional approaches and takeoffs, ultimate runway length, runway
orientation required by local wind conditions, local terrain, restrictions due to airspace obstacles
or surrounding community, noise impact and aircraft accident potential.
3.3. Runway Classification. Runways are classified as either Class A or Class B, based on
aircraft type as shown in Table 3.1. This table uses the same runway classification system
established by the office of the Secretary of Defense as a means of defining accident potential
zones (APZ) for the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program. These runway
classes are not to be confused with aircraft approach categories and aircraft wingspan in other
Department of Defense (DoD), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents, aircraft
weight classifications or pavement traffic areas. The aircraft listed provide examples of aircraft
that fall into these classifications and may not be all-inclusive.
   3.3.1. Class A Runways. Class A runways are primarily intended for small light aircraft.
   These runways do not have the potential or foreseeable requirement for development use by
   high-performance and large heavy aircraft. Ordinarily, these runways are less than 2,440
   meter (m) (8,000 ft) long and have less than 10 percent of their operations that involve
   aircraft in the Class B category. However, this is not intended to limit the number of C-130
   and C-17 operations conducted on any Class A airfield.
   3.3.2. Class B Runways. Class B runways are primarily intended for high performance and
   large heavy aircraft, as shown in Table 3.1.
   3.3.3. Rotary-Wing and Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing (V-STOL) Aircraft.
   Runways for Rotary-wing and V-STOL (V-22) aircraft are not addressed in this chapter.
   Design standards and considerations for rotary-wing aircraft runways and landing lanes are
   found in Chapter 4 of the UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.

Notes:
1. Only symbols for basic-mission aircraft or basic mission aircraft plus
type are used. Designations represent entire series. Runway classes in
this table are not related to aircraft approach categories, aircraft weight,
aircraft wingspan or to pavement design classes or types.
2. These are examples of aircraft, which fall into these classifications and
may not be all-inclusive.
3. Rotary aircraft are not addressed in this table.
4. V-22 aircraft is a rotary aircraft, which operates as a rotary-wing
aircraft on a Class A runway and operated as either fixed-wing or rotary-
wing aircraft on taxiways associated with Class A runways.
5. For unmanned aircraft refer to Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 09-
1: Airfield Planning and Design Criteria for Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(UAS)
3.4. Short Fields and Training Assault Landing Zones (LZ). Short Fields and Training
Assault LZs are special use fields. Design criteria are found in AF Engineering Technical Letter
(ETL) 09-6, C-130 and C-17 Landing Zone (LZ) Dimensional, Marking, and Lighting Criteria,
and Chapter 7 of the UFC 3-260-01.
3.5. Runway Systems. Runway systems are selected based on local wind patterns and mission
needs.
   3.5.1. Single Runway. A single runway is the least flexible and lowest-capacity system.
   The capacity of a single runway system will vary from approximately 40 to 50 operations per
 16                                                         USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


    hour under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) conditions, up to 75 operations per hour under
    VFR conditions.
    3.5.2. Parallel Runways. Parallel runways are the most commonly used system for
    increased capacity. In some cases, parallel runways may be staggered with the runway ends
    offset from each other and with terminal or service facilities located between the runways.
    When parallel runways are separated by less than the distance shown in Item 15 of Table 3.2,
    the second runway will increase capacity at the airfield under VFR conditions, but due to the
    close distance, capacity at the airfield will not be increased under IFR conditions.
    3.5.3. Crosswind Runways. Crosswind runways may be either the open-V or the
    intersecting type of runway. The crosswind system is adaptable to a wider variety of wind
    conditions than the parallel system. When winds are calm, both runways may be used
    simultaneously. An open-V system has a greater capacity than the intersecting system.
3.6. Runway Orientation and Wind Data. Runway orientation is the key to a safe, efficient
and usable aviation facility. Orientation shall be based on an analysis of wind data, terrain, local
development, operational procedures and other pertinent data. Procedures for analysis of wind
data to determine runway orientation are further discussed in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B,
Section 4, Wind Coverage Studies.

                               within the primary surface). Ideally
                               parallel taxiways (exclusive of shoulder

NOTES:
1. Geometric design criteria in this instruction are based on aircraft-specific requirements and are
not direct conversions from inch-pound (English) dimensions. Inch-pound units are included only
to permit reference to the previous standard.
2. Airfield and heliport imaginary surfaces and safe wingtip clearance dimensions are direct
conversions from inch-pound to SI units.
3. Metric units apply to new airfield construction and where practical, to modifications to existing
airfields and heliports, as discussed in paragraph 1.4.4.
3.7. Additional Considerations for Runway Orientation. In addition to meteorological and
wind conditions, the following factors must be considered:
     3.7.1. Obstructions. A specific airfield site and the proposed runway orientation must be
     known before a detailed survey can be made of obstructions, which affect aircraft operations.
     Runways should be so oriented that approaches necessary for the ultimate development of
     the airfield are free of all obstructions.

Figure 3.2. Runway and Primary Surface Transverse .




   3.7.2. Restricted Airspace. Airspace through which aircraft operations are restricted, and
   possibly prohibited, are shown on sectional and local aeronautical charts. Runways should
   be so oriented that their approach and departure patterns do not encroach on the restricted
   areas.
   3.7.3. Built-Up Areas. Airfield sites and runway alignment will be selected and the
   operational procedures adopted which will least impact local inhabitants. Additional
   guidance for facilities is found in DoD Instruction 4165.57, Air Installation Compatible Use
   Zone (AICUZ).
   3.7.4. Neighboring Airports. Existing aircraft traffic patterns of airfields in the area may
   affect runway alignment.
   3.7.5. Topography. Avoid sites which require excessive cuts and fills. Evaluate the effects
   of topographical features on: airspace zones, grading, drainage and possible future runway
   extensions.

   3.7.6. Soil Conditions. Evaluate soil conditions at potential sites to minimize settlement
   problems, heaving from highly expansive soils, high groundwater problems and construction
   costs.
   3.7.7. Noise Analysis. Noise analyses should be conducted to determine noise impacts to
   local communities and identify noise sensitive areas.
3.8. Runway Designation. Runways are identified by the whole number nearest one-tenth
(1/10) the magnetic azimuth of the runway centerline. The magnetic azimuth of the runway
centerline is measured clockwise from magnetic north when viewed from the direction of
approach. For example, where the magnetic azimuth is 183 degrees, the runway designation
marking would be 18; and for a magnetic azimuth of 117 degrees, the runway designation
marking would be 12. For a magnetic azimuth ending in the number 5, such as 185 degrees, the
runway designation marking can be either 18 or 19. Supplemental letters, where required for
differentiation of parallel runways, are placed between the designation numbers and the
threshold or threshold marking. For parallel runways, the supplemental letter is based on the
runway location, left-to-right, when viewed from the direction of approach: for two parallel
runways - ―L‖, ―R‖; for three parallel runways – ―L,‖ ―C,‖ and ―R.‖
3.9. Runway Dimensions. The following paragraphs and tables present the design criteria for
runway dimensions at all aviation facilities except Short Fields and Training Assault LZs.
   3.9.1. Runway Dimension Criteria, Except Runway Length. Table 3.2 presents all
   dimensional criteria, except runway length, for the layout and design of runways used
   primarily to support fixed-wing aircraft operations.
   3.9.2. Runway Length Criteria. HQ USAFE will determine the length of new or
   substantially modified Class A and Class B runways.
   3.9.3. Layout. Typical sections and profiles for runways and the associated airspace
   surfaces are in Figures 3.1 through 3.11
3.10. Shoulders. Unprotected areas adjacent to runways and overruns are susceptible to erosion
caused by jet blast. Shoulders reduce the probability of serious damage to an aircraft to a
minimum in the event that the aircraft runs off the runway pavement. The shoulder width,
shown in Item 3 of Table 3.2, includes both paved and unpaved shoulders. Paved shoulders are
required adjacent to all runways. The minimum paved shoulder width, shown in Table 3.2,
allows the runway edge lights to be placed within the paved portion of the shoulder and to reduce
foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft. The unpaved shoulder should be graded to prevent
water from ponding on the adjacent paved area (shoulder and runway). The drop-off next to the
paved area prevents turf (which may build up over the years) from ponding water. Manholes,
hand holes, and drainage structures constructed within these areas should, at a minimum, be
designed as provided in this section (NOTE: These requirements do not apply to projects already
under design prior to the publication date of this manual). Beyond the shoulders, sub-grade
structures are not designed to support aircraft wheel loads. The top surface of foundations,
manhole covers, hand hole covers, and frames should be flush with the grade. Maintenance
action is required if the drop-off at the top edge of the foundation exceeds 76 millimeters (mm)
(3 inches (in)).
   3.10.1. Paved Shoulder Areas.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    25


       3.10.1.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
       based on a wheel load of 34,000 kilograms (kg) (75,000 pounds (lb)) at a contact pressure
       of 1,724 kilopascals (kPa) (250 lb per square inch (psi)).
       3.10.1.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design based on
       the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the most critical
       assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case, however, should the
       design be based on computed stress conditions less than those created by a wheel load of
       34,000 kg (75,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250 psi).
    3.10.2. Unpaved Shoulder Areas.
       3.10.2.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
       based on a wheel load of 22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250
       psi).
       3.10.2.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design based on
       the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the most critical
       assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case, however, should the
       design be based on computed stress conditions less than those created by a wheel load of
       22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250 psi).
3.11. Runway Overruns. Runway overruns keep the probability of serious damage to an
aircraft to a minimum in the event that the aircraft runs off the runway end during a takeoff or
landing, or lands short during a landing. Overruns are required for the landing and takeoff areas.
Table 3.3 shows the dimensional requirements for overruns. Additionally, manholes, hand
holes, and drainage structures constructed within this area should, at a minimum, be designed as
provided in this section. (NOTE: These requirements do not apply to projects already under
design prior to the publication date of this instruction.) The top surface of foundations should be
flush with the grade. Sub-grade structures are not designed to support aircraft wheel loads
beyond the paved and unpaved areas of the overrun. Maintenance action is required if the drop-
off at the top edge of the foundation exceeds 76 mm (3 in).

3.12. Runway Clear Zones. Runway Clear Zones are areas on the ground, located at the ends
of each runway. They possess a high potential for accidents and their use is restricted to be
compatible with aircraft operations. In USAFE, Clear Zones are only delineated and protected
when they lie within the installation perimeter. Table 3.4 shows the dimensional requirements
for runway clear zones. Layout of the clear zones is shown in Figures 3.4 through 3.6
   3.12.1. The Mandatory Frangibility Zone (MFZ). The MFZs includes the Clear Zone and
   Primary surface. Items that must be sited in the clear zone or primary surface within the base
   boundary due to their function must be made frangible, see UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B,
   Section 13. Items that cannot be made frangible (such as highway guard rails), but must be
   located within this area for urgent and compelling reasons, must be waived by HQ USAFE
   before they are constructed. This is to ensure all alternatives are considered before non-
   frangible structures are sited within this area, see Figures 3.1 and 3.13

   3.14.1. Types of Airspace Imaginary Surfaces. At fixed-wing DoD facilities, the
   following types of airspace imaginary surfaces may be found:
       3.14.1.1. Class A VFR Runway.
       3.14.1.2. Class A IFR Runway.
       3.14.1.3. Class B IFR Runway.
   3.14.2. Imaginary Surfaces. The area surrounding a runway that must be kept clear of
   objects that might damage an aircraft is bounded by imaginary surfaces that are defined in
   this instruction. An object, either man-made or natural, which projects above an imaginary
   surface, is an obstruction. Imaginary surfaces for fixed-wing airfields are shown in Figures
   3.5 through 3.13 and are defined in Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting
   Information. The applicable dimensions and slopes are provided in Table 3.6. These
   imaginary surfaces include:
       3.14.2.1. Primary Surface (Runway Strip).
       3.14.2.2. Clear Zone.
       3.14.2.3. Inner Approach Surface.
       3.14.2.4. Approach Surface.
       3.14.2.5. Departure Surface
       3.14.2.6. Inner Horizontal Surface.
       3.14.2.7. Outer Horizontal Surface.
       3.14.2.8. Conical Surface.
       3.14.2.9. Transitional Surface.
       3.14.2.10. Inner Transitional Surface.
       3.14.2.11. Balked Landing Surface.
NOTE: Metric units apply to new airfield construction, and where practical, to modifications to
existing airfields and heliports, as discussed in paragraph 1.4.4.

NOTES:
1. Approach Surfaces are based on Instrument Approach-Departure procedures. Verify
Instrument Approach procedures with AF Flight Standard Agency or Host Nation Civil or
Military Aviation Authority, as appropriate, prior to using this table.
2. Airfield and heliport imaginary surfaces and safe wingtip clearance dimensions are shown as a
direct conversion from inch-pound to SI units.
3. USAFE does not operate any Class A runways. The Class A runway information in this table
is presented for reference only.
4. All USAFE installations can operate as a Class B IFR runway. Class B IFR imaginary
surfaces are the most protective. Therefore all USAFE runway systems must be established
based upon Class B IFR criteria presented in this table.
** These criteria only apply if the host nation requires them as part of a written agreement or
through ratification of NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 7174, Edition 1, Airfield
Clearance Planes.

3.15. Obstructions to Air Navigation. An existing object (including a mobile object) is, and a
future object would be, an obstruction to air navigation if it is higher than any of the heights or
surfaces listed in Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable
Airspace, and the surfaces described in this instruction.
   3.15.1. Aircraft Movement Area. No part of the aircraft movement area itself will be
   considered an obstruction if applicable grading criteria are met. (See the glossary in

    3.15.3. Trees. Trees are permitted near an airfield provided they are naturally occurring and
    are not located in the clear zone, primary surface, PA 2, and taxiway or apron clearance
    criteria. Trees cannot penetrate the transitional slope (7:1) or the approach clearance surface
    (50:1), or the departure clearance surface (40:1). Trees are permitted in PA 3 provided they
    do not present a hazard to aircraft operations, attract birds or interfere with NAVAIDS.
    Trees, which project into the imaginary surfaces must be removed or lowered to a distance
    below the imaginary surface, as shown in Table 3.7., see Figure 3.12.

3.17. Aircraft Arresting Systems. Aircraft arresting systems consist of engaging devices and
energy absorbers. Engaging devices are net barriers, disc supported pendants (hook cables), and
cable support systems, which allow the pendant to be raised to the battery position or retracted
below the runway surface. Energy absorbing devices are ship anchor chains, textile braking
system, rotary friction brakes, such as the BAK-12. The systems designated ―Barrier, Arresting
Kit‖ (BAK) are numbered in the sequence of procurement of the system design. There is no
connection between the AF designations of these systems and their function. The equipment is

government furnished equipment, as discussed in AFI 32-1043 USAFE Sup1, Managing Aircraft
Arresting Systems. Other designations such as E-5 are US Navy designations. The USAFE
systems in use today are as follows: E-5; BAK-12; BAK-14; mobile aircraft arresting system
(MAAS); and Textile Brake system.
   3.17.1. Requirements, Installation, Design and Repair Considerations. The BCE’s
   representative processes new requirements received from the Operations Group Commander
   (OG/CC) or Air Expeditionary Group Commander by first coordinating with the USAFE
   Power Production functional manager and 435 CTS/CEXD. The USAFE functional manager
   and 435 CTS/CEXD coordinate the new requirement with the USAFE A3O, SEF, and A7P,
   and responds to the base request. Once command endorsement is received, the base
   representative submits an AFEMS request to the Base Equipment Management Office
   (BEMO). Further information on the planning, installing and repairing of an arresting
   system or arresting system complex is found in AFI 32-1043. During the planning,
   installation and repair process, the following items will be given consideration.
      3.17.1.1. Configuration and Location. The configuration and location of arresting
      system installations will be determined in accordance with AFI 32-1043. Design will
      conform to the criteria within Section 3 of the appropriate 35E8 series Technical Order
      (T.O.) and the typical installation drawings. Both may be obtained from:

                    295 Byron Street
                    Robins AFB, GA 31098-1611


      3.17.1.2. Runway Pavement. The 60 m (200 ft) of pavement on both the approach and
      departure sides of the arresting system pendant is a critical area. Protruding objects and
      undulating surfaces are detrimental to successful tail-hook engagements and are not
      allowable. The maximum permissible longitudinal surface deviation in this area is plus
      or minus 3.0 mm (0.13 in) in 3.6 m (12 ft). Saw-cut grooves in runway pavement to
      improve surface drainage and surface friction characteristics in accordance with UFC 3-
      260-02, Pavement Design for Airfields are not considered protruding objects or
      undulations; however, the pavement shall not be grooved within the first 3.0 m (10 ft) on
      either side of the arresting system cables. For USAF facilities, changes in pavement type
      or an interface between rigid and flexible pavements are not permitted within the center
      23 m (75 ft) of the runway for 60 m (200 ft) in either direction from the arresting system
      cables. Sacrificial panels installed beneath arresting system cables in accordance with
      AFI 32-1043 are not considered a change in pavement type or an interface between rigid
      and flexible pavements. The prohibition on changes in surface pavement type is not
      applicable to emergency aircraft arresting systems located in overruns. Portland cement
      concrete (PCC) foundations designed in accordance with USAF Typical Installation
      Drawing 67F2011A, BAK-12, are required for aircraft arresting system cable tie-downs
      and are also exempt from the prohibition on changes in surface pavement type.
      3.17.1.3. Repair of Bituminous Pavements. Rigid inlays will not be used as a surface
      repair material beneath the cable in a flexible runway system. This type of repair causes
50                                                        USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


     high hook skip potential when the flexible pavement consolidates, exposing the leading
     edge of the rigid pavement. However, rigid pavement must be used as a foundation for
     sacrificial pads installed beneath aircraft arresting system cables. No part of the
     foundation for the panels shall be used as a surface pavement in a flexible runway
     pavement.
  3.17.2. Joint-Use Airfields. Arresting systems installed on joint-use civil/military airfields
  to support military aircraft are sited in accordance with the military rights agreement with the
  host government. If a separate agreement is specifically required for installation of a system,
  the Installation Commander shall coordinate with HQ USAFE/A7. HQ USAFE/A7 will
  coordinate any necessary agreements with the host nation.

                                         TAXIWAYS

5.1. Contents. This chapter presents design standards and considerations for fixed- and rotary-
wing taxiways.
5.2. Taxiway Requirements. Taxiways provide for ground movement of fixed- and rotary-
wing aircraft. Taxiways connect the runways of the airfield with the parking and maintenance
areas and provide access to hangars, docks and various parking aprons and pads.
5.3. Taxiway Systems.
   5.3.1. Basic. The basic airfield layout consists of a taxiway connecting the center of the
   runway with the parking apron. This system limits the number of aircraft operations at an
   airfield. Departing aircraft must taxi on the runway to reach the runway threshold. When
   aircraft are taxiing on the runway, no other aircraft is allowed to use the runway. If runway
   operations are minimal or capacity is low, the basic airfield layout with one taxiway may be
   an acceptable layout.
   5.3.2. Parallel Taxiway. A taxiway parallel for the length of the runway, with connectors to
   the end of the runway and parking apron, is the most efficient taxiway system. Aircraft
   movement is not hindered by taxiing operations on the runway and the connectors permit
   rapid entrance and exit of traffic.
   5.3.3. High Speed Taxiway Turnoff. High-speed taxiway turnoffs are located intermediate
   of the ends of the runway to increase the capacity of the runway. The high-speed taxiway
   turnoff enhances airport capacity by allowing aircraft to exit the runways at a faster speed
   than turnoff taxiways allow.
   5.3.4. Additional Types of Taxiways. Besides the types of taxiways discussed above, there
   are other taxiways at an airfield. Taxiways are often referred to based on their function.
   Common airfield taxiways and their designations are shown in Figure 5.1.
   5.3.5. Taxilanes. A taxi route through an apron is referred to as a taxilane. See Chapter 6
   for more information on taxilanes.
   5.3.6. Taxitracks. A taxi route connecting a dispersed parking platform (e.g. a fighter loop)
   to a taxiway or runway is referred to as a taxitrack. Dispersed parking platform and taxitrack
   use are generally limited to fighter aircraft only. Use of taxitracks by tactical transport
   aircraft is permitted provided minimum clearances established in Table 5.7 are met.
   5.3.7. Taxiway Layout. The following should be considered when planning and locating
   taxiways at an airfield:
   5.3.8. Efficiency. Runway efficiency is enhanced by planning for a parallel taxiway.
   5.3.9. Direct Access. Taxiways should provide as direct an access as possible from the
   runway to the apron. Connecting taxiways should be provided to join the runway exit points
   to the apron.
   5.3.10. Simple Taxiing Routes. A sufficient number of taxiways should be provided to
   prevent complicated taxiing routes. Turning from one taxiway on to another often creates
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                53


  confusion and may require additional airfield signs and communication with the air traffic
  control tower (ATCT).
  5.3.11. Delay Prevention. A sufficient number of taxiways should be provided to prevent
  capacity delays that may result when one taxiway must service more than one runway.
  5.3.12. Runway Exit Criteria. The number, type, and location of exits are a function of
  runway length, as shown in Figure 5.2 and as discussed in Chapter 2 of UFC 3-260-01,
  Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
  5.3.13. Taxiway Designation. Use letters of the alphabet for designating taxiways.
  Optimally, designation of the taxiways should start at one end of the airport and continue to
  the opposite end, e.g., east to west or north to south (see UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air
  Navigation Facilities). Designate all separate, distinct taxiway segments. Do not use the
  letters I, O, or X for taxiway designations.
  5.3.14. Deconflict and, or Restrict Vehicle Access. Comply with local Airfield Driving
  Instructions.

NOTES:
1. N/A = Not Applicable
2. Bed of channel may be flat. When drainage channels are required, the channel bottom cross
section may be flat but the channel must be sloped to drain.
3. A 15 m (50 ft) paved shoulder is allowed for C-5, E-4, and 747 aircraft where vegetation cannot
be established. Transverse grade of paved shoulder is 2% minimum to 4% maximum.
4. Metric units apply to new airfield construction and where practical, to modification of existing
airfields and heliports, as discussed in paragraph 1.4.4.
5. The criteria in this instruction are based on aircraft specific requirements and are not direct
conversions from inch-pound (English) dimensions. Inch-pound units are included only as a
reference to the previous standard.
6. Airfield and heliport imaginary surfaces and safe wingtip clearance dimensions are shown as a
direct conversion from inch-pound to SI units.

2. For all other cases, transverse grade of paved shoulder is 2% minimum to 4% maximum
5.5. Rotary-Wing Taxiway Dimensions. Rotary-wing taxiways are either paved or unpaved.
Wheel-gear configured rotary wing aircraft require a paved surface on which to taxi. Skid-gear
configured rotary-wing aircraft taxi by hovering along a paved or unpaved taxiway. Table 5.2
presents the criteria for rotary-wing taxiway design, including taxiway widths, clearances, slopes
and grading dimensions.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                            61


5.6. Taxiways at Dual Use (Fixed- and Rotary-Wing) Airfields:
     5.6.1. Criteria. For taxiways at airfields supporting both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft
     operations, the appropriate fixed-wing criteria will be applied, except as noted for shoulders.
     5.6.2. Taxiway Shoulders. A paved shoulder will be provided at dual use airfields.
     Shoulder widths may be increased beyond the requirement presented in Table 5.3, when
     necessary, to accommodate dual operations with fixed-wing aircraft.
5.7. Taxiway Inter. To prevent the main gear of an aircraft from becoming dangerously close to
the outside edge of the taxiway during a turn, fillets and lead-in to fillets are provided at taxiway
intersections. When an aircraft turns at an intersection, the nose gear of the aircraft usually follows
the painted centerline marking. The main gear, located to the rear of the nose gear, do not remain a
constant distance from the centerline stripe during the turn due to the physical design of the aircraft.
The main gear pivot on a shorter radius than the nose gear during a turn. Intersections should be
designed to ensure that the main gear wheels stay a minimum of 3 m (10 ft) from the pavement edge.
Intersection geometry can be determined using wheel-tracking simulation tools, or using the criteria
described in paragraph 5.7.1.

    5.7.1. Fillet Only Dimensions. Only fillets (not lead-ins to fillets) are required at runway-
    taxiway and taxiway-taxiway intersections. Fillets at runway-taxiway intersections are arcs
    installed in accordance with Table 5.4 and Figure 5.4. Fillets at taxiway-taxiway intersections
    are installed in accordance with Table 5.5 and Figure 5.5. Centerline and fillet radii used for
    these figures and tables are based on a 45.72 m (150 ft) centerline turning radius for
    runway/taxiway intersections and a 38.1 m (125 ft) centerline turning radius for taxiway/taxiway
    intersections using the geometry of the C-5 aircraft and a taxiway width of 22.9 m (75 ft). Larger
    centerline turning radii, other aircraft, or narrower taxiways may require larger fillets; therefore,
    the designer must consider the most demanding situation.

5.8. High-Speed Taxiway Criteria. If peak operations are expected to exceed 30 take-offs and
landings per hour, aircraft may be required to exit runways at greater than normal taxi speeds to
maintain airfield capacity. In these cases, an acute-angle exit taxiway may be required. BCE
designated representative should contact Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe
Pavements Engineer (HQ USAFE/A7P) or Headquarters Air Force Civil Engineer Support
Agency, Engineering Support Directorate (HQ AFCESA/CESC) for assistance.
5.9. Apron Access Taxiways. Apron access taxiways are provided for aircraft access onto an
apron. The number of apron taxiways should allow sufficient capacity for departing aircraft.
The apron access taxiways should be located to enhance the aircraft’s departing sequence and
route.
   5.9.1. Parking Aprons. The minimum number of apron access taxiways for any parking
   apron will be two. The minimum may be one if a single access taxiway will not inhibit
   planned operations.
   5.9.2. Fighter Aircraft Aprons. Three apron access taxiways should be provided for
   aprons with over 24-parked fighter aircraft. Four entrance taxiways should be provided for
   aprons with over 48-parked fighter aircraft.
5.10. Shoulders. Shoulders are provided along a taxiway to allow aircraft to recover if they
leave the paved taxiway. Paved shoulders prevent erosion caused by jet blast, support an
occasional aircraft, which may wander off the taxiway, support vehicular traffic, and reduce
maintenance of unpaved shoulder areas.
   5.10.1. For Fixed-Wing Taxiways. The shoulder for fixed-wing taxiways may be either
   paved or unpaved, depending on the class of runway and type of aircraft. Paved shoulder
   dimensions along fixed-wing taxiways are presented in Table 5.1. Criteria for fixed-wing
   taxiway shoulders, including widths and grading requirements to prevent the ponding of
   storm water, are presented in Table 5.1. Manholes, hand holes, and drainage structures
   constructed within these areas should, at a minimum, be designed as provided in this section.
   (NOTE: These requirements do not apply to projects already under design prior to the
   publication date of this manual.) Beyond the shoulders, sub-grade structures are not designed
   to support aircraft wheel loads. The top surface of foundations, manhole covers, hand hole
   covers, and frames should be flush with the grade. Maintenance action is required if the
   drop-off at the edge of the structure or foundation exceeds 76 mm (3 in).
       5.10.1.1. Paved Shoulder Areas.
           5.10.1.1.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft),
           design based on a wheel load of 34,000 kg (75,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724
           kilopascal (kPa) (250 lb per square inch (psi)).
           5.10.1.1.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
           based on the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the
           most critical assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case,
           however, should the design be based on computed stress conditions less than those
           created by a wheel load of 34,000 kg (75,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa
           (250 psi).

           5.10.1.2.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft),
           design based on a wheel load of 22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724
           kPa (250 psi).
           5.10.1.2.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
           based on the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the
           most critical assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case,
           however, should the design be based on computed stress conditions less than those
           created by a wheel load of 22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa
           (250 psi).
    5.10.2. For Rotary-Wing Taxiways. Paved shoulders are required adjacent to rotary-wing
    taxiways to prevent blowing dust and debris due to prop-wash. The criteria for a rotary-wing
    taxiway shoulder layout, including shoulder width, cross slopes and grading requirements,
    are presented in Table 5.3
5.11. Towways. A towway is used to tow aircraft from one location to another or from an apron
to a hangar.
    5.11.1. Dimensions. Table 5.6 presents the criteria for towway layout and design including
    clearances, slopes, and grading dimensions. When designing for access to a hangar, flare the
    pavement to the width of the hangar door from a distance beyond the hangar sufficient to
    allow maintenance personnel to turn the aircraft around.
    5.11.2. Layout. A typical transverse cross-section of a towway is shown in Figure 5.6
    5.11.3. Existing Roadway. When existing roads or other pavements are modified for use as
    towways, provide for necessary safety clearances, pavement strengthening (if required), and
    all other specific requirements set forth in Table 5.6 and Figure 5.6

5.12. Hangar Access. The pavement, which allows access from the apron to the hangar, is
referred to as a hangar access apron and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
5.13. Taxitracks.
   5.13.1. Taxitracks connect dispersed parking platforms to taxiways that connect to the
   runway.
      5.13.1.1. For tactical fighter aircraft ensure each dispersed parking platform is connected
      to a taxiway with two means of access to the runway.
      5.13.1.2. For tactical transport and maritime patrol aircraft, ensure the dispersed parking
      area is connected to a taxiway system providing separate access to either end of the
      runway.
   5.13.2. Taxitracks are 15 m (50 ft) wide and can be constructed of rigid or flexible
   pavement.

5.14. Parallel Taxiway/Emergency Runway.
     5.14.1. For USAFE, parallel taxiways used as emergency runways and emergency landing
     surfaces are all classified as emergency runways and are subject to this criteria. The purpose
     of the parallel taxiway and/or emergency runway is to provide aircraft pavement suitable for
     the dual function of transit to and/or from the runway and to provide an emergency runway
     for fighter aircraft only. The parallel taxiway and/or emergency runway is for operational
     redundancy.
     5.14.2. Table 5.8. provides details for parallel taxiways/emergency runways.

                            APRONS AND OTHER PAVEMENTS

6.1. Contents. This chapter presents design standards for fixed and rotary-wing aircraft parking
aprons, access aprons, maintenance pads and wash racks. It provides minimum wing-tip
clearance requirements, grades and lateral clearance standards, as well as typical aircraft parking
arrangements.
6.2. Apron Requirements. Aprons must provide sufficient space for parking fixed- and rotary-
wing aircraft. They should be sized to allow safe movement of aircraft under their own power.
Consider the effects of jet blast turbulence and temperature during design. Programming
requirements for AF aviation facilities are found in AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements.
6.3. Types of Aprons and Other Pavements. The following is a list of aprons and other
aviation facilities:
   6.3.1. Aircraft parking apron.
   6.3.2. Transient parking apron.
   6.3.3. Mobilization apron.
   6.3.4. Aircraft maintenance apron.
   6.3.5. Hangar access apron.
   6.3.6. Warm-up pad (holding apron).
   6.3.7. Unsuppressed power check pads.
   6.3.8. Arm/disarm pad.
   6.3.9. Compass calibration pad.
   6.3.10. Hazardous cargo pad.
   6.3.11. Alert pad.
   6.3.12. Aircraft wash rack.
6.4. Aircraft Characteristics (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)). Dimensional
characteristics of various military, civil, and commercial fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft are
available in U.S. Army Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 1110-3-394, Aircraft Characteristics
for Airfield-Heliport Design and Evaluation. This document can be located on the HQ
USAFE/A7P         Community       of     Practice  site    at    the    following     address:
https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-EN-
FE-08-8&Filter=OO-EN-FE-08.
6.5. Parking Apron for Fixed-Wing Aircraft.
   6.5.1. Location. Parking aprons should be located near and contiguous to maintenance and
   hangar facilities. Do not locate them within runway and taxiway lateral clearance distances
   and transitional surfaces. A typical parking apron is illustrated in Figure 6.3
76                                                        USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


  6.5.2. Size. As a general rule, there are no standard sizes for aircraft aprons. Aprons are
  individually designed to support aircraft and missions at specific facilities. Base the actual
  dimensions of an apron on the number and type of authorized aircraft, maneuvering space,
  and type of activity the apron serves. Allowances are provided in AFH 32-1084. The ideal
  apron size affords the maximum parking capacity with a minimum amount of paving.
  Generally, achieve this by reducing the area dedicated for use as taxi lanes by parking aircraft
  perpendicular to the long axis of the apron.
  6.5.3. Parking Apron Layout. Parking apron dimensions for United States Air Forces in
  Europe (USAFE) facilities will be based on the specific aircraft assigned to the facility and
  the criteria presented in AFH 32-1084. A typical mass-parking apron should be arranged in
  rows, as shown in Figure 6.3
  6.5.4. Layout for Combined Army and AF Parking Aprons. Parking apron dimensions
  for combined Army and AF facilities will be based on the largest aircraft assigned to the
  facility.
  6.5.5. Tactical/Fighter Parking Apron Layout. The recommended tactical/fighter aircraft
  parking arrangement is to park aircraft at a 45-degree angle as discussed in AFH 32-1084.
  Arranging these aircraft at a 45-degree angle may be the most economical method for
  achieving the clearance needed to dissipate jet blast temperatures and velocities to levels that
  will not endanger aircraft or personnel (Figure 6.4). Jet blast relationships are discussed in
  Army ETL 1110-3-394.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                               77

   6.5.6. Refueling Considerations. Refueling operations should not interfere with taxiing
   operations for other aircraft. Multiple routes in and out of the apron may be required.
   During refueling, active ignition sources such as sparks from ground support equipment or jet
   engines (aircraft) are prohibited within the Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ). An example
   of the refueling safety zone (RSZ) around a fixed-wing aircraft is shown in Figure 6.2. The
   safety zone is the area within 15 m (50 ft) of a pressurized fuel carrying servicing
   component; e.g., servicing hose, fuel nozzle, single-point receptacle (SPR), hydrant hose car,
   ramp hydrant connection point, and 7.6 m (25 ft) around aircraft fuel vents. The FSSZ is
   established and maintained during pressurization and movement of fuel. For additional
   information, see AF Technical Order (T.O.) 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
   Static Grounding/Bonding. Minimum requirements for the design and maintenance of the
   drainage system of aircraft fueling ramps are given in National Fire Protection Association
   (NFPA) 415, Standard on Airport Terminal Buildings, Fueling Ramp Drainage, and Loading
   Walkways, and UFC 3-460-01, Petroleum Fuel Facilities.

    6.5.7. Parking Dimensions. Table 6.1. presents minimum geometric criteria for fixed-wing
    apron design.
        6.5.7.1. Jet Blast Considerations. The clearances listed in Table 6.1 do not consider the
        effects of temperature and velocity due to jet blast. The effects of jet blast and minimum
        standoff distance to edge of pavement are described in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B,
        Sections 7 and 8, Jet Blast Effects/Jet Blast Deflector.
    6.5.8. Cargo Loading Considerations. Consider the effects of jet blast on aircraft loading
    operations and cargo storage locations when you design a layout for parking cargo aircraft.

NOTES:
1. For day-to-day operations, wingtip clearances may be reduced to those allowed by AFI 11-218, Aircraft
Operation and Movement on the Ground, with a waiver. For reduced wingtip clearances during
contingency operations, see Attachment 2, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Airfield and
Airspace Waiver Program.
2. Metric units apply to new airfield construction, and where practical, to modifications to existing
airfields and heliports, as discussed in paragraph 1.4.4.
3. The criteria in this instruction are based on aircraft specific requirements and are not direct conversions
from inch-pound (English) dimensions. Inch-pound units are included only as a reference to the previous
standard.
4. Airfield and heliport imaginary surfaces and safe wingtip clearance dimensions are shown as a direct
conversion from inch-pound to SI units.
5. For apron edges where fire hydrants must be installed, widen paved shoulders to within 4.6 m (15 ft) of
the hydrants to allow paved access for firefighting vehicles.

6.6. Taxiing Characteristics on Aprons for Fixed-Wing Aircraft.
    6.6.1. Apron Taxilanes. Taxi routes across parking aprons, referred to as taxilanes, are
    marked on the apron for safe passage of the aircraft. Typical taxilane locations are illustrated
    in Figures 6.1, 6.3, and 6.4. Minimum wingtip clearances between parked and taxiing
    aircraft are listed in Table 6.1.and shown on Figure 6.3. AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation
    and Movement on the Ground, provides authorization for operation of aircraft at reduced

   clearances under certain circumstances with a USAFE/A3 approved waiver. If a decision is
   made to reduce clearances based upon this authorization, you must waive the safe clearance
   requirements provided within this chapter in accordance with Attachment 2. Waivers should be
   pursued only when all avenues for compliance have been exhausted.
   6.6.2. Turning Capabilities (Aircraft Turning and Maneuvering Characteristics). Army
   ETL 1110-3-394, provides sources for obtaining various turning diagrams for fixed-wing aircraft.
   6.6.3. Departure Sequencing. Egress patterns from aircraft parking positions to taxiways
   should be established to prevent congestion at the apron exits. For parking apron access taxiway
   requirements, see Section 5.10
   6.6.4. Minimum Standoff Distances from Edge Pavements. See USAF ETL 01-5, Jet Engine
   Thrust Standoff Requirements for Airfield Asphalt Edge Pavements, and UFC 3-260-01,
   Appendix B, Sections 7 and 8 for information on minimum standoff distances from edge
   pavements.
6.7. Parking Apron for Rotary-Wing Aircraft. Mass parking of rotary-wing aircraft will require a
designated apron. Transient rotary-wing aircraft may be parked on aprons designated for fixed-wing
aircraft. At aviation facilities with assigned rotary-wing aircraft, a transport apron for fixed-wing
aircraft is desirable.
   6.7.1. Location. Parking aprons for rotary-wing aircraft should be located similar to parking
   aprons for fixed-wing aircraft. Rotary-wing aprons must not be located within the Lateral
   Clearance Distances and Transitional Surfaces discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Generally,
   company and/or squadron units should be parked together in rows for organizational integrity in
   locations adjacent to their assigned hangars. Parking aprons for small helicopters (observation
   helicopter (OH), utility helicopter (UH) and attack helicopter (AH)) should be separate from
   parking areas used by cargo helicopters (CH).
   6.7.2. Apron Size. As with fixed-wing aircraft aprons, there is no standard size for rotary-wing
   aircraft aprons. Dimensions should be based on the number and type of aircraft, maneuvering
   space and type of activity the apron serves.
   6.7.3. Maneuverability.
       6.7.3.1. Approach. Rotary-wing aircraft approach the parking spaces with either a front or
       sideways approach.
       6.7.3.2. Undercarriage. Rotary-wing aircraft are equipped with either skid gear or wheel
       gear. Once on the ground, skid-gear equipped helicopters cannot be moved without the
       appropriate aerospace ground equipment (AGE). Wheeled rotary-wing aircraft can be moved
       on the ground.
   6.7.4. Parking Apron Layout. Rotary-wing aircraft are parked in a layout similar to fixed-wing
   aircraft. Parking space, taxilane and clearance dimensions will be based on the rotor diameter of
   the specific aircraft assigned to the facility. Wingtip clearance criteria provided in Table 2.7 of
   AFH 32-1084 are preferred. Note: USAFE activities may use Army criteria presented in UFC 3-
   260-01 for rotary-wing aircraft except CH-53 and CH-54.
   6.7.5. Refueling Considerations. As discussed in paragraph 6.5.6., layout of aircraft parking
   locations and taxilanes should consider aircraft taxiing routes when an aircraft is refueled. The
   safety zone for rotary-wing aircraft is the area 3 m (10 ft) greater than the area bounded by the
   blades and tail of the aircraft. For additional information, see AF T.O. 00-25-172.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   87


   6.7.6. Parking Dimensions. Criteria for rotary-wing apron design are presented in AFH 32-1084.

6.8. Warm-Up Pads. A warm-up pad, also referred to as a holding apron, is a paved area
adjacent to a taxiway at or near the end of a runway. The intent of a warm-up pad is to provide a
parking location, off the taxiway, for aircraft, which must hold due to indeterminate delays. It
allows other departing aircraft unencumbered access to the runway. Pads must be sized to
provide a minimum of 7.62m (25 ft) of blast-resistant pavement behind the tail of an aircraft to
prevent damage from jet blast.
92                                                        USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


  6.8.1. Location.
     6.8.1.1. At End Turnoff Taxiway. The most advantageous position for a warm-up pad is
     adjacent to the end turnoff taxiway, between the runway and parallel taxiway, as shown
     in Figure 6.10 However, other design considerations such as navigational aids
     (NAVAIDS) may make this location undesirable. Do not site warm-up pads, other
     aprons, hot cargo spots, or taxiways in a way that will allow penetration of the approach
     or departure clearance surface.
     6.8.1.2. Along Parallel Taxiway. If airspace and NAVAIDS prevent locating the warm-
     up pad adjacent to the end turnoff taxiway, the warm-up pad should be located at the end
     of and adjacent to the parallel taxiway, as shown in Figure 6.11.
  6.8.2. Siting Considerations.
     6.8.2.1. End of Runway. Locate a warm-up pad as close to the runway as possible.
     6.8.2.2. Approach or Departure Clearance Surfaces. As discussed in Chapter 3, an
     obstruction to air navigation occurs when the imaginary surfaces are penetrated. Do not
     site warm-up pads, other aprons, hot cargo spots, or taxiways to these facilities in a way
     that will allow penetration of either the Approach or Departure Clearance Surfaces. Such
     aircraft penetrations may require revisions to TERPS procedures. Properly sited warm-
     up positions are illustrated in Figure 6.13.
     6.8.2.3. NAVAIDS. Warm-up pads must be located so that holding aircraft do not
     interfere with the operation of NAVAIDS, including instrument landing system (ILS)
     equipment. The critical area for ILS equipment is illustrated in Figures 6.14 through
     6.16. Additional discussion of ILS critical areas is provided in Technical Manual (TM)
     5-823-4, Marking of Army Airfield-Heliport Operational and Maintenance Facilities,
     AFI 13-204, Functional Management of Airfield Operations and Air Force ETL 04-2,
     Standard Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes.
  6.8.3. Warm-Up Pad Size. The size of the warm-up pad will be such to allow
  accommodating two of the largest aircraft assigned to the facility simultaneously. Wingtip
  clearances are presented in Table 6.1. Additional clearances provide a minimum of 7.62 (25
  ft) of blast-resistant pavement behind the tail of an aircraft to prevent damage from jet blast.
  6.8.4. Taxi-In/Taxi-Out Capabilities. The parking locations will have taxi-in/taxi-out
  capabilities to allow aircraft to taxi to their warm-up position under their own power, as
  shown in Figure 6.17

Figure 6.16. Warm-Up Pad CAT II ILS Critical Area.




NOTE:
The parking spot in the ILS critical area cannot be used during IFR conditions. Aircraft in this
particular position are within the localizer critical area identified by the ILS hold line. Under
instrument flight conditions, this area should be clear of objects that could reflect or block the
ILS signal.

Figure 6.17. Warm-Up Pad Taxiing and Wingtip Clearance Requirements.




   6.8.5. Parking Angle. Aircraft should be parked at a 45-degree (45°) angle to the parallel
   taxiway to divert the effects of jet blast away from the parallel taxiway (see UFC 3-260-01,
   Appenxix B, Sections 7 and 8) for minimum standoff distances). This is shown in Figure
   6.17.
   6.8.6. Turning Radius. The turning radius on warm-up pads will be designed to provide the
   minimum allowable turn under power for the largest aircraft assigned to the base.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                101


   6.8.7. Taxilanes on Warm-Up Pads. Taxilanes on the warm-up pads will meet the lateral
   clearance requirements discussed in Table 6.1. Lateral and wingtip clearance for a taxilane
   on a warm-up pad are illustrated in Figure 6.17
   6.8.8. Tie-Downs and Grounding Points. Tie-downs, mooring points, and grounding
   points are not required on warm-up pads.
6.9. Power Check Pad. An aircraft power check pad is a paved area, with an anchor block in
the center, used to perform full-power engine diagnostic testing of aircraft engines while the
aircraft is held stationary.
   6.9.1. Location and Siting Considerations. Unsuppressed power check pads should be
   located near maintenance hangars, but at a location where full power engine diagnostic
   testing of jet engines can be performed with minimal noise exposure to inhabited area’s on
   and off the base.
   6.9.2. Unsuppressed Power Check Pad Layout. Power check pads may either be
   rectangular, square or circular, and are illustrated in Figures 6.18, 6.19 and 6.20
   6.9.3. Access Taxiway/Towway. An access taxiway will be provided for access from the
   primary taxiway to the power check-pad. Since the aircraft may be towed to the
   unsuppressed power check-pad, the access taxiway must be designed as a towway. Taxiway
   and towway design requirements are presented in Chapter 5.
   6.9.4. Grading. The surface of the unsuppressed power-check pad must slope 3.5% in all
   directions from the anchor block to pavement edge to divert the effect of jet blast away from
   the concrete surfaces and pavement joints.
   6.9.5. Thrust Anchors. Thrust anchors are required on unsuppressed power check pads.
   Layouts for these anchors are interdependent of joint spacing and the two should be
   coordinated together.
       6.9.5.1. Power-check pads (thrust anchor) designed for up to 267 kN (60,000 lbs) are
       provided in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 15, Aircraft Trim Pad and Thrust
       Anchor For Up to 267 Kilonewtons (kN) (60,000 Pounds (lb)) Thrust. High-capacity
       trim pad design (444.8 kN (100,000 lbs) is addressed in USAF ETL 01-10, Design and
       Construction of High-Capacity Trim Pad Anchoring Systems.

Figure 6.20. Geometry for Circular Power Check Pad.




   6.9.6. Anchor Blocks. All unsuppressed power-check pads have a thrust anchor block
   installed in the center of the power-check pad to anchor the aircraft during engine testing.
   Anchor blocks are structurally designed for all tactical (non-transport) aircraft in the USAF
   inventory. The designer must verify structural adequacy of the anchor block for the mission
   aircraft and engine types. Thrust anchor blocks for USAFE aviation facilities are found in
   UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 15.
   6.9.7. Power-Check Pad Facilities.
       6.9.7.1. Required Facilities. The unsuppressed power check pad should consist of:
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   105


           6.9.7.1.1. Paved surface.
           6.9.7.1.2. Paved shoulders (see UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Sections 7 and 8 for
           minimum standoff distances).
           6.9.7.1.3. A thrust anchor or anchors for aircraft serviced at the pad.
           6.9.7.1.4. Blast deflectors if required to protect the surrounding area from jet blast
           damage.
       6.9.7.2. Optional Facilities. The unsuppressed power-check pad may include:
           6.9.7.2.1. Floodlighting for night operations.
           6.9.7.2.2. Water supply to wash down fuel spills.
           6.9.7.2.3. Oil separators, holding tanks and fuel treatment to address fuel spillage
           prior to discharge into sanitary or storm sewer.
           6.9.7.2.4. Communication link with the maintenance control room.
           6.9.7.2.5. Fire hydrants.
           6.9.7.2.6. A paved roadway to the unsuppressed power check pad for access by fire
           fighting, towing and aircraft maintenance support vehicles.
   6.9.8. Noise Considerations. The noise level at unsuppressed power check pads may
   exceed 115 decibel (dB(a)) during power-up engine tests. Caution signs should be placed
   around the power check pad indicating both the presence of hazardous noise levels and the
   need for hearing protection.
6.10. Arm/Disarm Pads. The arm/disarm pad is used for arming aircraft immediately before
takeoff and for disarming (safing) weapons retained or not expended upon their return. Do not
site new warm-up pads, other aprons, hot cargo spots, or taxiways to these facilities in a way that
will allow penetration of the approach or departure clearance surfaces.
   6.10.1. Location. Arm/disarm pads should be located adjacent to runway thresholds and
   sited such that armed aircraft are oriented in the direction of least populated areas or towards
   revetments. For parallel taxiways used as emergency runways, arm/disarm pads should be
   located outside of the clearance surfaces show in Table 5.8, to the maximum extent possible.
   6.10.2. Siting Considerations:
       6.10.2.1. Aircraft Heading. The criteria for establishing the exact heading of the parked
       aircraft depend on the type of aircraft and associated weapons. This information is
       contained within the classified portion of the aircraft manuals. The most economical
       means of parking aircraft on the arm/disarm pads is at 45 degrees (45°) to the taxiway.
       However, because of the requirement to orient armed aircraft away from populated areas,
       this angle may vary.
       6.10.2.2. Electromagnetically Quiet Location. Prior to construction of any pad, local
       field measurements must be taken to ensure that the location is electromagnetically quiet.
       To avoid potential electromagnetic interference from taxiing aircraft, pads should be
       located on the side of a runway opposite the parallel taxiway. The Air Force conducts
       electromagnetic radiation (EMR) surveys with regard to explosives safety in accordance
106                                                      USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


      with Air Force manual (AFMAN) 91-201, Chapter 9. The specific information for each
      emitting device should be available through the installation communications squadron.
      6.10.2.3. Inhabited Building Distance Clear Zone. As a general rule, an ―inhabited
      building distance clear zone‖ of plus or minus 5 degrees of arc on each side of the
      heading of the parked aircraft and 8.5 km (5 miles) in the front of the parked aircraft,
      both measured from the aircraft’s nose, should be maintained. This means that no
      occupied building will be in this clear zone. In addition, it is good practice to keep all
      buildings out of this clear zone to prevent damage from accidental weapon firing. This
      inhabited building distance clear zone may cross a runway, taxiway, or runway approach
      as long as the landing and taxiing aircraft can be seen by the arm/disarm quick check
      crews and the arming/disarming operations can cease for the period in which the aircraft
      passes. Parked aircraft or parked vehicles must not be located in the inhabited building
      distance clear zone. If this clear zone cannot be obtained, earth revetments must be used
      as a barrier.
  6.10.3. Arm/Disarm Pad Size. Each arm/disarm pad should be capable of servicing four or
  six aircraft at a time. The dimensions may vary with the length and wingspan of the aircraft
  to be served. Jet blast must also be taken into account. Typical layout of arm/disarm pads
  are shown in Figures 6.21, 6.22, 6.23 and 6.24. Arm/Disarm pad size may be increased as
  mission requirements dictate.
  6.10.4. Taxi-In/Taxi-Out Capabilities. The parking locations should have taxi-in/taxi-out
  capabilities to allow aircraft to taxi to their arm/disarm location under their own power.
  6.10.5. Parking Angle. The parking angle is dependent on the type of aircraft, type of
  weapons and the associated ―uninhabited clear zone‖ location.
  6.10.6. Turning Radius. The turning radius for taxilanes on arm/disarm pads should be
  designed to provide the minimum allowable turn under power of the largest aircraft, which
  will use the arm/disarm pad.
  6.10.7. Access Road. An all-weather access road should be constructed to the arm/disarm
  pad from outside the airfield’s taxiway and runway clearance areas. Design this road in
  accordance with UFC 3-250-18FA, General Provisions and Geometric Design for Roads,
  Streets, Walks, and Open Storage Areas and UFC 3-250-01FA, Pavement Design for Roads,
  Streets, Walks, and Open Storage Areas. Access roads must not encroach on taxiway
  clearances or taxilane wingtip clearance requirements (except at necessary intersections with
  these areas), nor shall any parking area associated with the access road be sited so that
  maintenance vehicles will violate the approach or departure clearance surfaces or any
  NAVAID critical area.
  6.10.8. Tie Downs and Grounding Points. Tie downs and mooring points are not required
  on arm/disarm pads. See UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 11, Tiedowns, Mooring, and
  Grounding Points, for grounding requirements.
  6.10.9. Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Ammunition and explosive safety
  standards are discussed in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 9, Explosives On or Near
  Airfields and AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.

6.11. Compass Calibration Pad (CCP). An aircraft compass calibration pad (CCP) is a paved
area in a magnetically quiet zone where an aircraft’s compass is calibrated.
   6.11.1. USAFE Options. The Air Force has the option of using the criteria presented here or
   using the criteria provided in Appendix 4 of the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory
   Circular (FAA AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design. A current copy of FAA AC 150/5300-13
   can be obtained from HQ AFCESA/CEOA. For CCP marking requirements, use the
   controlling aircraft technical order or use the information in FAA AC 150/5300-13 for
   general purpose CCPs.
   6.11.2. Location. The CCP should be located off the side of a taxiway at sufficient distance
   to satisfy the runway and taxiway lateral clearance distance and airspace criteria discussed in
   Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Do not site new CCPs, other aprons, hot cargo spots, or taxiways to
   these facilities in a way that will allow penetration of the approach or departure clearance
   surfaces. Provide an access taxiway to and from the primary taxiway to the CCP. The
   access taxiway must be oriented to facilitate moving the aircraft onto the CCP on a magnetic
   north heading. If the aircraft should be towed to the CCP, the access taxiway must be
   designed as a towway. Taxiway and towway design requirements are found in Chapter 5.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 111


  6.11.3. Siting Consideration.
     6.11.3.1. Separation Distances. To meet the magnetic quiet zone requirements and
     prevent outside-magnetic fields from influencing the aircraft compass calibration, efforts
     must be taken to make sure that minimum separation distances are provided. See UFC 3-
     260-01, Appendix B, Section 10, Compass Calibration Pad Magnetic Survey, for CCP
     separation distances.
     6.11.3.2. Preliminary Survey. During the site selection process, the proposed sites for
     compass calibration pads must be checked for magnetic influences to ensure that the area
     is magnetically quiet regardless of adherence to separation distances. Conduct a
     preliminary survey, as described in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 10 to determine
     if the proposed site is magnetically quiet. A survey, similar to the preliminary survey,
     must be conducted after construction of any new item, building, within or near the
     separation distances of the pad. This will ensure that the newly constructed item has not
     created new magnetic influences in the magnetic quiet zone.
     6.11.3.3. Magnetic Survey. The magnetic survey for the compass calibration pad is an
     airfield engineering survey that is conducted at the completion of the pad to ensure that
     the area is magnetically quiet, to determine the magnetic declination of the area and to
     layout the markings for the pad. Engineering surveys are also required every five years
     for CCPs. This cycle is operationally important as magnetic north not only varies at
     different locations on the earth, but physically changes as a function of time. It is an
     operational requirement to calibrate the aircraft’s compass correction factor on a regular
     basis because of these changes in the earth’s magnetic pole. In addition, the magnetic
     survey validates that the CCP is in a magnetic quiet zone; thus ensuring proper compass
     calibration. The magnetic survey for CCPs should be performed in accordance with UFC
     3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 10.
  6.11.4. CCP Size.
     6.11.4.1. CCP size requirements are shown on Figure 6.25. Unless otherwise stated in
     the datasheets of the primary aircraft using the pad, the CCP shall be sized as follows:
     length of the largest aircraft plus 10 meters (m) by wingspan of the largest aircraft plus 5
     m.
  6.11.5. Grading. Compass calibration pads will be graded as follows:
     6.11.5.1. Perimeter Elevation. The elevation of the perimeter of the pad will be the same
     around the entire perimeter.
     6.11.5.2. Cross-slope. The CCP should be crowned in the center of the pad with a
     constant cross slope of 1% in all directions to provide surface drainage while facilitating
     alignment of the aircraft pad.
  6.11.6. Tie Downs/Mooring Points. Do not place aircraft tie down/mooring points/tie
  down mooring eyes, or any static grounding points in the CCP pavement.
  6.11.7. Embedded Material. Due to the influence of ferrous metal on a magnetic field, the
  Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement for the CCP and access taxiway must not contain
  any embedded ferrous metal items such as dowels bars, reinforcing steel or steel fibers. In
  addition, ferrous metal must not be placed in or around the CCP site.

   6.11.8. Control Points. A control point will be set in the center of the CCP. This point will
   consist of a brass pavement insert into which a bronze marker is grouted in accurate
   alignment. This point will be stamped with ―Center of Calibration Pad.‖ The layout of the
   control points is discussed in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 10.

NOTE:
1. Thickness of concrete and base course, base course density, type of shoulder surfacing and
California Bearing Radio (CBR) of shoulder base course are governed by existing criteria or are
dependent upon site conditions.
2. Size of CCP is length of largest A/C plus 10 m (33 ft) x wingspan of largest A/C + 5 m (16 ft).
6.12. Hazardous Cargo Pads. Hazardous cargo pads are paved areas for loading and unloading
explosives and other hazardous cargo from aircraft. Hazardous cargo pads are required at
facilities where the existing aprons cannot be used for loading and unloading hazardous cargo.
Do not site new hazardous cargo pads, other aprons, hot cargo spots, or taxiways to these
facilities in a way that will allow penetration of the approach or departure clearance surfaces.
   6.12.1. Siting Criteria. Hazardous cargo pads require explosives site planning as discussed
   in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 9.
   6.12.2. Hazardous Cargo Pad Size. New Hazardous Cargo Pads shall be designed to meet
   the C-5 apron design criteria. Coordination with HQ USAFE/SEW is required. An access
   taxiway will be provided for access from the primary taxiway to the hazardous cargo pad.
   The taxiway should be designed for the aircraft to taxi onto the hazardous cargo pad.
   6.12.3. Tie Down and Grounding Points. Provide tie downs/mooring capabilities and
   grounding points on each hazardous cargo pad. See UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 11
   for further information.
   6.12.4. Miscellaneous Considerations. The following items need to be considered for
   hazardous cargo pads:
       6.12.4.1. Utilities. Telephone service, apron lighting, airfield lighting and water/fire
       hydrants are required for safety.
       6.12.4.2. Access Road. Provide a paved roadway to improve access to the hazardous
       cargo pad by trucks and other vehicles.

Figure 6.26. Typical Hazardous Cargo Pad.




NOTES:
1. This hazardous cargo pad is adequate for aircraft up to and including the C-5. The dimensions
may be adjusted to accommodate limiting constraints at individual facilities.
2. The distance between parked explosives cargo A/C is driven by explosives safety siting
requirements outlined under AFMAN 91-201, Table 12.1 (ILD-Intraline Distance required).

6.13. Alert Pad. An alert pad, often referred to as an alert apron, is an exclusive paved area for
armed aircraft to park and have immediate, unimpeded access to a runway. In the event of a
declared alert, alert aircraft must be on the runway and airborne in short notice. An alert apron
and an alert pad are shown on Figure 6.27 and 6.28, respectively.
   6.13.1. Location. Locating the alert apron/pad adjacent to a runway end will allow alert
   aircraft to proceed directly from the apron/pad to the runway threshold without interruptions
   from other traffic. The preferred location of alert pads is on the opposite side of the runway,
   away from normal traffic patterns to allow aircraft on the alert apron/pad direct, unimpeded
   access to the runway. Alert aprons/pads must not be located so that the aircraft or shelters
   are within the clear zone or penetrate the approach or departure clearance surfaces.
   6.13.2. Siting Criteria. Airspace Imaginary Surfaces. As discussed in paragraph 6.8.2.2,
   aircraft parked on the alert aprons/pads must not project into airspace imaginary surfaces.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                               115


      6.13.2.1. Explosives Consideration. Explosive-loaded aircraft on alert aprons/pads
      should be located in accordance with (IAW) approved Explosives Safety Site Plans
      (ESSP). UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 9.
   6.13.3. Alert Apron/Pad Size. Alert aprons/pads dimensions should vary with the length
   and wingspan of the aircraft to be served and the explosives on the aircraft. Wingtip
   clearances, presented in Table 6.2, are minimum separation distances to be observed at all
   times.

   6.13.4. Design Aircraft. To facilitate flexibility in future operations, new alert ramp
   construction should conform to B-52 standards. Aircraft parked in shelters are exempt from
   the above parking separation criteria.
   6.13.5. Alert Aircraft Parking Arrangements.
       6.13.5.1. Fighter Arrangements. Fighter aircraft are parked at 45-degree angles to
       dissipate the heat and velocity of jet blast.
       6.13.5.2. Non-Fighter Arrangements. Non-fighter aircraft should be parked in rows.
   6.13.6. Jet Blast Distance Requirements. Jet blast safe distances should be considered
   when planning and designing parking locations on alert pads. Safe distance criteria are
   presented in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Sections 7 and 8.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    119


   6.13.7. Taxi-In/Taxi-Out Capabilities. Alert aprons and pads should be designed either for
   taxi-in/taxi-out parking or for push-back parking. Taxi-in/taxi-out parking, shown in Figure
   6.29, is preferred since alert aircraft can be quickly taxied into position under their own
   power. Back-in parking, shown in Figure 6.30, requires less paved area.
   6.13.8. Turning Radius. The turning radius on the alert pad taxilanes will be designed to
   provide the minimum allowable turn under power of the largest aircraft, which will use the
   alert apron/pad. In no case will the initial turnout from the alert apron/pad parking space to
   the through taxilane exceed 90 degrees. For alert pads for bombers and tankers, the initial
   turn from the parking space will have a turn equal to the distance from the taxilane centerline
   to the nose of the aircraft (See Table 6.1).
   6.13.9. Dedicated Access Taxiway. At alert pads, provide a single dedicated taxiway from
   the alert pad to the runway for aircraft to progress directly without traffic interruptions.
   Having no other taxiways intersect the dedicated taxiway is the ideal way to ensure the
   dedicated taxiway is not obstructed.
   6.13.10. Tie Downs and Grounding Points. Provide tie downs/mooring capabilities and
   grounding points at each aircraft parking location, as discussed in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix
   B, Section 11.
6.14. Aircraft Wash Racks. Refer to UFC 3-260-01, Chapter 6, Aprons and Other Pavements,
for aircraft wash rack design criteria. Also refer to the respective host nation’s Final Governing
Standards (FGS) for environmental requirements. Where an FGS does not exist for a specific
host nation, refer to the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD).
6.15. Hangar Access Aprons. Hangar access aprons provide access to the hangars from the
parking apron and allow free movement of aircraft to the various hangar facilities. Access
aprons should be provided as a supporting item for each hangar and should be sized for the type
of aircraft to be accommodated.
   6.15.1. Dimensions. Generally, hangar access aprons should be as wide as the hangar doors
   and extend from the edge of the apron to the hangar door. Hangar access apron dimension
   requirements are summarized in Table 6.3.
   6.15.2. Grades for Aircraft Fueling Ramps. Grades for hangar access ramps on which
   fueling of aircraft will occur must slope away from aircraft hangars in accordance with
   NFPA Standard 415.
   6.15.3. Grades for Aircraft Access into Hangars. The grades in front of the hangar must
   allow access into the hangar. When aircraft are backed into the hangar, a tug vehicle pushes
   the aircraft in, tail first. Due to the location of the aircraft gear and the slope of the hangar
   access apron, the tail of the aircraft may be higher than the top of the hangar door. The
   hangar access apron grades may require adjustment to allow the aircraft tail to clear the
   hangar door.

                                                   around. The width of the maneuvering
                                                   area should be equal to the width of the
                                                   hangar door opening. Connect this

a direct conversion from inch-pound to SI units.
6.16. Taxiing Characteristics on Aprons for Rotary-Wing Aircraft. Taxi routes across
parking aprons are marked to provide safe passage. A hoverlane is a designated aerial traffic
lane used exclusively for the movement of helicopters. A taxilane is a designated ground traffic
lane.

   6.16.1. Hoverlane/Taxilane Width. The hoverlane/taxilane width is based on the rotor
   diameter of the largest helicopter generally using the apron.
6.17. Fixed-Wing and Rotary-Wing Grading Standards.
   6.17.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. Grading standards for fixed-wing parking aprons and
   shoulders are presented in Table 6.1. All parking aprons, pads and miscellaneous pavements
   should follow these grading standards unless a particular mission requirement, such as a
   power check pad, dictates otherwise. Avoid surface drainage patterns with numerous or
   abrupt grade changes. They can produce excessive pavement flexing and structural damage
   of aircraft.
   6.17.2. Rotary-Wing Aircraft. USAFE activities should use the Army grading criteria
   presented in UFC 3-260-01 for all rotary aircraft except CH-53 and CH-54. For those
   aircraft, see their respective Mission Design Series Facility Requirements Documents.
   6.17.3. Grades for Aircraft Fueling Ramps. Grades for ramps on which fueling of aircraft
   will occur should be in accordance with NFPA Standard 415.
6.18. Shoulders. Paved shoulders are provided around the perimeter of an apron to protect
against jet blast and foreign object damage (FOD), to support blast deflectors, for support
equipment storage, to provide paved access to fire hydrants, and to facilitate drainage. Criteria
for apron shoulders are presented in Table 6.1 for fixed-wing aprons and AFH 32-1084 for
rotary-wing facilities. To prevent storm water from ponding on the outside edge of the shoulder,
the turf adjacent to the paved shoulder should be graded to facilitate drainage. Manholes, hand
holes, and drainage structures constructed within these areas should, at a minimum, be designed
as stipulated in this section. (NOTE: These requirements do not apply to projects already under
design prior to the publication date of this instruction.) Beyond the shoulders, sub-grade
structures are not designed to support aircraft wheel loads. The top surface of foundations,
manhole covers, hand hole covers, and frames within shoulders should be flush with the grade.
Maintenance action is required if the drop-off exceeds 76 mm (3 in).
   6.18.1. Paved Shoulder Areas.
       6.18.1.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
       based on a wheel load of 34,000 kg (75,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kilopascal
       (kPa) (250 lb per square inch (psi)).
       6.18.1.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design based on
       the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the most critical
       assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case, however, should the
       design be based on computed stress conditions less than those created by a wheel load of
       34,000 kg (75,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250 psi).
   6.18.2. Unpaved Shoulder Areas.
       6.18.2.1. For structures with their shortest span equal to or less than 0.6 m (2 ft), design
       based on a wheel load of 22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250
       psi).
       6.18.2.2. For structures with their shortest span greater than 0.6 m (2 ft), design based on
       the maximum number of wheels that can fit onto the span, considering the most critical
       assigned aircraft operating at its maximum gross weight. In no case, however, should the
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 123


       design be based on computed stress conditions less than those created by a wheel load of
       22,667 kg (50,000 lb) at a contact pressure of 1,724 kPa (250 psi).
6.19. Miscellaneous Apron Design Considerations. In addition to the apron design criteria,
consideration should be given to providing room for support structures, equipment (e.g., AGE,
hydrant refueling systems), and facilities.
   6.19.1. Jet Blast Deflectors. Jet blast deflectors will substantially reduce the damaging
   effects of jet blast on structures, equipment and personnel, as well as the related noise and
   fumes associated with jet engine operation. Additional information on jet blast deflectors is
   found in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Sections 7 and 8.
   6.19.2. Line Vehicle Parking and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE). Line vehicle
   and AGE parking areas are provided for parking of mobile station-assigned and squadron-
   assigned vehicles and AGE equipment. These areas must remain outside of the apron
   clearance. Additional information on line vehicle parking is found in UFC 3-260-01,
   Appendix B, Section 12.
   6.19.3. Utilities. The following items are normally found on parking aprons. These items
   are not a part of airfield geometric design. However, the designer needs to be aware that they
   are an integral part of a parking apron and should make provisions for them accordingly.
       6.19.3.1. Storm water runoff collection system including inlets, trench drains, manholes
       and pipe.
       6.19.3.2. De-icing facilities and de-icing runoff collection facilities (refer to the
       respective host nation’s FGS for environmental requirements. Where an FGS does not
       exist for a specific host nation, refer to the OEBGD).
       6.19.3.3. Apron illumination.
       6.19.3.4. Fire hydrants.
       6.19.3.5. Refueling facilities.
       6.19.3.6. Apron edge lighting.

corrected and pose little or no risk to flying operations. Such violations are typically caused by
natural topographic features. The Major Command Vice Commander (MAJCOM/CV) is the
approval authority for permanent waivers.
Waiver, Temporary—An airfield waiver established to address safety mitigation for correctable
obstructions or violations of other airfield criteria such as grades. MAJCOM/CV is the approval
authority for temporary waivers. These waivers require CV approval each year (continuous 12

  UNITED STATES AIR FORCES IN EUROPE (USAFE) AIRFIELD AND AIRSPACE
                         WAIVER PROGRAM

A2.1. Waivers to Criteria and Standards
   A2.1.1. When proposed objects, activities, or facilities will violate airfield imaginary
   surfaces, safe clearance, or other design criteria established in this instruction, they must be
   analyzed to determine potential impact to aircraft operations before construction activities
   begin. Waivers are processed when compliance with criteria cannot be achieved; the
   proposed object, activity or facility poses little or no risk to flying safety; and there are no
   other viable alternatives. For work executed through contract, waivers to criteria must be
   processed and approval obtained before construction or alteration contracts are issued. For
   work executed by Government personnel, waivers to criteria must be processed and approval
   obtained before construction or alterations of facilities begin. The Base Civil Engineer
   (BCE) initiates an airfield waiver request as soon as design indicates airfield criteria cannot
   be met and all alternatives have been exhausted. Facilities listed as permissible deviations
   (see UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 13, Deviation from Criteria for Air Force Airfield
   Support Facilities beginning at paragraph B13.2.) do not require a waiver if sited and
   constructed properly. The USAFE Vice Commander (USAFE/CV) may grant permissible
   deviation status for other airfield related facilities or systems that are unique to the command
   but must provide acceptable construction standards, siting criteria, and aircraft clearance
   requirements for such items.

         meets the minimum requirements of this instruction. It is recommended that waivers
         be presented at each AOB.
         A2.1.2.4.7. Establishes a procedure for recording, reviewing and acting on waivers.
         Maintains records similar to those required at HQ USAFE/A7P. For additional
         guidance on how to formalize waiver procedures, see paragraph A2.2.1.
         A2.1.2.4.8. Obtains a waiver from the Installation Commander for any construction
         projects and activity that violate any airfield clearance criteria during the construction
         project.

         Management. For ATSEP inspection checklist topics, see UFC 3-260-01, Appendix
         B, Section 4, Wind Coverage Studies.
  A2.1.3. When requesting a waiver for obstructions, consider grouping adjacent supporting
  items with a controlling obstruction (i.e. highest building) or grouping related items (i.e.
  series of cable markers). One obstruction that has different type violations (taxiway, runway,
  apron criteria) and not meeting height, color, and frangibility criteria cannot be grouped
  A2.1.4. Obstruction Classification in the Airfield Waiver Program. Airfield obstructions can
  be classified in one of six categories: Temporary Waiver, Permanent Waiver, Construction
  Waiver, Contingency Waiver, Permissible Deviation, or Unapproved Obstruction. Proper
  classification of airfield obstructions is the first step towards establishing a competent airfield
  waiver program.
  A2.1.5. Obstruction Classification by Category.
     A2.1.5.1. Temporary Waivers.
         A2.1.5.1.1. Establish temporary waivers for correctable obstructions. Examples of
         correctable obstructions include manholes, junction boxes, poles.
         A2.1.5.1.2. The BCE's representative prepares temporary waiver requests and obtains
         coordination from airfield operations (AM, TERPS and ATC), flying and ground
         safety, flight operations, logistics, security forces, and communications before
         submitting the waiver request to USAFE through the Installation Commander. These
         requests are then processed for coordination with the same functional offices at
         command level, and are approved or disapproved by the USAFE/CV.
         A2.1.5.1.3. The Installation Commander will ensure an Operational Risk
         Management (ORM) Assessment is performed according to Attachment 3, Risk
         Management (RM) for Airfield Obstructions and Waiver Requests, of this instruction
         on all proposed waiver requests prior to submission to HQ USAFE for their review
         and action.
         A2.1.5.1.4. Effective Length of Waiver. Temporary waivers are valid for one year
         only (twelve continuous months) after USAFE/CV approval. Any extension of a
148                                                     USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


         temporary waiver beyond one year requires re-approval from USAFE/CV. BCE must
         resubmit a temporary waiver request following the procedures in paragraph A2.3.1.
      A2.1.5.2. Permanent Waivers.
         A2.1.5.2.1. Establish permanent waivers for violations that cannot reasonably be
         corrected or removed and pose little or no threat to flying operations. Examples of
         cases where permanent waivers are appropriate include violations caused by natural
         geographic features, development of facilities where the US has no authority to
         implement USAFE standards, or structures on non-DoD controlled land.
         A2.1.5.2.2. The BCE's representative prepares permanent waiver requests and
         obtains coordination from airfield operations (AM, TERPS and ATC), flying and
         ground safety, flight operations, logistics, security forces and communications, before
         submitting the waiver request to HQ USAFE through the Installation Commander.
         These requests are then processed for coordination with the same functional offices at
         command level, and are approved or disapproved by the USAFE/CV.
         A2.1.5.2.3. The Installation Commander will ensure an ORM Assessment is
         performed according to Attachment 3 of this instruction on all proposed waiver
         requests prior to submission to HQ USAFE for their review and action.
         A2.1.5.2.4. Permanent waivers may require approval or coordination from the Air
         Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) and the Air Force Safety Agency when AFI
         32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields or UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation
         Facilities standards apply because deviation from these standards may also affect
         runway approach minima.
         A2.1.5.2.5. Effective Length of Waiver. Permanent waivers do not require an annual
         submittal, they will be reviewed biennially during the Air Traffic System Evaluation
         (ATSEP) inspection process. For more information about the ATSEP process and its
         impact on the airfield waiver program, see Attachment 5.
      A2.1.5.3. Construction Waivers.
         A2.1.5.3.1. Establish construction waivers to identify, coordinate and approve
         construction activity on or near the airfield. The Installation Commander or
         equivalent is the construction waiver approval authority for an installation.
         Construction waivers apply to airfield systems, facilities and on base facilities where
         construction will require equipment (e.g. trucks, cranes, bull dozers, conduit spools,
         etc.) that may adversely and temporarily affect flying operations. Construction
         waivers can be used to correct or remove temporarily waivered obstructions that
         violate criteria in this instruction by a funded contract or in-house personnel
         Construction waivers must be obtained prior to start of construction activities.
         A2.1.5.3.2. The BCE's representative prepares construction waiver requests and
         obtains coordination from airfield operations (AM, TERPS and ATC), flying and
         ground safety, flight operations, logistics and security forces and communications as
         required, before submitting the waiver request to the Installation Commander for
         approval or disapproval.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 149


        A2.1.5.3.3. The BCE, in cooperation with Wing Safety and AM, will ensure an ORM
        Assessment is performed according to Attachment 3 of this instruction on all
        proposed construction waiver requests prior to submission to the Installation
        Commander for approval.
        A2.1.5.3.4. Effective Length of Waiver. Construction waivers are valid for one year
        (twelve continuous months) from their effective date or for the duration of the
        construction project, whichever is less. For projects/efforts greater than one year, a
        request for extension must be submitted to the Installation Commander.
        A2.1.5.3.5. Construction Waiver Review. Construction activities will be monitored
        at least monthly, by Civil Engineers (CE), Flight Safety and AM to ensure all
        information contained in the construction waiver remains accurate. Construction
        activities often change from the original plan and must be reevaluated to ensure there
        is no change in the level of risk; also mitigation efforts must be reevaluated for their
        effectiveness during construction. A review process is also required at the start of
        each project phase.
     A2.1.5.4. Contingency Waivers.
        A2.1.5.4.1. Establish contingency waivers when real-world contingencies require an
        installation to operate beyond the criteria in this instruction. Contingency waivers
        may waive the following criteria: wingtip clearances, apron clearance, taxiway
        clearance and the 7:1 transitional slope. A contingency waiver cannot waive the
        following criteria: primary surface, priority area (PA) 1, mandatory frangibility zone
        (MFZ), clear zone and approach departure clearance surface.
        A2.1.5.4.2. The BCE and Airfield Operations representatives prepare contingency
        waiver requests and obtains coordination from TERPS, ATC, flying and ground
        safety, flight operations, logistics, security forces, and communications as required,
        before submitting the waiver request to the Installation Commander for approval or
        disapproval.
        A2.1.5.4.3. The BCE, in cooperation with Wing Safety and AM, will ensure an ORM
        Assessment is performed on all proposed contingency waiver requests in accordance
        with Attachment 3 of this instruction prior to submission to the Installation
        Commander for approval.
        A2.1.5.4.4. Effective Length of Waiver. Locally approved contingency waivers are
        only valid for six months. For operations greater than six months, a temporary waiver
        request must be submitted to HQ USAFE through the Installation Commander.
     A2.1.5.5. Permissible Deviations.
        A2.1.5.5.1. Establish Permissible Deviations for airfield support facilities that are not
        required to meet airfield clearance criteria. However; they must meet siting criteria
        specified in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 13.
        A2.1.5.5.2. The BCE's representative prepares documentation to verify a facility or
        item was constructed in accordance with the criteria outlined in UFC 3-260-01,
        Appendix B, Section 13. Before an item can be classified as a permissible deviation,
        this documentation must be field verified by a representative from Civil Engineering
150                                                      USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


         and AM, approved by the BCE and the Operation Support Squadron Commander, and
         sent to the Installation Commander for approval.
         A2.1.5.5.3. Effective Length of Permissible Deviation. Permissible deviation status
         is effective for the life of the necessary airfield system. Permissible deviations will
         be reviewed biennially during the ATSEP inspection process. For more information
         about the ATSEP process and its impact on the airfield waiver program see UFC 3-
         260-01, Appendix B, Section 4.
      A2.1.5.6. Unapproved Obstructions.
         A2.1.5.6.1. Improvements in field surveys and digital mapping will lead to the
         occasional identification of an existing airfield obstruction. These items must be
         addressed at the time they are discovered. Ensure each item is properly classified and
         corrective action developed within 30 days of discovery.
  A2.1.6. Waiver Authority.
      A2.1.6.1. Temporary and Permanent Waivers. The USAFE/CV may grant permanent
      and temporary waivers for deviations from criteria in this instruction. The USAFE/CV
      approves or disapproves these waivers after coordination with all appropriate staff offices
      and concurrence by Directors of Air and Space Operations (HQ USAFE/A3); Logistics ,
      Installations and Mission Support (HQ USAFE/A4/7), Communications and Information
      (HQ USAFE/A6), Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFE/JA), Safety (HQ USAFE/SE),
      Security Forces Division (HQ USAFE/A7S), Programs Division (HQ USAFE/A7P), and
      Third Air Force (3 AF). In the event of a prolonged absence by USAFE/CV, waiver
      approval authority is delegated to HQ USAFE/A3. Temporary and permanent waiver
      authority is not delegated below Major Command (MAJCOM) level. The following are
      waiver classifications subject to local approval:
      A2.1.6.2. Permissible Deviations. Authority to classify an obstruction as a permissible
      deviation to airfield and airspace criteria is delegated to the Installation Commander
      provided the obstruction meets siting criteria listed in UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B,
      Section 13, beginning at paragraph B13.1.
         A2.1.6.2.1. Waiver approval is required according to AFI 11-230, when deviations
         from criteria in UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Facilities would constitute
         deviations from the instrument procedure criteria or obstructions to air navigational
         criteria in AFI 11-230 or AFMAN (I) 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal
         Instrument Procedures (TERPS).
      A2.1.6.3. Construction Waivers. Authority for deviations to the criteria in this
      instruction is delegated to the Installation Commander when temporary waivers for
      construction activities or air shows are necessary.
      A2.1.6.4. Contingency Waivers. Authority for deviations to the criteria in this
      instruction is delegated to the Installation Commander when real-world contingencies
      force installations to operate beyond the limits of the criteria established in this
      instruction. The Installation Commander is the approval authority for contingency
      waivers not exceeding six months. If a contingency waiver is needed for up to one year
      (twelve months), a temporary waiver request must be submitted to HQ USAFE through
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                               151


      the Installation Commander. If the contingency lasts longer than one year, contact HQ
      USAFE/A7P Community Planning for guidance. Contingency waivers may only be
      approved when requirements in paragraph A2.1.5.4 are met.
A2.2. Annual Waiver Review Procedures:
   A2.2.1. General annual waiver review procedures. The information in this section provides
   the minimal requirements for an annual airfield airspace waiver review process. There is an
   informal and formal annual submittal. The schedule in Table A2.1 describes the year
   required (e.g. odd or even) for each submittal listed by installation. Specific informal and
   formal submittal requirements are detailed in paragraph A2.2.1.3 It is recommended that
   each installation develop their own review procedures that meet the specific needs of their
   installation, provided these minimums are incorporated. The annual review of airfield
   airspace waivers can be a time consuming event for installations with numerous waivers. It
   is recommended that the BCE utilize the AFM’s quarterly airfield inspection to verify
   approved waivers. The BCE is a required member of the quarterly airfield inspection and
   should utilize the inspection to track changes in approved waivers. Noted changes to
   approved waivers should receive USAFE approval prior to being incorporated on the E-1
   map. At a minimum, the E-1 map must be updated annually. The annual airfield airspace
   waiver package is not the forum for requesting new waivers. New waivers are requested
   individually at the time of their discovery.

A2.3. Requirements for Requesting/Processing Temporary or Permanent Waivers to Airfield
and Airspace Criteria. The information in this section provides the minimal requirements for a
request to airfield airspace criteria. New waivers must be requested individually at the time of
their discovery, as indicated in A2.1.1 above. For new construction, a waiver must be obtained
prior to construction. If a waiver is approved with conditions, those conditions must be
incorporated into the facility’s design.
   A2.3.1. Temporary and Permanent Airfield Airspace Waiver Request Package
   Requirements. This information provides the minimal data necessary to request a waiver to
   the criteria of this instruction. In the future, it is possible that airfield obstructions/waivers
   could be eliminated. Civil Engineering must remain vigilant to preserve the safe operations

   RISK MANAGEMENT (RM) FOR AIRFIELD OBSTRUCTIONS AND WAIVER
                           REQUESTS

A3.1. Risk Management (RM).
   A3.1.1. RM provides a systematic way to identify and select control measures that do not
   rely simply on intuition and experience. It consists of three primary steps, namely: (1)
   hazard identification, (2) risk assessment, and (3) risk control. A Civil Engineering (CE)
   representative will be the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the RM process for
   airfield obstructions, with Safety and Airfield Management (AM) acting as Offices of
   Collateral Responsibility (OCRs). However, the OPR and the OCRs must collaborate to
   complete the RM.
       A3.1.1.1. RM is defined as a logic-based, common-sense approach to making calculated
       decisions on human, material and environmental factors before, during and after
       potentially dangerous activity, both on and off duty. RM has played an ever-increasing
       role in the airfield waiver process. Currently, all airfield waiver requests require an RM
       assessment be completed prior to submittal to USAFE. The material in this attachment is
       designed to: (1) assist base personnel with RM guidelines as they pertain to the airfield
       environment, and (2) provide examples of RM assessments for different types of waiver
       packages.
       A3.1.1.2. When discussing RM, it is important to understand the difference between
       hazard and risk. The hazard is the condition; it only becomes a risk when the hazard has
       been assessed for how likely it is to cause an accident (probability), and how severe that
       accident would be if the hazard did cause an accident (severity).
       A3.1.1.3. Airfield waivers require a full risk management assessment (Steps 1, 2, and 3)
       before submittal to HQ USAFE/A7P. Locally approved airfield waivers require only a
       risk assessment (Step 2) prior to Installation Commander approval.
   A3.1.1.4. To be a systematic process, there must be tools to use that will provide a
   reasonable assurance that all hazards have been identified. The amount of time available will
   be 1suited to a particular operation than others.
          A3.1.1.4.1. Operations Analysis. An operational analysis is a list of the major steps
          of an operation, usually listed in chronological order. The idea is to use this as a
          checklist to make sure you identify the hazards in each phase of an operation. This
          tool is used in virtually all risk management operations to include the most time
          critical.
          A3.1.1.4.2. Scenario Building. Scenario building involves mentally visualizing what
          will occur during each phase of an operation. Then, visualize the operation again
          including the things that can go wrong and noting the outcomes. This will help to
          identify hazards that must be addressed. Because of its simplicity, this tool should be
          included in most hazard identification applications to include some time-critical
          situations.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                               159


         A3.1.1.4.3. Change Analysis. The change analysis tool is used to detect the hazard
         implications of both planned and unplanned changes to a process. This allows the
         risk management process to focus only on aspects that have changed, eliminating the
         need to reanalyze a total operation just because a change has occurred in one area.
         This tool can save a great deal of effort in those situations where a process has
         already been risk managed; thus there is focus on the changes rather than the whole
         operation.
         A3.1.1.4.4. What If. What if asks what could go wrong and what hazards would
         show up as a result. It is designed to add structure to the intuitive and experimental
         expertise of personnel. One of the most powerful and effective of the hazard
         identification tools.
         A3.1.1.4.5. Logic Diagram. The logic diagram tool is used to add detail and rigor to
         the hazard identification process. Its graphic structure is an excellent means of
         capturing and correlating the hazard data produced by other tools. Because it is more
         structured than some of the other tools, the logic diagram requires more time and
         effort to complete, limiting its use to higher risk issues.
      A3.1.1.5. The Three Step USAFE RM Process.
         A3.1.1.5.1. Step One, Identify the Hazard. Figure A3.1 breaks down the origins of
         risk. When looking for the hazards of an operation, each of these areas should be
         broken down to its component parts and used as a tool to help identify conditions that
         could cause a hazard. Start with the given mission. The five-M model is composed
         of man, machine, media, mission and management. A man uses a machine, which is
         operated in some media to accomplish the mission. All of the components are
         affected by management who sets the rules, goals and expectations for mission
         accomplishment.

         A3.1.1.5.2. Step Two, Risk Assessment. A key part of the RM process is conducting
         a two-part risk assessment. This step assigns each hazard a risk code (value) so that a
         list can be developed that has the highest risk at the top. Figure A3.2 is the standard
         4x5 risk assessment matrix used by the USAF. The risk assessment matrix is used to
         quantify hazards and make them risks.

Figure A3.2. Risk Assessment Matrix.




             A3.1.1.5.2.1. Severity and Probability are used to determine the risk level
             (extremely high, high, medium and low). Each hazard will have a Roman
             numeral and a letter associated with it, which defines its risk level.
             A3.1.1.5.2.2. Severity. Severity describes how much damage could occur if a
             hazard results in a mishap. Standard RM terms associated with severity are:
                A3.1.1.5.2.2.1. Catastrophic    -   Mission    impossible,   system    loss   or
                death/permanent disability.
                A3.1.1.5.2.2.2. Critical - Mission impaired, major system damage, or
                permanent or partial disability.
                A3.1.1.5.2.2.3. Moderate - Mission possible using alternate options, minor
                system damage or minor injury.
                A3.1.1.5.2.2.4. Negligible - Minor mission disruptions, minor system
                impairment or first aid required.
             A3.1.1.5.2.3. Probability. Probability describes the frequency of a mishap caused
             by a hazard. Standard RM terms associated with probability are:
                A3.1.1.5.2.3.1. Frequent - Occurs often-in career or equipment service life.
                Everyone exposed.
                A3.1.1.5.2.3.2. Likely - Occurs several times in a career or equipment life.
                Most members exposed, occurrence predictable.
                A3.1.1.5.2.3.3. Occasional - Occurs sometime in career or in life of
                equipment. Sporadically.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                161


               A3.1.1.5.2.3.4. Seldom - Possible to occur in career or equipment life.
               Remote chance.
               A3.1.1.5.2.3.5. Unlikely - Assume it will never occur.             Possible but
               improbable.
        A3.1.1.5.3. Step Three, Risk Controls. The third and final step of the USAFE RM
        process is the identification and implementation of controls for each hazard identified,
        starting with the greatest risk. Each risk control must be evaluated for its ability to
        reduce or eliminate the risk and the cost to implement the control measure and for its
        impact to the severity and probability of the risk.
           A3.1.1.5.3.1. General risk controls are accepted when the benefits outweigh the
           cost. There are multiple ways to control risk. The list below provides some
           common examples of risk controls.
               A3.1.1.5.3.1.1. Reduce - An operation is made up of many tasks.              The
               operation can be made less risky by reducing some of the tasks.
               A3.1.1.5.3.1.2. Avoid - Go around the threat, wait for a more opportune time
               to attack the risk.
               A3.1.1.5.3.1.3. Spread - Risk can be spread by dispersing assets. An example
               is the spacing of munitions storage facilities or dispersing tactical aircraft
               across an airfield to reduce the threat of loss from an enemy attack.
               A3.1.1.5.3.1.4. Transfer - Risk can be transferred by using a machine to move
               the risk away from man. Risk may also be transferred by utilizing a different
               operation to accomplish a specific mission.
           A3.1.1.5.3.2. Hierarchy of Controls. Below are the specific control measures in
           priority order. If a hazard is engineered out of a system, it is gone. Compare that
           to giving up on controlling the hazard and simply wearing protective equipment to
           minimize the damage.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.1. Engineer - Design a better method/machine.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.2. Guard or Control - Yellow line/red line guard switch.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.3. Limit Exposure - Provide adequate safe distance.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.4. Selection of Personnel.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.5. Procedures - Rules, restrictions, limitations.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.6. Training and Education.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.7. Warn.
               A3.1.1.5.3.2.8. Reduce Effects - Provide safety equipment.
           A3.1.1.5.3.3. Risk Control Implementation. It is important that the control
           measures be implemented in a way that is appropriate and understood. To make
           the implementation directive clear, consider using examples, providing pictures or
           charts and including job aids. Also, be clear on who should be responsible at the
           unit level for implementation. These should include the level of responsibility for
 162                                                     USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


             making decisions relative to the control measure to establish accountability.
             A3.1.1.5.3.4. Risk Control Accountability. Accountability is an important area of
             RM. The accountable person is the one who makes the decision (approves the
             controls) and hence, the right person (appropriate level) must make the decision.
             But most important, having the appropriately documented RM analysis will help
             the decision maker explain their actions and decisions. Some probability of a
             mishap always exists unless the control measure selected is to not conduct the
             operation. Table A3.1 illustrates the success rate for implementation of a control
             from best to worst.

Table A3.1. The Involvement Continuum
                                User Ownership              Best

             A3.1.1.5.3.5. Participation. Table A3.1 shows the importance of workers
             developing their own controls using RM and deciding to implement it. If people
             are simply ordered to comply and inspections put in place to ensure compliance, it
             is likely that the long-term success of the implementation will be low. Risk
             control implementation must:
                 A3.1.1.5.3.5.1. Obtain Command Support - To be successful, command must
                 be behind the control put in place. Prior to implementing a control, get
                 higher-level approval. Then, explore the appropriate ways to demonstrate
                 command commitment.
                 A3.1.1.5.3.5.2. Communicate - The control must be deployed in a method
                 that insures it will be received by the intended audience. Also, the control
                 must be communicated in a way that is understandable by the user. In the
                 initial phase of the process, careful thought should be given to the design of
                 the controls to ensure it will last the length of the project.
                 A3.1.1.5.3.5.3. Measure the Effect - Deploy the controls along with a
                 feedback mechanism that provides information back on whether the controls
                 are achieving the intended purpose. This can best be achieved by designing
                 the controls to include user ownership.       Measure the effect of the
                 implementation where possible.
A3.2. RM Process for Airfield Airspace Waiver Packages (Example)
   A3.2.1. The purpose of integrating RM into the airfield waiver process is to identify the
   hazard (obstruction), analyze the risk (risk assessment), implement controls (safety
   precautions) and reevaluate the controls (corrective action). The RM process applies to
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                163


  temporary, permanent and temporary-construction waiver requests. The following example
  is of an RM analysis representing a temporary airfield waiver request for a perimeter road
  project.
  A3.2.2. Temporary Waiver Request (Example). For this example a project is constructing a
  perimeter road that will violate clear zone and apron criteria. A RM assessment is performed
  as part of the temporary waiver request as required in Attachment 2. Using the three-step
  process this example outlines the minimal requirements for a risk assessment submitted as
  part of a waiver request to HQ USAFE/A7P.
     A3.2.2.1. RM Assessment for Perimeter Road Project. Background. The Perimeter
     Road Project is a Fiscal Year (FY) 50 Military Construction (MILCON) project that will
     construct a perimeter road around the airfield. The current base boundary lies within the
     runway and apron clearance zones, therefore the perimeter road will violate these two
     airfield clearances. Utilizing RM will facilitate assessing the risk involved in
     constructing the road at its proposed location. The long-range plan to correct this hazard
     is to acquire land and relocate the base boundary and perimeter road outside of the
     airfield clearances.
         A3.2.2.1.1. Step 1. Identify hazards associated with constructing the perimeter road
         in the runway and apron clear zones:
             A3.2.2.1.1.1. Aircraft mishap (lands short and hits vehicle or pedestrian).
             A3.2.2.1.1.2. Aircraft mishap (exits runway on departure and hits vehicle or
             pedestrian).
             A3.2.2.1.1.3. Aircraft mishap (aircraft ingests foreign object damage (FOD)
             resulting from vehicular traffic near apron).
             A3.2.2.1.1.4. Equipment mishap (vehicle departs road and damages Navigational
             Aid).
         A3.2.2.1.2. Step 2. Assess the risk of each identified hazard then develop an overall
         risk level for the project.
             A3.2.2.1.2.1. Assessment for Aircraft Mishap (landing short striking vehicle or
             pedestrian).
             A3.2.2.1.2.2. Severity. If an aircraft did land short, for whatever reason, and did
             strike a vehicle or pedestrian, the resulting accident would be catastrophic. There
             would certainly be system loss (aircraft damage) and possible loss of life or
             permanent disability.
             A3.2.2.1.2.3. Probability. USAF pilots are professionals and receive training to
             handle emergency situations, therefore it is unlikely that a pilot would cause the
             aircraft to land short and cause a mishap.
                A3.2.2.1.2.3.1. Landing short striking vehicle score = I-E.

             A3.2.2.1.2.4. Assessment for Aircraft Mishap (exiting runway at departure end
             and striking vehicle or pedestrian).
             A3.2.2.1.2.5. Severity. If an aircraft did exit the runway, for whatever reason,
             and did strike a vehicle or pedestrian, the resulting accident would be
             catastrophic. There would certainly be system loss (aircraft damage) and possible
             loss of life or permanent disability.
             A3.2.2.1.2.6. Probability. USAF pilots are professionals and receive training to
             handle emergency situations. Runway 18/36 is equipped with 305 m (1000 ft)
             overruns and redundant BAK-12 aircraft arresting systems. On average, the
             overrun barrier is engaged once every 5 years. Pilot skill and the in-place safety
             features of Runway 18/36 provides for an unlikely exiting of the runway at the
             departure end resulting in an aircraft mishap.
                A3.2.2.1.2.6.1. Exiting runway at departure end and striking vehicle or
                pedestrian = I-E.

             A3.2.2.1.2.7. Assessment for Aircraft Mishap (ingests FOD resulting from
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                165


             vehicular traffic near apron).
             A3.2.2.1.2.8. Severity. When an aircraft ingests FOD it is possible for the engine
             to sustain damage. If the damage is immediate the engine could be destroyed and
             prevent the aircraft from accomplishing its mission. Engine damage is major
             system damage. The resultant mishap would be critical.
             A3.2.2.1.2.9. Probability. Our maintenance crews, safety personnel and airfield
             managers (AFMs) are professionals and follow an installation approved FOD
             control plan that has all but eliminated FOD incidents at this installation. It is
             recognized that the FOD plan must be modified to incorporate the new perimeter
             road and therefore is not applicable to this assessment. Given the distance of the
             perimeter road from the apron and dedication of installation leadership and the
             airfield crew, it is unlikely that an aircraft would experience FOD damage and
             cause a mishap.
                A3.2.2.1.2.9.1. Ingesting FOD and damaging aircraft = II-E.

             A3.2.2.1.2.10. Assessment for Vehicular Mishap (vehicle departs perimeter road
             and strikes navigational aid).
             A3.2.2.1.2.11. Severity. Speed limits on perimeter road are set at 50 KPH and
             navigational aids (NAVAIDS) on our airfield are frangible and obstruction lit. If
             a vehicle departed the perimeter road and struck a nearby navigational aid there
             would be minor systems damage to the NAVAIDS and possibly minor injury to
             the vehicle operator resulting in moderate overall damage.
             A3.2.2.1.2.12. Probability. The probability of a vehicle departing the perimeter
             road is occasional. Poor visibility from less than desirable weather conditions has
             caused two Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) to depart other portions of the
             perimeter road in the last 5 years.
                A3.2.2.1.2.12.1. Vehicle striking navigational aid = III-C.

            A3.2.2.1.2.13. Overall risk rating for project = Medium.
         A3.2.2.1.3. Step 3. Risk Controls. The requirements for a perimeter road and the
         unavailability of land, dictate the perimeter road be sited in the proposed location,
         therefore we cannot avoid, spread or transfer the risk. The only appropriate controls
         are to reduce the risk by implementing the following:
            A3.2.2.1.3.1. Engineer - The proposed perimeter road site is located as far from
            the runway end and apron edge as possible. NAVAIDS near the perimeter road
            are frangible and obstruction lit.
            A3.2.2.1.3.2. Guard or Control - Traffic control lights have been integrated into
            the perimeter road design. These ―stop lights‖ are controlled by the tower and
            will halt vehicular traffic when aircraft are taking off or landing on the runway.
            A3.2.2.1.3.3. Limit Exposure - Traffic control lights are located outside of the
            runway clear zones and are frangible. NAVAIDS are set back from the perimeter
            road as far as possible and are frangible.
            A3.2.2.1.3.4. Selection of Personnel - N/A. We investigated limiting GOVs with
            flightline certified drivers to the perimeter road, however some community
            functions are only accessible only via the perimeter road therefore we cannot limit
            access to flightline certified drivers in GOVs.
            A3.2.2.1.3.5. Procedures - Traffic control lights contain an information sign
            requiring drivers to stop when lights are red. Traffic light information has been
            posted on the installation website and been passed to squadron orderly rooms for
            dissemination. A local Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) has been published to inform
            operators of the control lights.
            A3.2.2.1.3.6. Training and Education - Traffic control lights are briefed to all
            new arrivals at the base new comers briefing.
            A3.2.2.1.3.7. Warn. Information signs warning of the hazards of low flying
            aircraft are posted adjacent to the traffic control lights.
            A3.2.2.1.3.8. Reduce Effect - The only equipment provided with the perimeter
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 167


             road project is the traffic control lights.
             A3.2.2.1.3.9. Installation Commander has approved use traffic control lights on
             the perimeter road project. The traffic lights added $5,000 to the cost of the
             project and require $100/year for maintenance for the life of the waiver. Land
             acquisition is expected to take 10 years so the maintenance cost for the life of the
             control lights is expected to be $1,000 and is deemed an acceptable resource cost.
             A3.2.2.1.3.10. Risk Control Implementation. With Installation Commander
             approval, the BCE has incorporated the traffic control lights into the perimeter
             road project. Since the project is still in design and awaiting waiver approval, the
             traffic lights are on hold pending approval of the waiver and awarding of the
             construction project.
A3.3. Assessment. A RM assessment must be prepared, in cooperation, by CE, SE and OSS and
approved by the Installation Commander. Chief of Safety can approve RM assessments for
temporary construction waivers. If an Installation Commander approves a temporary
construction waiver, it is assumed that by doing that the Commander also endorses the risk
assessment.
A3.4. Review. The waiver OPR/OCR will review the on-going effectiveness of the approved
risk controls and make changes as deemed necessary and brief the Installation Commander of
any updates.

                                          Attachment 5
  CIVIL ENGINEER’S (CE) ROLE IN THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM EVALUATION
                          PROGRAM (ATSEP)

A5.1. Air Traffic System Evaluation Program (ATSEP). The ATSEP evaluates the ability of the
air traffic system to meet standards and operational requirements of civil and military users. All
USAFE and host nation locations (where USAF has functional responsibility) are subject to this
program. This attachment will briefly describe the ATSEP program and further define CE’s role
in the program. The ATSEP fulfills the portion of CE requirements under the Unit Compliance
Inspection (UCI) and shall not be duplicated.
A5.2. HQ USAFE/A3Y is responsible for scheduling, implementing, and reporting ATSEP
visits within USAFE.
A5.3. Objective. Analyze, from an operational viewpoint, the total air traffic system for safety,
compatibility and adequacy. Analyze and evaluate all pertinent areas that are a part of, or affect,
the air traffic system for compliance with regulatory guidance.
A5.4. Scope. Evaluate the quality of service and support (e.g., Weather, CE, Safety, Airspace
Management) provided to air traffic system users and compliance with standards by Air Traffic
Control (ATC), Airfield Management (AM) and Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems
(ATCALS) maintenance. Provide trend information and recommend system improvements.
A5.5. Scheduling Evaluations.
   A5.5.1. HQ USAFE will conduct ATSEPs where they have functional responsibility (to
   include host nation locations) for ATC, AM, CE or ATCALS. USAFE will forward a copy
   of their annual ATSEP schedule to Air Force Flight Standards Agency (HQ AFFSA/XAS) by
   1 August each year for planning and budgeting. USAFE will forward schedule changes to
   HQ AFFSA/XAS as they occur.
   A5.5.2. HQ USAFE/A3 will notify the Installation Commander, Operations Group
   Commander (OG/CC) or equivalent operational commander, and the Mission Support Group
   Commander (MSG/CC) of the scheduled evaluation not later than 60 days prior to the event.
   HQ USAFE/A3YA will notify base-level Operations Support, CE, and Communications
   squadron commanders by including them on the 60-day notification. This notification will
   include evaluation dates, a list of ATSEP team requirements (i.e., office space, computer
   support, and phones), a request for any locally identified items requiring special attention and
   ATSEP questionnaires, along with instructions for their distribution, completion and
   collection. The Installation Commander (or OG/CC or equivalent operational commander)
   and MSG/CC will acknowledge receipt and advise HQ USAFE/A3, not later than 30 days
   prior to scheduled evaluation date, of any requirements that cannot be met.
A5.6. Conducting the ATSEP Evaluation.
   A5.6.1. An evaluation will be conducted at each location at least once every 24 months.
   Follow the guidelines established in AFI 13-218_USAFESUP1, Air Traffic System
   Evaluation Program, using all applicable regulatory guidance and compliance checklists.
   Evaluators will: observe airfield operations, interview key personnel from wing organizations
   and adjacent airports, review local airfield procedures and documentation, conduct testing
 174                                                          USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012


   and evaluate ATCALS maintenance, Weather, CE and Safety support. HQ USAFE/A3
   ATCALS maintenance, CE, safety and weather personnel should participate as ATSEP team
   members to ensure an in-depth evaluation of system support functions.
   A5.6.2. There may be times when other functional evaluations, which also address ATSEP
   evaluated areas, are conducted simultaneously with an ATSEP (e.g., AF Weather Technical
   Standardization and Evaluation Program or Inspector General inspections). ATSEP
   evaluation frequency may be adjusted to support reducing the inspection ―footprint‖ if the
   ATSEP is combined with other inspection/evaluation programs (adjustment should be limited
   to plus 6 months or minus 12 months).
   A5.6.3. For any particular evaluation, the ATSEP team composition and scope of the
   evaluation will depend primarily on levels of USAF functional responsibility within that air
   traffic system. The ATSEP team will conduct an in-depth evaluation ranging from a
   comprehensive analysis of all air traffic system components and user satisfaction to
   completion of the compliance checklists.          Contact Programs Division, Plans and
   Requirements Branch (HQ USAFE/A7PP) Community of Practice (CoP) web site for the
   latest CE ATSEP checklist information at the following link:
https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-EN-
FE-08-8-1&Filter=OO-EN-FE-08.
A5.7. Evaluation Areas. Applicable USAF, (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) NATO,
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Host Nation and HQ USAFE requirements
will be thoroughly evaluated from an operational viewpoint. The following areas, as a
minimum, will be observed:
   A5.7.1. ATC operations.
   A5.7.2. Airspace management and configuration.
   A5.7.3. Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS, or PANSOPS in Germany).
   A5.7.4. Interface with adjoining air traffic facilities.
   A5.7.5. AM operations.
   A5.7.6. ATCALS support.
   A5.7.7. CE support of ATC, AM, ATCALS and TERPS requirements (i.e., CE Maps,
   airfield obstruction/waiver program, airfield signs/markings, auxiliary power, facility
   grounding/ lightning protection).
   A5.7.8. Safety awareness programs: public relations, Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA),
   and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) programs.
   A5.7.9. Weather Support (i.e., Cooperative Weather Watch and Tower Visibility Reporting).
   A5.7.10. Specialized requirements (local directives).
A5.8. Observations. Annotate deficiencies identified during this comprehensive analysis in the
ATSEP report as Observations. Observations are system deficiencies that clearly indicate actual
or potential flying mission impact or adversely affect flight safety. Each Observation must
contain the following elements:
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  175


   A5.8.1. Observation Statement. The Observation Statement must clearly state the deficiency
   and define the mission impact or safety of flight indicators.
   A5.8.2. Discussion.   The Discussion should contain information that supports the
   Observation. The Discussion is also the appropriate place to include unit or wing input.
   A5.8.3. Recommendation. The Recommendation should indicate any possible means to
   correct the deficiency and specifically address the agency/office best able to correct the
   deficiency. Recommendations will be based on previous successful actions to close
   Observations or best practices learned through experience.
A5.9. Special Interest Items (SII). Air Force Flight Standards Agency (HQ AFFSA/XA)
identifies annual ATSEP SIIs using the previous years’ ATSEP reports. Once SIIs have been
determined by HQ AFFSA/XA, the SIIs are coordinated with HQ USAFE to ensure validity.
AF-level SIIs will be evaluated using a checklist developed by HQ AFFSA/XAS. SII checklists
contain questions that should be used by units to conduct self-inspections. SIIs will be rated
either satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on the overall checklist. Because some of the
checklists must be evaluated subjectively, a single unsatisfactory question in the body of the SII
does not automatically render the entire SII unsatisfactory. However, if the answer to the most
fundamental question (e.g., ―Does a BASH program exist?‖) is no, the SII would be
unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory SIIs will be reported, tracked and closed in the same manner as
Observations. HQ USAFE may develop and manage USAFE-specific SIIs as deemed necessary.
A5.10. Key CE Support Areas. CE’s support of the airfield and its operations can make or
break an ATSEP inspection. Improvements in safety of airfield operations are the goal of the
ATSEP inspections. The ATSEP inspection of key CE programs will include:
   A5.10.1. Airfield Waiver Program. The identification, tracking and removal of airfield
   obstructions are the responsibility of CE. The airfield waiver program is the main device for
   improving the airfield environment. Key components (Airfield Obstruction Reduction
   Initiative, Airfield Waivers, Project Siting, Frangibility, etc) of the waiver program reviewed
   by ATSEP inspectors are found in the CE ATSEP checklist.
   A5.10.2. Airfield Lighting and Marking Program. Airfield lighting, markings and signs
   providing clear guidance for the movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and personnel on
   the airfield are paramount to safe operations. Areas reviewed by ATSEP inspectors are
   found in the AM (Airfield Portion) ATSEP checklist. Consult the HQ USAFE/A7PP CoP
   site     at    the    following    link:    https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/
   DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-EN-FE-08-8-1&Filter=OO-EN-FE-08.
   A5.10.3. Mapping Support. Several of the OSS offices under inspection require current CE
   maps to perform their jobs. The following is a list of maps that should be made available to
   the AFM, Operational Support Squadron (OSS), TERPS and Safety on an annual basis:
       A5.10.3.1. Current C, E, and M series maps.
           A5.10.3.1.1. C-1 Installation Layout.
           A5.10.3.1.2. C-2 Off-Installation.
           A5.10.3.1.3. C-3 Regional Location.
           A5.10.3.1.4. C-4 Vicinity Location.

         A5.10.3.1.13. M-3 Long Range Development Plan.
  A5.10.4. Snow and Ice Removal Plan. ATSEP inspectors will review the snow and ice
  removal plan to validate the plan’s currency and effectiveness. It is important that CE show
  participation in the development of this plan.
  A5.10.5. Participation in the BASH Program. CE is responsible for participating in the
  BASH program, as BASH control measures involve CE support. ATSEP inspectors will
  review the BASH plan for effectiveness and CE involvement.
  A5.10.6. Airfield Systems Support. CE Operations provides most of CE’s daily support to
  OSS by ensuring the airfield critical systems are operational. Key areas reviewed during the
  ATSEP process are:
      A5.10.6.1. Generator / Emergency Power Support. Ensure emergency power generators
      are fully functional and are sized for the correct load. Aircraft Arresting System Support
      / Certification. Ensures aircraft arresting systems are in compliance and required
      maintenance is being conducted.
      A5.10.6.2. Airfield Pavement Inspections. Ensures airfield pavement inspections are
      made with Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency’s (AFCESA’s) pavement evaluation
      plan.
      A5.10.6.3. Airfield Sweeper Support. Ensures there is appropriate sweeper support.
      A5.10.6.4. Lightning Protection Systems and Grounding of ATCALS facilities. Ensures
      ATCALS facilities have adequate lightning protection and grounding.
USAFEI32-1007 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 177

 AIRFIELD CRITERIA AND WAIVER PROCESSING PROCEDURES FOR GERMAN
                    MAIN OPERATING BASES (MOBS)

A6.1. Air Traffic Act Permit (ATAP). Ramstein AB and Spangdahlem AB operate under
approved ATAP agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the USAF.
These agreements implement a modified set of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) criteria for Ramstein AB and
Spangdahlem AB. This attachment is intended to provide Ramstein and Spangdahlem personnel
with guidance on applicable airfield criteria, waiver processing procedures, and new construction
siting information.
A6.2. Applicable Airfield Criteria. The ATAP for each installation implements a modified
ICAO criteria for the runway surfaces and NATO criteria for aprons, parallel taxiway/emergency
runways, and taxitracks. Many of the ICAO clearance surfaces evolve from the Aerodrome
Reference Point (ARP). The ARP for each installation is defined in the ATAP and must be used
for surface calculation and obstruction evaluation. The following information is intended as
guidance. A copy of the approved ATAP is available from USAFE Programs Division Office
(HQ USAFE/A7P).
     A6.2.1. Ramstein AB. Obstacles violating the criteria in Table A6.1 must be reported to
     HQ USAFE/A7PP and AFSBw. Airfield obstructions must be marked and lighted according
     to ICAO Annex 14 and NATO standards.
        A6.2.1.1. ARP:

Note: Taxilane clearances will be determined by taking the greater of either item (a) or (b).

   A6.2.5. Runway Strip Strength. The strength along the graded parts of the runway strip
   from the center line of the runway and its extended center line should be so prepared or
   constructed as to minimize hazards arising from differences in load-bearing capacity to
   airplanes which the runway is intended to serve in the event of an airplane running off the
   runway. Additionally, the strip shall be prepared to prevent the landing gear of aircraft using
   the runway from sinking more than 15 cm (5.9 inches (in)). The graded portion of the strip
   that is required to meet these strength criteria is presented in Figure A6.1 on the next page.
   A6.2.6. Exceptions (waivers) to these criteria require AFSBw and HQ USAFE approval.
   Process waivers according to Attachment 2. USAFE bases will coordinate waiver requests
   with AFSBw before submitting them to HQ USAFE/A7P.
