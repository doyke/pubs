                                                  INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will assist
Surgical Service Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks. The tasks are
broken down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming proficient with the
tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the trainee’s duty
position (items identified in the CFETP as core tasks are mandatory), then determine the order in which you want the
trainee to learn about each subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the
objective of each module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time
to learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be
evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each
objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training
record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is
met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module. After the trainer has ensured and documented that the
trainee is qualified to perform the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will meet Air
Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). We value your
expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have suggestions for its improvement, or if
you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please let us know about them by contacting the
below individual.

      2. Wrap sterile gauze sponge around break-point of ampule
      3. Pointing away from self and others, "snap" top from bottom; discard sponge
          and ampule top properly
      4. Using syringe (with volume equal or greater than ampule) and large-diameter
          (18-20ga) needle, insert needle into neck of ampule and withdraw solution
      NOTE: Local policy in some hospitals requires use of special filter-needles to
          reduce likelihood of withdrawing small glass fragments into syringe.
      5. Remove needle and discard properly; use new needle for actual administration
          of drug/solution
e. Withdrawing drugs from vials
      1. If powdered, the medication is mixed per manufacturer instructions before
          being withdrawn
      2. Remove metal protective cap from rubber diaphragm
      3. Wipe diaphragm with antiseptic per local policy
      4. Using syringe (with volume equal to or greater than vial) and large bore (18-
          20ga) needle:
          a. Carefully remove protective cap from needle
          b. Pull syringe plunger back until volume of air in syringe equals volume of
              solution being withdrawn
          c. Insert needle through rubber diaphragm and inject air

          d. Keeping needle tip immersed, withdraw desired volume


5. Remove needle and discard properly; use new needle for actual administration of
   drug/solution
