1. General. Aircrews will use the briefing guides and checklists
applicable to their mission. The general aircrew or mission
briefing will be accomplished for all flights. Specialized briefings
will be accomplished prior to accomplishing the associated event.
Flight leads will conduct a formation debrief. Carry this
information in the US Air Force flight crew checklist.

2. Use of Briefing Guides. Tailor the briefing to the applicable
mission or event. Brief only the applicable items in a logical
sequence.

3. Supplements and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
Units may supplement this publication with additional briefing
guides or checklists. Units may publish SOPs to describe
standards for accomplishing steps in checklists. Units will
forward proposed supplements and SOPs to the MAJCOM
