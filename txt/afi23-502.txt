This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 23-2, Management of US Air
Force Bulk Petroleum and Related Products. It establishes goals, assigns responsibilities, and
provides guidance for recoverable fuel (Jet, AVGAS, Unleaded, Diesel and Heating Oil). It
requires HQ USAF to provide oversight and active duty, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard
(ANG), and subordinate activities to establish and implement operating and accounting
procedures in connection with recovering or disposing of these products. At Air Force
government-owned, government-operated (GOGO) locations, or government-owned, contractor-
operated (GOCO) locations, government/contract personnel manage the recovery and disposal of
fuels products according to prevailing federal, state, local, and host nation laws. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). DLA Energy requires Defense Working
Capital Fund (DWCF) records be maintained IAW DLA Energy P-3, Document/Data Control
and Retention. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, and route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all (direct supplements)
(Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit
(DRU) supplements) must be routed to AF/A4LE for coordination prior to certification and
approval. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified
with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, or T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See Air Force

collecting, storing, returning to inventory, reclaiming, reusing, and disposing of all recoverable
and/or waste fuel generated on the base. The program must be environmentally consistent with
effective energy conservation, property management, quality control principles, and sound
economics. At a minimum, the program must include:

    designating pick up locations and verifying pick up quantities. (T-3)
    3.2.6. Stress sound conservation and property management of waste products and the on-
    base reclamation of fuel products. The priorities for reclaiming or disposing of products are:

             INVENTORY CONTROL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

4.1. General Guidelines. Recoverable fuel represents a significant economic resource.
Endeavor to collect, segregate, and reclaim on-specification fuel to recoup product value or to
reuse IAW T.O. 42B-1-23. The FMF's Fuels Service Center (FSC) performs inventory control
and product accountability procedures for R&W fuel.
   4.1.1. Credit reclaimed aviation fuel, non-fly aviation fuel, and ground fuel returned as the
   original grade to bulk fuels storage at the DoD standard price to the aircraft or organization
   from which the fuel was collected. When multiple agencies contribute to a central collection
   point, credit the fuel on a percentage basis to each organization. Follow DoD 4140.25-M and
   DLA Energy P-7, Accountability and Custodial Responsibilities for Defense Working Capital
   Fund (DWCF) Inventory and Government Property for Defense Working Capital Fund
   (DWCF) fuel.
   4.1.2. Account for aviation fuel, non-fly aviation fuel, and ground fuel returned to bulk fuels
   storage in a grade different from its original grade through procedures outlined in DoD
   4140.25-M, T.O. 42B-1-1, Quality Control of Fuels and Lubricants, and the following:
       4.1.2.1. Fuel analysis must be performed by the Aerospace Fuels Laboratory prior to
       regrading, downgrading, or blending of recovered fuel. Once analysis is completed,
       written approval is required from DLA Energy-QA via AFPA IAW T.O. 42B-1-23. (T-
       0)
   4.1.3. Products that cannot be returned to base inventory, used in a secondary application on-
   base, or transferred to other DoD activities for reuse are considered surplus products and may
   be eligible for disposition by the DLA Disposition Services.
   4.1.4. Reprocessing may be a viable alternative for off-specification fuel not suitable for
   downgrading. FMF investigates the potential for reprocessing large quantities of off-
   specification fuel in coordination with AFPA, DLA Energy, and base contracting function.
       4.1.4.1. Forward requests to fund the reprocessing of DWCF fuel to AFPA. AFPA will
       review and forward to DLA Energy to determine feasible vendor and location. (T-2)
       4.1.4.2. The installation bears the reprocessing costs for non-capitalized fuel. (T-0)
       4.1.4.3. Research the local commercial refining or reprocessing capability.
          4.1.4.3.1. Compare the costs to reprocess the product with the costs to purchase the
          new product, including the costs to dispose of the unusable product.
   4.1.5. Fuel not returned to base storage, reused on-base, or at other DoD installations and
   deemed not suitable for AF use will be managed IAW the base Hazardous Waste
   Management Plan. Properly identify these products on appropriate item records and dispose
   of IAW the base Hazardous Waste Management Plan. (T-3)
       4.1.5.1. Dispose of recoverable fuel through DLA Disposition Services once disposition
       is approved by Fuels Management Flight and Air Force Petroleum Office. (T-3)
10                                                           AFI23-502 31 OCTOBER 2014


     4.1.5.2. Each installation will properly credit proceeds from the sale of recoverable fuel
     to the U.S. Treasury. (T-0)
