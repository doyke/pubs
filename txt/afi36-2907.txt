        2.2.7.1. If the senior Air Force officer or commander of the member's element is not
        available or is junior to the commander who imposed the punishment, the GCMCA of the
        Air Force command decides whether to establish a UIF.
        2.2.7.2. If the Air Force host command does not have a GCMCA who is senior to the
        commander who imposed punishment, a senior general court-martial authority of the Air
        Force decides.
2.3. Initiating UIF actions.
     2.3.1. For officers, commanders on G-series orders refer optional documents (LOAs or
     LOCs) to the offending member along with an AF Form 1058 before establishing a UIF.
     Mandatory UIF documents (Article 15s, court-martial or civilian court convictions) are not
     referred via AF Form 1058. LORs are mandatory for file in an officer’s UIF, and must be
     entered into the UIF via AF Form 1058, but the commander does not need to submit the AF
     Form 1058 to the officer. The officer is provided an opportunity to respond to the LOR when
     it is initially presented (see paragraph 2.3.4)
     2.3.2. For enlisted members, commanders on G-series orders refer optional documents
     LOAs, LOCs, or LORs to the offending member along with an AF Form 1058 before
     establishing an UIF. Do not use AF Form 1058 if you file an optional Article 15 in the UIF.
     Note: Mandatory UIF documents (Article 15s with punishment exceeding 1 month {31 days
     or more}, court-martial or civilian court convictions) are not referred via AF Form 1058.
     2.3.3. For Non-extended active duty Airmen (non-EAD), Reservists and ANG Drill Status
     Guardsmen (DSG) members (enlisted and officer), commanders may refer documents they
     intend to file in the UIF to the member in person or by certified letter.
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    9


  2.3.4. The RegAF and AFR individuals on Title 10 status (enlisted and officer) will be
  allocated 3 duty days (current date plus 3 duty days) to acknowledge the intended actions and
  provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision on placing
  optional documents in the UIF. For Non-EAD Reservists and ANG DSG members who
  depart the duty area prior to the 3 duty days allowed for acknowledging intended actions, the
  individual has 45 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to acknowledge
  the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent information before the commander
  makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond, the date of receipt is not
  counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of the postmark on the
  envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. The individual is presumed to be in
  receipt of official correspondence if it is delivered by certified mail to the individual’s
  address or best available address.
     2.3.4.1. File any statement or document provided by the individual in the UIF.
         2.3.4.1.1. Article 15 supporting documentation such as evidence or other written
         materials, to include the member’s response to the Article 15 action, considered as a
         basis for imposing punishment, vacating a suspended punishment, submitted by the
         offender in mitigation, extenuation, defense or an appeal is not part of the record.
         File these materials at the office of the servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) of the
         commander who initiated the Article 15 as attachments to that office’s copy of the
         action.
     2.3.4.2. The commander advises the individual of their final decision. For non-EAD
     airmen this may be accomplished in person or by certified mail.
     2.3.4.3. The commander forwards copies of adverse administrative actions, LORs, AF
     Form 1137s, and AF Form 1058:
         2.3.4.3.1. For Regular Air Force (RegAF) duty general officers and general officer

      commander’s decision to place adverse information in an UIF or the Officer Selection
      Record (OSR) is unrelated to the Secretary of the Air Force’s decision to place this
      information in the Senior Officer Unfavorable Information File (SOUIF). Therefore,
      commanders will forward copies of all adverse information to SAF/IG, 1140 Air Force
      Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330, in accordance with (IAW) AFI 90-301, Inspector

2.4. Establishing a UIF:
   2.4.1. The UIF monitor will receive documents from the unit commander, base SJA, social
   actions officer or substance abuse clinic. Some documents require mandatory establishment
   of an UIF while others are at the commander's discretion. Refer to Table 2.2 to determine
   whether the documents listed below are mandatory or optional for file in the UIF. If not
   already established, create an UIF folder and AF Form 1137.

   about events that occurred. ARPC/Commander will be the establishing authority for
   Reservists in PAS S7XXXXXX (inactive Reserve status).
   2.4.3. Commanders decide what to do with optional UIF documents. After initially deciding
   not to establish a UIF, commanders may elect to establish a UIF or include an earlier
   administrative action in a previously established UIF if the date of the action or document is
   within 6 months from the date of the action. This does not apply to individuals who have
   reenlisted since the date of the document.
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 11

   individual should acknowledge the action. (T-2).
   2.5.2. UIF monitors:
      2.5.2.1. Remove UIFs (enlisted or officer) when you receive a record of action from the

   individual's unit commander. (T-2).
   2.6.3. If the individual is absent without leave (AWOL) or in deserter status before or on the
   UIF expiration date, the unit commander notifies the UIF monitor in writing of the
   individual’s status. The notification letter serves as a source document for the PDS update.
   The UIF monitor retains the UIF and updates the UIF disposition date to "8 Aug 3888"
   (indefinite). Do not annotate the AF Form 1137 (see Table 2.3). (T-1). If the individual
   returns from AWOL or deserter status, the unit commander advises the UIF monitor to
   destroy the UIF or establishes a new UIF disposition date. This date is no more than 3
   months from the date the commander signs the UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the

   entered dropped-from-rolls status, has it signed by the commander, and forwards it to the
   MPS, Personnel Employment Element. If returned to duty at a later date the unit commander
   advises the UIF monitor to destroy the UIF or establishes a new UIF disposition date. This
   date is no more than 3 months from the date the commander signs the UIF notice advising
   the UIF monitor of the member’s change in status. If a document is added to the UIF before
   the end of the 3 months, the UIF disposition date is extended. If a document is not added, the
   UIF is destroyed at the end of the 3 months (see Table 2.3). (T-1).

      annually. UIF monitors provide the commander and SJA an automated listing of all
      UIFs. The commanders will compare the listing to the actual documents in the UIF
      folder to ensure database integrity. Document the review via a memorandum signed by
      the unit commander and SJA. Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) commanders use a
      computer listing of UIFs to acknowledge existence of UIFs. After the review is

           Relocation Section (for unit program) or the gaining unit by indicating on the AF
           Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the member is on the
           control roster and annotating the UIF disposition date in the remarks section. After
           reviewing the AF Form 1288, the gaining commander will decide if the assignment is
           appropriate and will approve or disapprove the assignment. (T-3).
2.10. Commander's Enlisted Management Roster (CEMR) and Commander's Officer
Management Roster (COMR). The CEMR and the COMR are monthly listings of personnel
assigned within the unit possessing a quality indicator (UIF, control roster, Article 15, etc.). The
CEMR also lists personnel possessing EPR ratings which might indicate close observation of
their performance is appropriate. No certification or suspense of either roster is required. They
are simply management tools designed to give commanders an "at a glance" look at personnel in
their organization with quality indicators. All entries should be reviewed by the commander and
FSS staff to ensure appropriate action was taken. This includes determining the appropriateness
of an upcoming promotion, qualification for PRP duties, assignment, reenlistment, etc., some of
which are identified under the "projected for" area. The rosters are retrieved from the unit and
provided to the commander for review. (T-1).
2.11. Making Recommendations to the Commander. The SJA or MPS Chief may
recommend action to the commander. Use the AF Form 1058 or memorandum and file it in the
individual's UIF along with the commander's reply. AF From 1137 is not required to be
annotated.
2.12. UIFs on General Officers and General Officer Selects. AF/DPG, NGB/GOMO and
AF/REG function as the sole UIF monitor and repository and maintain the original UIF for the
commander. Copies of general officer and general officer select UIFs will not be maintained at
or by any organization other than AF/DPG or AF/REG for AFR and ANG members (see
paragraph 2.1.4.3 or 2.5.4 for mailing addresses). UIF information will not be updated in PDS
for general officer or general officer selects.

Notes:

1. Also applies to Article 15 punishment imposed on an Air Force member of a joint command by
a commander of a different service when processed in accordance with AFI 51-202. Includes any
suspended punishment longer than a month (31 days or more). Less than a month equals 30 days
or less. AFRC, ARPC or TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months
for AFR or ANG personnel, if deemed appropriate.

2. The servicing SJA specifies in writing whether the action is mandatory or optional for file in the
UIF. The determination accompanies the record of court action (conviction or judgment) or is
written and signed on the record itself. If mandatory for file, the SJA sends the record and
determination directly to the UIF monitor with a copy to the member’s commander for action.

3. PCS plus 1 year is determined by adding 1 year to the individual’s Date Arrive Station. If
individual’s UIF is due to expire prior to the individual departing PCS, extend the UIF (do not let it
expire) for 1 year from Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD). The gaining UIF monitor makes
appropriate PDS adjustments when the individual’s record is gained to file. For Reservist, extend
the UIF (do not let it expire) for 1 year from the effective date change strength accountability, the
 20                                                         AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014


date the Reservist changes assignment. For RegAF officers that will separate or transfer to the
AFRC, do not let the UIF expire. Extend the disposition date to reflect 2 yrs or separation or
transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.

4. AFRC, ARPC or TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months for
AFR or ANG personnel, if deemed appropriate.

5. If the Article 15 punishment is a Letter of Reprimand only, then the update of UIF code 1 with a
2 year disposition date is appropriate.

6. If there is more than 14 days between the date the commander signed the AF Form 1058 and the
date of the LOR, annotate the discrepancy in a Memorandum for Record (MFR) and use the date of
the LOR/LOA/LOC when determining the disposition date. File the MFR in the UIF with the AF
Form 1058.

Notes:
1. This is an AF Form 1137 annotation only. You do not have to maintain documentation in the
UIF.

2. The PDS generates a transmittal notice for the AF Form 1137 before the RNLTD, when a
member's end assignment changes, and on short-notice assignments if the member is within 120
days of RNLTD. When a member's end assignment changes or is canceled, the PDS generates a
Transaction Register (TR) remark, and the gaining unit destroys the advance copies of the AF
Form 1137.

3. Keep a copy of the advance transmittal notice in the UIF folder until mailed. Destroy it
afterwards.

4. If the member is projected for a PRP position, coordinate UIFs on gains with the unit PRP
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      25


monitor.

5. File retained transmittal notices in the general correspondence file.

6. Before sending the UIF electronically (encrypted), ensure its contents are complete and
accurately recorded. Sign and date the AF Form 1137 (reviewer’s remarks, signature, date),
certifying that you have reviewed it. Do not send electronically until you receive PDS
confirmation.

7. The PDS produces a notice once it confirms a member's reassignment. Remove the pencil
entries on the AF Form 1137 before scanning and sending the UIF to the new unit.

8. When a member enters or returns from dropped-from-the-rolls status, code or decode the UIF
disposition.

9. To determine the member's status, consult the worldwide personnel listing, MPS in-
processing clerk, Personnel Employment, or the losing Adverse Actions office.

10. Upon receipt, before giving an UIF to the FSS, RIO or ARPC/DPAMR, the UIF monitor:

10.1. Signs and dates the AF Form 1137 (reviewer's remarks, signature, date), certifying he or
she reviewed it.

10.2. For a member reassigned as a prisoner (confinement) with or without discharge because of
a court-martial conviction, records the court-martial conviction on AF Form 1137 and includes it
in the UIF before forwarding the UIF to the Personnel Employment Element.

10.3. Delays forwarding and takes timely follow-up action pending receipt of the court-martial
conviction and then gives Personnel Employment the UIF for placement in the Field Personnel
Record Group (FPRG).

11. Does not apply to the Air Force Reserve.

                                            Chapter 3

                                     CONTROL ROSTER

3.1. Who Uses the Control Roster. The control roster is a rehabilitative tool for commanders
to use. Commanders use the control roster to establish a 6-month observation period (AFRC,
ARPC, RIO, or the TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months, for
AFR and ANG personnel, if deemed appropriate) for individuals whose duty performance is
substandard or who fail to meet or maintain Air Force standards of conduct, bearing, and
integrity, on or off duty.
3.2. When to use a Control Roster. A brief incident of substandard performance or an isolated
breach of standards, not likely to be repeated, should not usually result in an individual's
placement on the control roster. Consideration should be given to prior incidents, acts, failures,
counseling and rehabilitative efforts. Commanders inform members on the control roster their
performance and behavior must improve or they will face more severe administrative action or
punishment.
   3.2.1. Commanders may direct an OPR or EPR before entering or removing an individual
   from the control roster, or both.
       3.2.1.1. The commander should periodically counsel personnel on the control roster
       about their improvement or failure to improve.
   3.2.2. When placing an officer on the control roster who is eligible or selected for
   promotion, or a selective continuation appointment, a commander must decide if the officer
   is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified. If not, initiate action to find the
   officer not qualified, delay the projected promotion, or remove the officer from the list (see
   AFI 36-2501, AFI 36-2610, Appointing Regular Air Force Officers and Obtaining
   Conditional Reserve Status, or AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective
   Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force).
   3.2.3. The commander cannot place an individual on the control roster as a substitute for
   more appropriate administrative, judicial, or nonjudicial action. Being put on the control
   roster does not shield an individual from other appropriate actions.
   3.2.4. An individual's name cannot remain on the control roster for more than 6 consecutive
   months. AFRC, ARPC, RIO or TAG may establish longer observation periods, if deemed
   appropriate, for AFR and ANG personnel, not to exceed 12 months. If a member is not
   rehabilitated in that time, the commander initiates more severe action:
       3.2.4.1. The control roster is cleared at 2400 on the last day of the observation period or
       on the date a member separates (enlisted only), retires, or dies. For example, if placed on
       the roster 1 January, the action expires at 2400 on 30 June. If affected on 1 September, it
       expires at 2400 on the last day of February (28th or 29th)
       3.2.4.2. Commanders may put an individual back on the control roster only if a new
       incident or failure occurs.
   3.2.5. PCS or PCA reassignment procedures for personnel on the control roster are:
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  27


     3.2.5.1. If the member is put on the control roster, and will leave an overseas area before
     the end of the observation period, and is otherwise eligible, the commander may extend
     the member's Date Eligible to Return from Overseas (DEROS) a maximum of 120 days
     (long tour area only). A commander who decides to involuntarily extend the DEROS
     advises the Relocation and Employment Elements as soon as possible.
     3.2.5.2. If the PCS reassignment is mandatory (does not include PCS without PCA for
     separation processing), the losing base UIF monitor removes the UIF code 2. The
     monitor then notes on the individual's AF Form 1137 that "control roster action expired
     due to mandatory PCS" before transferring the UIF to the gaining unit. Control roster
     action expires on the date the member departs. Note: This does not apply to unit moves
     when the member retains the same leadership.
     3.2.5.3. If the PCS reassignment is not mandatory, the person remains eligible for PCS if
     the observation period expires before the (RNLTD) for the assignment. The commander
     advises the Relocation Element of the person's control roster status; the Relocation
     Element notifies the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). AFPC determines the
     individual's assignment eligibility (see AFI 36-2110, Assignments).
     3.2.5.4. For AFR assignments, individuals remain eligible for PCS while on the control
     roster. The losing commander or IMA Program Manager advises the MPS Relocation
     Section (for unit program) or the gaining IMA Program Manager (for the IMA program)
     by indicating on the AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the
     member is on the control roster and annotating the UIF disposition date in the remarks
     section. After reviewing the AF Form 1288, the gaining commander or IMA Program
     Manager will decide if the assignment is appropriate and will approve or disapprove the
     assignment.
        3.2.5.4.1. Delay PCA when an individual is on the control roster. If the PCA is
        essential to the mission and the losing and gaining commanders concur, the person
        may be reassigned, but remains on the control roster.
     3.2.5.5. For ANG Statutory Tour Assignments, individuals will not normally be eligible
     for PCS/PCA while on the control roster. Any requests for PCS/PCA movement while
     members are on a control roster should be forwarded to NGB/HR for staffing to the
     appropriate approval authority.
     3.2.5.6. For ANG members in Title 32 member assignments, individuals remain eligible
     for PCS while on the control roster. The losing commander advises the MPS Relocation
     Section (for unit program) or the gaining unit by indicating on the AF Form 1288,
     Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the member is on the control roster and
     annotating the UIF disposition date in the remarks section. After reviewing the AF Form
     1288, the gaining commander will decide if the assignment is appropriate and will
     approve or disapprove the assignment. (T-3).
  3.2.6. For RegAF, AFR and ANG, the commander cancels all formal training for members
  during the period they are on the control roster. (T-1).
  3.2.7. The commander must not put individuals on the control roster who are on TDY, TDY
  en route, or in PCS status:
 28                                                          AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014


       3.2.7.1. An individual's time on the control roster does not stop and start for periods of
       TDY, ordinary leave, or change in immediate supervisor. For example, if an individual
       on the control roster requests 2 weeks leave, the control roster time does not stop for the 2
       weeks the individual is on leave and then start again. The 6 months is continuous
       regardless of the individual's leave or TDY status.
3.3. Who Can Add or Remove Individuals to or from the Control Roster. The following
individuals have authority to add or remove any assigned or attached enlisted member to or from
the control roster. The following individuals also have the authority to add any assigned or
attached officers to the control roster. Remove control roster action on officers upon receipt of
an AF Form 1058, or memorandum signed by the officer’s wing commander (or equivalent), or
issuing authority, whichever is higher. This early removal option applies regardless of how long
the action was on file/in system.
   3.3.1. Commanders on G-series orders at all levels for members assigned or attached to their
   units. Commanders must be senior to the member.
   3.3.2. The commander, vice commander, staff director and directors at MAJCOM, FOA, and
   DRU.
   3.3.3. Chief of staff, deputy chiefs of staff, assistant chiefs of staff, other heads of staff
   agencies, and directors assigned to Headquarters, US Air Force.
   3.3.4. Comparable officers within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense.
   3.3.5. The Senior Air Force officer assigned to a joint command.
   3.3.6. The Readiness Management Group Program Manager for Civil Air Patrol Reserve
   Assistance Program and the Admissions Liaison Officer Program.
3.4. Initiating and Maintaining the Control Roster. The UIF monitor retrieves and maintains
the control roster for the commander:
   3.4.1. Commanders use AF Form 1058 to initiate control roster action. Individuals must
   acknowledge the action and have 3 duty days to submit a statement on their behalf before the
   AF Form 1058 is finalized. The commander advises the individual of their final decision.
   Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry. (T-2).
       3.4.1.1. Should be updated to reflect: For Non-EAD Reservists and ANG DSG members
       who depart the duty area prior to the 3 duty days allowed for acknowledging intended
       actions, the individual has 45 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter
       to acknowledge the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent information
       before the commander makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond, the
       date of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date
       of the postmark on the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. The
       individual is presumed to be in receipt of official correspondence if it is hand delivered or
       delivered by certified mail to the individual’s address or best available address.
       3.4.1.2. A control roster will not be created or maintained on members assigned to the
       non-participating AFR status (PAS S7XXXXXX).
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    29


                                           Chapter 4

      ADMINISTRATIVE COUNSELINGS, ADMONITIONS, AND REPRIMANDS

4.1. Who Can Use Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands. Commanders, supervisors,
and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands.
These actions are intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from
standards of performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and whose actions
degrade the individual and unit's mission. This includes issuing administrative counseling,
admonitions, and reprimands to reservists who commit an offense while in civilian status.
   4.1.1. Raters must consider making comments on performance reports when the ratee
   receives any of these adverse actions
   4.1.2. Written administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the
   rules of access, protection, and disclosure outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974, System of
   Records, AFPC L. The same rules apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and
   those filed in an individual's UIF or the unit's Personnel Information File (PIF).
4.1.3. Standard of Proof. While no specific standard of proof applies to administrative action
proceedings, commanders should utilize the “preponderance of the evidence” standard when
evaluating the evidence and every element of the offenses committed. A preponderance of the
evidence means simply the greater weight of credible evidence. Whether such proof is available
should be considered before initiating the administrative action. If such proof is lacking,
administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally unsupportable and, as a result,
could be set aside. There is no requirement to prove any allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.

4.2. Records of Individual Counseling (RIC) and LOCs. Counseling helps people use good
judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve problems. Counselors assist subordinates in
developing skills, attitudes, and behaviors that are consistent with maintaining the Air Force's
readiness.
   4.2.1. First line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders routinely counsel individuals
   either verbally or in writing, giving advice and reassuring subordinates about specific
   situations.
   4.2.2. AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling, records the counseling session. It
   provides a record of positive or negative counseling and is useful when completing
   performance evaluations. Documenting counseling sessions on bond paper or letterhead
   constitutes a LOC.
   4.2.3. Front line supervisors and first sergeants may recommend the commander file
   negative or unfavorable RICs, or LOCs in the UIF. For officer personnel, if the LOC is not
   filed in the UIF, it must be filed in the individual’s PIF.
4.3. LOAs. An admonishment is more severe than a LOC/RIC. Use it to document an infraction
serious enough to warrant the LOA. Do not use it when a reprimand is more appropriate. For
officer personnel, if the LOA is not filed in the UIF, is must be filed in the individual's PIF.
 30                                                         AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014


4.4. LORs. A reprimand is more severe than a counseling or admonition and indicates a
stronger degree of official censure. Commanders may elect to file a LOR in an UIF for enlisted
personnel. LORs are mandatory for file in the UIF for officer personnel.
   4.4.1. For officer personnel only: If a person other than the unit commander issues a LOR,
   send it to the unit commander for acknowledgment and endorsement via AF Form 1058 and
   establish/file in an UIF. Include the member’s written acknowledgment and any documents
   submitted by the member.
   4.4.2. The AF Form 1058 does not need to be referred to the officer since the rebuttal
   opportunity is offered at the time the LOR is administered (see paragraph 4.5.1). The AF
   Form 1058 is used only to obtain the commander’s acknowledgment of the action (for LORs
   administered by personnel other than the commander) and to refer the LOR for file in the
   UIF.
4.5. Administering RICs, LOCs, LOAs, or LORs.
   4.5.1. Administer a counseling, admonition, or reprimand, verbally or in writing. If written,
   the letter states:
       4.5.1.1. What the member did or failed to do, citing specific incidents and their dates.
       4.5.1.2. What improvement is expected.
       4.5.1.3. That further deviation may result in more severe action.
       4.5.1.4. That the individual will be allocated 3 duty days to submit rebuttal documents
       for consideration by the initiator. For Non-EAD Reservists or ANG members: the
       individual has 45 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter, to
       acknowledge the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent information before
       the commander makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond, the date of
       receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of the
       postmark on the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. An individual is
       presumed to be in receipt of official correspondence if it is delivered in person or by
       certified mail to the individual's address or best available address.
       4.5.1.5. That all supporting documents received from the individual will become part of
       the record.
       4.5.1.6. The person who initiates the LOC, LOA, or LOR has 3 duty days to advise the
       individual of their final decision regarding any comments submitted by the individual.
       For Non-EAD Reservists and ANG members: the initiator has 45 calendar days from the
       date of personal delivery or date of receipt of the certified letter to reply to the member.
AFI36-2907 26 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                31


  4.5.2. The person who initiates a RIC/LOC, LOA, or LOR may send it to the member's
  commander or superiors for information, action, or for their approval for file in the UIF or
  PIF. Include the member's written acknowledgment and any documents submitted by the
  member. For officers, LORs must be filed in the UIF, and any LOAs or LOCs not filed in the
  UIF, must be filed in the officer's PIF.
  4.5.3. The person who initiates a LOA or LOR for a general officer or general officer select
  will forward the original document and attachments to AF/DPG,AF/REG or NGB/GOMO
  for distribution to the commander. Mailing addresses are listed in paragraph 2.1.4.3
