    edge the intended actions and provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final
    decision on placing optional documents in the UIF. For Non-EAD Reservists who depart the duty

  area prior to the 3 duty days allowed for acknowledging intended actions, the individual has 30 calen-
  dar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to acknowledge the notification, intended
  actions, and provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision. In calcu-
  lating the time to respond, the date of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowl-
  edgment, the date of the postmark on the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. The
  individual is presumed to be in receipt of official correspondence if it is delivered by certified mail to
  the individual’s address or best available address.

         1.3.4.1.1. Article 15 supporting documentation such as evidence or other written materials, to

         punishment, or vacating a suspended punishment, or submitted by the offender in mitigation,
         extenuation, or defense or on appeal are not part of the record. File these materials at the office

         office’s copy of the action.
     1.3.4.2. The commander advises the individual of their final decision.
     1.3.4.3. The commander forwards copies of adverse administrative actions, LORs, and AF IMT

     mander’s decision to place adverse information in an UIF or the Officer Selection Record (OSR)

       1.3.4.7. For all IMA’s, send a copy of the initial and and any updated AF IMT 1058s to the MAJ-
       COM/AF Element Program Manager and HQ ARPF/DPRFQ.

1.4. Establishing an UIF:
    1.4.1. As the UIF monitor, you will receive documents from the unit commander, base staff judge
    advocate, social actions officer or substance abuse clinic. Some documents require mandatory estab-
    lishment of an UIF while others are at the commander's discretion. Refer to Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.
    to determine whether the documents listed below are mandatory or optional for file in the UIF. If not
    already established, create an UIF folder and AF Form 1137.
       1.4.1.1. AF Form 1058.
       1.4.1.2. AF Form 3070, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings.

       1.4.2.3. If the member is performing or selected for assignment to Personnel Reliability Program
       (PRP) duties or is a student attending a PRP-related course as defined by AFI 36-2104, Nuclear
       Weapons, Personnel Reliability Program, mark the folder in the upper right hand corner reflecting
       the member's involvement with the program. The PRP marking should be visible when the folder
       is closed and filed. (EXAMPLE: a piece of colored tape placed on the edge of the file.)
       1.4.2.4. Prepare an AF Form 1137 for each UIF summarizing the incident, the disposition date,
       the commander's evaluation of the incident, and what administrative action was taken. Be spe-
       cific.
       1.4.2.5. Remove the AF Form 1137 entry when a portion of the supporting documents are
       removed, as appropriate; the original AF Form 1137 remains in the UIF.
       1.4.2.6. Coordinate and distribute AF Form 1137 as appropriate. When you make distribution of
       an AF Form 1137 for an individual Reservist, forward one copy to the MAJCOM/AF Element
       Program Manager (see Table 2.3.).
       1.4.2.7. Except as indicated in paragraph 1.11., update the Military Personnel Data System
       (MilPDS)/PC-III IAW Table 2.1. and Table 2.2., when a commander establishes a UIF or adds/
       removes documents from a member's UIF.
    1.4.3. The commander ensures the UIF contains only substantiated unfavorable information about
    events that occurred while the person was on active duty or assigned to the Air Force Reserve. HQ
    Air Reserve Personnel Cennter (ARPC)/CC will be the establishing authority for Reservists in PAS
    S7XXXXXX (inactive Reserve status).

   1.4.4. Commanders decide what to do with optional UIF documents. After initially deciding not to
   establish a UIF, commanders may elect to establish a UIF or include an earlier administrative action in
   a previously established UIF if the date of the action or document is within 6 months from the date of
   the action. This does not apply to individuals who have reenlisted since the date of the document.

            1.5.2.3.4. When the commander initiates or updates a UIF on an IMA, the UIF monitor will
            forward on copy of all of the information to the MAJCOM/AF Element Program Manager and
            HQ ARPC/DPRFQ.

1.6. Accessing UIFs:
     1.6.1. The UIF monitor ensures the only personnel with access to UIFs are:
        1.6.1.1. The member who has the UIF.
        1.6.1.2. Individuals listed in paragraph 1.2. reviewing UIFs on personnel assigned or attached to

     command:
        1.7.1.1. Review all unit UIFs within 90 days of their permanent assumption or appointment to
        command. Unit commanders and Staff Judge Advocates (SJA) must review UIFs annually. UIF
        monitors provide the commander and SJA a computer listing of all UIFs. The commanders will
        compare the listing to the actual documents in the UIF folder to ensure personnel database integ-
        rity. Document the review via memorandum signed by the unit commander and SJA. Geograph-
        ically Separated Unit (GSU) commanders use a computer listing of UIFs to acknowledge
        existence of UIFs. After the review is complete, the GSU commander signs the list and files it in
        the general correspondence file.
        1.7.1.2. Review UIFs when individuals are considered for:
            1.7.1.2.1. Promotion.

         an officer is convicted by a court-martial, comments are mandatory on the next OPR (the OPR
         must be referred) and the next PRF for below and in-the-promotion-zone consideration. Com-
         ments on OPRs and EPRs relating to Article 15 punishment and control roster actions are
         strongly recommended for officers and senior NCOs, and must be considered in all cases.
         Refer to AFI 36-2402, Officer Evaluation System, and AFI 36-2403, The Enlisted Evaluation

         Reserve.
  1.7.2. Commander's Enlisted Management Roster (CEMR) and Commander's Officer Man-
  agement Roster (COMR). The CEMR and the COMR are monthly listings of personnel assigned
  within the unit possessing a quality indicator (UIF, control roster, Article 15, etc.). The CEMR also
  lists personnel possessing EPR ratings which might indicate close observation of their performance is
  appropriate. No certification or suspense of either roster is required. They are simply management
  tools designed to give commanders an "at a glance" look at personnel in their organization with qual-
  ity indicators. All entries should be reviewed by the commander and MPF staff to ensure appropriate
  action was taken. This includes determining the appropriateness of an upcoming promotion, qualifi-
  cation for PRP duties, assignment, reenlistment, etc., some of which are identified under the "pro-
  jected for" area. The rosters are retrieved from the office automation area in PC-III (via the Personnel
  Systems Manager [PSM] for non-PC-III units) by the unit and provided to the commander for review.
  1.7.3. The UIF monitor (base and unit):
     1.7.3.1. Audits existing UIFs at least twice a year by comparing the PDS to UIFs on file.
     1.7.3.2. Maintains the UIFs properly and corrects the corresponding PDS entries. (Units not under
     PC-III configuration may audit UIFs as part of existing self-inspections.)
     1.7.3.3. Signs the audit list or self-inspection checklist (Attachment 2) and files it in the general
     correspondence file.
12                                                                          AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005


     1.7.4. The base UIF monitor will audit all existing UIFs at least bi-annually by comparing the PDS to
     UIFs on file.
     1.7.5. The unit UIF monitor will ensure UIFs are maintained properly and corresponding PDS entries
     are correct/corrected.
     1.7.6. Document reviews via memorandum signed by the base and unit UIF monitor as applicable to
     the type of review conducted. Upon completion of a review, each UIF monitor files it in the general
     correspondence file.
     1.7.7. Unit commanders or first sergeants review the MPF’s audit and commander's self-inspection
     checklist.

1.8. Making Recommendations to the Commander. The SJA or MPF Commander may recommend
action to the commander. Use the AF Form 1058 or memorandum and file it in the individual's UIF along
with the commander's reply. You do not need to annotate AF Form 1137.

1.9. Removal of UIFs or their Documents.
     1.9.1. Commanders maintain the UIF and all of its documents/contents until the final disposition date
     (Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.) unless early removal of the document or UIF is clearly warranted. Com-
     manders initiate removal action via AF IMT 1058 or memorandum, and the individual should
     acknowledge the action.

        listed in the LOR , LOA or LOC.
        1.9.2.3. Remove UIFs (officer only) upon receipt of an AF IMT 1058, or memorandum signed by
        the officer’s wing commander (or equivalent), imposing or issuing authority, whichever is higher.
        Courts-martial and Article 15 documents may be removed early once the punishment is completed
        (see paragraph 1.9.5.).
        1.9.2.4. Remove UIFs (enlisted only) upon receipt of an IMT 1058, or memorandum signed by
        the wing commander (or equivalent) or the convening authority, whichever is higher. Courts-mar-
        tial documents may be removed early once the punishment is completed (see paragraph 1.9.5.).
        1.9.2.5. All other UIF entries may be removed early regardless of how long the UIF was on file/
        in system by the wing commander (or equivalent) or issuing authority, whichever is higher for
        officers and by the unit commander for enlisted members .
        1.9.2.6. The wing commander (or equivalent), imposing or issuing authority, whichever is higher,
        may direct removal of derogatory data from the OSR at any time; or the officer may appeal to have
        the derogatory data removed after one In the Promotion Zone (IPZ) or Above the Promotion Zone
        (APZ) consideration. (See AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System). Removing an
AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005                                                                              13

1.10. Transferring and Disposing of UIFs. The UIF monitor marks the front and back of the envelope
containing UIF information FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY when releasing UIF information through the
mail. Do not use Standard Forms 65B or 65C, US Government Messenger Envelopes.
     1.10.1. See Table 2.3. for when and how to dispose of UIFs. Effective May 1998, unexpired UIFs are
     transferred between the active, ANG, and Reserve components on all personnel (officer and enlisted)
     separating or transferring between the active duty and Reserve components. This includes the transfer
     of unexpired UIFs within the Reserve components for officer and enlisted members.
     1.10.2. The following procedures apply to Temporary Duty (TDY) personnel:
        1.10.2.1. TDY en route PCS. The TDY commander sends a completed copy of AF Forms 1058
        and 1137 and the individual's PCS special orders to the gaining MPF after each UIF entry. If the
        individual's eligibility or suitability for the pending assignment is in doubt, the gaining com-
        mander contacts the MPF for guidance.
        1.10.2.2. TDY. If the individual is TDY and will return to their permanent unit, the TDY com-
        mander sends the completed package to the individual's unit commander.
     1.10.3. If the individual is absent without leave (AWOL) or in deserter status before or on the UIF
     expiration date, the unit commander notifies the UIF monitor in writing of the individual’s status. The
     notification letter serves as a source document for the PDS update. The UIF monitor retains the UIF
     and updates the UIF disposition date to "8 Aug 3888" (indefinite). Do not annotate the AF IMT 1137
     (see Table 2.3.).
        1.10.3.1. If the individual returns from AWOL or deserter status, the unit commander advises the
        UIF monitor to destroy the UIF or establishes a new UIF disposition date. This date is no more
        than 3 months from the date the commander signs the UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the
        member's change in status. If a document is added to the UIF before the end of the 3 months, the
        UIF disposition date is extended. If a document is not added, the UIF is destroyed at the end of the
        3 months (see Table 2.3.).
     1.10.4. The UIF monitor maintains the UIF for members in dropped-from-rolls status. When the UIF
     expires, the monitor annotates the AF IMT 1137 to show the date the member entered
     dropped-from-rolls status, has it signed by the commander, and forwards it to the MPF, Personnel
     Employment Section. If returned to duty at a later date the unit commander advises the UIF monitor
     to destroy the UIF or establishes a new UIF disposition date. This date is no more than 3 months from
     the date the commander signs the UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the member’s change in sta-
     tus. If a document is added to the UIF before the end of the 3 months, the UIF disposition date is
     extended. If a document is not added, the UIF is destroyed at the end of the 3 months (see Table 2.3.).

1.11. UIFs on General Officers and General Officer Selects. AFSLMO and RESOMO function as the
sole UIF monitor and repository and maintain the original UIF for the commander. Copies of general
officer and general officer select UIFs will not be maintained at or by any organization other than AFS-
LMO or HQ USAF/RESOMO for Reserve personnel (see paragraph 1.3.4.3. or 1.9.4. for mailing
addresses). UIF information will not be updated in PDS for general officer or general officer selects.

                                            CONTROL ROSTER


2.1. Who Uses the Control Roster. The control roster is a rehabilitative tool for commanders to use.
Commanders use the control roster to set up a 6-month observation period (HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may
establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months, for Reserve personnel if deemed appropri-
ate) for individuals whose duty performance is substandard or who fail to meet or maintain Air Force
standards of conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty.

2.2. Using a Control Roster. A brief incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach of stan-
dards, not likely to be repeated, should not usually result in an individual's placement on the control roster.
Consideration should be given to prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling and rehabilitative efforts.
Commanders inform members on the control roster their performance and behavior must improve or they
will face more severe administrative action or punishment.
     2.2.1. Commanders may direct an OPR or EPR before entering or removing an individual from the
     control roster, or both.
         2.2.1.1. The commander should periodically counsel personnel on the control roster about their
         improvement or failure to improve.
     2.2.2. When placing an officer on the control roster who is eligible or selected for promotion, an
     appointment in the RegAF, CRS, or a selective continuation appointment, a commander must decide
     if the officer is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified. If not, initiate action to find
     the officer not qualified, delay the projected promotion, or remove the officer from the list (see AFI
     36-2501, AFI 36-2610, Appointing Regular Air Force Officers and Obtaining Conditional Reserve
     Status, or AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotions for the Reserve of the Air Force).
     2.2.3. The commander cannot place an individual on the control roster as a substitute for more appro-
     priate administrative, judicial, or nonjudicial action. Being put on the control roster does not shield an
     individual from other appropriate actions.
     2.2.4. An individual's name cannot remain on the control roster for more than 6 consecutive months.
     HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may establish longer observation periods, if deemed appropriate, for Reserve
     personnel, not to exceed 12 months. If a member is not rehabilitated in that time, the commander ini-
     tiates more severe action:
         2.2.4.1. The control roster is cleared at 2400 hours on the last day of the observation period or on
         the date a member separates (enlisted only), retires, or dies. For example, if placed on the roster 1
         January, the action expires at 2400 on 30 June. If effected on 1 September, it expires at 2400 on the
         last day of February (28th or 29th).
         2.2.4.2. Commanders may put an individual back on the control roster only if a new incident or
         failure occurs.
     2.2.5. PCS or PCA reassignment procedures for personnel on the control roster are:
         2.2.5.1. If the member is put on the control roster, and will leave an overseas area before the end
         of the observation period, and is otherwise eligible, the commander may extend the member's
AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005                                                                                  17


       Date Eligible to Return from Overseas (DEROS) a maximum of 120 days (long tour area only). A
       commander who decides to involuntarily extend the DEROS advises the Relocation and Employ-
       ment Elements as soon as possible.
       2.2.5.2. If the PCS reassignment is mandatory (does not include PCS without PCA for separation
       processing), the losing base UIF monitor removes the UIF code 2. The monitor then notes on the
       individual's AF Form 1137 that "control roster action expired due to mandatory PCS" before trans-
       ferring the UIF to the gaining unit. Control roster action expires on the date the member departs.
       2.2.5.3. If the PCS reassignment is not mandatory, the person remains eligible for PCS if the
       observation period expires before the Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD) for the assignment.
       The commander advises the Relocation Element of the person's control roster status; the Reloca-
       tion Element notifies HQ AFPC. HQ AFPC determines the individual's assignment eligibility
       (see AFI 36-2110, Assignments).
       2.2.5.4. For Reserve assignments, individuals remain eligible for PCS while on the control roster.
       The losing commander or IMA Program Manager advises the MPF Relocation Section (for unit
       program) or the gaining IMA Program Manager (for the IMA program) by indicating on the AF
       Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the member is on the control ros-
       ter and annotating the UIF disposition date in the remarks section. After reviewing the AF Form
       1288, the gaining commander or IMA Program Manager will decide if the assignment is appropri-
       ate and will approve or disapprove the assignment.
       2.2.5.5. Delay PCA when an individual is on the control roster. If the PCA is essential to the mis-
       sion and the losing and gaining commanders concur, the person may be reassigned, but remains on
       the control roster.
   2.2.6. The commander cancels all formal training for members during the period they are on the con-
   trol roster.
   2.2.7. The commander must not put individuals on the control roster who are on TDY, TDY en route,
   or in PCS status:
       2.2.7.1. An individual's time on the control roster does not stop and start for periods of TDY, ordi-
       nary leave, or change in immediate supervisor. For example, if an individual on the control roster
       requests 2 weeks leave, the control roster time does not stop for the 2 weeks the individual is on
       leave and then start again. The 6 months is continuous regardless of the individual's leave or TDY
       status.

2.3. Who Can Add or Remove Individuals to or from the Control Roster. The following individuals
have authority to add or remove any assigned or attached enlisted member to or from the control roster.
The following individuals also have the authority to add any assigned or attached officers to the control
roster. Remove control roster action on officers upon receipt of an AF IMT 1058, or memorandum signed
by the officer’s wing commander (or equivalent), or issuing authority, whichever is higher. This early
removal option applies regardless of how long the action was on file/in system.
   2.3.1. Commanders at all levels for members assigned or attached to their units. Commanders must
   be senior to the member.
   2.3.2. The commander, vice commander, staff director and directors at Major Commands (MAJ-
   COM), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU).

     2.3.3. Chief of staff, deputy chiefs of staff, assistant chiefs of staff, other heads of staff agencies, and
     directors assigned to Headquarters, US Air Force.
     2.3.4. Comparable officers within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the Joint
     Chiefs of Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense.
     2.3.5. The Senior Air Force officer assigned to a joint command.
     2.3.6. The Program Manager for Civil Air Patrol Reserve Assistance Program and the Admissions
     Liaison Officer Program.

2.4. Initiating and Maintaining the Control Roster. The UIF monitor retrieves and maintains the con-
trol roster for the commander:
     2.4.1. Commanders use AF IMT 1058 to initiate control roster action. Individuals must acknowledge
     the action and have 3 duty days to submit a statement on their behalf before the AF IMT 1058 is final-
     ized. The commander advises the individual of their final decision. Placement on the control roster is
     a mandatory UIF entry.
        2.4.1.1. For Non-EAD Reservists who depart the duty area prior to the 3 duty days allowed for
        acknowledging intended actions; the individual has 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of
        the certified letter to acknowledge the notification and intended actions, and provide pertinent
        information before the commander makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond,
        the date of receipt is not counted and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of the
        postmark on the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. An individual is presumed to
        be in receipt of official correspondence if it is delivered by certified mail to the individual's
        address or best available address.
        2.4.1.2. A control roster will not be created or maintained on members assigned to the non-partic-
        ipating Reserve status (PAS S7XXXXXX).
     2.4.2. DELETED.

NOTES:
     1. Also applies to Article 15 punishment imposed on an Air Force member of a joint command
        by a commander of a different service when processed in accordance with AFI 51-202.
      2. The servicing SJA specifies in writing whether the action is mandatory or optional for file in
         the UIF. The determination accompanies the record of court action (conviction or judgment)
         or is written and signed on the record itself. If mandatory for file, the SJA sends the record
         and determination directly to the UIF monitor with a copy to the member's commander for
         action.
      3. PCS plus 1 year is determined by adding 1 year to the individual’s Date Arrive Station (DAS).
         If individual’s UIF is due to expire prior to the individual departing PCS, extend the UIF (do
         not let it expire) for 1 year from RNLTD. The gaining UIF monitor makes appropriate PDS/

        PC-III adjustments when the individual’s record is gained to file. For Reservists, extend the
        UIF (do not let it expire) for 1 year from the effective date change strength accountability
        [EDCSA], the date the Reservist changes assignment. For active duty officers that will sepa-
        rate or transfer to the USAFR do not let the UIF expire. Extend the disposition date to reflect
        2 years or separation or transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.
     4. HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months,
        for Reserve personnel if deemed appropriate.
     5. If the Article 15 punishment is a Letter of Reprimand only, then the update of UIF code 1 with
        a 2 year disposition date is appropriate.

         and determination directly to the UIF monitor with a copy to the member's commander for
         action.
      3. HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months,

NOTES:
         1. This is an AF Form 1137 annotation only. You do not have to maintain documentation in the
            UIF.
         2. The PDS generates a transmittal notice for the AF Form 1137 before the RNLTD, when a
            member's end assignment changes, and on short-notice assignments if the member is within
            120 days of RNLTD. When a member's end assignment changes or is canceled, the PDS gen-
            erates a TR remark, and the gaining unit destroys the advance copies of the AF Form 1137.
         3. Keep a copy of the advance transmittal notice in the UIF folder until you mail it. Destroy it
            afterwards.
         4. If the member is projected for a PRP position, coordinate UIFs on gains with the unit PRP
            monitor.
         5. File retained transmittal notices in the general correspondence file.
         6. Before mailing an UIF, ensure that its contents are complete and accurately recorded. Sign
            and date the AF Form 1137 (reviewer's remarks, signature, date), certifying that you have
            reviewed it. Do not mail the UIF until you receive PDS confirmation.
         7. The PDS produces a notice once it confirms a member's reassignment. Change the pencil
            entries on the AF Form 1137 before sending the UIF to the new unit.
         8. When a member enters or returns from dropped-from-the-rolls status, code or decode the UIF
            disposition.
         9. To determine the member's status, consult the worldwide personnel listing, MPF inprocessing
            clerk, Personnel Employment, or the losing Special Actions office.
         10. Before giving an UIF to the Personnel Employment Element, for individual Reservists, to HQ
             ARPC/DPMPQ, the UIF monitor:
28                                                                      AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005


        10.1. Signs and dates the AF Form 1137 (reviewer's remarks, signature, date), certifying he or
        she reviewed it.

        10.2. For a member reassigned as a prisoner (confinement) with or without discharge because
        of a court-martial conviction, records the court-martial conviction on AF Form 1137 and
        includes it in the UIF before forwarding the UIF to the Personnel Employment Element.

        10.3. Delays forwarding and takes timely follow-up action pending receipt of the court-mar-
        tial conviction and then gives Personnel Employment the UIF for placement in the Field Per-
        sonnel Record Group (FPRG).

        10.4. For prisoners confined at a Department of Defense Regional Correction Facility, under
        administrative control of the Director of Air Force Corrections, mail the UIF to HQ AFSPA/
        SPCI Bldg 20203, 8601 F Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5516. See AFI 51-201, Admin-

          ADMINISTRATIVE COUNSELINGS, ADMONITIONS, AND REPRIMANDS


3.1. Who Can Use Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands. Commanders, supervisors, and other
persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands. These actions are
intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of performance, con-
duct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and whose actions degrade the individual and unit's mission.
This includes issuing administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands to Reservists who commit
an offense while in civilian status.
   3.1.1. Raters must consider making comments on performance reports when the ratee receives any of
   these adverse actions
   3.1.2. Written administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the rules of
   access, protection, and disclosure outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974, System of Records, F035 AF
   MP L. The same rules apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in an indi-
   vidual's UIF or the unit's Personnel Information File (PIF).

3.2. Records of Individual Counseling (RIC). Counseling helps people use good judgment, assume
responsibility, and face and solve problems. Counselors assist subordinates in developing skills, attitudes,
and behaviors that are consistent with maintaining the Air Force's readiness.
   3.2.1. First line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders routinely counsel individuals either ver-
   bally or in writing, giving advice and reassuring subordinates about specific situations.
   3.2.2. AF IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling (RIC), records the counseling session. It pro-
   vides a record of positive or negative counseling and is useful when completing performance evalua-
   tions. Documenting counseling sessions on bond paper or letterhead constitutes a Letter of
   Counseling (LOC) if you don't have access to an AF IMT 174.
   3.2.3. Front line supervisors and first sergeants may recommend the commander file negative or unfa-
   vorable RICs or LOCs in the UIF. For officer personnel, if the LOC is not filed in the UIF, it must be
   filed in the individual’s PIF.

3.3. LOAs. An admonishment is more severe than a LOC/RIC. Use it to document an infraction serious
enough to warrant the LOA. Do not use it when a reprimand is more appropriate. For officer personnel,
if the LOA is not filed in the UIF, is must be filed in the individual's PIF.

3.4. LORs. A reprimand is more severe than a counseling or admonition and indicates a stronger degree
of official censure. Commanders may elect to file a LOR in an UIF for enlisted personnel. LORs are
mandatory for file in the UIF for officer personnel.
   3.4.1. For officer personnel only: If a person other than the unit commander issues a LOR, send it to
   the unit commander for acknowledgment and endorsement via AF IMT 1058 and establish/file in an
   UIF. Include the member’s written acknowledgment and any documents submitted by the member.
   3.4.2. The AF IMT 1058 does not need to be referred to the officer since the rebuttal opportunity is
   offered at the time the LOR is administered (see paragraph 3.5.1.). The AF IMT 1058 is used only to
30                                                                              AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005


     obtain the commander’s acknowledgment of the action (for LORs administered by personnel other
     than the commander) and to refer the LOR for file in the UIF.

3.5. Administering RICs, LOCs, LOAs, or LORs.
     3.5.1. Administer a counseling, admonition, or reprimand, verbally or in writing. If written, the letter
     states:
        3.5.1.1. What the member did or failed to do, citing specific incidents and their dates.
        3.5.1.2. What improvement is expected.
        3.5.1.3. That further deviation may result in more severe action.
        3.5.1.4. That the individual has 3 duty days to submit rebuttal documents for consideration by the
        initiator. For Non-EAD Reservists: the individual has 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of
        the certified letter, to acknowledge the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent infor-
        mation before the commander makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond, the
        date of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of the
        postmark on the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. An individual is presumed to
        be in receipt of official correspondence if it is delivered by certified mail to the individual's
        address or best available address.
        3.5.1.5. That all supporting documents received from the individual will become part of the
        record.
        3.5.1.6. The person who initiates the RIC, LOC, LOA, or LOR has 3 duty days to advise the indi-
        vidual of their final decision regarding any comments submitted by the individual. For Non-EAD
        Reservists: the initiator has 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to reply
        to the member.
     3.5.2. The person who initiates a RIC/LOC, LOA, or LOR may send it to the member's commander
     or superiors for information, action, or for their approval for file in the UIF or PIF. Include the mem-
     ber's written acknowledgment and any documents submitted by the member. For officers, LORs must
     be filed in the UIF, and any LOAs or LOCs not filed in the UIF, must be filed in the officer's PIF.
     3.5.3. The person who initiates a LOA or LOR for a general officer or general officer select will for-
     ward the original document and attachments to AFSLMO or RESOMO for distribution to the com-
     mander. Mailing addresses are listed in paragraph 1.3.4.3. or 1.9.4.

3.6. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling, AF Form 1058, Unfavorable
Information File Actions, and AF Form 1137, Unfavorable Information File Summary.

          PROCEDURES FOR UPDATING THE PERSONNEL DATA SYSTEM (PDS)

A3.1. The commander is responsible for the accuracy and validity of UIF data. The Base or Unit UIF
monitor updates the following codes and disposition dates in the PDS when directed by the commander or
SJA IAW Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.:
   A3.1.1. Code 1 - UIF only
   A3.1.2. Code 2 - Control Roster and UIF
   A3.1.3. Code 3 - Punishment, Article 15, or court-martial

A3.2. The PDS monitors the expiration and proper disposal of the UIF using the UIF disposition date. As
documents are placed in or removed from the UIF, the UIF disposition date must be adjusted. The PDS
identifies preliminary UIF actions by the interim disposition date, such as Article 15 or court-martial pun-
ishment, or placement on the control roster. Establish the final UIF disposition date when the interim
period is over. For example: Article 15 punishment is for 2 months. The commander signs item 4 on the
AF IMT 3070 on 26 Sep 04. The interim UIF code is 3 and the interim UIF disposition date is the date
punishment will be completed or is suspended to. If no additional documents are added to the UIF prior
to the expiration of the interim date, the code is adjusted from 3 to 1 and the final UIF disposition date is
25 Sep 06, one day less than the document’s effective date plus the 2-year final retention duration. Then
on 18 Sep 06 the individual receives a LOR and the commander completes the AF IMT 1058 on 25 Sep
06. Update the disposition date to 24 Sep 07.

NOTES:
  1. Interim Disposition Date: Do not subtract one day from the interim disposition date.
   2. Final Disposition Date: Subtract one day from the date in item 4 of the AF IMT 3070 or section V
      of AF IMT 1058 to determine the final disposition date.
   3. AF IMT 1058: If there is more than 14 days between the date the commander signed the AF IMT
      1058 and the date of an LOR, annotate the discrepancy in an MFR and use the date of the LOR
      when determining the disposition date. File the MFR in the UIF with the AF IMT 1058.

A3.3. When the commander places a member on the control roster and the UIF also has an Article 15
action in it; the control roster (interim UIF code 2) takes precedence over the Article 15 (UIF code 3). If
the Article 15 punishment is not complete when the control roster expires, update the interim UIF to code
3 and add an interim UIF disposition date for the remainder of the punishment period. Update the UIF
code to 1 and adjust the UIF disposition date when punishment is complete.

A3.4. DELETED.

A3.5. A TR notice alerts the UIF monitor when an UIF is about to expire. If there is no new information
to add to the UIF, allow the code and date to expire automatically and is destroy the UIF (see Table 2.3.).
For officers only: If an officer has an UIF based on a record of conviction adjudged by court martial or

yr, or death and receives an assignment prior to the UIF expiration date, do not allow the UIF to expire
until it has been on file for 4 years or PCS plus 1-year, whichever is later. PCS plus 1 year is based on
DAS at the new duty station. If an officer has an UIF and will separate or transfer to the USAFR prior to
the UIF expiration date, do not allow the UIF to expire until is has been on file for 4 years or separation/
transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.

UIF monitor will establish a disposition date on an individual basis.

A3.7. Step-by-Step Instructions for Removing an UIF
     A3.7.1. Officer UIFs can only be deleted via MilPDS, and should only be updated upon receipt of an
     AF IMT 1058 or memorandum from the Wing Commander/ equivalent, or issuing authority which-
     ever is higher authorizing the deletion of the UIF. Never update without a source document. Enlisted
     UIFs can be deleted using PC-III or MilPDS and should be updated upon receipt of an AF IMT 1058
     from the unit commander or higher commander.
        A3.7.1.1. In MilPDS, click Customer Support, Career Enhancements, Misc. Actions, then Officer
        Quality Force or Enlisted Quality Force.
        A3.7.1.2. Once at the Officer or Enlisted Quality Force screen, hit the F7 key.
        A3.7.1.3. Type in the member's SSAN with dashes.
        A3.7.1.4. Hit the F8 key to execute the search.
        A3.7.1.5. When the member's name/data comes up on screen, click on the Quality Info button.
        A3.7.1.6. A long, rectangular "details" block will now appear on screen. (Don't open the "details"
        block) Just place your cursor in the small, narrow "box" on the left side of the details block.
        A3.7.1.7. Click the Delete Record icon (red "X" icon at the top (middle) of your screen).
        A3.7.1.8. MilPDS will ask if you really want to do this. Click on "yes", to delete the UIF. The
        UIF data in the details block will disappear.
        A3.7.1.9. Click the "save" icon ("yellow disk" icon at the top (left) of your screen). This action
        will delete the UIF data, and save the removal transaction. If you fail to take this step, the update
        won't save.

offending member along with an AF IMT 1058 before establishing an UIF. Do not use AF IMT 1058 if
you file an optional Article 15 in the UIF. NOTE: Mandatory UIF documents (Article 15s with punish-
ment exceeding 1 month {31 days or more}, court-martial or civilian court convictions) are not referred
via AF IMT 1058.
1.3.2. For officers, commanders refer optional documents (LOAs, LOCs) to the offending member along
with an AF IMT 1058 before establishing a UIF. Mandatory UIF documents (Article 15s, court-martial or
civilian court convictions) are not referred via AF IMT 1058. LORs are mandatory for file in an officer’s
UIF, and must be entered into the UIF via AF IMT 1058, but the commander does not need to submit the
AF IMT 1058 to the officer. The officer is provided an opportunity to refute the LOR when it is initially

duty days allowed for acknowledging intended actions, the individual has 30 calendar days from the date
of receipt of the certified letter to acknowledge the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent
information before the commander makes the final decision. In calculating the time to respond, the date
of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of the postmark on
the envelope will serve as the date of acknowledgment. The individual is presumed to be in receipt of
official correspondence if it is delivered by certified mail to the individual’s address or best available
address.

member’s response to the Article 15 action, considered as a basis for imposing punishment, or vacating a
40                                                                            AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005


suspended punishment, or submitted by the offender in mitigation, extenuation, or defense or on appeal
are not part of the record. File these materials at the office of the servicing SJA of the commander who
initiated the Article 15 as attachments to that office’s copy of the action.
1.3.4.3. The commander forwards copies of adverse administrative actions, LORs, and AF IMT 1137s
and 1058s:
1.3.4.3.1. For active duty General officers, general officer selects, colonels and colonel selects to the Air

Blvd, Suite 400, Rosslyn, VA 22209-2131.
1.3.4.4. DELETED.
1.3.4.5. For officers in the grade of colonel and above (active duty, guard and reserve): A commander’s
decision to place adverse information in an UIF or the Officer Selection Record (OSR) is unrelated to the
SecAF’s decision to place this information in the Senior Officer Unfavorable Information File (SOUIF).
Therefore, commanders will forward copies of all adverse information to SAF/IG, 1140 Air Force Penta-
gon, Washington D.C. 20330, according to AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints. The SOUIF pro-
cess is described in AFI 90-301 and 36-2501, Officer Promotions and Selective Continuation.
1.3.4.6. For officers in the grade of Lieutenant Colonel and below: send a copy of the initial and updated
AF IMT 1137 to the officer’s servicing and gaining MAJCOM/DPP.

PC-III IAW Table 2.1. and Table 2.2., when a commander establishes a UIF or adds/removes documents
from a member's UIF.
1.4.4. Commanders decide what to do with optional UIF documents. After initially deciding not to estab-
lish a UIF, commanders may elect to establish a UIF or include an earlier administrative action in a previ-
ously established UIF if the date of the action or document is within 6 months from the date of the action.
This does not apply to individuals who have reenlisted since the date of the document.
1.4.6. See Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. for a list of documents that the UIF monitor must file.
NOTE: DELETED.

1.5. Updating UIF Documents (see Attachment 3).
1.5.1. Unit UIF Monitor. Once documents are received from the unit commander, base staff judge advo-
cate, or social actions officer the unit UIF monitor updates UIF actions in PC-III or PDS in a timely man-
ner. At PC-III units, the PDS automatically relays each UIF update throughout the MPF. The base UIF

1.5.2.2. The Customer Service Element files a copy of all executed grade reductions (demotion order)
received from the Career Enhancement Element as the source document of the new grade and date of
rank.
1.5.2.3 The Personnel Relocations Element:
1.5.2.3.1. Updates and maintains assignment availability codes.
1.5.2.3.2. Ensure members remain qualified to possess the current Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).
1.5.2.3.3. Ensures members pending or with approved formal training, retraining, or reclassification,
remain qualified.
1.5.2.3.4. When the commander initiates or updates a UIF on an IMA, the UIF monitor will forward on
copy of all of the information to the MAJCOM/AF Element Program Manager and HQ ARPC/DPRFQ.
1.6.1.4. OPR and EPR rating officials, when preparing to write or endorse an OPR, EPR, Promotion Rec-
ommendation Form (PRF) or recommending an enlisted member for reenlistment, extension, or a Career
Job Reservation (CJR).
1.7.3. The UIF monitor (base and unit):
1.7.4. The base UIF monitor will audit all existing UIFs at least bi-annually by comparing the PDS to

1.7.6. Document reviews via memorandum signed by the base and unit UIF monitor as applicable to the
type of review conducted. Upon completion of a review, each UIF monitor files it in the general corre-
spondence file.
1.7.7. Unit commanders or first sergeants review the MPF’s audit and commander's self-inspection
checklist.
1.9. Removal of UIFs or their Documents.
1.9.1. Commanders maintain the UIF and all of its documents/contents until the final disposition date
(Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.) unless early removal of the document or UIF is clearly warranted. Command-
ers initiate removal action via AF IMT 1058 or memorandum, and the individual should acknowledge the
action.
1.9.2. UIF monitors:

unit commander for enlisted members .
1.9.2.6. The wing commander (or equivalent), imposing or issuing authority, whichever is higher, may
direct removal of derogatory data from the OSR at any time; or the officer may appeal to have the derog-
atory data removed after one In the Promotion Zone (IPZ) or Above the Promotion Zone (APZ) consider-
ation. (See AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System). Removing an officer’s UIF early does not
remove the derogatory data (if filed) from the Officer Selection Record (OSR).
1.9.2.6.1. The MAJCOM/FOA Records Custodian removes the documents from the Officer Command
Selection Record Group (OCSRGp) upon receipt of their copy of the approved early removal decision
memorandum and destroys all related documents.

Element Program Manager and HQ ARPC/DPRFQ.
1.9.5. Commanders are prohibited from removing any documents or adjusting disposition dates for Arti-
cle 15, or court-martial punishment, sentence, judgment, or action that is not complete. (For example: If
an Article 15, punishment calls for 45 days extra duty, the Article 15, cannot be removed from an individ-
ual’s UIF until the 45 days extra duty is performed.)
1.9.6. For IMA’s, provide a copy of an adjusted AF IMT 1137 to the MAJCOM/AF Element Program
Manager and HQ ARPC/DPRFQ.
1.10.1. See Table 2.3. for when and how to dispose of UIFs. Effective May 1998, unexpired UIFs are
transferred between the active, ANG, and Reserve components on all personnel (officer and enlisted) sep-
arating or transferring between the active duty and Reserve components. This includes the transfer of
unexpired UIFs within the Reserve components for officer and enlisted members.
1.10.3. If the individual is absent without leave (AWOL) or in deserter status before or on the UIF expi-
ration date, the unit commander notifies the UIF monitor in writing of the individual’s status. The notifi-
cation letter serves as a source document for the PDS update. The UIF monitor retains the UIF and
updates the UIF disposition date to "8 Aug 3888" (indefinite). Do not annotate the AF IMT 1137 (see
Table 2.3.).
1.10.4. The UIF monitor maintains the UIF for members in dropped-from-rolls status. When the UIF
expires, the monitor annotates the AF IMT 1137 to show the date the member entered dropped-from-rolls
status, has it signed by the commander, and forwards it to the MPF, Personnel Employment Section. If
returned to duty at a later date the unit commander advises the UIF monitor to destroy the UIF or estab-
lishes a new UIF disposition date. This date is no more than 3 months from the date the commander signs
the UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the member’s change in status. If a document is added to the
UIF before the end of the 3 months, the UIF disposition date is extended. If a document is not added, the
UIF is destroyed at the end of the 3 months (see Table 2.3.).
44                                                                              AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005

NOTES:
1. Also applies to Article 15 punishment imposed on an Air Force member of a joint command by a com-
mander of a different service when processed in accordance with AFI 51-202.
2. The servicing SJA specifies in writing whether the action is mandatory or optional for file in the UIF.
The determination accompanies the record of court action (conviction or judgment) or is written and
signed on the record itself. If mandatory for file, the SJA sends the record and determination directly to
the UIF monitor with a copy to the member's commander for action.
3. PCS plus 1 year is determined by adding 1 year to the individual’s Date Arrive Station (DAS). If indi-
vidual’s UIF is due to expire prior to the individual departing PCS, extend the UIF (do not let it expire) for
1 year from RNLTD. The gaining UIF monitor makes appropriate PDS/PC-III adjustments when the indi-
vidual’s record is gained to file. For Reservists, extend the UIF (do not let it expire) for 1 year from the
effective date change strength accountability [EDCSA], the date the Reservist changes assignment. For
active duty officers that will separate or transfer to the USAFR do not let the UIF expire. Extend the dis-
position date to reflect 2 years or separation or transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.
4. HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months, for
Reserve personnel if deemed appropriate.
5. If the Article 15 punishment is a Letter of Reprimand only, then the update of UIF code 1 with a 2 year
disposition date is appropriate.

NOTES:
1. Includes any suspended punishment. Longer than a month equals 31 days or more. Less than a month
equals 30 days or less.
2. The servicing SJA specifies in writing whether the action is mandatory or optional for file in the UIF.
The determination accompanies the record of court action (conviction or judgment) or is written and
signed on the record itself. If mandatory for file, the SJA sends the record and determination directly to
the UIF monitor with a copy to the member's commander for action.
3. HQ AFRC or HQ ARPC may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months, for
Reserve personnel, if deemed appropriate.
4. Also applies to Article 15 punishment imposed on an Air Force member of a joint command by a com-
mander of a different service when processed in accordance with AFI 51-202.


3.1. Who Can Use Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands. Commanders, supervisors, and other
persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands. These actions are
intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of performance, con-
duct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and whose actions degrade the individual and unit's mission.
This includes issuing administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands to Reservists who commit
an offense while in civilian status.
3.1.1. Raters must consider making comments on performance reports when the ratee receives any of
these adverse actions
AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005                                                                                  51


3.1.2. Written administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the rules of access,
protection, and disclosure outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974, System of Records, F035 AF MP L. The
same rules apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in an individual's UIF or
the unit's Personnel Information File (PIF).
3.2. Records of Individual Counseling (RIC). Counseling helps people use good judgment, assume
responsibility, and face and solve problems. Counselors assist subordinates in developing skills, attitudes,
and behaviors that are consistent with maintaining the Air Force's readiness.
3.2.2. AF IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling (RIC), records the counseling session. It pro-
vides a record of positive or negative counseling and is useful when completing performance evaluations.
Documenting counseling sessions on bond paper or letterhead constitutes a Letter of Counseling (LOC) if
you don't have access to an AF IMT 174.
3.2.3. Front line supervisors and first sergeants may recommend the commander file negative or unfavor-
able RICs or LOCs in the UIF. For officer personnel, if the LOC is not filed in the UIF, it must be filed in
the individual’s PIF.
3.4.1. For officer personnel only: If a person other than the unit commander issues a LOR, send it to the
unit commander for acknowledgment and endorsement via AF IMT 1058 and establish/file in an UIF.
Include the member’s written acknowledgment and any documents submitted by the member.
3.4.2. The AF IMT 1058 does not need to be referred to the officer since the rebuttal opportunity is
offered at the time the LOR is administered (see paragraph 3.5.1.). The AF IMT 1058 is used only to
obtain the commander’s acknowledgment of the action (for LORs administered by personnel other than
the commander) and to refer the LOR for file in the UIF.
3.5.1.6. The person who initiates the RIC, LOC, LOA, or LOR has 3 duty days to advise the individual of
their final decision regarding any comments submitted by the individual. For Non-EAD Reservists: the
initiator has 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to reply to the member.
3.5.3. The person who initiates a LOA or LOR for a general officer or general officer select will forward
the original document and attachments to AFSLMO or RESOMO for distribution to the commander.
Mailing addresses are listed in paragraph 1.3.4.3. or 1.9.4.

                      Procedures for Updating the Personnel Data System (PDS)
A3.1. The commander is responsible for the accuracy and validity of UIF data. The Base or Unit UIF
monitor updates the following codes and disposition dates in the PDS when directed by the commander or
SJA IAW Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.:
A3.1.1. Code 1 - UIF only
A3.1.2. Code 2 - Control Roster and UIF
A3.1.3. Code 3 - Punishment, Article 15, or court-martial
54                                                                            AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005


A3.2. The PDS monitors the expiration and proper disposal of the UIF using the UIF disposition date. As
documents are placed in or removed from the UIF, the UIF disposition date must be adjusted. The PDS
identifies preliminary UIF actions by the interim disposition date, such as Article 15 or court-martial pun-
ishment, or placement on the control roster. Establish the final UIF disposition date when the interim
period is over. For example: Article 15 punishment is for 2 months. The commander signs item 4 on the
AF IMT 3070 on 26 Sep 04. The interim UIF code is 3 and the interim UIF disposition date is the date
punishment will be completed or is suspended to. If no additional documents are added to the UIF prior
to the expiration of the interim date, the code is adjusted from 3 to 1 and the final UIF disposition date is
25 Sep 06, one day less than the document’s effective date plus the 2-year final retention duration. Then
on      18 Sep 06 the individual receives a LOR and the commander completes the AF IMT 1058 on 25
Sep 06. Update the disposition date to 24 Sep 07.
Notes:
1. Interim Disposition Date: Do not subtract one day from the interim disposition date.
2. Final Disposition Date: Subtract one day from the date in item 4 of the AF IMT 3070 or section V of
AF IMT 1058 to determine the final disposition date.
3. AF IMT 1058: If there is more than 14 days between the date the commander signed the AF IMT 1058
and the date of an LOR, annotate the discrepancy in an MFR and use the date of the LOR when determin-
ing the disposition date. File the MFR in the UIF with the AF IMT 1058.


A3.3. When the commander places a member on the control roster and the UIF also has an Article 15
action in it; the control roster (interim UIF code 2) takes precedence over the Article 15 (UIF code 3). If
the Article 15 punishment is not complete when the control roster expires, update the interim UIF to code
3 and add an interim UIF disposition date for the remainder of the punishment period. Update the UIF
code to 1 and adjust the UIF disposition date when punishment is complete.
A3.4. DELETED.
A3.5. A TR notice alerts the UIF monitor when an UIF is about to expire. If there is no new information
to add to the UIF, allow the code and date to expire automatically and is destroy the UIF (see Table 2.3.).
For officers only: If an officer has an UIF based on a record of conviction adjudged by court martial or
any amended records or a record of conviction by a civilian court (foreign or domestic) or an action tanta-
mount to a finding of guilty for an offense that carries a possible sentence of confinement for more than 1
yr, or death and receives an assignment prior to the UIF expiration date, do not allow the UIF to expire
until it has been on file for 4 years or PCS plus 1-year, whichever is later. PCS plus 1 year is based on
DAS at the new duty station. If an officer has an UIF and will separate or transfer to the USAFR prior to
the UIF expiration date, do not allow the UIF to expire until is has been on file for 4 years or separation/
transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.
A3.6. PDS will not be updated for general officer or general officer selects. The AFSLMO or RESOMO
UIF monitor will establish a disposition date on an individual basis.
A3.7. Step-by-Step Instructions for Removing an UIF
A3.7.1. Officer UIFs can only be deleted via MilPDS, and should only be updated upon receipt of an AF
IMT 1058 or memorandum from the Wing Commander/ equivalent, or issuing authority whichever is
higher authorizing the deletion of the UIF. Never update without a source document. Enlisted UIFs can
AFI36-2907 17 JUNE 2005                                                                                    55


be deleted using PC-III or MilPDS and should be updated upon receipt of an AF IMT 1058 from the unit
commander or higher commander.
A3.7.1.1. In MilPDS, click Customer Support, Career Enhancements, Misc. Actions,
then Officer Quality Force or Enlisted Quality Force.
A3.7.1.2. Once at the Officer or Enlisted Quality Force screen, hit the F7 key.
A3.7.1.3. Type in the member's SSAN with dashes.
A3.7.1.4. Hit the F8 key to execute the search.
A3.7.1.5. When the member's name/data comes up on screen, click on the Quality Info button.
A3.7.1.6. A long, rectangular "details" block will now appear on screen. (Don't open the "details" block)
Just place your cursor in the small, narrow "box" on the left side of the details block.
A3.7.1.7. Click the Delete Record icon (red "X" icon at the top (middle) of your screen).
A3.7.1.8. MilPDS will ask if you really want to do this. Click on "yes", to delete the UIF. The UIF data
in the details block will disappear.
A3.7.1.9. Click the "save" icon ("yellow disk" icon at the top (left) of your screen). This action will
delete the UIF data, and save the removal transaction. If you fail to take this step, the update won't save.
