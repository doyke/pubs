                 OFFICER ADVANCED ACADEMIC DEGREE SYSTEM (AADS)

1.1. Objective. Graduate Education programs are designed to manage limited resources and support
National, Military, and Air Force strategic objectives in an increasingly complex international environ-
ment with rapidly changing science and technology. Graduate education requirements are identified as
specific positions for which an Advanced Academic Degree (AAD) is necessary to accomplish the job
and meet the overall Air Force mission. It applies to all Air Force active duty line officer positions in the
grade of lieutenant colonel and below. It does not apply to US Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard
members.

1.2. Concept.
   1.2.1. An advanced academic degree position is a manpower authorization which prescribes a degree
   level and also an academic specialty. AAD positions are the basis of the AF funded graduate education
   program. A position validated as requiring an AAD means the incumbent cannot optimally perform
   the job without the specific advanced degree. The basis for Air Force AAD-funded quota require-
   ments are projected vacancies due to personnel rotations or new degree requirements. If the Air Force
   cannot fill the mission critical positions with the current officer inventory, then a limited number of
   officers will receive graduate education through AFIT. Whenever possible, officers selected to com-
   plete graduate education will complete this education in-residence at AFIT (exceptions must be
   approved by USAF/DPDE). Graduates of the funded graduate education program will normally serve
   in an AAD position immediately following graduation, but must serve in an AAD position no later
   than the second tour following completion of the funded education.
   1.2.2. GEMS identifies, approves, and manages AAD funded quota requirements to ensure the Air
   Force educates to valid requirements. The AAD Task List in Attachment 2 outlines the specific pro-
   cess to be followed to: validate AAD position requirements; request and approve quota allocations;
   assign officers to AFIT; and, upon graduation, manage graduates in their follow-on AAD tour.
   1.2.3. Officers in the rank of lieutenant colonel and above will not normally be considered for newly
   established degrees requirements.

1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. HQ USAF/DPD:
       1.3.1.1. Establishes policies for identifying and validating AAD funded quota requirements.

       generally be at the Air Staff, but MAJCOM or FOA representatives may also serve as ASMs if
       there is sufficient justification. They are the POC for organizational and unit functional managers
       seeking AAD information.
       1.3.4.3. Provide special guidance as necessary to AF/DPDE for inclusion in the annual data call
       to the field.

6                                                                           AFI36-2302 11 JULY 2001


       1.3.11.2. Supervisors annually survey all of their line officer Unit Manpower Document (UMD)
       authorizations in the grade of lieutenant colonel and below to determine AAD position coding and
       annual graduate education quota requirements. Identified requirements will be annotated on an AF
       Form 1779 (Attachment 7) and forwarded through channels.

1.4. Waiver Requests. All AAD waiver requests will be forwarded through the chain to AFPC/DPA.
Waivers can be disapproved at any level; however, they will only be approved by the AFPC/DPA or AF/
DP, as defined in the waiver process. Approval may be delegated to AFPC/DPA. Requestors will provide
the ASM and USAF/DPDEE a copy of the approved waiver request. The ASMs will maintain a record of
all requests and outcomes. See Attachment 3 for the waiver request format.

1.5. Health Professionals
    1.5.1. The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) is not considered as part of the AAD program, as they
    receive separate funding for their education and training activities. The Surgeon General, USAF, con-
    venes an annual board called the Integrated Forecast Board (IFB) in the spring of each year. The IFB
    serves functions similar to the AFERB but for the AFMS. The IFB reviews requests for training, pri-
    oritizes these requests, and then allocates available training manyears among the five health profes-
    sional corps in accordance with the established priority. The IFB reviews requests for AAD, Graduate
    Medical Education (GME, ie., clinical residencies and fellowships), Graduate Dental Education
    (GDE, ie., clinical residencies and fellowships), Education With Industry, and fellowships at the Air
    Staff, MAJCOM. After the IFB concludes its annual meeting, the five health professional corps con-
    vene a selection board to select officers for the education and training programs approved by the IFB.
    1.5.2. Prior to the IFB, the AFMS conducts an annual review and validation of all billets coded as
    AAD. The Surgeon General’s Specialty Consultants serve as Career Field Managers and perform the
    annual review of AAD coded positions. Consultants forward their proposed requirements to HQ
    USAF/SGW. A board consisting of the Directors of the Health Professional Corps, serving as Aca-
    demic Specialty Monitors, reviews and validates requirements for AAD coding. HQ USAF/SGW for-
    wards approved requests for AAD coding directly to MAJCOMs for processing.

       coordination and final approval for new PCE courses.
   2.3.3. Air Force ASMs:
       2.3.3.1. ASMs (or PCE Points of Contact (POC)) are the key to the success of the PCE Program.
       A list of current ASMs (to include PCE POCs when not the same) is available from HQ AETC/
       EDCFR or USAF/DPDE.
       2.3.3.2. The ASMs represent the Air Force-wide functional perspective for PCE requirements.
       ASMs will generally be at the Air Staff, but MAJCOM or FOA representatives may also serve as
       ASMs if there is sufficient justification. They are the POC between user organizations and the
       functional managers seeking information about PCE requirements.
       2.3.3.3. Provide special guidance as necessary to be included in the annual PCE PGL.
       2.3.3.4. Provide guidance and criteria to assist MAJCOMs in identifying PCE requirements dur-

       Group.
       2.3.3.7. Coordinate with HQ AETC/EDCFR/EDXP on development, conduct, curriculum, and
       administration of new or modified programs to meet Air Force requirements.
    2.3.4. MAJCOMs. MAJCOM functional managers should involve their base-level units in identify-
    ing, validating, and prioritizing PCE requirements. They identify the total executable requirements for
    training conducted at AETC resident centers, schools, or by other services with quotas managed by
    Air University. Executable is defined as the number of quotas that can be used (number of personnel
    that require the training and can be released) in a fiscal year regardless of funding type, e.g., AETC/
    AU or MAJCOM/unit.
    MAJCOM functional managers consolidate all training requirements and forward to their MAJCOM/
    DPs for final assessment. The assessment will include a summary, listing the total number of require-
    ments prioritized by levels 1, 2, and 3, as well as by categories 1-7 (detailed instructions are contained
    in the annual data call).
    Levels by definition are:
    Level 1 - Mission Accomplishment. Accomplishment of the AF mission objective will not occur if the
    training requirement is not satisfied. As the most urgent level, these requirements take priority over all
    other MAJCOM training requirements. In using this rating, Commanders are saying the training is
    critical for accomplishing the day to day mission and, if AF funds cannot support the need, then unit
    funds will be used because the training is essential.
    Level 2 - Mission Sustainment. Training required to maintain the AF’s readiness posture. This training
    is needed to minimize the erosion factor.
    Level 3 - Mission Enhancement. Training that fosters the effective use of resources to improve AF’s
    mission capability.
    Level 1 training requirements must be accompanied by mission impact statements and certified by the
    commander (as designated by the MAJCOM but no lower than unit level
    Within level 1, 2, or 3, rankings by category are provided:
    Category: appropriate category number is selected from the following list:
    1-Required by law
    2-Required for person to fill position
    3-Required for a certification used by the AF
    4-Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) establishing AF as only DoD teacher of class
    5-Enhances duty performance, etc.

ASC—An Academic Specialty Code is a four character code which defines the academic field of study
required for a particular position. The first character in the code denotes the general area of study
(engineering, physical science, social science, etc.). The second character denotes the major academic
field. The other characters represent specialties and subspecialties. For further guidance concerning
academic specialty codes for graduate degree programs specific to AFIT, contact AFIT/RRA.
ASMs—Academic Specialty Monitors are primarily functional managers for the Air Force who use a
particular type of degree. Monitors will generally be at Air Staff, but MAJCOM or FOA representatives
may also serve as ASMs if there is sufficient justification. The monitors represent the Air Force-wide
functional perspective for degree requirements. They can also act as the POC between organizations and
the functional managers seeking information about degree requirements. ASMs also those POCs
representing PCE. Air Staff, MAJCOM or FOA representatives may also serve as PCE POCs. However,
PCE POCs may be separate individuals from those concerned with advanced academic degrees.

AFI36-2302 11 JULY 2001                                                                                  33



GENERAL: Complete one worksheet for each AAD position. Entries must be legible, either typed or
printed. This worksheet is the only acceptable form; others will be returned without action. Refer to
instructions below.


SUPERVISORS: The AAD worksheet has two purposes:


SECTION I - CURRENT POSITION INFORMATION
-First, to request a change to the AAD coding for a position in your organization. To make an AAD cod-
ing change request, or to document that a specific, previously uncoded position must have an individual
assigned to it with a particular Academic Specialty Code (ASC), complete Sections I, II, and IV of the
AAD worksheet.

- Second, to request a fresh graduate education degree for a position. Rather than fill a position from the
inven-tory, this request initiates a start in a graduate program that will fill your AAD-coded position
upon graduation. To request a new graduate quota to satisfy future needs, complete Sections I, II, III, and
IV of the worksheet.Note: If you wish to initiate/change the AAD coding for a position and request a
graduate education quota, complete all sections (I-IV) of the AAD worksheet.sheet.

Note: If you wish to initiate/change the AAD coding for a position and request a graduate education
quota, complete all sections (I-IV) of the AAD worksheet.

     a. Position Number: Position Control Number (MPCN) from manpower documents.
     b. AFSC: Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) attached to the position number identified.
     c. Grade: Grade authorized for position involved.
     d. PAS: Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code assigned to position and location.
     e. Unit/Org/Office Symbol: Unit or Organizational designation and office symbol.
     f. Academic Specialty Code (ASC): Four-digit code of the degree required to perform duties of this
position. ASC listings and titles are available at {http://afit.edu}. The ASC must be compatible with the

     g. Degree Levels: Degree required to meet AF mission - Masters or Ph.D.
     h. ASC Title: Clear text title of the ASC
     i. MAJCOM: Major Command abbreviation: ACC, AETC, AMC, etc.


  SECTION II - UMD ACTION REQUIRED

     b. Change - Already an AAD billet, but requires a change in ASC or degree level.
34                                                                           AFI36-2302 11 JULY 2001


     c. Delete - Position no longer requires an AAD; delete ASC code.
      d. Position Description/Rationale for Action Requested - Must be completed to determine validity
of the AAD requirement whenever there is: a new AAD requirement or a change to an existing require-
ment. Include precise, specific statements why an individual with an advanced degree must be assigned to
this job. Describe responsibilities/projects/research to be accomplished and need for graduate education
only available through formal graduate education programs. Be as clear, precise and informative as possi-
ble. Limit input to the space provided.


     SECTION III - NEW AIR FORCE GRADUATE EDUCATION QUOTA


     Request for student entering AFIT program to obtain a fresh degree. Complete this sec-
     tion only if this position requires assignment of an officer who must have a “new” degree. A
     "new" degree is needed to ensure state-of-the-art technology or research. The determination of
     the need for a "new" degree should be made at lowest possible level; i.e., supervisor with
     first-hand knowledge of what new degree, if any, is required to ensure overall project/program
     success.

       Justification for Grad-Ed Quota - Mandatory for all new graduate education quota requests,
       which must be approved by the Air Force Education Requirements Board (AFERB). Since
       competing for scarce resources demands a strong justification in today’s budget environ
       ment, the AFERB requires specific and significant linkage to the Air Force mission be
       clearly stated in all requests.


     SECTION IV - AUTHENTICATION/APPROVAL

       a. Supervisor - Rater who can answer specific questions about the AAD requirement.
       b. Division Chief (or above) - The approving official at a level one step higher than the supervisor
       of the AAD position.
       c. Functional - Installation-level functional OPR - if applicable.
       d. Installation Staff - Installation AAD OPR reviews, verifies and forwards to Wing Commander
       for review and certification.
       Note: Wing Commander - Reviews, approves and signs transmittal letter prepared by installation
       staff, to MAJCOM/XP, validating that attached base AAD billet/new graduate education quota
       requests are an absolute must to meet the Air Force mission.

   SECTION V - MAJCOM and HQ USAF ACTION

     a. MAJCOM XP reviews inputs from bases to ensure submissions are accurate and complete.
     Then forwards to MAJCOM DP for review and action. Upon completion of DP and functional
     review, XP ensures AAD billet data is updated in UMD.
     b. MAJCOM DP Officer Assignments checks requests to ensure that submissions are not placed
     against positions: that already have AAD graduates on them/inbound at the time of this student
     would graduate; that will expire before the graduate completes his/her degree; or for which the
     AFSC and ASC are incompatible. Then forwards submission to MAJCOM DP AAD Manager.
     c. MAJCOM DP AAD Manager reviews worksheets and coordinates verification of AAD and
     new AFIT graduate education degree requirements with the headquarters functionals.
     d. MAJCOM functionals, upon receipt of AAD input from the MAJCOM DP, reviews and vali
     dates applicable AAD billet and new graduate education quota requirements. Then determines
     whether installation input is adequate, making appropriate revisions and adjustments. Prioritizes
     new quota requirements, before signing, dating and returning AAD work sheets to the MAJCOM
     DP.
     e. MAJCOM DP AAD Manager consolidates the MAJCOM’s AAD validation and new graduate
     education quota submission and forwards it through XP to the Vice Commander for signature and
     follow-on submission to HQ USAF/DP, the applicable Academic Specialty Managers (ASM), HQ
     AETC/EDCFR and AFIT/RRE.
     f. MAJCOM Vice Commander reviews and signs transmittal verifying MAJCOM AAD billet
     validations and new graduate education quota requests. Applicable AAD forms are attached to CV
