     area who are interested in a career in Law Enforcement.
     1.2. Sponsors of the interested party should contact the Police Services office (DSN: 246-

     program.

     Services Office or route it with their daily paperwork.
     2.2. Police Services will serve as the liaison between the participant(s) and the on-duty
     element leader, flight chief, or higher authority for times when a person is able to ride-along.
     2.3. The on-duty flight chief will personally select a Security Forces patrolman as the
     representative for the guest to accompany.
     2.4. The guest will be briefed on the following program requirements:
        2.4.1. The guest is not allowed to respond with the patrol to incidents involving the
        possibility of weapons or situations determined by the patrol as dangerous. If the patrol
        has to respond to a potentially dangerous situation, the guest will be dropped off at the
        safest location possible and picked up by another patrol.
        2.4.2. The guest will follow the directions of patrol personnel at all times.
        2.4.3. The patrol will brief the guest on general Security Forces duties and mission.
        2.4.4. The BDOC Controller will be briefed on the exact location of the guest.
        2.4.5. After the guest has been briefed on the proper radio procedures, they may be
        allowed, at the discretion and supervision of the patrol and the element leader, to use the
        Security Forces radio for short routine transmissions.
