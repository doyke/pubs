and building 221 (hush house 3) will have the canopy closed at all times unless personnel are
actively working in the cockpit. If canopy cannot be lowered due to current maintenance actions
the cockpit area will be covered with a canvas sheet or thick plastic sheet (garbage bags are not
acceptable) and secured to prevent falling or blowing off. Note: When pushing F-16 aircraft
into or removing aircraft from any hangar (Hangars 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and building 99) the tow bar
wheels must be lowered (unless using the upper pintle hook) while crossing door tracks to

procedure.
16.1.12.2. (Added) Ejection seat raise and/or tilt operations may be conducted outside except
during inclement weather (seat will interfere with closing the canopy). Otherwise, aircraft will
be inside approved PAS. Note: Egress personnel must be on duty if a seat is raised to the
maintenance position at an outside location. When personnel are going off duty the seat will be
 38        AFI21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 4 JUNE 2012


lowered to allow the canopy to be closed. Seats will not be left in the raised position overnight
unless the aircraft is inside an approved shelter.
16.1.12.2.1. (Added) If the aircraft needs to be put on jacks or towed the seat must first be
lowered.
16.1.13. (Added) Maintenance Procedures.

conducting any ejection seat removal/installation actions.
16.3.2.1. (Added) Egress personnel may ride in the cargo compartment of an explosive-laden
vehicle. No more than three personnel and two seat assemblies may be transported together in
the cargo compartment. Personnel must be seated and seat assemblies will be safed and secured
as prescribed in AFMAN 91-201_USAFESUP. Protective containers will be used to transport
detonators, initiators, squibs and other such electrically or mechanically actuated devices to
prevent item-to-item contact. The container must be marked properly, identifying its contents.
16.3.3.1. (Added) AMUs will maintain the serviceability of flight status pins and safety
devices installed on aircraft egress systems.
16.3.4. (Added) The following actions are prohibited when egress personnel are performing
aircraft maintenance:
16.3.4.1. (Added) Performing other maintenance on aircraft without prior approval from the
egress team leader.
16.3.4.2. (Added) Disrupting work in progress, except in emergency situations and only after
reaching a safe stopping point.

disconnected to prevent stress on canopy hinge points.
16.10.2.1. (Added) The egress section will provide an A-10 and F-16 certified egress person to
teach cockpit familiarization training for the Training Detachment 17 (Det 17) if the Det 17
instructor is TDY, on leave and/or performing instructor duty.
16.10.2.2. (Added) Completed training will be documented on the automated training product.
The MTF will be responsible for scheduling training.
16.12.5.4. (Added)       The egress section will perform a 100% Cartridge-Actuated
Device/Pressure Actuated Device (CAD/PAD) verification of any serially-controlled item being
cannibalized prior to installation.
