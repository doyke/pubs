                                            Chapter 1

                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1. Nuclear Certification. The Air Force Nuclear Certification Program ensures all
procedures, equipment, software, facilities, personnel, and organizations are certified before
conducting nuclear operations with nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems. Nuclear
certification occurs when a determination is made by the Air Force that procedures, equipment,
software, and facilities are sufficient to perform nuclear weapon functions and personnel and
organizations are capable of performing assigned nuclear missions. Nuclear Certification is a
part of Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E), as directed by AFI 63-1201,
Life Cycle System Engineering. Nuclear Certification is required before a nuclear weapon system
or item of equipment can be used to support unit nuclear mission taskings. Note: Essential
Facility Systems of individual buildings/structures to include lightning/side flash protection
systems, facility power systems, hoists, cranes, and similar devices (structural support), physical
facility security systems and software, blast containment/isolation features, electromagnetic
radiation and radiation monitoring that are used to maintain, store or handle nuclear weapons
will be included as part of the certification of Continental United States (CONUS)-based
Weapons Storage Areas (WSAs).
   1.1.1. Nuclear Certified Item (NCI) is defined as procedures, equipment, software, facilities,
   systems, subsystems or components which are nuclear certified In Accordance With (IAW)
   the nuclear certification process outlined in this document. Therefore, NCI consists of
   anything that is nuclear certified. Only nuclear certified items may be used in nuclear
   operations.     The MNCL is a listing of all NCI and can be located at
   https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm, identifies equipment, hardware and
   software that are nuclear certified.
   1.1.2. Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) is defined as peculiar (i.e., system specific) and
   common specialized or non-specialized support equipment whose design meets applicable
   design criteria and is nuclear certified IAW the nuclear certification process outlined in this
   document and identified on the MNCL.
       1.1.2.1. NCE is a subset of NCI that consists of support equipment which is nuclear
       certified. NCE includes vehicles; aerospace ground equipment; munitions material
       handling equipment; facility lifting and suspension equipment; test equipment; automatic
       test equipment (when used in a support function); organizational, field, and depot support
       equipment; and related computer program software.
       1.1.2.2. NCE does not include aircraft components and suspension equipment (e.g.,
       pylons, rotary launchers, bomb racks) nor Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)
       system components and items installed in the launch facility/launch control center. These
       items are referred to as “NCI which are not NCE.”
1.2. Overview of USAF Nuclear Certification Program. As illustrated in Figure 1.1., the Air
Force Nuclear Certification Program has two major elements: Design Certification and
Operational Certification. Design Certification consists of four distinct components representing
nuclear surety-related tasks (Compatibility Certification, Nuclear Safety Design Certification,
Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) Development/Approval, and Technical Order
 6                                            AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


Certification) that must be satisfied in order for a system to be Design Certified. Operational
Certification consists of four interrelated personnel/organizational oriented nuclear surety
components (Task Qualification Training, Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) Certification,
Nuclear Surety Training, and successful completion of an Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection
(INSI)). Together, these two elements and their associated components must be satisfied before
an item can be nuclear certified. Design Certification components identified in the Certification
Requirements Plan (CRP) must be accomplished before the Operational Certification element
can be completed (i.e., The weapon system or item must be Design Certified before the
Lead/Using command can conduct an INSI). Note: Not all components may be required for
nuclear certification. Specific certification requirements will be outlined in the CRP.

Figure 1.1. Nuclear Certification Major Elements and Components.




     1.2.1. The Commander, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) grants nuclear
     certification when the system is Design Certified and at least one operational unit is
     Operationally Certified. The SPM is responsible for obtaining and maintaining Design
     Certification for nuclear weapon capable systems in accordance with requirements identified
     in this AFI. The Lead/Using Command is responsible for obtaining and maintaining a unit’s
     Operational Certification in accordance with this AFI.

   1.2.2. Design Certification occurs when each of the four components (Compatibility,
   Nuclear Safety Design, Weapon System Safety Rules, and Technical Orders) illustrated in
   Figure 1.2. are accomplished for the weapon system or item of equipment.
      1.2.2.1. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Nuclear Systems Division
      (AFNWC/NCS) provides Compatibility Certification for aircraft, air-launched missile
      systems, support equipment, and nuclear maintenance, handling, and storage facilities.
      The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, ICBM Systems Directorate (AFNWC/NI)
      provides Compatibility Certification for ICBM systems. Reference AFI 63-1201; MIL-
      STD-1822A, Nuclear Compatibility Certification of Nuclear Weapon Systems, and
      Support Equipment.
      1.2.2.2. Headquarters Air Force Safety Center (HQ AFSEC) provides Nuclear Safety
      Design Certification. Reference AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Certification
      Program.
      1.2.2.3. The Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group (NWSSG) develops/revises Weapon
      System Safety Rules. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approves them and HQ
      AFSEC publishes them in the form of an AFI. Reference AFI 91-102, Nuclear Weapon
      System Safety Studies, Operational Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules.
      1.2.2.4. The Technical Order Management Agency (TOMA) approves and publishes
      technical orders (TOs). Reference TO 00-5-3, AF Technical Manual Acquisition
      Procedures.
   1.2.3. Operational Certification occurs, as illustrated in Figure 1.3., when the Lead/Using
   Command qualifies a unit’s personnel to perform the mission, certifies them in the PRP,
   trains them in nuclear surety, and assigns a “Ready” rating on an INSI. Each unit must be
   Operationally Certified by the Lead/Using Command to be considered nuclear-mission
   capable. However, Nuclear Certification of a weapon system is granted based on the
   Operational Certification of the first unit. Subsequent units receiving the new or modified
   system/item will undergo an INSI conducted by the using command prior to being
   considered nuclear-capable. Reference AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety
   Program, DoD 5210.42 R-AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
   Program(PRP); AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear
   Weapons Technical Inspection.Note: Not all components may be required for nuclear
   certification. Specific certification requirements will be outlined in the CRP

                          NUCLEAR CERTIFICATION PROCESS

3.1. Process Overview. The Air Force nuclear certification process consists of four phases:
Identification, Administration, Fielding, and Sustainment (Figure 3.1.). See Attachment 2 for a
macro view of the nuclear certification process. The Identification Phase encompasses the
actions taken by the SPM and/or Lead/Using Command to identify the need for and begin the
nuclear certification process. The Administration Phase includes actions necessary to obtain or
continue the nuclear certification of a weapon system, item of equipment, or maintenance,
handling and storage facilities. The Fielding Phase involves releasing hardware, software, or
procedures for the use in, or in support of, a nuclear weapon system or its subsystems. Finally,
the Sustainment Phase begins when the fielding process is complete and includes all the actions
that maintain the nuclear certification status of a weapon system. NOTE: The details of the
activities related to the major components of each phase are provided in NWC HDBK 63-126,
Air Force Nuclear Certification Process Guide, available from AFNWC/NCSC.

Figure 3.1. Nuclear Certification Process Phases.




3.2. Identification Phase. The Identification Phase encompasses: (1) identifying when a new or
modified weapon system, component, nuclear mission support product, or nuclear
maintenance/storage facility requires nuclear certification and determining how a modification
could affect the nuclear certification of an existing weapon system, component, nuclear mission
support product, or nuclear maintenance/storage facility; (2) formally notifying the
AFNWC/NCSC of a potential impact to the nuclear certification of a weapon system,
component, nuclear mission support product, or nuclear maintenance/storage facility via the
Nuclear Certification Impact Statement (NCIS), (3) defining the top level certification
requirements in the Basic Certification Requirements Plan (Basic CRP; and (4) developing and
coordinating the detailed nuclear certification requirements, roles, responsibilities, and schedules
in the CRP.
   3.2.1. The Identification Phase begins with the nuclear weapon system requirements
   identification process. The SPM is provided the direction and resources to deliver a
   capability to the user IAW AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
   Management. In conjunction with the Lead/Using Command, the SPM identifies if the new
   system development/acquisition or modification to an existing weapon system/item of
   support equipment requires nuclear certification or impacts the nuclear certification status of
   the existing system/item. Systems or items requiring nuclear certification should have these
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            21


  requirements documented as early as possible in the requirements generation or acquisition
  process. For new capabilities, nuclear certification requirements should be documented in
  the Capability Development Document (CDD). Lead/Using Commands must identify any
  operational change that impacts nuclear certified weapon systems (e.g., new Primary Nuclear
  Airlift Force (PNAF) certified unit, new unit with nuclear mission, new or modifications to
  nuclear maintenance or storage facilities). New or revised nuclear weapon maintenance or
  test procedures to be conducted in Air Force facilities will be documented and approved IAW
  AFI 91-103, Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program. The first step in the
  Identification process is to identify the requirement for a new item or an item that requires
  modification. The second is to determine if the item or modification will require nuclear
  certification or will change the status of a previously certified item (See Table 4.1. for
  guidance in determining what is required to be nuclear certified). The third step is to
  determine exactly what is required to achieve or maintain the nuclear certification of the
  weapon system or item.
  3.2.2. Nuclear Certification Impact Statement. Once the SPM identifies the need to obtain
  nuclear certification for a new system/item or identifies a potential impact to a nuclear
  certified weapon system’s/item’s nuclear certification it is documented in the Nuclear
  Certification Impact Statement. The NCIS is prepared by the SPM and routed to the
  AFNWC/NCSC through the program office’s Nuclear Certification Manager (Nuclear
  Certification Impact Statement templates can be obtained from the AFNWC/NCSC). The
  NCIS provides the data the AFNWC/NCSC, in coordination with the appropriate process
  owners, uses to determine what certification requirements the program office will have to
  meet in order to get the system/item nuclear certified.
     3.2.2.1. The Nuclear Certification Impact Statement provides a functional description of
     the proposed new system or modification and includes the SPM’s evaluation of its
     potential for nuclear certification impact. Since the NCIS serves as the source document
     for determining the impact the program effort has on nuclear certification, it is important
     that the NCIS address the new acquisition or modification effort in enough detail to allow
     the process owners to effectively evaluate and substantiate the recommended certification
     approach. The NCIS should address potential impacts to compatibility certification
     (reference MIL-STD-1822A), published Technical Orders, published Weapon System
     Safety Rules, and nuclear safety design criteria established in appropriate 91-series
     instructions/manuals (i.e., AFI 91-103, AFMAN 91-118, etc.), and for existing systems,
     degradations to existing nuclear weapon system safety features. Additionally, the NCIS
     should address potential operational certification impacts (e.g., task qualification training,
     the potential need to conduct an initial nuclear surety inspection, etc.).
     3.2.2.2. The AFNWC/NCSC will coordinate the NCIS with the appropriate nuclear
     certification process owners (i.e., HQ AFSEC, the AFNWC/NCS, Lead/Using Command,
     etc.). Process owners will evaluate the NCIS and identify their requirements that the
     program office must meet in order for the system/item to be nuclear certified. If it is
     determined that no certification actions are required, the AFNWC/NCSC will notify the
     SPM via an NCIS Approval Notification Letter. This letter will identify any
     administrative requirements that need to be accomplished by the AFNWC or other
     process owners (e.g., updating the Master Nuclear Certification List or Nuclear
     Compatibility Certification Statement) and that no further certification process actions are
22                                            AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


     required by the program office. If the process owners determine that certification actions
     will be required, the AFNWC/NCSC will notify the SPM via memorandum and will
     coordinate the development of the Basic Certification Requirements Plan.
  3.2.3. Certification Requirements Plan (CRP). The CRP is the document that defines the
  requirements, assigns the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, and describes the
  integrated nuclear configuration of the weapon system or item of equipment or software
  being certified. It defines the process and structure for the certification of a weapon system,
  subsystem, associated specialized and non-specialized support equipment, facilities, and
  software. It defines all of the activities and tasks that must be accomplished in order for
  nuclear certification to be granted. The CRP defines the configuration of the item(s) that will
  undergo nuclear certification and contains certification process schedules, to include nuclear
  certification documentation submittal schedules, and nuclear certification process task
  assignments. The purpose of the CRP is to ensure proper planning for, and communication
  of, a coordinated nuclear certification effort.
     3.2.3.1. If nuclear certification is required, the AFNWC/NCSC will prepare a Basic CRP
     and obtain coordination from all appropriate process owners: the AFNWC/NCS for
     aircraft/air launched delivery systems, support equipment (i.e., bomb loaders, munitions
     handling equipment, etc.) and nuclear maintenance, handling, and storage facility
     compatibility certification; the AFNWC/NI for ground launched missile system
     compatibility certification; HQ AFSEC for nuclear safety design certification and WSSR
     development; the appropriate Technical Order Management Authority for Technical
     Orders; and the Lead/Using Command(s) for Operational Certification. The Basic CRP
     formally identifies to the SPM those certification tasks that need to be satisfied in order to
     achieve nuclear certification. The Basic CRP:
         3.2.3.1.1. Describes basic actions necessary to evaluate new acquisitions or
         modifications for nuclear certification.
         3.2.3.1.2. Identifies the specific certification tasks that must be accomplished, their
         general requirements, and responsibilities of each process owner. Each of the
         required certification processes (i.e., Nuclear Safety Design, Compatibility, etc.) will
         be addressed in separate appendices to the Basic CRP.
         3.2.3.1.3. Identifies the documentation needed to support the certification evaluations
         (e.g., Nuclear Surety Evaluation Report (NSER), Nuclear Safety Analysis Report
         (NSAR), Final Design Approval Report (FDAR), Electrical Interface Control
         Drawing (EICD), and Mechanical Interface Control Drawing (MICD)).
         3.2.3.1.4. Contains a draft schedule identifying major certification and program
         milestones.
         3.2.3.1.5. Contains any other pertinent information that will help the SPM plan for
         and obtain nuclear certification.
     3.2.3.2. The AFNWC/NCSC will coordinate the draft Basic CRP among all the process
     owners to ensure the plan and its appendices accurately capture process owner
     requirements. Once the process owners have coordinated on the draft Basic CRP, it will
     be forwarded to the SPM. The SPM will, in turn, develop the CRP that will be executed.
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            23


      3.2.3.3. The SPM prepared CRP will contain the details regarding how the program
      office will meet the certification requirements identified in the Basic CRP. The CRP will
      be forwarded to the AFNWC/NCSC for final evaluation and coordination from all
      appropriate process owners. When all coordination is complete, the AFNWC/NCSC
      approves the CRP and returns it to the SPM for implementation. Copies will also be
      provided to all appropriate process owners.
      3.2.3.4. Figure 3 2 illustrates the general format for the CRP. A signature page
      included behind the cover page will contain the signatures of the SPM, each of the
      process owners who coordinated on the CRP, and the AFNWC/NCSC indicating
      approval of the CRP. The body of the CRP will contain the introduction, background,
      nuclear certification and nuclear surety synopsis, technical and functional descriptions of
      the activity, item, list of acronyms and applicable documents, as well as a general
      description of the design and evaluation approach the program office will use. Also in the
      body, the program office includes program milestones, action agencies, and defines the
      relationship between the nuclear certification milestones and the weapon system
      milestones as appropriate. The detailed certification schedule will be included as
      Appendix A. Each subsequent appendix will provide detailed information related to the
      certification requirements (i.e., task descriptions, tasks, reviews, tests, responsibilities,
      schedule constraints, etc.) necessary to support the certification requirement. Appendices
      will be developed for only those components of Design and Operational Certification that
      have been identified as requiring action. (NOTE: Each CRP will be tailored to meet the
      needs of the particular acquisition/modification effort.) The CRP is a "living" document
      and as program changes are encountered and incorporated into the
      acquisition/modification effort, their impact on the nuclear certification process must be
      reviewed and the CRP updated accordingly.

3.3. Administration Phase. The Administration Phase includes actions necessary to obtain or
continue the nuclear certification of a weapon system prior to fielding. The Administration
Phase begins when the CRP is issued for implementation by the AFNWC. There are five distinct
series of actions that can take place within the Administration Phase: 1) Compatibility
Certification; 2) Nuclear Safety Design Certification; 3) Weapon System Safety Rules
development; 4) Technical Orders Certification; and 5) Operational Certification. Activities
during this phase include the documentation of modifications, evaluation, testing, and analysis
needed to obtain compatibility and safety design certifications; Secretary of Defense approval of
proposed Weapon System Safety Rules; verification of Technical Orders; and the Operational
Certification of the weapon system. The AFNWC will issue a Nuclear Certification Summary
(NCS) when all actions required by the CRP are accomplished. Issuance of the NCS will also
initiate an update to the MNCL and complete the Administration Phase.
   3.3.1. Compatibility Certification. The CRP will identify the need to obtain compatibility
   certification. Compatibility Certification ensures that the equipment item or weapon system
   meets design and evaluation requirements for the mechanical, electrical, and aerodynamic
   interface between the delivery vehicle or equipment item and the nuclear weapon. Nuclear
   weapon system compatibility evaluations are also a component of Operational-Suitability as
   established in AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering. A successful nuclear weapon
   system compatibility evaluation and subsequent issuance of a Nuclear Compatibility
   Certification Statement (NCCS) are required to complete the nuclear compatibility process.
   The NCCS defines the nuclear compatibility certified configuration of the weapon system.
       3.3.1.1. Aircraft Compatibility Certification. For aircraft and air launched missile
       systems, nuclear compatibility certification is accomplished by the AFNWC/NCS. To
       obtain compatibility certification, the SPM will generate the compatibility certification
       documents such as the Electrical Interface Control Drawing (EICD), Mechanical
       Interface Control Drawing (MICD), Final Design Approval Report (FDAR), and
       appropriate Technical Orders as specified in the CRP. Any requirements for testing and
       analysis needed to complete the compatibility certification actions will also be identified
       in the CRP. The AFNWC/NCS will coordinate the required tests and analysis with the
       appropriate program office, test organizations (e.g., 49th Test and Air Force SEEK
       EAGLE Office (AFSEO)), and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), as
       needed. In addition, the AFNWC/NCS will ensure AF/A10 and NNSA are aware of
       system modifications or acquisitions that may affect Nuclear Weapon Major Assembly
       Release and Aircraft Compatibility Control Drawings (MAR/ACCD) via the weapon
       and/or weapon system POG as appropriate. Once all required tests and analyses have
       been completed, the SPM is required to update the compatibility certification documents
       as indicated by test results and analyses. The AFSEO provides flight clearance
       recommendations and SEEK EAGLE Certification IAW AFI 63-104, The SEEK EAGLE
       Program. The AFNWC/NCS will interface and coordinate with the NNSA, via Sandia
       National Laboratory, to obtain the initial release of, or updates to, the Major Assembly
       Release (MAR) and Aircraft Compatibility Control Drawing (ACCD) as appropriate.
       Upon completion of all actions identified in the CRP for compatibility certification, the
       AFNWC/NCS aircraft compatibility certification office will issue an initial or updated
       Nuclear Compatibility Certification Statement (NCCS) and notify the AFNWC/NCSC
       via a Nuclear Compatibility Certification Notification Letter.
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         25


        3.3.1.1.1. Nuclear Compatibility Certification Statement (NCCS). The NCCS is
        issued when all aspects of the Compatibility Certification are accomplished. It is a
        document that consists of seven parts:
            3.3.1.1.1.1. Section I: Aircraft System General Information - includes
            nomenclature, propulsion, nuclear armament, and nuclear certified stations.
            3.3.1.1.1.2. Section II: Aircraft Monitor and Control System Components -
            includes hardware and software identifiers.
            3.3.1.1.1.3. Section III: Suspension and Release Equipment - includes explosive
            cartridge configuration and suitable substitute cartridge, if any.
            3.3.1.1.1.4. Section IV: Compatible Weapon/Equipment Configurations -
            includes, but not limited to, Training Stores, Air-to-Air missiles, Pods, and Fuel
            Tanks (This section of the NCCS will specify the authorized configurations).
            3.3.1.1.1.5. Section V: Carriage and Employment Limitations - includes weapon
            loads, min/max airspeed and altitudes.
            3.3.1.1.1.6. Section VI: AMAC Testers - includes aircraft Flight Line testers,
            Maintenance testers, and their associated software identification numbers.
            3.3.1.1.1.7. Appendix
                3.3.1.1.1.7.1. A: Historical AMAC Testing - includes certification and
                surveillance testing, aircraft types, tail numbers, location and dates.
                3.3.1.1.1.7.2. B: Nuclear Certification Documents Reference - includes safety
                and compatibility documentation.
                3.3.1.1.1.7.3. C: Nuclear Certified Technical Orders - ground and flight.
                3.3.1.1.1.7.4. D: Open Issues/Restrictions - if any.
            3.3.1.1.1.8. Additional aircraft specific information, pertinent to nuclear weapon
            compatibility certification, may be provided in the NCCS.
     3.3.1.2. Initial Surveillance and Aircraft Monitor and Control (AMAC) Testing. The
     AFNWC/NCS will determine if initial surveillance and/or Aircraft Monitor and Control
     (AMAC) testing is necessary for each type of aircraft nuclear weapon system. The
     AFNWC/NCS will conduct/direct testing as required. The purpose of the testing is to
     ascertain compliance of the aircraft AMAC system with the required AMAC
     specification and to establish that the aircraft is indeed electrically compatible with the
     required set of nuclear weapons. The results of initial surveillance and/or AMAC testing
     shall be maintained and published in a surveillance test database or appropriate
     repository. These results shall also be published in a test report following each test and
     shall be used by the AFNWC/NCS aircraft compatibility office as source data to justify
     nuclear compatibility certification. Surveillance/AMAC test results will also be provided
     to the SPM.
     3.3.1.3. ICBM Compatibility Certification. The goals of compatibility certification for
     ICBMs are similar to those for aircraft as they certify the equipment item or weapon
     system meets mechanical and electrical compatibility requirements between the delivery
26                                           AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


     vehicle and the nuclear weapon. For ICBM systems, compatibility certification is
     accomplished by the AFNWC/NI in conjunction with the Lead/Using Command
     coordination. Interface and coordination with the AFNWC/NCS and NNSA are required
     to obtain the Major Assembly Release (MAR). Nuclear Compatibility Certification is
     documented in the MAR. The CRP will identify design and evaluation requirements as
     well as any special testing or analysis necessary to obtain compatibility certification.
     Upon completion of all actions identified in the CRP for compatibility certification, the
     AFNWC/NI SPM will notify the AFNWC/NCSC via a Compatibility Certification
     Notification Letter and will forward a copy to the AFNWC/NCS.
     3.3.1.4. Facility Compatibility Certification.        The goal of facility compatibility
     certification is to ensure nuclear maintenance, handling or storage facilities and their
     associated systems are compatible with the nuclear weapon activities performed within
     the facility with respect to the interface between the weapons and the facility
     environments as measured against the weapon Stockpile to Target Sequence (STS)
     document criteria. Changes in facility usage, (e.g., the introduction of new weapons for
     which the facility/unit is not certified to store or maintain, or the introduction of new or
     revised nuclear weapon maintenance/test procedures), or modifications to the
     maintenance, handling or storage facility will drive the need to evaluate impacts on the
     compatibility certification of the facility. The CRP will identify the compatibility
     certification requirements. Upon completion of all actions identified in the CRP for
     compatibility certification, the facility compatibility certification office within AFNWC
     will notify the AFNWC/NCSC via a Facility Compatibility Certification Notification
     Letter.
  3.3.2. Nuclear Safety Design Certification. Nuclear safety design certification evaluates
  facilities, hardware, and/or software associated with nuclear weapon systems for compliance
  with nuclear safety design certification and evaluation criteria. The purpose is to validate
  that the system, item of equipment, or nuclear maintenance, handling or storage facility can
  be used safely in support of nuclear mission taskings. Nuclear safety design certification
  begins with an approved CRP that has identified the need to nuclear safety design certify a
  system/item that will be used with nuclear weapons. The CRP also outlines the applicable
  design and evaluation criteria in AFI 91-103, AFI 91-107, Engineering Technical Letter
  (ETL) 11-7; Nuclear Weapons Capable Maintenance and Storage Facilities, AFMAN 91-
  118, and/or AFMAN 91-119, which must be satisfied to meet the requirements of Nuclear
  Safety Design Certification (NSDC). A successful nuclear safety design evaluation and
  subsequent issuance of a NSDC Letter by HQ AFSEC/SEW to the AFNWC/NCSC are
  required to complete the nuclear safety design certification.
     3.3.2.1. Nuclear Safety Design Certification Requirements. The SPM must comply with
     the nuclear safety design certification requirements identified in the approved CRP and
     document these actions IAW AFI 91-103. Compliance will be documented in a Nuclear
     Surety Evaluation (NSE) submitted to HQ AFSEC/SEW by the SPM. The decision to
     grant nuclear safety design certification is based on compliance with design criteria and
     an adequate exercise of the design as specified by the evaluation criteria outlined in the
     CRP. Discrepancies and/or deviations from design and evaluation criteria are assessed
     for risk (based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of likelihood and consequence)
     and impact to operational requirements.
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        27


  3.3.3. Weapon System Safety Rules Development. The development of a new nuclear
  capable weapon system or a significant design or mission change (to include a CONOPs
  change) to an existing weapon system may dictate the need for a Nuclear Weapons System
  Safety Group (NWSSG) study to be included in the CRP. The NWSSG study leads to the
  development, SECDEF approval, and promulgation of weapon system specific Weapon
  System Safety Rules (WSSRs). WSSRs are operational restrictions/requirements designed
  to assure nuclear weapon systems are compliant with the four DoD nuclear safety standards
  as defined by DoD Directive 3150.2. WSSRs must be approved by the SECDEF prior to the
  operational use of nuclear weapon systems with war reserve material. The requirement to
  convene the NWSSG and conduct a safety study as described in AFI 91-102 will be
  documented in the approved CRP. The NCIS and CRP will identify a Rules Need Date.
  This date will be used as the baseline for developing the NWSSG schedule, which will
  include delivery dates for all required documents (e.g., Lead/Using Command Operational
  Plan Data Document, Nuclear Safety Analysis Report (NSAR), and TNSA) and other
  materials needed by the NWSSG to support the scheduled studies. SECDEF approval of new
  or updated WSSRs, and subsequent issuance of a Safety Rules Approval Letter to the
  AFNWC/NCSC by HQ AFSEC/SEW completes the weapon system safety rules
  development activities. For currently nuclear certified systems with SECDEF approved
  WSSRs in place: If the NWSSG determines that the existing WSSRs are adequate, HQ
  AFSEC/SEW will forward the safety rules approval letter to the AFNWC/NCSC following
  Air Staff approval of the NWSSG Report.
  3.3.4. Technical Order Certification. The Technical Order Management Agency (TOMA) is
  responsible for ensuring that Technical Orders and procedures involved in a weapon system’s
  nuclear mission operations, maintenance, troubleshooting, OPCERT, DECERT, handling,
  movement, restraint configuration, loading, unloading, delivery, and testing are complete,
  accurate, and safe as directed by TO 00-5-3, Air Force Technical Order Life Cycle
  Management. Compliance with Nuclear Weapon System Safety Rules, requirements in 91-
  100 series AFIs, nuclear safety, nuclear compatibility, and design safety features is the
  responsibility of the Technical Content Manager (TCM) (NOTE: For ICBM systems the
  AFNWC/NI will provide the TCM for Nuclear Surety Procedure (NSP) flagged procedures).
  Technical order certification begins with the approval of the Technical Order Certification
  appendix to the CRP, which describes all TO-related actions required to certify the
  procedures (e.g., Developer/program office certification/validation responsibilities and
  Lead/Using Command verification responsibilities). When technical data is approved, the
  TOMA will formally notify the AFNWC/NCS via a technical order approval notification
  letter. SPMs may devise local procedures for approval and reporting Technical Order
  Certification. For example, the Nuclear Certification Manager may be assigned review and
  approval authority for non NSP coded procedures. If requested, the SPM will provide the
  AFNWC/NCSC nuclear certification engineer advance copies of TOs or TO source data, as
  applicable, for new items or weapon systems or for those systems with substantial changes to
  existing procedures for additional review of nuclear certification issues.
  3.3.5. Operational Certification. The goal of Operational Certification is to ensure that the
  organization and personnel assigned to support the nuclear mission can effectively and safely
  operate and maintain their assigned weapon systems. Operational Certification applies to a
  variety of circumstances: a new weapon system that will have a nuclear capability, an
28                                           AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  existing weapon system that has had the nuclear mission capability added to the unit’s
  Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement, or an existing nuclear-capable unit that
  has received a significant modification to a nuclear certified weapon system, subsystem, or
  item of support equipment. One of these conditions will drive the requirement to include an
  Operational Certification appendix to the CRP.
     3.3.5.1. Lead/Using Command. The Using Command has the primary responsibility to
     complete the requirements of this certification. The Lead/Using Command will develop
     and implement a tailored nuclear qualification program for each type of weapon system
     accomplishing this certification. The program will include nuclear-mission qualification
     training, training programs to ensure compliance and proficiency in all applicable NSI
     events as listed and described in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear Weapons Technical
     Inspections, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and aircrew/missile crew
     nuclear mission certifications as applicable to the unit’s DOC statement. The Lead/Using
     Command will develop the Operational Certification appendix, when required, and
     coordinate with the SPM for inclusion in the final CRP
     3.3.5.2. Unit Nuclear Qualification Programs. A variety of programs will be initiated at
     the operational unit level to prepare personnel for their nuclear mission roles. Units
     initiate required administrative actions to ensure personnel possess the appropriate
     security clearances IAW DoDM 5200.01 Vols 1-4, DoD Information Security Program,
     and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, commensurate with the level
     of training they will receive. Unit commanders will identify, evaluate, and PRP-certify
     selected individuals IAW DoD 5210.42 R-AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons
     Personnel Reliability Program. Required nuclear surety training will be conducted IAW
     AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. Applicable nuclear
     qualification training and task evaluations will be accomplished and personnel will be
     graded and qualified IAW applicable operations and maintenance TOs, AFIs, and
     Lead/Using Command’s supplements and instructions.
     3.3.5.3. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection. The Using Command, in coordination with
     HQ AFSEC, will determine the need for an Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI) and
     ensure this requirement is included in the Operational Certification appendix to the CRP.
     The Using Command will determine when a unit is ready to undergo the INSI based on
     their assessment of the unit’s level of nuclear mission proficiency. The Using
     Command’s IG will schedule and conduct the inspection IAW the guidelines described in
     AFI 90-201. The unit must receive a “Ready” rating to be considered nuclear-mission
     capable. Additional training and Lead/Using Command assistance will be provided to
     the unit if they receive a “Not Ready” rating and the unit will be re-evaluated IAW AFI
     90-201. After the unit successfully completes the inspection, the Using Command will
     send an Operational Certification Letter to the AFNWC/NCSC to confirm Operational
     Certification actions are complete. Even though numerous “like units” may be
     accomplishing the same operational certifications for a new capability, the Operational
     Certification Letter is only required after the first unit passes the Initial Nuclear Surety
     Inspection.
  3.3.6. Administrative Phase Completion. Throughout the Administration Phase, the
  AFNWC/NCSC will monitor the status of the certification process. The CRP identifies
  which of the nuclear certification process components (i.e., compatibility, nuclear safety
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              29


   design, etc.) are required for nuclear certification. Successful completion of these tasks is
   documented by the following: (1) A Compatibility Certification Letter from the
   AFNWC/NCS or AFNWC/NI, as appropriate, indicating that all actions for Compatibility
   Certification are complete, (2) The Nuclear Safety Design Certification Letter from HQ
   AFSEC/SEW, (3) Formal technical order approval letter from the appropriate Technical
   Order Management Agency, (4) Weapon System Safety Rules Approval notification from
   HQ AFSEC/SEW, and (5) an Operational Certification Letter from the Lead/Using
   Command indicating completion of Operational Certification requirements for the first
   Operationally Certified unit. When all of the CRP-directed Design Certification components
   identified above are accomplished, the AFNWC/NCSC will develop the Design Certification
   Summary letter package for AFNWC signature. Once signed, the DCS will be forwarded to
   the SPM and the MNCL will be updated to indicate that Design Certification is complete.
   Once the CRP-directed Operational Certification actions are completed, and the
   AFNWC/NCSC is satisfied that all actions specified in the CRP are complete, a Nuclear
   Certification Summary letter will be signed out and forwarded to the SPM and the MNCL
   will be updated to indicate the system/item is nuclear certified. This completes the
   Administration Phase.
3.4. Fielding Phase. The Fielding Phase procedures ensure an item is sent to the user in the
desired, nuclear certified configuration to support the tasked mission. The Fielding Phase
typically begins with the issuance of either a Design Certification Summary or Nuclear
Certification Summary from AFNWC to the SPM (NOTE: Nuclear Certification = Design
Certification + Operational Certification of one unit). The Fielding Phase typically ends with the
user employing the new, nuclear certified, weapon system or item of equipment configuration to
meet nuclear-mission taskings. This phase also addresses situations that require the release of a
new or modified item to the user prior to design certification or weapon system nuclear
certification being complete (e.g., conventional-only release or release for operational-
certification actions (i.e., training purposes only)). All items affecting a nuclear certified weapon
system configuration will be released via a TO/TCTO and units will process them IAW AFI
21series guidance.
   3.4.1. Release Process. “Release” refers to the process of sending a new or modified item to
   the user with a TO or TCTO. Various release conditions are: a) items that modify an existing
   nuclear certified weapon system configuration; b) items that add nuclear capability to an
   existing non-nuclear certified weapon system; or c) an entirely new nuclear certified weapon
   system. New or modified weapon system configurations/items can be released to the user as
   one of four Release Cases, described in the following paragraphs. The Lead/Using
   Command determines the Release Case and authorizes the SPM to release the item along
   with any necessary restrictions. The need to include restrictions may come from many
   sources including operational test results, other limitations identified during OSS&E
   certifications, and circumstances as directed by Lead/Using Command requirements. Non-
   nuclear mission requirements may drive the need to field items destined for use on nuclear
   certified systems before an item has been appropriately certified. However, the Air Force
   Nuclear Certification Program has been designed to find the appropriate balance between
   operational flexibility and nuclear surety. When the SPM’s recommendation for release and
   the Lead Using Command’s Release Authorization actions are complete, the SPM will notify
   the AFNWC/NCSC that all Program Office/Lead/Using Command-related CRP activities are
30                                          AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  completed. This notification terminates the Nuclear Certification Process Fielding Phase.
  (NOTE: The Nuclear Certification process will not be accelerated to allow for earlier-than-
  planned fielding if the certification process owners determine that the adequacy or
  completeness of the process is in question or adversely affected.)
     3.4.1.1. Release Cases. In the Fielding Phase, there are four scenarios for release. The
     use of “Release Cases” is intended to provide the Lead/Using Command and SPM with
     standardized terminology for the release of items affecting nuclear certified weapon
     systems.
         3.4.1.1.1. Release Case 1: “Release Now, Certification Complete.” Release of a
         new or modified item for which Nuclear Certification is complete. After receiving
         the Nuclear Certification Summary, the SPM will send a release recommendation to
         the Lead/Using Command based on the completion of necessary OSS&E
         certifications and Lead/Using Command requirements. When the Lead/Using
         Command’s coordination requirements are satisfied, the Lead/Using Command will
         authorize the program office to release the item to specified units. The Lead/Using
         Command will specify the required unit actions in the release instructions.
         3.4.1.1.2. Release Case 2: “Release Now, Certify Now.” Release of a new or
         modified item for which only Design Certification is complete. The most likely
         reason for this Release Case is the need to release an item so the user can conduct
         operational certification actions (i.e., qualification training or preparing for and
         accomplishing an INSI). After receiving the Design Certification Summary, the SPM
         will send a release recommendation to the Lead/Using Command based on the
         completion of necessary OSS&E certifications and Lead/Using Command
         requirements. When the Lead/Using Command’s internal and external coordination
         requirements are satisfied, the Lead/Using Command will authorize the program
         office to release the item to specified units. Typically, this type of release would
         include authorization for units to use the item/weapon system configuration to
         conduct operational certification actions. Since the released item has not yet been
         nuclear certified, the item shall not be used in support of an operational nuclear
         mission with war reserve weapons or certified critical components. Upon completion
         of all Operational Certification actions at the initial unit, the Lead/Using Command
         shall forward the Operational Certification Letter to the AFNWC/NCSC. The
         AFNWC will issue the Nuclear Certification Summary to the SPM. After receiving
         the Nuclear Certification Summary, the SPM will send an updated release
         recommendation to the Lead/Using Command. When the Lead/Using Command’s
         coordination requirements are satisfied, the Lead/Using Command will specify
         required actions in the release instructions for both Operationally Certified units as
         well as follow-on units that have not yet undergone their Initial Nuclear Surety
         Inspection. Only units that have completed Operational Certification for the
         new/modified weapon system configuration may use the nuclear certified, weapon
         system configuration in support of a nuclear mission with war reserve weapons or
         certified critical components.
         3.4.1.1.3. Release Case 3: “Release Now, Certify Later.” Release of a new or
         modified item for which: 1) Design Certification and/or Nuclear Certification is not
         complete; and 2) the Lead/Using Command does plan to complete nuclear
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         31


        certification in the future. When operational requirements dictate, the Lead/Using
        Command may direct the SPM release an item with the intention of design-certifying
        or nuclear-certifying the new/modified item or weapon system configuration after
        release (e.g., avionics software revision). The Nuclear Certification Impact Statement
        will have identified the Lead/Using Command’s intention to have the item released
        prior to completion of any or all of the nuclear certification requirements. The
        Lead/Using Command must restrict the affected nuclear certified platform to a
        “conventional-only” role until nuclear certification actions have been accomplished
        and address the impact of the non-nuclear certified weapon system configuration on
        operational requirements. For example, even though the aircraft at a unit currently
        are conventional use only, the unit has a requirement to meet their DOC nuclear-
        mission requirements. The AFNWC/NCSC will coordinate the restricted release
        request with all affected certification process owners and provide appropriate
        direction to the SPM in the Basic Certification Requirements Plan. Once the SPM
        receives a Design Certification Summary, an updated release recommendation will be
        sent by the program office to the Lead/Using Command. When the Lead/Using
        Command’s internal and external coordination requirements are satisfied, the
        Lead/Using Command will update its release instructions to the appropriate units.
        Typically, this release update would include authorization for units to use the
        item/weapon system configuration to conduct operational certification actions. Since
        the released item has not yet been nuclear certified, the item shall not be used in
        support of an operational nuclear mission with war reserve weapons or certified
        critical components, but may be used to support conventional mission taskings. After
        the Nuclear Certification Summary is issued, an updated release recommendation will
        be sent by the program office to the Lead/Using Command. When the Lead/Using
        Command’s coordination requirements are satisfied, the Lead/Using Command will
        specify required actions in the release instructions for both Operationally Certified
        units as well as follow-on units that have not yet undergone their Initial Nuclear
        Surety Inspection. Only units that have completed Operational Certification for the
        new/modified weapon system configuration may use the nuclear certified, weapon
        system configuration in support of a nuclear mission with war reserve weapons or
        certified critical components.
        3.4.1.1.4. Release Case 4: “Release Now, Never Certify.” Release of a new or
        modified item for which: 1) Design Certification and/or Operational Certification has
        not been initiated or completed; and 2) the Lead/Using Command does not plan to
        initiate or complete nuclear certification in the future.             When operational
        requirements dictate, the Lead/Using Command may direct the SPM to develop and
        release an item with no intention of design-certifying the item or nuclear-certifying
        the new/modified weapon system configuration. The Nuclear Certification Impact
        Statement will have identified the Lead/Using Command’s intention to have the item
        released without undergoing nuclear certification. The AFNWC/NCSC will
        coordinate the restricted release request with all affected certification process owners
        and provide appropriate direction to the SPM in the Basic Certification Requirements
        Plan. The Lead/Using Command must restrict the affected nuclear certified weapon
        system to a “conventional-only” role and address the impact of the non-nuclear
        certified weapon system configuration on operational requirements.
 32                                             AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


3.5. Sustainment Phase. The Sustainment Phase includes all actions necessary to maintain the
nuclear certified status of a fielded weapon system/item once operational. A nuclear certified
system or item enters the Sustainment Phase once the system is fielded and remains in the
Sustainment Phase until it is decertified or retired. During this phase the nuclear certified
system/item is monitored for any changes that would impact the design or Operational
Certification of the system/item. Activities during this phase include weapon system/safety
deficiency reporting, reporting the results of periodic system testing, inspections/evaluations, and
periodic procedure reviews. Any change that alters the certification status would drive the
process back to the Identification Phase.
   3.5.1. Compatibility Certification. During the Sustainment Phase a certified weapon system
   or equipment item is monitored to confirm that the weapon system or equipment item
   continues to meet the requirements for the interface (mechanical, electrical, and
   aerodynamic) between the item and the nuclear weapon based upon established design and
   evaluation requirements.
       3.5.1.1. Aircraft Compatibility Certification. Nuclear certified aircraft and air-launched
       missile systems will be monitored for changes that could impact the system’s Nuclear
       Compatibility Certification Statement. Once the Lead/Using Command receives the
       nuclear certified system/item, the unit is required to conduct initial and periodic
       operational checks IAW applicable technical orders. The AFNWC/NCS will be provided
       Category I and critical or major Category II Deficiency Reports, as defined in TO 00-
       35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation and Resolution, for those items listed
       in the MNCL. The AFNWC/NCS will also be provided testing results to determine if the
       deficiencies identified or the testing results impact the compatibility certification status of
       the system. Similarly, the AFNWC/NCS will be provided inspection and evaluation
       reports generated by the Lead/Using Command (i.e., NSI, NORI, Tactical Evaluation
       (TAC Eval), etc.) to determine if the compatibility certification may be affected by
       inspection or evaluation findings. The SPM must be informed of system deficiencies
       affecting compatibility certification via the reporting processes and/or from the
       AFNWC/NCS. If the program office determines a baseline configuration change is
       required, the SPM must initiate/reenter the Identification Phase detailed in Section 3.2.
           3.5.1.1.1. Surveillance Testing. The AFNWC/NCS will conduct recurring annual
           surveillance and/or AMAC tests for each type of certified nuclear aircraft weapon
           system. The Lead/Using Command will provide operational aircraft assets and
           personnel, as necessary, to support surveillance/AMAC testing on USAF and non-
           U.S. NATO operational nuclear-capable aircraft and air-launched missile systems.
           They will also provide combat delivery aircraft when required to support flight-
           testing of NNSA/USAF air-carried nuclear weapons.
           3.5.1.1.2. Testing Results. The results of recurring surveillance and/or AMAC
           testing shall be maintained and published in a surveillance test database or
           appropriate repository. These results shall also be published in a test report following
           each test and shall be used by the AFNWC/NCS as source data to justify continuing
           the nuclear compatibility certification. A copy of each surveillance test report shall
           also be provided to the SPM.
AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           33


     3.5.1.2. ICBM Compatibility Certification. The AFNWC/NI, in conjunction with the
     Lead/Using Command, monitors ICBM compatibility certification throughout the
     sustainment phase. Periodic testing (e.g., Simulated Electronic Launch Minuteman
     (SELM)) and monitoring of Deficiency Reports, DULL SWORD and other mishap
     reports, and nuclear surety inspections, etc., will be used to ensure the weapon system
     continues to meet all nuclear compatibility certification requirements. Any impact to
     compatibility certification will result in a return to the Identification Phase and
     subsequent submission of a Nuclear Certification Impact Statement.                     The
     AFNWC/NCSC in coordination with the other nuclear certification process owners, will
     evaluate the NCIS to determine if a change in the certification status is appropriate (e.g.,
     restriction or decertification) and to identify any follow-on actions.
     3.5.1.3. Facility Compatibility Certification: Host installation MAJCOM will monitor a
     nuclear certified facility for changes (e.g., changes in the authorized Maintenance
     Capability Letter (MCL,) implementation of new weapon maintenance procedures, or use
     of existing approved procedures in different facilities, maintenance facility modifications,
     etc.) that could impact the compatibility certification of the facility. Any impact to
     compatibility certification will result in a return to the Identification Phase and
     subsequent submission of a Nuclear Certification Impact Statement.                      The
     AFNWC/NCSC, in coordination with the other nuclear certification process owners, will
     evaluate the NCIS to determine if a change in the certification status is appropriate (e.g.,
     restriction or decertification) and to identify any follow-on actions.
  3.5.2. Nuclear Safety Design Certification. Process Owners will monitor fielded nuclear
  certified systems (i.e., hardware, software, facilities, etc.) for changes that could impact the
  nuclear safety design certified status of the system/item IAW AFI 91-103. Monitoring is
  accomplished through the use of nuclear surety inspection reports, DULL SWORD reports,
  and other safety-related reporting, as well as MDRs/PQDRs used to relate non-safety related
  deficiencies pertaining to all aspects of a nuclear weapon system (i.e., personnel, procedures,
  equipment, training, etc.). These reports serve as the primary means by which the SPM and
  other process owners identify trends, or areas of concern, affecting the system/item’s nuclear
  safety design certification.        The need to modify the weapon system/item or
  equipment/facility and restart the certification process, or decertify or restrict the use of a
  certified system/item will result in reentry into the Identification Phase. Formal notification
  is provided to the AFNWC/NCSC when decertification or use restrictions are implemented
  against safety design certified items so these changes can be documented in the MNCL.
  3.5.3. Weapon System Safety Rules. Fielded nuclear certified weapons systems are
  monitored by the Nuclear Weapons Systems Safety Group on a recurring basis through
  Operational Safety Reviews (OSR) conducted every five years and through Special Studies
  conducted by the NWSSG to address specific issues when needed. During these
  reviews/studies, the NWSSG assesses compliance of all aspects of the nuclear weapons
  system with the four DoD Safety Standards as required by DoD 3150.2-M. Existing WSSRs
  are reviewed and modified as necessary and recommendations are made to mitigate shortfalls
  in the system with respect to compliance with the DoD Weapon System Safety Standards.
  As in the Administrative Phase of the nuclear certification process, the product of the
  NWSSG study is an Air Force Safety Rules Package and NWSSG Report that is forwarded
  to HQ USAF and the SECDEF. This phase includes all documentation and staffing actions
34                                           AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


  necessary to support Operational Safety Reviews (OSRs) and Special Studies by the NWSSG
  IAW AFI 91-102 and DoD 3150.2-M, approval or disapproval by the SECDEF of an Air
  Force Safety Rules Package and implementation of Air Staff-approved recommendations,
  which may or may not require re-initiation of the Nuclear Certification process. HQ
  AFSEC/SEW will notify the AFNWC/NCSC of the approval and publication of WSSRs.
  The AFNWC/NCSC, in coordination with the appropriate process owners, will determine if
  there are any impacts to the nuclear certification of the weapon system (i.e., changes to
  MNCL listing). If there is no impact, then no action is required. If the new rules or
  recommendations require changes to the weapon system or otherwise impact the nuclear
  certification of the particular weapon system, then the next step is to return to the
  Identification Phase of the Nuclear Certification Process and initiate a nuclear certification
  action.
  3.5.4. Technical Order Sustainment. Sustainment of current TOs is critical to the continued
  nuclear certification of a weapon system. Personnel operating and maintaining nuclear
  certified weapon systems with approved and verified TOs must be vigilant to identify
  deficiencies in procedural and/or technical guidance to their Lead/Using Command
  functional managers. The requirement to update a publication may come from a variety of
  sources. Periodic reviews may reveal the need for more efficient or effective ways to
  accomplish a task or to maintain a weapon system and its support equipment. Other sources
  may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Unit Inspections (e.g., NSIs, Staff
  Assistance Visits); 2) Deficiency Reports (e.g., safety reporting system, maintenance quality
  control reports) and/or; 3) Command level (AF/MAJCOM) requirement to emphasize
  particular procedures that are vital for a weapon system’s continued operational safety and/or
  security. Changes are processed IAW existing AF guidance (e.g., TO 00-5-1). Proposed
  changes to Technical Order procedures will be evaluated by appropriate program office
  personnel (e.g., TOMA, TCM, Equipment Engineer, or NCM) and the system Chief
  Engineer, or delegated representative, must approve all TO revisions which could affect
  system nuclear certification.     Note: The NCIS for TO revisions will also prompt a review
  to determine if the changes in the procedures may impact the design certification of the
  associated system or hardware.
  3.5.5. Operational Certification. The Sustainment Phase Operational Certification process
  begins once a unit is Nuclear Certified.
     3.5.5.1. Unit Program Management. A Lead/Using Command with a nuclear mission
     must ensure units maintain and conduct follow-on (continuation) training programs.
     These training programs include recurring qualification and certification programs,
     Nuclear Surety programs, and a viable PRP.
     3.5.5.2. Lead/Using Command Evaluations and Inspections. . If an inspection or
     evaluation documents a nuclear operational certification deficiency, the issue(s) may
     require entry into the Identification Phase. Recurring nuclear surety inspection reports
     will be forwarded to the AFNWC/NCSC as required by Table 7.1.

                  DETERMINING THE NEED TO NUCLEAR CERTIFY

4.1. It is Air Force policy that procedures, personnel, equipment, facilities, and
organizations that handle, maintain, or operate nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon
systems shall be nuclear certified before operations with war reserve material can be
undertaken.
4.2. Use Table 4 1. to determine if an item, or modification to a nuclear certified item, is
required to be nuclear certified before conducting nuclear operations or supporting
nuclear related taskings such as nuclear generation exercises using war reserve material.
   4.2.1. When used with nuclear weapons in Air Force custody, ally-operated nuclear weapon
   systems, equipment, and procedures must satisfy the same nuclear certification criteria
   required for Air Force systems, equipment, and procedures.
   4.2.2. When items do not clearly fall into any of the categories identified in Table 4.1., the
   Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, in coordination with appropriate process owners
   identified in Chapter 1 of this publication, will determine if nuclear certification is required.
   Submit an NCIS to the AFNWC/NCSC per this instruction.
   4.2.3. Any item of equipment used with nuclear weapons, but not specifically designed for
   that purpose, is considered non-specialized equipment.

Nuclear Certified Equipment and Software, which was rescinded. The MNCL is the sole
authority for determining the certification status of nuclear certified weapon systems, support
equipment, software, and facilities. It is a web-based database which provides users the nuclear
certification status of weapon systems, sub-systems, components, software, support equipment
and facilities. Verification of certification status and configuration will be accomplished by
MAJCOM policy IAW paragraph 2.7.14. of this instruction.
   5.1.1. NATO Host Nations are authorized to use ELO-4, Master Nuclear Certification List
   Extract for User Nation Use, for determining the certification status of host nation owned
   support equipment, hardware, and software. ELO-4 is provided by the 498 NSW/ Det 1.
   5.1.2. The certification status of a listed item is indicated in the Certification Status (Cert
   Status) column and will contain either the word “Design” or “Nuclear.”
       5.1.2.1. The “Design” designation indicates the item has been successfully design
       certified but has not yet completed its operational certification requirements and therefore
       is restricted from operational employment in support of nuclear taskings.
       5.1.2.2. The “Nuclear” designation indicates that the item has completed all nuclear
       certification requirements identified in the CRP and can be employed in support of
       nuclear taskings.
       5.1.2.3. Users of the MNCL should check both the specific item listing as well as the
       General Guidance section of the MNCL to determine the certified status and usability
       (i.e. restrictions) of a nuclear certified item.
5.2. MNCL Management.
   5.2.1. The MNCL is managed by the AFNWC/NCSC.
   5.2.2. Routine updates to the MNCL occur on the last duty day of every month. However,
   out-of-cycle updates can occur at any time when deemed necessary.
   5.2.3. Questions regarding items in the MNCL should be submitted to the AFNWC/NCSC
   MNCL Manager via e-mail to mnclproblem@kirtland.af.mil or by using the
   “Problem/Suggestion” link on the main menu page of the MNCL.
5.3. Accessing the MNCL. A computer with an Internet browser, either Microsoft Internet
Explorer version 5.0 or higher or Netscape 6.1 or higher, operating from a .mil or .gov domain, is

   level training upon assignment. Personnel assigned Nuclear Certification Manager duties
   within Program Offices, AFSC or Special Centers shall complete the in-residence nuclear
   certification process core-course within 180 days of assignment and recurring training
   annually. Annual Recurring training will be accomplished by attending either the in-
   residence Nuclear Certification Process course or its MTT equivalent. If the NCM is unable
   to attend either of the two prescribed methods due to reasons beyond the individual’s control,
   the SPM may authorize the use of the Nuclear Certification Process CBT (see paragraph 6.2
   below) to meet the annual recurring training requirement. The individual must be scheduled
   to attend the in-residence or MTT course at the earliest available class date. SPMs are
   responsible for identifying program office personnel (i.e., program managers, engineers,
   equipment specialists, safety officers, etc.,) requiring training and the level of training
   required (i.e., core or executive-level), and frequency (i.e., initial training only or initial and
   annual recurring training). Identified personnel will receive initial training within 180 days
   of assignment and if designated by the SPM, recurring training annually.
   6.1.2. Lead/Using Command.         Individuals assigned MAJCOM Nuclear Certification
   Manager or Nuclear Certified Equipment Manager duties shall receive initial nuclear
   certification process related training by attending the in-residence Nuclear Certification
   Process and NCE Users courses within 180 days of assignment and shall receive recurring

Terms
Aircraft Monitor and Control (AMAC)—Equipment installed in aircraft to permit nuclear
weapon monitoring and control of safing, pre-arming, arming, and fuzing functions on nuclear
weapons or nuclear weapon systems.
Aircraft Compatibility Control Drawing (ACCD)—A controlled drawing prepared and
maintained by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Sandia National Laboratory
(NNSA/SNL). The ACCD establishes the extent of compatibility and restrictions between a
nuclear weapon and an aircraft.
Combat Delivery Vehicle—A vehicle, with its installed equipment and components, used to
deliver a nuclear weapon to a target.
Critical Component—A component of a nuclear weapon system that, if bypassed, activated, or
tampered with, could result in, or contribute to, deliberate or inadvertent authorizing, prearming,
arming, or launch of a combat delivery vehicle carrying a nuclear weapon, or the targeting of a
nuclear weapon to other than its planned target. HQ AFSEC/SEW designates critical
components.
DECERT—(ICBM only term) Action by proper authority to remove a certified critical
component from operational use. When it becomes necessary to remove an operationally
certified critical component from the operational weapon system, DECERT is accomplished
prior to removing two-person control. DECERT consists of removal of classified/code material
and the subsequent removal from nuclear certified control.
Design Certification—This occurs when each of four components is accomplished for the
weapon system: Compatibility Certification, Nuclear Safety Design Certification, Weapon
System Safety Rules (WSSRs) Approval, and Technical Orders Approval.
Electrical Interface Control Drawing (EICD)—The EICD documents the physical, electrical
power, and logical signal circuits in the delivery system between the avionics components at the
DOE/AF interfaces. The EICD includes all types of electrical interfaces in the monitor and
control circuits of the nuclear weapon and nuclear weapon system, including man-machine,
discrete lines, and multiplex data buses.
Facility—One or multiple buildings used for maintenance, handling, and storage of nuclear
weapons, the associated physical security features, and supporting infrastructure located within
CONUS based WSAs.
Facility Certification Configuration Document (FCCD)—The FCCD defines the
configuration of a WSA that was assessed and certified to have the capability to conduct nuclear
operations with nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems.
Launch Activation Path—The path by which information and energy flow to effect a missile
launch.
Lead Command—The MAJCOM that serves as the operator’s interface with the SPM for a
weapon system as defined by AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for
 60                                            AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013


Weapon Systems or applicable PAD. This term is not to be confused with that MAJCOM
designated by HQ USAF/A5R as OPR for authoring a requirements document (i.e., This
MAJCOM would be the “Using Command”). Although, in most cases, the MAJCOM
designated by HQ USAF/A5R to sponsor a requirement will become the "Lead Command" for a
weapon system.
Major Assembly Release (MAR)—A Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) prepared, DOE/AL
approved statement that war reserve (WR) weapon material is satisfactory for release on a
designated effective date to the DoD for specified uses which are qualified by exceptions and
limitations. The MAR contains drawings and data defining the mechanical and electrical
characteristics of the weapon and the delivery platform. For aircraft systems, the MAR also
includes the Aircraft Compatibility Control Drawing (ACCD).
Mechanical Interface Control Drawing (MICD)—the MICD defines the physical and
mechanical interfaces between the delivery platform and the nuclear weapon. The MICD
includes dimensions, clearances, forces, installations, etc., associated with the weapon’s
suspension and release equipment (for aircraft, on the wing or in the weapons bay).
Non-Combat Delivery Vehicle—Any vehicle, other than combat vehicles, used to move nuclear
weapons.
Non-Specialized Equipment—Equipment used with nuclear weapons but not specifically
designed for that purpose. (USAF)
Nuclear Certification—The process for determining that procedures, personnel, equipment,
facilities, and organizations meet nuclear surety standards and are capable of performing
assigned nuclear weapon functions and missions. Nuclear certification is a part of OSS&E, as
directed by AFI 63-1201. Nuclear certification is required prior to a system acquiring operational
status.
Nuclear Certified Equipment—Peculiar (i.e., system specific) and common specialized or non-
specialized support equipment whose design meets applicable design criteria and is nuclear
certified IAW the nuclear certification process outlined in this publication and identified in the
MNCL.
Nuclear Certified Item—Procedures, equipment, software, facilities, systems, subsystems or
components which are nuclear certified IAW the nuclear certification process outlined in this
publication.
Nuclear Surety—All functions and activities that ensure Air Force compliance with the DoD
Nuclear Weapon System Safety Standards. To comply with these standards Air Force nuclear
systems are designed, developed, operated, maintained, transported, and controlled to provide
maximum safety to the public and operating personnel while protecting the environment and
maintaining reliability to support mission accomplishment.
Nuclear Weapon—A complete assembly (e.g., implosion type, gun type, or thermonuclear type)
in its intended ultimate configuration which, upon completion of the prescribed arming, fusing,
and firing sequence, is capable of producing the intended nuclear reaction and release of energy.

AFI63-125_ANGSUP_I 27 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          61


Nuclear Weapon System—A combat delivery vehicle with its nuclear weapon or weapons and
associated support equipment, noncombat delivery vehicles, facilities, and services. (USAF
definition)
Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group (NWSSG)—The NWSSG is composed of
representatives from applicable Air Force Major Commands, Combatant Commands, Air Force
Security Forces Center, Department of Energy, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency and is
chaired by an appointee from HQ AFSEC/SEW. It conducts all nuclear weapon system safety
studies and operational safety reviews to evaluate Air Force nuclear weapon systems and ensure
the DoD Nuclear Weapon Safety Standards are met in weapon system design and operations.
(USAF definition)
Operational Certification—This occurs when the Lead Command/Using Command qualifies
its personnel to perform the mission, certifies them in the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP),
trains them in nuclear surety, and assigns a “Ready” rating on an Initial Nuclear Surety
Inspection (INSI).
OPCERT—(ICBM only term) The process of verifying a system or critical component is
functioning as design certified and all credible threats and scenarios are mitigated. An item
identified as a nuclear critical component must successfully complete OPCERT procedures prior
to installation in the operational weapon system or whenever two-person control has been lost,
the component has been decertified, or when directed by higher authority.
SEEK EAGLE—The Air Force certification program for determining safe carriage,
employment and jettison limits, safe escape, and ballistics accuracy, when applicable, for all
stores in specified loading configurations on USAF aircraft.
Specialized Equipment— Equipment designed specifically for use with nuclear weapons.
(USAF)
Support Equipment—Includes all equipment required to perform the support function, except
that which is an integral part of the mission equipment. It does not include any of the equipment
required to perform mission operation functions. Support equipment should be interpreted as
tools; test equipment; automatic test equipment (when used in a support function);
organizational, field, and depot support equipment; and related computer program software.
(USAF)
System Program Manager (SPM)—The designated individual with responsibility for and
authority to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to
meet the user’s operational needs. For platforms/programs in the acquisition phase, the SPM is
accountable for cost, schedule, and performance and is the DoDD 5000.1 Program Manager
(PM). Depending on the phase of the system (acquisition or sustainment), the SPM will normally
reside at either a Product Center or Air Logistics Center (ALC). If a program is in acquisition,
the SPM will be at a Product Center and will be supported by a System Support Manager (SSM)
normally located an ALC. If a program is in sustainment, the SPM will normally reside at the
appropriate ALC or other sustainment location and will be supported by a DSM normally located
at a Product Center. The SSM/DSM functions as the SPM, for nuclear certification program
purposes, for those programs for which they have programmatic responsibility. Note: For this
AFI, the term System Program Manager (SPM) applies collectively to Single Managers, System
Program Managers, Product Group Managers, System Support Managers, Development System
