     protective equipment (PPE) is inspected annually. All PPE has been approved by host
     Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) and review under phase and ISO shop industrial
     surveys. Ensure all personnel a medically qualified/trained for specialized PPE requirements.
     2.2. Assign and ensure an adequate number of trained/qualified personnel are assigned to
     CDDAR team. Determine/assign positions prior to recovery operation (e.g., special vehicle
     operators, console operators, safety observers, etc).

     2.7.3. Upon notification of an on/off base crash, the CDDAR Team Chief will implement
     the crash recovery team recall.
     2.7.4. Be the single on-scene (OS) focal point for CDDAR operations and reports
     directly to the On-Scene Commander (OSC). If the operation will be ongoing two

     determination on whether to pre-position a CDDAR team and or tow crew. Any damaged
     aircraft that cannot be towed by normal means will be removed from the runway area by
     Crash Recovery team as determined by the Production Superintendent. All other aircraft
     IFE’s that can be moved by normal means of towing will remain the responsibility of the
     AMXS and moved according to tech data.
     2.7.10. Assemble a team to respond to a Hot Brakes condition.

        Brake condition by the 920 MOF/MOC advised of location and tail number of
        aircraft.
        2.7.10.2. CCDAR Team Chief or assigned technical expert will evaluate Hot Brakes.
        Nonessential personnel will evacuate the area to a minimum of 300 feet from the
        aircraft.
        2.7.10.3. Hot brake areas are designated as runway 11/29 Short Takeoff and Landing
        (STOL), and taxiway J, and B south warm-up.

(THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE AIRCRAFT IS MOVED/LIFTED)

CRASH RECOVERY TEAM CHIEF WILL ENSURE:
1. _____ Assemble Crash Recovery Team.
2. _____ Brief the team on the current situation using the Pre-Response Briefing Checklist.
3. _____ Check equipment and make preparation for transportation to crash site.
4. _____ Once authorization is given to access the crash site, use the Aircraft Data Checklist to

risk.
Make Control Decisions. Deal with risk by accepting, avoiding, reducing, spreading, or
transferring it.
Risk Control Implementation. Develop implementation strategy.
Supervise and review. Once controls are in place, then the process must be scrutinized to
determine its effectiveness.
7. _____ Develop a recovery plan and assign duties, using the following factors:
Aircraft condition (i.e. structural damage, gear up/down, weight, etc)
Terrain (i.e. level, sloped, muddy, snow, etc)
Weather (i.e. rain, wind, cold, etc)
Personnel and equipment available.
Hazards identified using ORM
Urgency of recovery (i.e. runway out of commission)
Brainstorm all problems, and encourage input from all personnel.
8. _____ Before commencing with the recovery, give a safety briefing using the Safety Briefing
Checklist.
9. _____ Fill out the Key Personnel Contact Information sheet.
