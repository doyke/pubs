This instruction implements Air Force Instruction 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Manage-
ment. It provides guidance and procedures for the management of Precision Measurement Equipment
(PME). For purposes of this instruction, PME is synonymous with Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic
Equipment (TMDE). It applies to all organizations of the 910 Airlift Wing which own/use PME.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision adds the Avionics Guidance Control Shop as the responsible work center for calibrating and
testing fluid and air pressure gauges. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.


1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. Owning Work Center (OWC) will deliver all Precision Measurement Equipment (PME) cali-
   brated by the U.S. Army Calibration Team and due calibration to the Maintenance Supply Liaison
   (MSL), in building 305. OWC will deliver all PME calibrated by the 910 Maintenance Squadron's
   Avionics Guidance and Control Shop (AGCS), and due calibration, to the AGCS Shop, building 203.
   Avionics PME will be scheduled through Comm/Nav LGMV. Torque indicating devices, fluid pres-
   sure (hydraulic, fuel, oil), air pressure gauges (not including oxygen), tensiometers and physician and
   platform (freight) scales will be scheduled and calibrated by the AGCS Shop.
   1.2. MSL will maintain the Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) Master Listing
   for all PME calibrated by the U.S. Army Calibration Team. AGCS will maintain the TMDE MASTER
   ID LIST by equipment ID for all PME calibrated by the AGCS Shop.
   1.3. OWC will maintain PME status showing a current calibration of all assigned PME.

    1.4. OWC shall have access to and be familiar with contents of T.O. 33K-1-100, T.O. 00-20-14, any
    Calibration and Measurement Summary (CMS) technical orders and T.O. 00-25-234. Furthermore,
    OWC will be particularly aware of T.O. 00-20-14, para. 3-8, TMDE User-Owner Responsibilities.

2. Calibration Procedures for PME Calibrated by the U.S. Army Calibration and Repair Center.
    2.1. All calibration done by the U.S. Army Calibration and Repair Center, Letterkenny Army Depot,
    Chambersburg PA, will be in accordance with the interservice support agreement and T.O. 00-20-14.
    Letterkenny will send a Transportable Field Calibration Unit (TFCU) on a quarterly basis to calibrate
    all PME due the following quarter. Prior to TFCE arrival:
       2.1.1. MSL sends a list of items to each OWC. The OWC reviews the list, makes any changes,
       and notifies MSL of the number of PME due calibration by circling those items in red. The OWC
       signs the list, annotates the total number of items due and returns the first copy of the list to MSL
       within 5 workdays.
       2.1.2. The day prior to the team's arrival, MSL will notify the OWC to bring their PME to MSL
       for scheduling. It is essential that PME be brought in the day prior to the team's arrival so that all
       items are ready for calibration the following morning. OWCs that have only reservists as PME
       coordinators must make arrangements to have another OWC bring it on the unit training assembly
       (UTA) prior to the TFCU arrival. Items calibrated in place (scales, test cell, etc.) will be coordi-
       nated between the OWC and TFCU by MSL.
       2.1.3. The OWC ensures PME is brought to MSL and the list sent out accompanies the items.
       MSL checks the list against items brought in, initials each corresponding item on the list, and
       returns a copy of the list to the OWC (this list serves as a hand receipt for PME received).
       2.1.4. Any PME that is priority will have an AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag,
       attached with the word "PRIORITY" (in red), in block 14. Notify MSL so that the item can be pro-
       cessed immediately.
       2.1.5. Upon completion of calibration, MSL will notify the OWC that PME is ready to pick up.
       OWC will bring their hand receipt so MSL can line through the item(s) returned.
    2.2. TMDE requiring calibration which are not listed in T.O. 33K-1-100 or are termed "CON-
    TRACT" in T.O. 33K-1-100, are not the responsibility of the TFCU.
    2.3. All PME the TFCU cannot calibrate on site will be sent to Letterkenny for calibration.
    2.4. Any PME requiring parts for repair will be handled by one of the following methods:
       2.4.1. The TFCU will take the item to Letterkenny for repair and order parts for repair there.
       2.4.2. The OWC will have the item returned with a list of parts required to repair the item. The
       OWC will order parts through Base Supply. MSL briefs the OWC on the proper ordering proce-
       dures for PME.
    2.5. One-of-a-kind and priority PME which fall between cycles will be handled in the following man-
    ner:
       2.5.1. The OWC attaches an AFTO Form 350 (properly filled out) to the item with printed name
       and DSN number (in red) at the top of block 15 and bring the item to MSSL along with the Tech-
       nical Order (T.O.), any ancillary equipment and priority letter.

      2.5.2. MSL contacts Letterkenny and ships the item via United Parcel Service (UPS).
   2.6. All PME calibrated by the TFCU are listed by OWC in the TMDE MASTER LISTING. Proce-
   dures for use are as follows:
      2.6.1. Three copies of this listing are received quarterly.
      2.6.2. The original is retained by MSL.
      2.6.3. The two remaining copies are distributed to the applicable OWC. The OWC reviews each
      item on the listing for accuracy and verifies the date due calibration on the DA Label 80 or DA
      Label 163. DA 163 must be signed by supervisor or designated representative. Corrections to the
      listing are annotated in red and the OWC returns the top copy of the listing to the MSL so that any
      changes or errors can be corrected. The OWC retains their copy until receipt of a new listing.
      Although all data is checked, one should pay particular attention to the ID Code, Serial, Model,
      and Due Cal Data columns of the listing.

3. Calibration Procedures for PME Calibrated by the 910 AGCS Shop.
   3.1. All calibration done by the 910 AGCS Shop is per TOs 00-20-14, 33K-1-100-1 and 2.
      3.1.1. For all PME calibrated by the AGCS Shop, Analysis will send to each OWC, a copy of the
      TMDE Listing, showing the calibration due date. Each OWC is responsible to have their equip-
      ment delivered to the AGCS Shop NLT the calibration due date.
   3.2. All TMDE (torque wrenches, pressure gauges, tensiometers, etc.) will be signed in by the OWC
   representative on the "Sign In/Out Control Log, located in the AGCS Shop.
      3.2.1. AGCS personnel will be responsible for creating and scheduling a job control number for
      the item(s) to be calibrated.
   3.3. Upon completion of calibration of equipment, AGCS personnel will notify the OWC that PME is
   ready to be picked up.
      3.3.1. When TMDE is picked up, the OWC must sign out the item(s) on the "Sign In/Out Control
      Log", located in the AGCS Shop.
