                                            Chapter 1

                               OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES

1.1. Overview of the Records Disposition Program. Each military agency head must
economically and efficiently manage the agency’s records according to Title 44 United States
Code (USC) § 2101-2118; § 3101-3107; 3301-3314; Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR), Part 1228, Disposition of Records, and applicable regulations of the General Services
Administration (GSA), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and DoD. In the Air Force,
economical and efficient records management involves scheduling all records for retention or
periodic destruction, preserving records that reflect the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the Air Force, preserving records that protect
the legal and financial rights of the Government and of individuals that Air Force actions directly
affect, offering records of enduring value for permanent preservation in the National Archives,
promptly and systematically disposing of records of temporary value, and setting up safeguards
against illegal removal, loss, or destruction of records.
     1.1.1. Do not dispose of any record without the specific authority of the Archivist of the
     United States. This guidance is reflected in the AFRIMS RDS.
     1.1.2. See AFI 33-322, Records Management Program, for specific responsibilities.
1.2. Objectives of the Records Disposition Program.
     1.2.1. Retire long-term (10 years old or older) paper records to authorized Federal Record
     Centers (FRC). A list of FRCs can be found at Attachment 2. Long-term electronic records
     are stored within the Air Force. Additional guidance on electronic records is found in the
     Electronic Records Management (ERM) Solution Guide and AFMAN 33-363.
     1.2.2. Transfer short-term paper records (less than 10 years old) to authorized local staging
     areas.
     1.2.3. Dispose of short-term holdings as soon as authorized.

                                 CATEGORIES OF RECORDS

2.1. Federal Records. Official records vary widely to include books, papers, maps,
photographs, electronic media, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, that the Air Force makes or receives under Federal law or during the course of its
public business and keeps as evidence of its organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities, and because of the material’s informational value.
Exception: Library and museum material that serves only reference or exhibition purposes,
stocks of publications, and blank forms.
NOTE:
Official records are public records and belong to the office, rather than the official.
   2.1.1. Collections of official records are known as official files. Removal and destruction of
   official records must be according to AFRIMS RDS, or other directives authorized in this
   instruction. Dispose of classified official records according to AFRIMS RDS and AFI 31-
   401, Information Security Program Management. (T-0).
2.2. Personal Records. Personal records relate solely to an individual’s private affairs,
including papers the individual created before entering Government service, private materials the
individual brought into, created, or received in the office, but are not related to Government
business and work-related circumstances. Personal records are not used for transacting
Government business.
   2.2.1. Maintain and dispose of correspondence designated “personal” or “private” but
   relating to the conduct of public business according to 44 USC §3101-3107.
   2.2.2. Do not include classified information in personal records.
   2.2.3. Work-Related Personal Records. Work-related personal records include diaries,
   journals, personal calendars, and appointment schedules that contain work-related
   information, but exist for the official’s personal use (such as reminders and personal
   observations on work-related topics) and are not for transacting Government business.
       2.2.3.1. File personal records separately from the records of the agency.
NOTE:
 The Air Force may later designate some of these materials as official records, depending on the
circumstances surrounding their creation, maintenance, use, or disposition.
   2.2.4. Presidential appointees and other officials in policy-making positions may donate
   personal records to a presidential library, the National Archives, or the Air Force Historical
   Research Agency (AFHRA), 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
   Exception: Donated papers must not contain classified material or compartmented, restricted
   data, or formerly restricted data.
       2.2.4.1. Donors who qualify according to AFI 31-401 may be granted access to classified
       material.
 8                                                            AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


        2.2.4.2. Officials may choose to dispose of the reference (or extra copy) file according to
        approved disposition.
     2.2.5. DELETED.
        2.2.5.1. Donors who qualify according to AFI 31-401 may be granted access to classified
        material.
        2.2.5.2. Officials may choose to dispose of the reference (or extra copy) file according to
        approved disposition.
2.3. Private Organizations’ Records. Records of private organizations (such as the American
Red Cross, Air Force Aid Society, federal credit unions, various national scouting organizations,
Little League, American Legion, hobby clubs, and other special interest groups) serving Air
Force communities are not official records within the scope of this instruction. (See AFPD 34-2,
Managing Nonappropriated Funds, for more details on private organizations.)
2.4. Permanent Records. Permanent records include those that the Archivist of the United
States decides have enduring value because they document the organization and functions of the
Air Force, contain significant information on persons, things (such as historic buildings or
manufactured objects), places, events, contingency operations, conflicts, problems, and
conditions with which the Air Force has dealt.
     2.4.1. Personnel must justify records that they consider worthy of permanent retention (see
     paragraph 11.3.2).
     2.4.2. Only the Archivist of the United States can approve the permanent retention of
     records. Such approvals take the form of appropriate disposition standards published in
     AFRIMS RDS; 44 USC § 3301-3314; the National Archives and Records Administration
     (NARA); General Records Schedule (GRS); Federal Information Resources Management
     Regulation; and Title 41, CFR, Part 105, General Services Administration.
2.5. Temporary Records. Temporary records are any records determined by the Archivist of
the United States to have insufficient value to warrant preservation by the National Archives.
Temporary records are disposable after a fixed period of time or after an event and according to
the AFRIMS RDS.
2.6. Unscheduled Records. Unscheduled records are not disposable under the GRS and have
not been approved by NARA; they are described, but not authorized for disposal by NARA
because they are on “Disposition Pending” status or NARA has not completed the appraisal. Do
not retire unscheduled records to records centers without special permission from the Air Force
Records Officer, who will send a waiver request addressing NARA restrictions.
2.7. State Records. These records are created by military members, most specifically ANG
members in performance of state-funded activities and belong to the state funding the activity.
There may be a thin line separating Federal and State records. For example, during a hurricane or
flood an ANG unit may be activated to assist with a state emergency. Should the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) get involved or Federal dollars be expended toward
the emergency, the records created by the ANG become Federal records. State records are the
property of the state, and Federal records are the property of the Agency (i.e., Air Force). When
there is an issue of whether records are state or Federal property, the ANG unit’s Base Records
Manager (BRM) will contact the ANG Command Records Manager (CRM) for guidance. If
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                        9


necessary, the ANG CRM will coordinate with the Air Force Records Officer (and any
applicable MAJCOM CRM.
   2.7.1. State or Federal records pertaining to AFRC issues should be directed to the AFRC
   CRM.
   2.7.2. State or Federal records pertaining to active duty Air Force issues should be directed
   to the applicable MAJCOM CRM.
   2.7.3. The Air Force Records Officer will provide guidance to the BRM as necessary or in
   the event the CRM is unavailable.
2.8. Records in Other Than Paper Form. These records include data on servers, hard disk
drives, shared drives, all types of compact discs, digital versatile disks (DVD), optical disks,
magnetic tapes, floppy disks, computer disk drums, records on hard disks and in electronic
databases, paper tapes, information on microform (such as roll films, aperture cards, film jackets,
microfiche, ultrafiche, video disks, and tapes) and audiovisual records (such as motion pictures,
still photography, and sound recordings). The same general principles of record evaluation and
the specific disposition instructions prescribed in the AFRIMS RDS apply regardless of physical
form or characteristics of the medium. Records of differing retention periods in the same system
are retained for the longest period authorized for any of the recorded data in the system and
require backup for records preservation.
   2.8.1. Prepare and submit an AF Form 525, Records Disposition Recommendation,
   according to paragraph 11.2 for any records not covered in AFRIMS RDS. When evaluating
   records in other than paper form consider if all information contained in source documents is
   committed to the system; if medium involved will be exportable into a readable format for
   future reference such as audits, accountability, backup data to reports, and so forth; if optical
   disks, electronic records, and microforms are duplications of records, substitutions of records
   or new records; and if the records meet the requirements of NARA and GSA concerning the
   long-term retention value of audiovisual or cartographic records (see paragraphs 5.7.1.4 and
   5.7.2).
2.9. Vital Records During Emergency. The Federal vital records program includes two basic
categories: emergency operating records and rights and interest records.
   2.9.1. Emergency operating records serve the Federal Government if the country is attacked
   and include records necessary for military efforts and mobilization; protection of material,
   personnel, services, systems, public health, safety, and order; and those needed to conduct
   civil defense activities.
       2.9.1.1. Emergency operating centers must keep vital records immediately available.
       2.9.1.2. The Headquarters United States Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and
       Programs, (HQ USAF/A8) manages the emergency operation program for the Air Force
       as part of the Air Force Continuity of Operations Plan, the USAF Operation and
       Mobilization Plan, and other contingency war or planning programs (see AFI 10-208,
       Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program; AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning
       and Execution; and AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response [FSTR] Planning and
       Operations).

   2.9.2. Rights and interest records uphold the legal rights and interests of individual citizens
   and their Government and include research, Social Security, retirement, payroll, and
   insurance records.
       2.9.2.1. The Social Security Administration maintains social security records.
       2.9.2.2. The Office of Personnel Management maintains civilian retirement records.
       2.9.2.3. The Air Force Military Personnel and the Air Force Reserve Personnel Centers
       send the military personnel retirement records to the National Personnel Records Center
       (NPRC), 9700 Page Avenue, St Louis, MO 63132-5100.
       2.9.2.4. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) maintains payroll and
       accompanying insurance records.
       2.9.2.5. The offices of primary responsibility (OPR) send research records to the FRCs
       when the Air Force no longer needs the records.
       2.9.2.6. The OPRs generally send permanent research records to the Washington
       National Records Center (WNRC).
       2.9.2.7. The NARA will store, protect, and maintain rights and interest vital records for
       agencies desiring permanent storage of their vital records.
       2.9.2.8. Each NARA record center has environmentally controlled space for storing
       records on magnetic tape and photographic film.
       2.9.2.9. Transfer rights and interest records to a record center by contacting the Air Force
       Record Officer (SAF/XCISI) who will coordinate with personnel from the FRC
       Operations in Washington DC to determine which FRC will receive the records.
2.10. Contractors’ Records. Records relating to work that contractors perform are maintained
according to AFRIMS RDS, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and the Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement, as applicable.
   2.10.1. When contractors create data for the government’s use, the contract must identify the
   background data that contractors must deliver to the government for possible reuse.
       2.10.1.1. Before identifying the background data that contractors must deliver to the
       government, program and contracting officers must coordinate with records and
       information managers, historians and other government agencies as appropriate to ensure
       that all government needs are met, especially when the data supports new missions or
       programs.
       2.10.1.2. When the background data includes electronic records, the contractor must
       deliver enough technical documentation to allow the Air Force or other agencies to use
       the data.
       2.10.1.3. Manage all data created for government use or legally controlled by the
       government according to the records management procedures in this instruction.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                         11


                                            Chapter 3

TRANSFER OF PERMANENT ELECTRONIC RECORDS TO NATIONAL ARCHIVES
               AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION (NARA)

3.1. Current Acceptable Formats Transferable to National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) (36 CFR Part 1228).
  3.1.1. Acceptable Format. Electronic records being transferred to NARA must be written in
  a format that does not depend on specific hardware or software to decode it. Acceptable
  codes are the American Standard Code for Information Interchange and the Extended Binary-
  Coded Decimal Interchange Code. All extraneous control characters must be removed,
  except:
     3.1.1.1. Record length indicators for variable length records.
     3.1.1.2. Marks delimiting a data element, field, record, or file.
     3.1.1.3. Standardized Markup Language tags.
  3.1.2. Data files and databases will be transferred as flat files or as rectangular tables, i.e., as
  two-dimensional arrays, lists, or tables. All records in a database should have the same
  logical format. Each data element within a record will contain only one data value. A record
  should not contain nested repeating groups of data items.
  3.1.3. Acceptable Media. Media forms currently approved by NARA for electronic records
  transfer are listed in paragraphs 3.1.3.1, 3.1.3.2, and 3.1.3.3. NARA will copy the contents of
  the media at the time of accessioning and return the media to the transferring activity unless
  that activity indicates it does not want the media returned.
     3.1.3.1. Open Reel Magnetic Tape. Open-reel magnetic tape shall be on -inch 9-track
     tape reels recorded at 1600 or 6250 bits per inch (bpi) that meet American National
     Standard Institute (ANSI) X3.39-1986, American National Standard: Recorded Magnetic
     Tape for Information Interchange (1600 characters per inch ) or ANSI X3.54-1986,
     American National Standard; Recorded Magnetic Tape for Information Interchange
     (6250 cpi, Group Coded Recording), respectively.
     3.1.3.2. Magnetic Tape Cartridge – 18-Track 3480-Class. Tape cartridges shall be 18-
     track 3480-class cartridges recorded at 37,871 bpi that meet ANSI X3.180-1990,
     American National Standard: Magnetic Tape and Cartridge for Information Interchange -
     18-Track, Parallel, 1/2 inch (12.65 millimeter [mm]), 37871 cpi, Group-Coded -
     Requirements for Recording. The data shall be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per
     block.
     3.1.3.3. Digital Linear Tape (DLT) Type IV. DLT Type IV high-density magnetic
     cartridge tape was added to NARA’s list of acceptable electronic records transfer media
     in November 2001. DLT Type IV can store up to 40 gigabytes of information on each
     cartridge. Activities interested in using this media for records transfer should coordinate
     with the appropriate Joint Staff/Headquarters Combatant Command Records Manager,
     who will coordinate with NARA’s Electronic and Special Media Records Services
     Division concerning technical limitations prior to initiating such a transfer.
 12                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


3.2. Transfer Criteria.
   3.2.1. Transfers of electronic records must consist of an identifiable, organized body of
   records (not necessarily a traditional series, e.g., the electronic mail (E-mail) records of the
   Deputy Secretary from the past fiscal year). The records should be scheduled for transfer to
   NARA using the Standard Form (SF) 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, prior
   to transfer if an existing approved schedule does not exist.
   3.2.2. E-Mail transfers should come from E-mail systems or from a DoD 5015.2-STD,
   Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications,
   certified Records Management Application (RMA). (Note: In the ‘II’ format (i.e., little-
   endian), byte order is always from the least significant byte to the most significant byte.) If
   you need to send them from some other kind of system, first contact NARA to see if they can
   accommodate it.
   3.2.3. For preservation purposes, NARA prefers that agencies transfer E-mail and their
   attachments in a markup language format that contains:
       3.2.3.1. Delimiters to indicate the beginning and end of each message and the beginning
       and end of each attachment, if any. Each attachment must be differentiated from the body
       of the message, and uniquely identified.
       3.2.3.2. Labels to identify each part of the message (Date, To [all recipients, including
       cc: and bc: copies], From, Subject, Body, and Attachment) including transmission and
       receipt information (Time Sent, Time Opened, Message Size, File Name, and similar
       information, if available). Agencies that use an E-mail system that identifies users by
       codes or nicknames, or identifies addressees only by the name of a distribution list should
       include information with the transfer-level documentation, to ensure identification of the
       sender and addressee). (Note: For records created after the effective date of this
       guidance, tagged image file format (TIFF) version 6.0 is recommended and preferred.
       Versions 4.0 and 5.0 are acceptable. The reference specifications for version 6.0 are
       defined at http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html#dr).
       3.2.3.3. If a markup language cannot be produced, NARA will accept E-mail messages
       and their attachments in their native formats. Each attachment should be labeled with its
       filename and the default file extension to indicate the proprietary software used to create
       the attachment. If attachment file names do not include the default file extension (e.g.,
       .doc, .xls), agencies must provide documentation identifying the proprietary formats used
       to create each attachment.
   3.2.4. At this time, NARA will not accept E-mail messages that have been converted to a
   portable document format (PDF) or other image file format. NARA is developing transfer
   requirements for PDF and scanned images as part of the NARA Electronic Records
   Management Initiative.
   3.2.5. Attachments to E-mail messages may be transferred in their native formats, such as
   PDF, other image file formats, and common office automation formats.
3.3. Transfer Information.
   3.3.1. Transfer records on Type IV DLT or through file transfer protocol (FTP). FTP
   transfers currently are limited to a maximum size of five gigabytes (5 GB). For FTP
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     13


   transfers, the offering organization must provide the following information to NARA:
   internet protocol (IP) address for the FTP site, a temporary user name and temporary
   password for NARA to use in accessing the FTP site, a designated time or time span for
   NARA to access the records and download a copy to NARA.
NOTE:
See http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/register.htm for a list          of Records     Management
Applications (RMA) compliant with DoD 5015.2-STD.
   3.3.2. DoD 5015.2-STD defines intelligent names as clear, uncoded, indications of the
   individual.
3.4. Transfer Requirements for Scanned Images of Textual Records.
   3.4.1. This guidance expands currently acceptable formats to enable the transfer of existing
   scanned images of textual records to NARA. (Note: In the ‘II’ format (i.e., little-endian),
   byte order is always from the least significant byte to the most significant byte.) The
   guidance does not apply to “original digital images” or scanned images of primarily
   nontextual records (e.g., maps and photographs).
   3.4.2. NARA will accept transfers of scanned images that have been scheduled as permanent
   records on an SF 115. To facilitate preservation processing and future access to these records,
   agencies must comply with the following minimum requirements.
3.5. Image File Format.
   3.5.1. NARA will accept scanned images in the following file formats:
      3.5.1.1. TIFF, in ‘II’ format, versions 4.0 (April 1987), 5.0 (October 1988), and 6.0 (June
      1992). (Note: For records created after the effective date of this guidance, TIFF version
      6.0 is recommended and preferred. Versions 4.0 and 5.0 are acceptable. The reference
      specifications          for        version         6.0         are       defined         at
      http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html#dr.)
      3.5.1.2. Graphics Interchange Format, versions 87a (June 1987), and 89a (July 1990).
      3.5.1.3. Basic Image Interchange Format (BIIF), International Standards Organization
      (ISO) Standard 12087-5, Part 5 (December 1998).
      3.5.1.4. Portable Network Graphics, version 1.0 (October 1996).
   3.5.2. NARA will periodically update this set of acceptable formats and versions.
   3.5.3. NARA prefers uncompressed images. With prior consultation between NARA and the
   transferring organization, NARA may accept compressed images created using a lossless
   compression method (e.g., International Telecommunications Unit (ITU) when it is
   impractical or technically impossible to transfer uncompressed files (e.g., due to limitations
   on bandwidth or storage media capacities). NARA will not accept images created using lossy
   compression techniques because the potential information loss that can result from
   compression can make such images unsuitable for archival preservation. (Note: Lossy refers
   to a method of image compression where some image content is sacrificed in exchange for
   higher compression ratios).

3.6. Acceptable Image Quality Specifications.
   3.6.1. Scanned images of textual records transferred to NARA must meet the following
   minimum requirements for scanning resolution and pixel (bit) depth to support archival
   preservation and continued use.
   3.6.2. Bitonal (1-bit) scanned at 300-600 pixels per inch (ppi). (Note: The acronym JPEG
   stands for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, a standards committee formed in 1982 by
   the ISO to research methods for electronically transmitting video, still images, and text.) This
   is appropriate for documents that consist exclusively of clean printed type possessing high
   inherent contrast (e.g., laser printed or typeset on a white background). Scanning at 600 ppi is
   recommended.
   3.6.3. Gray scale (8-bit) scanned at 300-400 ppi. This is appropriate for textual documents
   of poor legibility because of low inherent contrast, staining or fading (e.g., carbon copies,
   thermofax, or documents with handwritten annotations or other markings), or that contain
   halftone illustrations or photographs. Scanning at 400 ppi is recommended.
   3.6.4. Color (24-bit Red, Green, Blue [RGB]) scanned at 300-400 ppi. Color mode (if
   technically available) is appropriate for text containing color information important to
   interpretation or content. Scanning at 400 ppi is recommended.
3.7. Transfer Documentation.
   3.7.1. Submit signed SF 258, Agreement to Transfer Records to the National Archives of the
   United States.
      3.7.1.1. For each transfer, supply documentation that identifies:
          3.7.1.1.1. Imaging system and version (i.e., application software and storage system).
          3.7.1.1.2. Records Management Application (if applicable) and version.
          3.7.1.1.3. Image file format and version.
          3.7.1.1.4. Image quality specifications (i.e., resolution, pixel (bit) depth, compression
          technique).
          3.7.1.1.5. Total number of documents in the transfer.
          3.7.1.1.6. Total number of images in the transfer.
          3.7.1.1.7. Arrangement of files on the transfer media.
          3.7.1.1.8. Operating system and version.
          3.7.1.1.9. Structure of image header (if applicable).
      3.7.1.2. In addition, supply the following:
          3.7.1.2.1. Control information necessary to enable retrieval of each file, including
          whether the file is a single image or multiple images. Such information can be
          conveyed through metadata (e.g., a thumbnail index), captured for each document
          either in the image header or in accompanying documentation.
          3.7.1.2.2. Finding aids, indexes, and other information used to retrieve the records
          also must be transferred to NARA to support future access to the records.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      15


          3.7.1.2.3. The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) versions of the images (i.e.,
          additional files enabling full text searches linked to the appropriate scanned image), if
          available.
      3.7.1.3. Supply a description of the quality control inspection performed as part of the
      imaging process and a report on the results of the last inspection performed on the images
      and the date of that inspection.
      3.7.1.4. For inspections conducted after the effective date of this guidance, agencies must
      use one of the quality sampling methods presented in ANSI/Association of Information
      Imaging Managers (AIIM) TR34-1966, Sampling Procedures for Inspection by Attributes
      of Images in Electronic Image Management and Micrographic Systems at
      http://www.aiim.org, or by contacting the Records Management Program Office at
      usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-records@mail.mil.
3.8. Transfer Mechanisms for Scanned Images Textual Records.
   3.8.1. Transfer scanned images as uncompressed and nonaggregated files.
      3.8.1.1. Transfer records on DLT Type IV or through FTP. FTP transfers currently are
      limited to a maximum size of 5 GB. For FTP transfers, the offering agency must provide
      the following information to NARA: the IP address for the agency FTP site, temporary
      user name and temporary password for NARA to use in accessing the agency FTP site,
      designated time or time span for NARA to access the records and download a copy to
      NARA.
          3.8.1.1.1. The “II” format (i.e., little-endian) byte order is always from the least
          significant byte.
3.9. Records in Portable Document Format (PDF).
   3.9.1. This instruction expands currently acceptable formats to enable the transfer of records
   in PDF to NARA. Find transfer requirements for records in PDF (paragraphs 3.9.2 and
   3.9.3), records converted to PDF from their native electronic formats (e.g., office automation
   products), records converted to PDF from scanned paper or image formats such as TIFF.
   3.9.2. Transfer Requirements for PDF Records.
      3.9.2.1. Transfer PDF records that have been scheduled as permanent records on SF 115.
      Any organization that has permanent PDF records that do not meet the requirements in
      this instruction, should contact the NARA appraisal archivist for the Air Force and the
      Air Force Records Officer. To facilitate future access to the records, organizations must
      comply with the following minimum requirements:
          3.9.2.1.1. Provide PDF File Specification for all PDF records.
              3.9.2.1.1.1. PDF records must comply with PDF versions 1.0 through 7.0 (i.e., all
              existing PDF versions as of the date of this instruction) and meet the requirements
              outlined in paragraphs 3.9.2 through 3.9.2.1.1.
              3.9.2.1.1.2. NARA periodically updates the list of acceptable PDF versions.
   3.9.3. General Requirements for All PDF records.
      3.9.3.1. Security Requirements.
16                                                          AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


        3.9.3.1.1. PDF records must not contain security settings (e.g., self-sign security, user
        passwords, and/or permissions) that prevent NARA from opening, viewing or
        printing the record.
        3.9.3.1.2. PDF records created after 1 April 2004 must have all security settings
        deactivated (e.g., encryption, master passwords, and/or permissions) prior to transfer
        to NARA. Deactivation of security settings ensures NARA’s ability to support long-
        term record migration and preservation.
     3.9.3.2. Review of Special Features. Because of the complexities associated with certain
     PDF features, NARA will review PDF records containing special features on a case-by-
     case basis when the records are scheduled. Examples of special features include but are
     not limited to: digital signatures; links to other documents, files or sites; embedded files
     (including multimedia objects); form data; comments and/or annotations.
  3.9.4. Requirements for Records Converted to PDF from their Native Electronic Formats
  (e.g., office automation products).
     3.9.4.1. Electronic records that have been converted to PDF from their native electronic
     formats must include embedded fonts to guarantee the visual reproduction of all text as
     created. All fonts embedded in PDF records must be publicly identified as legally
     embeddable (i.e., font license permits embedding) in a file for unlimited, universal
     viewing and printing.
        3.9.4.1.1. PDF records that reference fonts other than the “base 14 fonts” must have
        those fonts referenced in the record (i.e., as a minimum, subsets of all referenced
        fonts) embedded within the PDF file. (Note: TIFF version 6.0 is recommended and
        preferred for records created after the effective date of this guidance. Versions 4.0
        and 5.0 are acceptable. The reference specifications for version 6.0 are defined at
        http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html#dr.)
        3.9.4.1.2. PDF records created after 1 April 2004 must have all fonts referenced in
        the record, including the “base 14 fonts,” embedded within the PDF file. This
        requirement is met by having, as a minimum, subsets of all referenced fonts
        embedded within the PDF file.
  3.9.5. Requirements for Scanned Paper or Image Formats Converted to PDF.
     3.9.5.1. Scanned images of textual paper records converted to PDF must adhere to the
     requirements in NWM 02.2003, Memorandum to Agency Records Officers: Expanding
     Acceptable Transfer Formats: Transfer Instructions for Scanned Images of Textual
     Records (Scanned Images Transfer Guidance), dated December 23, 2002, located at
     http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/pdf-records.html.
        3.9.5.1.1. Any organization that has PDF records that have not been scanned
        according to the minimum image quality specifications in the NWM 02.2003
        guidance, must contact the Air Force Record Officer (SAF/XCISI) for guidance.
     3.9.5.2. PDF records that contain embedded searchable text based on OCR must be
     identical in content and appearance to the source document. NARA understands that the
     ability to embed OCRed text in PDF records enhances access to the records. NARA will
     accept PDF records with uncorrected OCRed text. NARA will not accept PDF records
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                  17


     resulting from OCR processes that either alter the content or degrade the quality of the
     original bit-mapped image.
         3.9.5.2.1. NARA will accept PDF records that have been OCRed using processes that
         do not alter the original bit-mapped image. An example of an output process that
         accomplishes this requirement is Searchable Image - Exact.
         3.9.5.2.2. NARA will not accept PDF records that have been OCRed using processes
         that substitute OCRed text for the original scanned text within the bit-mapped image.
         Such OCR processes may involve loss of data through imprecise interpretation of
         scanned characters. Examples of output processes that use this prohibited technique
         include Formatted Text and Graphics and PDF Normal.
         3.9.5.2.3. NARA will not accept PDF records that have been OCRed using processes
         that use lossy compression to reduce file size (e.g., JPEG). Such OCR processes
         degrade the quality of the original image and may make such images unsuitable for
         archival preservation. An example of an output process that uses this lossy
         compression technique for color and grayscale images is Searchable Image -
         Compact.
  3.9.6. Transfer Documentation.
     3.9.6.1. This guidance supplements transfer documentation requirements in 36 CFR Part
     1228, located at http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/i.html to ensure
     that transfers of records in PDF are clearly identified and described. Organizations must
     also submit a signed SF 258, as required by 36 CFR Part 1228.
         3.9.6.1.1. For each transfer, organizations must supply documentation that identifies
         the software used to create the PDF records (if available) and the version, and the
         operating system (if available) and version.
         3.9.6.1.2. Organizations must provide all external finding aids for the transferred
         PDF records (e.g., indexes; descriptive, administrative, or technical metadata; and/or
         databases of OCRed text) in formats approved by NARA, with the appropriate
         documentation required by 36 CFR Part 1228.
         3.9.6.1.3. When an organization develops standards or guidelines to assist in
         formatting, validating, or accessing PDF records (including recommended software or
         quality settings, and/or guidelines for embedding metadata within PDF records), a
         copy of these standards or guidelines must be included with the transfer.
         3.9.6.1.4. PDF records converted from scanned images also must adhere to the
         transfer documentation requirements of the Scanned Images Transfer Guidance,
         http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/scanned-textual.html.
  3.9.7. Transfer Mechanisms for PDF.
     3.9.7.1. PDF records must not be compressed (e.g., Winzip, PKZIP) or aggregated (e.g.,
     tape archive [TAR]) for purposes of transfer unless NARA has approved the transfer in
     compressed or aggregated form in advance. In such cases, NARA may require the
     organization to provide the software to decompress the records (see 36 CFR Part 1228).
 18                                                            AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


      3.9.7.2. The basic fonts are: Courier (Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic), Arial MT
      (Regular Oblique, and Bold Oblique), Times New Roman PS MT (Roman, Bold, Italic,
      and Bold Italic), Symbol, and Zap dingbats.
3.10. Digital Photographic Records.
   3.10.1. This instruction expands currently acceptable formats to enable the transfer of
   permanent digital photographic records to NARA.
   3.10.2. This instruction applies to digital photographic records that have been appraised and
   scheduled for permanent retention at NARA. Included under the scope of this instruction are
   still photographs of natural, real-world scenes or subjects created in support of agency
   business that are produced from digital cameras (excluding the types of records described
   below), and scanned images of photographic prints, slides, and negatives.
   3.10.3. The instruction applies to master image files of digital photographs created using
   medium to high quality resolution settings appropriate for continued preservation. (Note: In
   the ‘II’ format (i.e., little-endian), byte order is always from the least significant byte to the
   most significant byte.)
   3.10.4. The following digital photographic records will not be accepted for transfer under
   this instruction:
      3.10.4.1. Low-resolution photographs typically created for posting on organization web
      sites (i.e., all files created at less than 2 mega pixels, or scanned as less than 2000 line
      files). (Note: For records created after the effective date of this guidance, TIFF version
      6.0 is recommended and preferred. Versions 4.0 and 5.0 are acceptable. The reference
      specifications            for         version       6.0         are        defined        at
      http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html#dr.)
      3.10.4.2. Digital photographs captured within office automation applications (e.g., word
      processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications).
      3.10.4.3. Digital photographic records such as aerial photography, and photogrammetric
      and satellite imagery.
      3.10.4.4. Vector-based images, such as records created using graphic arts software or
      computer-aided design applications.
   3.10.5. Transfer requirements for digital photographic records. NARA will accept transfers
   of permanent digital photographic records that meet the specifications of this instruction. The
   requirements in paragraphs 3.10.5.1 through 3.10.6 list acceptable image file formats, image
   quality specifications, transfer documentation, and related information on how to transfer
   these records to NARA. Any organization having permanent digital photographic records
   that do not meet the requirements in this instruction must contact the Air Force Records
   Officer for guidance.
      3.10.5.1. General Requirements.
          3.10.5.1.1. Digital photographic records acceptable for transfer to NARA must meet
          the provisions of paragraph 3.10.4.1 through paragraph 3.10.4.4 and shall include still
          photographs produced by digital cameras and scanned images of photographs.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      19


         3.10.5.1.2. Digital photographic records must be scheduled for permanent retention
         and transfer to NARA on SF 115. The records must be organized as either a discrete
         collection of photographs or by Air Force record series.
     3.10.5.2. Image File Format.
         3.10.5.2.1. NARA will accept digital photographic records in the following file
         formats and versions. Additional formats may be added in subsequent iterations of
         this instruction or in future guidance from NARA.
             3.10.5.2.1.1. TIFF, in ‘II’ format (Note: Height and width of an image in pixels).
             Default file extensions include .TIFF and .TIF.
             3.10.5.2.1.2. JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF), all versions compliant with
             ISO/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 10918-1:
             Information Technology—Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone
             Still Images (1994). (Note: The proportion of an image’s size given in terms of
             the horizontal dimension versus the vertical dimension.) Default file extensions
             include .JPEG, JFIF, and .JPG.
         3.10.5.2.2. NARA prefers that organizations transfer digital photographic records
         with file names that use the default file extension for each of the above formats.
         Records may be accepted that are named according to organization-specific naming
         conventions (e.g., organization acronym or NARA-assigned record group number)
         provided the corresponding computer files can be opened and the organization has
         transferred adequate documentation describing the file name and format of the files.
     3.10.5.3. Image Quality Specifications.
         3.10.5.3.1. Records must be provided as continuous-tone gray scale or color raster
         images, 8-bit or 16-bit per channel.
         3.10.5.3.2. Color images must be produced in RGB color mode as 24-bit or 48-bit
         color files.
         3.10.5.3.3. Effective 1 January 2005, digital camera files must be captured as 6
         megapixel files or greater with a minimum pixel array of 3,000 pixels by 2,000
         pixels. Records produced at this resolution and size are comparable in quality to 35-
         mm film photographs, which is the minimum quality level for still pictures currently
         accepted by NARA [see 36 CFR Part 1228].
  3.10.6. Photographs must be scanned as minimum 2,000 line files (Note: 3,000 line files
  describe digital photographs that are 3,000 pixels across the long dimension of the image) to
  approximate a 2-megapixel file according to the following image size and resolution
  guidelines. (Note: Image resolution for scanned images of photographs will vary according
  to the size of the source document, which may affect actual pixel dimensions and aspect
  ratios). Scan an 8” x 10” original (print, slide, or negative) at 200 dots per inch (dpi) (Note:
  True optical resolution is defined as the maximum or actual resolution of a device without
  recourse to interpolation. Interpolation (see Note 12) that occurs as part of the normal
  operation of digital cameras is acceptable) to produce a file that is 1,600 x 2,000 pixels. Scan
  a 4” x 5” original (print, slide, or negative) at 400 dpi to produce a file that is 1,600 x 2,000
20                                                            AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


  pixels. Scan a 35-mm original (print, slide, or negative) at 1400 dpi to produce a file that is
  1,300 x 2,000 pixels.
     3.10.6.1. Photographs scanned after 1 January 2005, must be produced as minimum
     3,000 line files to approximate a 6 megapixel file according to the following image size
     and resolution guidelines (Note: This process calculates greater or fewer pixels from
     existing pixels in order to resize an image as either larger or smaller). Records
     conforming to these guidelines will be comparable in quality to 35-mm film photographs,
     which is the minimum quality level for still pictures currently accepted by NARA (see 36
     CFR Part 1228) Scan an 8” x 10” original (print, slide, or negative) at 300 dpi to produce
     a file that is 2,400 x 3,000 pixels. Scan a 4” x 5” original (print, slide, or negative) at 600
     dpi to produce a file that is 2,400 x 3,000 pixels. Scan a 35-mm original (print, slide, or
     negative) at 2100 dpi to produce a file that is 2,000 x 3,000 pixels.
     3.10.6.2. Effective 1 January 2005, organizations must ensure that digital cameras and
     scanners produce records with true optical resolution (Note: Lossless refers to a method
     of image compression where there is no loss in quality when the image is compressed or
     uncompressed). Resizing images or interpolating to a higher resolution from a lower
     resolution for purposes of transfer will not be permitted. (T-0).
     3.10.6.3. NARA will accept digital photographs in TIFF file formats that are compressed
     using a lossless compression method. If available, NARA prefers that organizations
     transfer uncompressed versions of these files. (Note: While there is no standard or
     industry-recognized metric for determining medium quality, records created using this
     setting would reveal some degradation of the image without substantive loss of quality
     when viewed at normal size).
     3.10.6.4. NARA will accept permanent digital photographs in the JPEG file format,
     which uses a lossy (Note: While there is no standard or industry-recognized metric for
     determining high quality, records created using this setting would reveal no noticeable
     loss of quality or image degradation when viewed at normal size) compression method,
     provided the records have been created using at least medium quality compression
     settings (or better) (Note: Examples of descriptive metadata elements include Dublin
     Core and International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata).
     3.10.6.5. Effective 1 January 2005, agencies must create JPEG files using at least high-
     quality compression settings (or better). (Note: The International Color Consortium
     [ICC] and Microsoft Windows Image Color Management [ICM] profiles define industry
     standard methods of generating and interpreting numeric values that describe color for
     digital screens, scanners, and output devices to ensure color consistency across platforms
     and devices.) (T-0).
     3.10.6.6. Effective 1 January 2005, organizations must transfer first generation JPEG
     files that have not been degraded in quality by multiple revisions and resaving. Making
     changes to JPEG files (e.g., altering the image size), and then resaving them can result in
     recompression of the images, leading to additional data loss and degradation of image
     quality and NARA will not accept them. (T-0).
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                         21


3.11. Digital Geospatial Data Records.
   3.11.1. This instruction expands currently acceptable formats to enable the transfer of
   permanent digital geospatial data records created for Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
   to NARA.
   3.11.2. This instruction applies to digital geospatial data records (i.e., digital cartographic
   data files that may be processed in GIS) that have been appraised and scheduled for
   permanent retention at NARA. Excluded are fixed views of the data and other types of
   reports and output products created as paper maps, other nondigital formats, or fixed digital
   formats such as GeoTIFF images. NARA, the Air Force Record Officer and the subject
   matter expert determine specific disposition instructions through the record scheduling
   process.
   3.11.3. Transfer Requirements for Digital Geospatial Data Records.
      3.11.3.1. Contact the Air Force Record Officer to schedule permanent digital geospatial
      data records that do not meet the requirements of this instruction.
   3.11.4. General Requirements. Those digital geospatial data records that are appraised as
   permanent must be scheduled for permanent retention and transferred to NARA on SF 115.
   The records must be organized as either a logical grouping of information or by Air Force
   record series.
   3.11.5. Geospatial Data Standards. NARA will accept digital geospatial data records that
   fully implement a non-proprietary, published, open standard maintained by or for a Federal,
   national, or international standards organization (Note: Additional examples of open
   standards include the International Hydrographic Organization Transfer Standard for Digital
   Hydrographic Data [IHO 57], Spatial Data Standard for Facilities, Infrastructure and
   Environment, and Military Standard: The Interface Standard for Vector Product Format
   [MIL-STD-2407]). Digital geospatial data records created and maintained in proprietary
   formats must be transferred to NARA in an acceptable geospatial data standard. Examples of
   acceptable geospatial data standards include, but are not limited to:
      3.11.5.1. Spatial Data Transfer Standard. This standard has been incorporated into 36
      CFR Part 1228.270 (d) (3). (See http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/sdts/ and
      http://www.fgdc.gov/standards).
      3.11.5.2. Geography Markup Language, versions 2 and 3 (Open GIS Consortium). (See
      http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml).
   3.11.6. Transfer Documentation. This instruction supplements transfer documentation
   requirements in 36 CFR Part 1228. For all such transfers, organizations must submit a signed
   SF 258, as required by 36 CFR Part 1228.
      3.11.6.1. For each transfer, organizations must supplement the SF 258 with additional
      information identifying the standard and version to which the records adhere, the number
      of files in the transfer, the size (in bytes) of these files, and the logical arrangement of the
      files (e.g., by subject or date).
      3.11.6.2. Organizations must provide descriptive and technical information about the
      records (i.e., metadata). (Note: Examples of descriptive metadata elements for digital
      geospatial data include the profiles in SDTS, the Federal Geographic Data Committee’s
 22                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


      Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, incorporated into 36 CFR Part
      1228.270(e)(3), and the metadata components of the Geography Markup Language,
      version 3). This metadata should be incorporated into the appropriate section within the
      approved transfer standard used to transfer the digital geospatial data records to NARA.
      The metadata must conform to a standard maintained by a Federal, national, or
      international body. For each transfer the organization must reference the standards to
      which the data and metadata conform, including version and date, where applicable.
      3.11.6.3. When metadata does not conform to a published standard, organizations must
      provide a full description of the standard and the metadata used. Where the standard is
      not maintained by a national or international body (i.e., agency specific), a copy and
      description of the standard must be included.
   3.11.7. Transfer Mechanisms.
      3.11.7.1. Organizations may transfer digital geospatial data records using any of the
      approved media or methods listed in 36 CFR Part 1228.270(c). (Note: See
      http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/index.html.)
      3.11.7.2. Digital geospatial data records must not be compressed (e.g., Winzip, PKZIP)
      or aggregated (e.g., TAR) for purposes of transfer unless NARA has approved the
      transfer in compressed or aggregated form in advance. In such cases, NARA may require
      the organization to provide the software to decompress the records.
3.12. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Records Manager (RM)
Guidance for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Authenticated and Secure Transaction
Records.
   3.12.1. Introduction. The Records Management Guidance for Agencies Implementing
   Electronic         Signature        Technologies,          http://www.archives.gov/records-
   mgmt/policy/electronic-signature-technology.html, issued by NARA on 18 October 2000,
   requires that Federal agencies comply with records management requirements when
   implementing Public Law (PL) 105-277, Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA).
   PL 105-277 requires that, when practicable, agencies use electronic forms, electronic filing,
   and electronic signatures to conduct official business with the public by 2003.
   3.12.2. Public key cryptography. Public key cryptography, which is used to implement
   digital signatures, is one of the principal electronic signature technologies that organizations
   will use when conducting business electronically. PKI supports the application of digital
   signature technology. PKI is defined as “a set of policies, processes, server platforms,
   software and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-
   private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.”
   3.12.3. Records Management Guidance. This guidance applies to the three categories of
   Federal record scope:
      3.12.3.1. PKI Transaction-Specific records that may be embedded or referenced within
      each transaction (e.g., the digital signature, generally the public key certificate and
      possibly transaction-specific PKI records used for authentication or non-repudiation, such
      as certificate validation responses).
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     23


     3.12.3.2. PKI-Unique Administrative records, which are generally retained separate from
     the transaction data, support authentication, nonrepudiation and the overall
     trustworthiness of the electronic transaction process (e.g., certificate validation responses
     used to validate the subscriber/signer’s certificate, subscriber agreement, etc.)
     3.12.3.3. Other Administrative records (non-PKI records) that can be retained and used
     to attest to the reliability and overall trustworthiness of the PKI-based transaction
     process, such as client/browser and server setup and configuration records, application or
     system testing and validation records, and operational procedures and training
     documentation.
  3.12.4. PKI-Related Record Keeping Principles. All Federal PKI digital signature
  authenticated and secured transaction records should:
     3.12.4.1. Contain the human readable name of the subscriber/signer. This could be the
     subject name from the public key certificate or other metadata that represents the name of
     the subscriber/signer.
     3.12.4.2. Include a human readable date and time associated with the signing of the
     transaction that is “at or near the time” that the signing occurred. (Note: Federal Rules of
     Evidence 803(6) - a “[r]ecord of a regularly conducted activity” such as a “memorandum,
     report, record, or data compilation, in any form” will be admissible if the record was
     made “at or near the time by...”). (T-0).
     3.12.4.3. Indicate the intent of the subscriber/signer, i.e., the purpose for applying the
     PKI digital signature to the transaction. The intent may be obvious in that it relates
     directly to a purpose included in the text of the transaction, e.g., “approved by” or
     “submitted by.” It could be in the form of a statement that the subscriber/signer takes
     responsibility for the transaction or that the subscriber/signer is authorized to sign on
     behalf of someone else. It also may relate to the context of the transaction (e.g., a
     purchase order form).
  3.12.5. For the PKI-related transaction records, the operational or recordkeeping system
  should:
     3.12.5.1. Capture all PKI transaction records that meet the definition of a Federal record.
     Also, the metadata needed for identification, searching and disposition management of
     the transaction should be captured “at or near the time” of the transaction.
     3.12.5.2. Retain PKI recordkeeping Trust Documentation Sets for at least the same
     period of time as the digitally-signed transaction to which they pertain.
     3.12.5.3. Avoid the retention of PKI transaction records on any individual user’s
     workstation because: (T-1).
         3.12.5.3.1. Integrity protection is not automatically provided and is limited to user-
         modifiable file controls (e.g., a reversible read-only setting).
         3.12.5.3.2. Accessibility is limited to the users who have access to the files on the
         workstation.
         3.12.5.3.3. Disposition management cannot be programmatically controlled.

  3.12.6. NARA Requirements for Permanent Electronically-Signed Records. Section 5.6 of
  NARA’s Records Management Guidance for Agencies Implementing Electronic Signature
  Technologies guidance states that: “For permanent records, agencies must ensure that the
  printed name of the electronic signer, as well as the date and time when the signature was
  executed, be included as part of any human readable form (such as electronic display or
  printout) of the electronic record.” NARA requires this so that the name of the signer and the
  date and time of signing will be preserved as part of the record. Therefore, all electronic
  transaction records, including PKI authenticated and secured transaction records that are to
  be transferred to NARA for permanent retention must meet these minimum requirements.
     3.12.6.1. For digitally-signed records that have been scheduled and appraised as
     permanent, NARA currently has no intention of using the digital signature’s revalidation
     capabilities to establish authenticity of the record or of maintaining that capability into
     the future. NARA currently lacks an infrastructure to support key escrow necessary to
     maintain digital signature revalidation capabilities. Furthermore, organizations could
     attest to the authenticity and integrity of the digitally-signed record at the time of transfer
     of legal custody of the materials to NARA. Finally, based on experience with secondary
     users of archival records, embedded hand-written (“wet”) signatures hold limited value
     for research. NARA presumes that this use paradigm will continue to apply. It is unlikely
     that PKI-related records establishing the trust of a particular digitally-signed transaction
     would be scheduled and appraised as permanent.

                      PROCEDURES FOR DOCUMENT REMOVAL

4.1. Process to Request Copies or Removal of Official Records. In order to protect the
interests of the Department of the Air Force, transitioning personnel (separating from service,
retirement) that desire to take copies of specific documents or official records including email
shall submit a request through the Freedom of Information Act process. For information on this
process, refer to www.FOIA.af.mil. Otherwise, personnel are not authorized to remove or make
copies of documents or official records (e.g., email, Microsoft Office documents, etc.) of the
following types:
   4.1.1. Official record copy or extract from any such document
   4.1.2. Classified information, restricted data, and formerly restricted data.
   4.1.3. Diaries that contain official schedules of meetings, appointments, field trips, or other
   official activities used to transact Government business.
   4.1.4. A copy of a document containing information exempt from public release under the
   Freedom of Information Act or stamped “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,” whether it is the
   official record copy or an extra copy (see DoD 5400.7-R/AF Sup, DoD Freedom of
   Information Act Program).
   4.1.5. Records about sensitive or Privacy Act material (reference AFI 33-332, Privacy Act
   Program).
   4.1.6. Preliminary or draft documents from other Government organizations, including
   foreign governments, material (including extra copies) whose removal would create a gap in
   the logical sequence of essential records.
   4.1.7. Records required to transact official business of the Air Force or to help in the
   decision-making process.
4.2. Documents Authorized for Removal. Personnel are authorized to remove:
   4.2.1. Personal and private unclassified papers that do not refer to official business.
   4.2.2. Reference books and other personal items.
   4.2.3. Extra copies of unclassified papers (with agency approval) that they have drafted,
   reviewed, or otherwise acted upon.
   4.2.4. Non-record materials are still Government works and must be protected from unlawful
   removal. Copies of official records shall not be made solely for the purpose of removal or
   donation. Non-record materials such as copies of training slides received at a conference,
   copies of stock publications, and any personal meeting notes may be removed by the
   transitioning personnel without the approval of the AF Records Manager. Use and follow
   nondisclosure agreements when they apply.
   4.2.5. No documentary material, though judged to be non-record material, shall be
   withdrawn if it creates a gap in the official files and impairs the completeness of essential
   documentation. Indexes or other finding aids, necessary for the use of the official files, may
   not be removed.

4.3. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements.
   4.3.1. Classify official information according to Executive Order (E.O.) 12958, Classified
   National Security Information; as amended by E.O.13292; and AFI 31-401.
   4.3.2. Personnel who remove classified material face penalties, including imprisonment in
   accordance with 18 USC 798. Any personnel who willfully and unlawfully conceal, remove,
   mutilate, obliterate, or destroy unclassified records are subject to fines or imprisonment in
   accordance with 18 USC 2071. Violation of the statutory and regulatory limitations
   governing removal of information by Air Force personnel shall be forwarded to the Air Force
   physical security office. Under 44 U.S.C. 2905 & 3106 and 36 CFR 1230.14, the Air Force
   must contact the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) with knowledge of
   any actual or potential threat to records (e.g., removal, alteration, or destruction). NARA may
   then contact the Attorney General at the Department of Justice, if necessary, to assist the AF
   in the recovery of any unlawfully removed records. (T-0).
   4.3.3. Individuals who qualify under AFI 31-401 may be granted limited access to classified
   records.
4.4. Removal Procedures for employees going to another Federal agency.
   4.4.1. Employees going to another Federal agency are not required to use the FOIA process
   in section 4.1. Prior to leaving the agency, an employee wishing to take any records to the
   new agency must present those records to the OPR (as per AFMAN 33-302 (the supplement
   to DoD 5400.7-R), Freedom of Information Act Program) and the COR for approval.
   4.4.2. DELETED.

                                            Chapter 5

                                DISPOSITION PROCEDURES

5.1. Authority and Implementation.
   5.1.1. In addition to the guidelines in this instruction, follow the dispositions in the NARA
   GRS and AFRIMS RDS.
   5.1.2. Do not make personal decisions to destroy Air Force records.
EXCEPTION:
Dispose of special intelligence records per AFMAN 14-304, (FOUO) The Security, Use and
Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Information, and AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
Records System, for records that are included in the military personnel master record.
   5.1.3. Use destruction methods and procedures in AFI 31-401 as authority for disposing of
   classified documentary records according to agency procedures.
EXCEPTION:
Destroy nonrecord classified material and other temporary material, such as extra copy files and
publications, and other materials excluded from the definition of records, as soon as their
intended purposes are served.
   5.1.4. When disposition schedules and standards change because of new requirements,
   procedures, and methods, follow these rules:
       5.1.4.1. When a changed schedule increases the retention period, apply the standard to
       all records (including inactive and cutoff records) of that description, regardless of where
       they are maintained or when they were created.
       5.1.4.2. When a changed schedule reduces the retention period, apply the standard
       retroactively. Exception: Specific instructions to the contrary for individual cases.
5.2. Retention and Retirement Standards.
   5.2.1. Records must be identified in AFRIMS RDS.
       5.2.1.1. Use Table 5.1 to cut off records identified in AFRIMS RDS.
           5.2.1.1.1. Note 1 allows a temporary extension.
           5.2.1.1.2. Exceptions as authorized in this instruction and AFRIMS RDS.
       5.2.1.2. Retire Air Force personnel records with a retention period of 10 years or more to
       the National Archives and Records Administration, 700 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,
       Washington DC 20408-0001. Exception: AFRIMS RDS specifies another FRC (such as
       the National Personnel Records Centers in St. Louis MO, for personnel and medical
       records or the Rocky Mountain Federal Archives in Denver CO, for Air Force Academy
       records).
       5.2.1.3. Tables in the AFRIMS RDS include specific standards for cutoff, setting up
       inactive files, retention periods, and specific instructions as to the organizational levels at
       which the disposition instructions apply. In most cases, however, only general disposition
       instructions exist, such as “destroy after 3 months,” “2 years,” “10 years,” “when
 28                                                             AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


       superseded,” and so forth. Regardless of the disposition standards, unless otherwise
       stated, retention periods begin after the file cutoff date, rather than the dates of individual
       records in a file.
       5.2.1.4. When a base closes, the RM must first notify SAF/XCISI through the CRM of
       records that are disposable within 8 years.
       5.2.1.5. The Air Force Record Officer will contact NARA, Office of FRC Operations to
       determine which regional record center near the closing base will retire/accept the
       temporary records.
NOTE:
This procedure also applies when a base staging area becomes too crowded for storing records.
       5.2.1.6. When AFRIMS RDS does not specify a location in column C of the table,
       assume the standard applies Air Force-wide.

NOTE:
  1. CRMs may authorize a temporary extension to disposition standards in AFRIMS RDS
  pending processing of request as indicated in paragraph 9. This also applies to other
  governments’ laws or agreements with the US, which specify longer retention periods. If a
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     31


  temporary extension is granted by the CRM, retain the records and send the following
  information immediately by letter through channels to SAF/XCISI:
  2. Description of records and prescribing directives; table and rule from the AFRIMS RDS
  covering records; length of requested extension; volume of records involved; reasons for
  extension.
  3. A statement of the current and proposed physical location of the records, including
  information on whether the records have been or will be transferred to one or more federal
  records centers. SAF/XCISI will advise the CRM of final action. If the request is
  disapproved, follow the disposition criteria in the appropriate AFRIMS RDS, table and rule.
  If approved, the CRM issues an authorization letter to the requesting activity for attachment
  to the related files plan.
  4. Transitory and reading files and other large volumes of 3-6-month retention files are cut
  off at the end of each month. When volume or other circumstances justify, and after the RM
  approves, cut off records with a retention period of 1 year or less on a daily, weekly,
  monthly, or semiannual basis, and retain for the prescribed retention period.
  5. If office space is urgently needed for current records, before the retention period within
  the office expires, see paragraph 9.2.2.
  6. Comply with paragraph 8.7 before retiring classified records to a staging area or records
  center.
  7. If there is no staging area, retain and destroy in the current files area.
  8. Retain small volumes of 2-8-year retention in the current files area until eligible for
  disposal or retirement, if the RM approves and if the office does not need additional space or
  equipment.
  9. If there is no staging area, or the accumulating office is not in close proximity to an Air
  Force installation having a staging area, transfer records with a 3- to 8-year retention to the
  Regional FRC serving the area, provided the CRM and NARA approve, and the records
  center agrees to accept the records. Under the same circumstances for 9-year to permanent
  records, retain in current files area for 2 years after cutoff, then retire (through the
  organization’s records manager) to WNRC or other designated records centers.
  10. If the office needs space for current records, transfer noncurrent records to the staging
  area earlier, if the RM responsible for the supervision of the staging area approves.
  11. The CRM may approve an extension of retention period for records needed for longer
  than 2 years after cutoff because of frequent reference. Annotate the related SF 135 with the
  new information. Send requests for extension to SAF/XCISI, who must get NARA’s
  approval for extension of retention period. Place records authorized for indefinite retention at
  the installation (such as certain civil engineering records and equipment historical files),
  which are relatively inactive and have infrequent reference in the local staging area by
  mutual agreement between the accumulating office and the RM responsible for the
  supervision of the staging area.
  12. Hold local series not retireable to WNRC or NPRC.

   5.2.2. Unscheduled records are records not identified in AFRIMS RDS. Upon receipt or
   creation of unscheduled records, procedures in paragraph 11.2 must be followed. If the
   records take up file space that is needed for active material, the CRM will facilitate the
   transfer to a staging area until final disposition is approved. Upon transfer of unscheduled
   records to a staging are, send a copy of the SF 135 to the base RM and the CRM.
5.3. Emergency Retirement. In hostile or potentially hostile areas, during war, or when war
seems imminent, get agreement between the chief of the office of record (COR), the RM, the
CRM, SAF/XCISI, and NARA to retire records with a retention period of more than 2 years to
the proper FRC at any time after cutoff if:
   5.3.1. Records may be destroyed by hostile or potentially hostile action and the records are
   valuable enough to save until the normal retention period ends. Offices retiring records make
   duplicate copies, if needed, for frequent reference to avoid harm to the unit’s mission or
   place an unrealistic research and reference burden on the FRCs.
   5.3.2. The records take space urgently needed for military purposes and personnel do not use
   them frequently enough to warrant continued local storage. If none of the conditions in
   paragraphs 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 apply, keep the records and retire them at the times specified in
   paragraph 5.2 and Table 5.1, or, in an emergency, according to paragraph 5.4.3.
   5.3.3. Do not retire material that you plan to keep for less than 2 years unless it is of
   sufficient importance in protecting the legal or financial rights of individuals and the Air
   Force. Requests to destroy these short term records must be approved by SAF/XCISI before
   destruction.
5.4. Emergency Disposal of Records, IRCN: 1095-NAR-AR. Dispose of records without
regard to AFRIMS RDS if an emergency arises, as follows:
   5.4.1. A Hazard to Health, Life, or Property. A CRM who believes that records have become
   a hazard to health, life, or property notifies Air Force Records Officer of the nature of the
   hazard, the kind and quantity of material involved, and its location. Air Force Records
   Officer notifies NARA. Upon NARA approval, Air Force Records Officer directs immediate
   destruction or removal of the material. (T-0).
   5.4.2. Nitrocellulose-Based Film. If any radarscope, aerial, or other still or motion-picture
   film on a nitrocellulose base deteriorates to the point where it is soft and sticky, is emitting a
   noxious odor, contains gas bubbles, or has turned to an acrid powder, and the OPR in charge
   decides that it is a menace to health, life, or property, the CRM may eliminate the hazard
   without prior approval of SAF/XCISI. The CRM:
       5.4.2.1. Requests the OPR remove the film from inhabited buildings as soon as possible;
       destroy it in a way to save its silver content, or if the quantity is not large enough to
       justify saving its silver content, arrange for authorized disposal in approved landfills.
       Submerge the film to be burned in water-filled drums, and move it to a remote spot that
       fire authorities have approved for burning. If possible, burn one reel at a time, but never
       more than 25 pounds. Do not burn the film in a furnace or other confined space to avoid
       dangerous gases; within 30 days of film destruction, complete and send a report to
       SAF/XCISI describing the film and stating when, where, and how the destruction took
       place. Assign Interagency Report Control Number 1095-NAR-AR to this report.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     33


   5.4.3. State of War, Threatened War, or Hostile Action Outside the United States:
       5.4.3.1. When war seems imminent, destroy records in the custody of a COR outside the
       territorial limits of the continental United States (CONUS) without regard to disposition
       standards in AFRIMS RDS and without prior approval if these situations exist; retaining
       the records would be prejudicial to the interest of the United States (US); records take up
       space urgently needed for military purposes; records are without sufficient
       administrative, legal, research or other value to warrant their continued preservation.
       5.4.3.2. If the records are considered valuable enough to warrant preservation, retire
       according to paragraph 5.3. Follow destruction procedures in AFI 31-401 when
       emergency destruction is required. When you destroy records in an emergency, provide
       the following information in writing to SAF/XCISI: organization name, location, and
       commander; record description and authentication date, record security classification (if
       known), place and date of destruction; and reason for the destruction.
5.5. Damage to or Unauthorized Disposition of Records. The Secretary of the Air Force
Office of Information Dominance and Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO A6), in accordance
with AFPD 33-3, ensures that personnel do not dispose of records without authorization. Note:
Disposing of records without authorization involves removing them from Air Force custody or
destroying or altering them without regard to the schedules in the AFRIMS RDS (44 USC §
2095, 3105, 3106, and 3314).
   5.5.1. Upon discovering unauthorized loss, damage, or destruction of records, the COR and
   record professional responsible for the records must make a reasonable effort to find, restore
   or reconstruct them.
       5.5.1.1. Restoring Records. RMs who believe they can save damaged records should
       contact the base disaster planning office, follow procedures in NARA’s Vital Records
       and Records Disaster Mitigation and Recovery: An Instructional Guide, located at
       Error! Hyperlink reference not valid., or other material in local libraries, or consult
       with a local restoration company. The CRM will immediately report the quantity and type
       of records damaged, source of damage (fire, flood, and so on), extent of damage and a
       5.5.1.2. Reconstruction. Replace record sets of publications with copies from reference
       collections or from stock. Reconstruct other records from extra copies or from other
       records containing the same information.
       5.5.1.3. Disposal. If restoration or reconstruction of damaged records is not practical and
       the Air Force Records Officer has concurred, the CRM will direct and oversee the
       immediate disposal of the damaged records. CRMs must identify them as lost or
       destroyed records on SF 135 when they retire records of the same period to a staging area
       or FRC. (T-1).
   5.5.2. Penalties. U.S. Criminal Code 18 USC § 2071 lists penalties for willfully and
   unlawfully destroying, damaging or altering records. The maximum penalty is a $2,000 fine,
   3 years in prison, or both; loss of office, and disqualification from holding any US office.
   5.5.3. Reporting. CRM must report all unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction
   of records to Air Force Records Officer. The report must include a complete description of
   the records with the volume and dates, name of the office of origin, statement of the exact
 34                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


   circumstances surrounding the violation and steps to safeguard and prevent further instances
   of record loss. (T-1).
   5.5.4. Exclusions. These rules do not cover private or personal files (see paragraph 2.2). Any
   person or activity having knowledge of impending, actual, or threatened unlawful removal,
   defacing, alteration, or destruction of records must immediately send written notification to
   the Air Force Records Officer. (T-1).
5.6. Intra-Air Force Transfer. Permit transfer of files or records from one Air Force
organization to another only when retiring them to a staging area or other repository according to
the procedures in this instruction, an organization that is changing status transfers them
according to paragraph 7.5, or a function responsibility transfers from one unit to another. (T-1).
   5.6.1. When MAJCOMs and field operating agencies (FOA) transfer responsibilities, they
   transfer the active records relating to that responsibility at the same time. The receiving
   MAJCOM or FOA ensures that the records are properly identified on the files plans. Use SF
   135 to transfer records, and send a copy to the losing and gaining CRMs. (T-1).
5.7. Transfer to the National Archives. The Archivist of the United States accepts for deposit
with the National Archives any Air Force records that the Archivist decides have sufficient
administrative, historical, or other value to keep. Normally the transfer of Air Force records to
the National Archives is from the FRCs. However, an organization may offer certain records for
direct transfer to the National Archives of the United States by sending a SF 258 to SAF/XCISI
describing the contents, nature, and quantity of the material proposed for transfer. SAF/XCISI
must sign and send the SF 258 to the National Archives. The OPR, SAF/XCISI, and the NARA
arrange the transfer and set up the conditions for using the material. NARA determines the kind
of records it will accept and whether to retire them to the FRC or transfer them directly to the
National Archives.
   5.7.1. Audiovisual Records:
       5.7.1.1. Motion Pictures. The FRCs and the NARA normally do not accept Air Force-
       owned, motion picture records on nitrocellulose-based film because of the potential
       hazards (see paragraph 5.4.2). Air Force organizations having nitrate motion pictures they
       decide are valuable enough to keep at records centers or NARA must convert the nitrate
       film to safety acetate film. Before converting the film, SAF/XCISI must obtain NARA
       approval that the converted film will be accepted. Normally, the minimum number of
       copies of motion picture film necessary for security, duplication, and use by NARA is the
       negative (original or duplicate) that (in descending order of priority): most nearly
       represents the original capture of actual events, best represents the edited production of
       actual events and best represents the edited production for which action is staged, with a
       master positive print and one projection print for actual use. Note: In most cases, the
       projection print is the negative after laboratory cutting, composite negative of sound film,
       the master fine-grain positive print, and one other print.
       5.7.1.2. Still Photographs. A negative and captioned print (whether on film, glass, paper,
       or other medium) of each still photographic image are necessary for security, duplication,
       and use by the National Archives. Include such copies when available in collections of
       still photographs that you transfer.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                    35


      5.7.1.3. Sound Recordings. Include these types of copies, when available, in collections
      of sound records that you transfer or retire to NARA:
          5.7.1.3.1. For conventional disc recordings, the matrix or stamper of each sound
          recording unit, or the original instantaneous recording if no matrix or stamper exists,
          and a pressing or dubbing of the recording.
          5.7.1.3.2. For magnetic sound recordings on wire or tape, for scribed or embossed
          recordings on tape, or for recordings photographically reproduced on sensitized film,
          a “dubbing” if one exists; otherwise, the original magnetic, embossed, for
          photographed recording.
      5.7.1.4. Reference Material. Transfer copies of existing reference material, such as data
      sheets, continuities, review sheets, scripts, or indexes for identifying and using audio-
      visual records with these materials.
   5.7.2. Cartographic Records. Offer these cartographic records, when no longer needed, to the
   National Archives for appraisal and direct transfer:
      5.7.2.1. Manuscript maps or maps on which personnel have made manuscript changes,
      additions, or annotations for record purposes or that bear manuscript signatures to
      indicate official approval. Keep these maps together with the documents to which they
      refer.
      5.7.2.2. Master sets of maps. Keep master sets separate from stocks of maps for
      distribution and from maps received from other organizations. A master set includes one
      copy of each edition or map issued.
      5.7.2.3. Index maps, card indexes, lists, catalogs, or other reference materials.
      5.7.2.4. Preliminary or intermediate materials, such as manuscript field notebooks or
      surveys, triangulation and other computations, “Fair drawings” for individual color
      plates, and aerial photographs for mapping purposes.
      5.7.2.5. Related records necessary for preparing, compiling, editing, or printing maps
      (e.g., project folders containing specifications and appraisals of source materials).
   5.7.3. Microforms. Offer permanent microforms to NARA in one silver copy and one work
   copy. Use a special microfiche box for retiring microforms.
   5.7.4. Electronic Records. Contact the Air Force Records Officer for guidance on offering
   permanent electronic records to NARA (see AFMAN 33-363).
5.8. Transfer to Other Government Agencies.
   5.8.1. According to 36 CFR Part 1228.122, do not transfer records from one Government
   agency to another without written approval by NARA. (T-0).
      5.8.1.1. Transfer these records to the Federal Archives, the FRCs, or the National
      Archives according to paragraphs 5.2 and 5.8, and set up procedures for loaning records
      for official use.
   5.8.2. Send written requests for exceptions to paragraph 5.8.1 to SAF/XCISI before
   transferring or loaning Air Force records.
 36                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


   5.8.3. Request should include a concise description of the records for transfer (with the
   volume in cubic feet), restrictions on using records, name and location of the receiving
   agency (with the names of the persons who will use the records and their intended use), name
   and location of the organization transferring the records, reason for the transfer (with
   justification for transfer of records more than 5 years old) and why the transfer is in the best
   interest of the Government. Note: Restrictions because of a law, executive order, or Air
   Force decision continue after a transfer, although the organization receiving the records may
   agree to remove the restrictions.
   5.8.4. The Air Force Records Officer receives authority from NARA for transferring Air
   Force records to another Federal agency in instances other than those cited above.
5.9. Transfer Outside of Government Agencies. The Air Force Records Officer gets approval

       5.10.1.1. DRMO decides whether to destroy or sell the records as waste paper. Contracts
       for recycling or selling these records must prohibit their future use as records or
       documents. DoD 5400.7-R/AFSUP1 and AFI 33-332 contain disposal procedures for
       records exempt from public disclosure. Recycle or sell nonpaper records (film, plastic

   prejudicial to the interests of the government, public, or private individual by any means
   approved for classified information or by any means that would make it difficult to recognize
   or reconstruct the information. Methods and equipment used to destroy classified information
   include burning, crosscut shredding, wet pulping, chemical decomposition, or pulverizing.
   Only use equipment specified on the National Security product list.
       5.10.2.1. Unclassified material is considered destroyed when disposed of in a waste
       container and/or recycled, or placed in Data Distribution System according to the Air
       Force or local procedures. Records on electronic or similar media are considered
       destroyed when you erase, degauss and reuse them.
   5.10.3. Record donation to an eligible government (including a foreign government),
   organization, institution, corporation, or individual that has made application must have prior
   approval through CRM, the Air Force Records Officer and NARA. The CRM applies to The
   Air Force Records Officer for approval with a description of the records and organization
   that owns them. The Air Force Records Officer requests the transfer through NARA; the
   following conditions must be met: (T-0).

      DISPOSITION PROCEDURES FOR RECORDS OF UNITS AND ACTIVITIES
                          CHANGING STATUS

7.1. Redesignation or Reorganization of Units and Activities.
   7.1.1. When the Air Force redesignates or reorganizes a unit or activity with a change in
   function or mission, cut off the files on the day before the redesignation or reorganization and
   ensure that the successor unit or activity maintains them as a separate entity. Destroy or retire
   files according to the program action directive and the tables and rules in AFRIMS RDS.
   7.1.2. When the Air Force redesignates or reorganizes a unit or activity with no change in
   function or mission, maintain the files and cut off in the same manner and at the same time as
   if no change of status had occurred.
EXCEPTION:
All files that are created after redesignation displaythe new designation.
       7.1.2.1. When files for a reorganized or redesignated unit or activity are retired, mark the
       SF 135 to show the organizational change.
7.2. Inactivation of Units and Activities. The term inactivation includes discontinuance,
disbandment, and reduction to zero strength.
   7.2.1. When the organization is not transferring responsibilities, destroy records as permitted
   by AFRIMS RDS, transfer records (that are disposable within 8 years) to the appropriate
   staging area until they are eligible for disposal, and retire records to WNRC that are to be
   kept for at least 9 years or that current directives do not require at another organization or
   records center.
       7.2.1.1. If the organization has no staging area or is being inactivated, send a list of
       records and volumes through records management channels to SAF/XCISI. SAF/XCISI
       queries NARA as to which FRC to send the records and notifies the CRM of the
       appropriate disposition.
   7.2.2. When an organization transfers responsibilities, it must transfer all records to the
   successor organization to preserve their administrative origin.
EXCEPTION:
When needed to support a particular transaction, event, or function.
       7.2.2.1. Use SF 135 to transfer records.
EXCEPTION:
When inappropriate (such as for personnelfolders).
7.3. Installations Placed on Inactive or Standby Status. Keep records required for the
continued maintenance of an installation placed on an inactive or standby status at the
installation. Dispose of the records according to AFRIMS RDS and the special information Base
Realignment and Closure provide on base closures.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      41


7.4. Units Alerted for Overseas Movement. Before a unit moves to or from the CONUS,
records destruction should be completed within the limits established by the AFRIMS RDS. (T-
1).
   7.4.1. If there is no staging area at the unit’s last permanent station, the unit requests a
   transfer to the FRC.
   7.4.2. If the staging area cannot receive classified material, transfer it to any organization
   that the commander considers appropriate, notify the CRM of its location, and retire records
   to the FRC NARA chooses.
7.5. Transferred Units. When the Air Force transfers a unit from one MAJCOM to another, or
from one place to another, the unit retains its current records; when a unit is transferred without
personnel and equipment, it transfers only those records that the unit’s new commander
considers essential. The unit disposes of the remaining records in one of the following ways:
retires them to an appropriate FRC, keeps them in the staging area of the former installation, or
destroys them according to AFRIMS RDS.
EXCEPTION:
When a unit leaves its former responsibility or mission to another unit, the new unit may keep
any required records, if the CRM approves. The unit keeps these records intact to preserve their
administrative origin, except when another organization needs them to support a particular
transaction, event, or function.
7.6. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) Units.
   7.6.1. Air Force Reserve Units Entering Active Duty. Cut off record sets of orders the day
   before entering active duty. Other active records the unit requires while on active duty will
   accompany the unit. Transfer remaining records with the record sets of orders to a staging
   area designated by the former CRM for retention or retirement, or destroy the records before
   the unit enters active duty according to AFRIMS RDS.
       7.6.1.1. If a unit changes back to Reserve status during the same calendar year in which
       it entered active duty, remove the record sets of orders issued before the active duty from
       the staging area and continue the same series with the normal cutoff as specified by
       Headquarters Air Force Reserve.
   7.6.2. ANG Units Entering on Active Duty. Active records that the unit requires while on
   active duty accompany the unit. Cut off remaining records and dispose of or retire them
   according to appropriate ANG regulations before the unit enters on active duty.
   7.6.3. Air Force Reserve Units Changing Back to Reserve Status. Cut off record sets of
   orders and other records that a Reserve unit created or collected during active duty on the last
   day of active duty. Transfer the records to a staging area that the former CRM chooses for
   retention or retirement or destroy according to AFRIMS RDS.
   7.6.4. ANG Units Changing Back to State Control. Cut off records created or collected by
   the ANG unit during active duty on the day before active duty ends. Transfer the records to a
   local staging area and notify the CRM. Retain, retire, or dispose of the records as instructed
   by the CRM and the unit’s State Headquarters.

8.2. Where To Obtain Boxes. Get boxes from a normal supply source.
8.3. Preparing Records Series for Packing. For this chapter, a series is a block of records
having the same disposition date and following the same rule from the tables in AFRIMS RDS.
   8.3.1. Standard-size record boxes:
   14¾ by 12 by 9¾ inches (tuck-bottom) national stock number (NSN) 8115-00-117-8249
   14¾ by 12 by 9¾ inches NSN 8115-00-117-8344
   15 by 12 by 10 inches NSN 8115-00-290-3379
   8.3.2. Special size boxes:
   Half-size boxes
   14¾ by 9¾ by 4 7/8 inches NSN 8115-00-117-8338
   Magnetic tape box
   14¾ by 11¾ by 11¾ inches NSN 8115-00-117-8347

   Microfiche box
   14¾ by 6¾ by 4¾ inches NSN 8115-01-025-3254
   Microfiche box (archival)
   14¾ by 6¾ by 5 inches NSN 8115-01-132-1932
   X-ray box
   18 by 15 by 5¾ inches NSN 8115-00-290-3386
   8.3.3. Remove all nonrecord material such as metal staples and paper clips, rubber bands,
   and extra copies of records from official records. Noncorrosive, rustproof staples are
   acceptable in instances when paper records are strong and flexible. They should not be used
   on records of high intrinsic value or on records that are weak and brittle. When staples are
   used, they should be positioned through strips of archival bond paper to help support and
   protect the documents.
   8.3.4. Group together series for an office, unit, or headquarters by item number and cutoff
   date. Separate classified from unclassified material. Exception: Do not separate classified
   and unclassified material when necessary to maintain continuity of files or when most of the
   material is classified. However, if only a few classified documents are in a case or file, use
   DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, according to AFMAN 33-363.
   8.3.5. Unclassified Records. As a rule, keep series separate when transferring.
EXCEPTION:
If a series is small in volume, combine it with another as long as the retention periods are the
same. This procedure also applies to permanent records.
       8.3.5.1. Temporary records must consist of at least one box and normally have only one
       closing-year date for a series.
       8.3.5.2. Transfer only those records covered in AFRIMS RDS.
       8.3.5.3. Do not routinely accept unscheduled, contingent, and frozen records for transfer.
       Offices transferring records must first gain approval from SAF/XCISI.
EXCEPTION:
Closing bases may receive exceptions for these types of records.
   8.3.6. Classified Records. The COR or designated person reviews all classified records
   before retiring them to a staging area or FRC to determine whether they can be downgraded
   or declassified according to AFI 31-401. The COR certifies on SF 135 that the downgrading
   or declassification review took place and puts new classification marks on the records.
8.4. Packing Unclassified Records Series.
   8.4.1. You may pack records from more than one office in the same box, labeling the first
   folder of each office with the organization and office symbol. Do not include disposition
   guides (guide cards with the disposition control label).
EXCEPTION:
Include disposition guides for inactivated units or discontinued responsibilities.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                   45


  8.4.2. Without disturbing the existing filing arrangement, pack each series according to these
  steps:
     8.4.2.1. For shipments to WNRC and other FRCs, pack each series for each named or
     numbered unit in a separate box or boxes.
     8.4.2.2. For other shipments, pack the series in the order shown in paragraph 8.3.
     8.4.2.3. Pack records in shipping containers loosely enough to permit others to remove
     files freely or to add more files later. (See Figure 8.1 for packing, closing, and sealing
     shipping containers.)

Figure 8.1. Packing Records for Transfer or Retirement.




       8.4.2.4. Place records in boxes in an upright position in the sequence listed on SF 135
       and as illustrated in Figure 8.1 with the label facing the numbered end of the box. Do not
       place folders on top of folders. If the box contains only a few legal-size files mixed with
       letter-size files, fold the bottom edge of the legal-size files to fit the width of the box.
NOTE:
The standard shipping container holds 1 cubic foot of records when filled to capacity.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      47


       8.4.2.5. Standard shipping containers filled to capacity do not need packing material. If
       the last box in a series is partially filled, use crumpled or wadded paper or other suitable
       packing material (no wood shavings, shredded paper, wax paper, additional file material,
       or surplus file folders) to prevent movement during shipment. Do not send one partially
       filled box, except for wartime records. Mark the SF 135 for wartime records with the
       contingency or conflict name (i.e., Operation ENDURING FREEDOM).
       8.4.2.6. FRCs do not accept storage containers of less than one cubic foot. Hold a series
       until a cubic foot becomes available by combining successive years of the series or until
       the anticipated date of destruction of the series according to AFRIMS RDS.
EXCEPTION:
One full microfiche-shipping container, NSN 8115-011-025-3254 or NSN 8115-01-132-1932
(archival), holds one-fourth cubic foot of microfiche. Ship boxes one at a time as they are filled.
       8.4.2.7. Get approval from the CRM to:
           8.4.2.7.1. Combine small volumes of permanent records (governed by the same table
           and rule) from two or more units within the MAJCOM or FOA to make a cubic foot
           shipment.
           8.4.2.7.2. Combine small volumes of temporary records (governed by the same table
           and rule) of two or more units within the same MAJCOM or FOA to make a cubic
           foot, if they are eligible for retirement to a FRC.
NOTE:
 Only offices that the MAJCOM or FOA records management officers designate may retire the
records in paragraph 8.4.2.7.2.
       8.4.2.8. If combining small volumes of records:
           8.4.2.8.1. Pack permanent and temporary records in separate boxes.
           8.4.2.8.2. List the retiring organization on SF 135.
           8.4.2.8.3. Use labeled dividers within the box to separate the files of the
           organizations.
           8.4.2.8.4. The collection point will keep a copy of each SF 135.
           8.4.2.8.5. Send a copy of SF 135 to each organization retiring the records, to
           MAJCOM and FOA records management officers, and other specified offices.
8.5. Packing Classified Records Series. Pack series classified TOP SECRET, SECRET, or
CONFIDENTIAL in the same way as unclassified records, but for large quantities also
remember to:
   8.5.1. Stamp standard shipping containers of each classified series with the highest
   classification in the box.
   8.5.2. Wrap the outside of the box before shipping it by registered mail to the FRC .
8.6. Sealing and Marking Boxes.
   8.6.1. Sealing. Seal boxes for a FRC, or postal shipments to any location with one-inch
   filament tape NSN 7510-00-582-4772.
 48                                                          AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


EXCEPTION:
Boxes sent as registered mail. Seal boxes personnel have placed in a staging area. Do not plan to
ship via postal channels with the gummed tape described in paragraph 8.2 or fold the top flaps
(for unclassified material) as illustrated in Figure 8.1. When sending boxes or packages as
registered mail, seal with two-inch filament tape, NSN 7510-00-159-4450, according to DoD
4525.8-M/AFMAN 33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual. Observe the size and weight limitations
and other procedures of DoD 4525.8-M/AFMAN 33-306 when sending boxes by the parcel
service.
   8.6.2. Identification.
       8.6.2.1. Place the shipper and addressee name and address on the top of each box
       according to DoD 4525.8-M/AFMAN 33-306 when shipping to an FRC or through postal
       channels to any location. Omit this information when delivering boxes directly to the
       WNRC in Washington DC.
       8.6.2.2. For shipments to other than a FRC, enter the box number and the total number of
       boxes, in consecutive numerical sequence, in the upper right-hand corner of the
       unstitched front end of each box or in the appropriate label printed on the tuck-bottom
       box NSN 8115-00-117-8249. For example, if a shipment includes three boxes, number
       them 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. Use a felt-tip pen or its equivalent to mark the boxes or use tuck-
       bottom boxes with printed label on the front of the box. Mark the accession number and
       box number with numerals at least 1¾ inch high. If packing boxes in several locations
       combine them later into a single shipment, assigning temporary numbers in pencil, but
       remove numbers before starting to number the complete shipment. Do not let boxes
       containing records of one office get mixed with those of another office.
       8.6.2.3. For shipments to WNRC or other designated FRCs, use the box-marking
       instructions sent with the approved SF 135. If the FRC does not send instructions,
       number the boxes for each shipment in consecutive order in the upper right-hand corner
       of the unstitched front end of each box or on the printed label on the new tuck-bottom
       box. Begin each accession with box number “1.” For example, if a shipment has two
       boxes, number them as 1/2, 2/2. The box numbers must be the same as the box numbers
       in item 6(e) of SF 135. Place the accession number in the center of the front end of each
       box or on the printed label on the new tuck-bottom box. Make sure the sealing tape does
       not cover the accession number. Put the accession number in the space provided when
       using boxes with pre-stenciled labels.
8.7. Methods of Shipment.
   8.7.1. Use the most economical means of shipment from outside the Washington, DC area to
   WNRC or to another FRC. Motor or rail freight shipment satisfies this requirement within
   CONUS. When rapid transportation is required, use parcel service. If using parcel service,
   follow the weight and size restrictions and other procedures in DoD 4525.8-M/AFMAN 33-
   306. Ship TOP SECRET, SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL material according to AFI 31-401
   and DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program. Do not ship TOP SECRET material
   through postal channels. Ship TOP SECRET material through the TOP SECRET Control
   Officer and an appropriately cleared courier of the Defense Courier Service, or as AFI 31-
   401 requires. Use local Transportation Management Office for large, unclassified shipments.
   For shipments of 50 boxes or more, call WNRC to schedule a shipping date and instruct the
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     49


  commercial carrier to contact WNRC 24 hours before delivery. Write this instruction on the
  bill of lading.
  8.7.2. From organizations within Washington DC area to WNRC. Note: The Washington
  DC area includes the District of Columbia, Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties in
  Maryland, and Fairfax and Arlington Counties (the Pentagon), and the Cities of Alexandria,
  Fairfax, and Falls Church in Virginia.
  8.7.3. The organization retiring the records delivers or arranges the delivery to the building’s
  loading platform for pickup on dates that WNRC has scheduled. Telephone WNRC for
  scheduled pickup dates at (301) 778-1550. (See Figure 8.2 for instructions for loading skids).
 50                                                      AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


Figure 8.2. Sample of a Loaded Skid (Contact FRC for specific instructions).




   8.7.4. If a building does not have a loading platform, arrange for pickup by telephoning
   WNRC at (301) 778-1550.
   8.7.5. Each record manager ensures offices combine shipments, when possible, on the
   loading platform on the WNRC scheduled pickup dates. When WNRC pick-up is not
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                    51


   practical, the organization retiring records will contact the appropriate Base Information
   Transfer Center for delivery to WNRC by US official mail.
   8.7.6. If a shipment is SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL, determine scheduled pickup dates
   before packing and sealing boxes, in case the facility lacks sufficient storage for the boxes
   until delivery to the loading platform. TOP SECRET record delivery to WNRC is arranged
   through the TOP SECRET Control Officer via the Defense Courier Service.
8.8. For Official Use Only (FOUO) Files. Do not separate records and files carrying the
FOUO protective marking. Pack and ship them with unclassified records.
8.9. Using Standard Form (SF) 135.
   8.9.1. Use SF 135 to identify records for retirement to a FRC or staging area or to transfer
   records to another organization. When the compiled folder list exceeds the single page of the
   SF 135, attach additional pages in the form of text documents or spreadsheets. These
   documents serve:
      8.9.1.1. As a packing list for transferred or retired records.
      8.9.1.2. As a medium for controlling the location, retrieval, reference, and disposition of
      records in staging areas and the FRC.
      8.9.1.3. As a receipt for retired records.
      8.9.1.4. To identify and account for lost, destroyed, or withheld records personnel
      normally would have retired. (See reverse side of SF 135 for preparation of SF 135 and
      Table 8.1 for copying and distributing the SF 135).
   8.9.2. Prepare a separate SF 135 for each series of temporary records in a shipment. Prepare
   a separate SF 135 for permanent records. Prepare a separate SF 135 for unclassified,
   SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, and TOP SECRET records, regardless of volume, when:
      8.9.2.1. Placing records in a staging area. Prepare a separate SF 135 for each:
          8.9.2.1.1. Office of record
          8.9.2.1.2. Staff element.
          8.9.2.1.3. Unit.
   8.9.3. Distribute copies of the SF 135 according to Table 8.1.
   8.9.4. Do not use these forms when retiring or shipping military or civilian personnel records
   or Navy - Air Force Interface official personnel folders to the National Personnel Records
   Center.
   8.9.5. Get advance approval for shipments to FRC. Send the original and one copy of the SF
   135 to the FRC at least 3 weeks before the planned shipment date or E-Mail. The FRC staff
   reviews the SF 135 and returns one copy with accession numbers after approval. Upon
   receipt of the approved SF 135, place a copy in the first box of each accession. One copy of
   the SF 135 is retained for suspense and reference. Ship the records as soon as possible.
   Shipments must arrive at the FRC within 90 days after SF 135 approval for CONUS and 120
   days for overseas. If the FRC does not receive the shipment within these time frames, the SF
   135 is returned to the originating organization and the paperwork must be resubmitted. Upon
52                                                         AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


  receipt of the shipment, the FRC returns a receipt of the SF 135 showing the box locations
  for the organization’s files. The RM keeps one copy and sends one copy to the office retiring
  the records.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                        53


                                            Chapter 9

                                RECORDS STAGING AREAS

9.1. Purpose of Records Staging Areas. Record staging areas are storage areas that receive
and maintain inactive records in less costly space and equipment than Air Force uses in current
files areas. These facilities keep and dispose of records with a retention period of less than 9
years to eliminate the expense of transporting records to the FRCs. Staging areas also combine
shipments of records of permanent and long-term (9 years or more) value before transferring
them to the FRCs.
9.2. Setting Up Staging Areas.
   9.2.1. At Air Force Installations. Record staging areas should not exceed 5,000 square feet of
   space for an installation or off-base organizations annually collecting 100 or more cubic feet
   of records with a retention period of over 2 years. An installation or off-base organization
   may operate only one staging area for tenant units or organizations on or near the base. When
   two or more off-base organizations share the same geographical location, but are not located
   near a FRC, or it is impractical or uneconomical to use the nearest staging area, the BRM and
   CRM will facilitate the set-up of a single area for all or most of the organizations to use
   jointly. (T-1).
       9.2.1.1. The CRM may waive the instructions in paragraph 9.2.1 when high rent or
       inadequate space makes a staging area impractical or uneconomical.
       9.2.1.2. In the event of a waiver by the CRM, personnel may either keep records that are
       to be retained for 8 years or less in available space and equipment or retire them to the
       regional FRC. Send the request for transferring records to a FRC to SAF/XCISI.
       SAF/XCISI will send the request to the NARA. (See Table 5.1, Note 7, and Attachment
       3.)
       9.2.1.3. In the event of a waiver by the CRM, personnel may retire records with a
       retention period of more than 8 years to the appropriate FRC (see Table 5.1, Item 15,
       Note 7).
       9.2.1.4. The CRM may waive the requirement to set up a single staging area when
       special circumstances exist (such as security precautions, unusual tenant requirements,
       off-base activities, limited storage facilities, distance, and so on). If mutually acceptable,
       other DoD organizations may use Air Force staging areas. Make a support agreement for
       tenants who wish to have staging area support. The CRM will send a copy of any waivers
       and a complete justification to the Air Force Records Officer.
   9.2.2. No record staging areas exist for organizations in the National Capital Regional area.
   If these organizations urgently need space for active records, they may transfer inactive
   records with a retention period of at least 3 years or more remaining to WNRC. Requests for
   exceptions to the 3-year retention period must be sent to the Air Force Records Officer with
   justification. (See Table 5.1, Items 12 and 14, and Note 3.)
9.3. Using Staging Areas. Store both permanent and temporary records with a retention period
over 2 years or more in staging areas until they are eligible for disposal or retirement to an FRC.
Personnel may store large volumes of records with shorter retention periods in staging areas if
 54                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


they use space and equipment economically, and if the COR and the BRM agree. Do not store
active records in staging areas. Consider records rarely used but kept indefinitely (e.g.,
installation management records and equipment historical files) as inactive and store them in
staging areas. Records with short retention periods may be kept in available space and equipment
until they are eligible for destruction.
9.4. Supervising Staging Areas. The wing or base RM supervises the installation staging area
except at Air Intelligence Agency (AIA), National Air and Space Intelligence Center, and Air
Force Technical Applications Center. Restrict the time that personnel spend in staging areas to
the minimum necessary to receive, search for, and dispose of records. Do not staff staging areas
full-time.
9.5. Staging Area Space. The staging area must be weather tight, and, if practical, fire-
resistant. The space must have adequate light, heat, ventilation, and be close to restroom
facilities. Seal holes in walls and floors against insects and rodents. If insects are found,
eliminate them using a dry-base insecticide. The facility must meet the security safeguards in
AFI 31-401 if using to store classified material. (T-0).
   9.5.1. Limit the amount of space to the minimum required for the staged records and the
   necessary office space when the staging area is the custodian’s permanent, full-time location.
   Save space by using the equipment in paragraph 8.3 and by limiting aisles between shelving
   units to 34 inches or less. The minimum files-to-space ratio acceptable in staging areas is 2
   cubic feet of files to each square foot of floor space.
NOTE:
 Seek a ratio of three or more cubic feet of files to each square foot of floor space under optimum
conditions for ceiling height, floor load capacity, and suitability of space.
   9.5.2. Use warehouse space for records staging areas when possible; when warehouse space
   is not accessible use office space. When possible, obtain a ratio of at least 2¾ cubic feet of
   files to each square foot of office floor space; if unacceptable or not feasible apply paragraph
   9.2.1.
9.6. Staging Area Equipment.
   9.6.1. Shelving. Use open steel shelving from Federal Prison Industries, Inc. If other types of
   shelves are already installed, use them until they are no longer serviceable. Ensure that each
   unit of shelving has 10 shelves, with each shelf approximately 42 by 30 inches, with 11
   inches of clearance between shelves. When ceiling height or floor load capacity does not
   permit the use of units 10 shelves high, use fewer shelves. Use Save-an-Aisle files in a
   permanent building rather than a warehouse with BRM and CRM approval.
   9.6.2. Containers:
       9.6.2.1. Boxes. Use standard records retirement boxes (see paragraph 8.3.1 for a
       description of retirement boxes).
       9.6.2.2. Classified storage. Per AFI 31-401, use GSA-approved security containers or
       approved secure storage areas for keeping classified records in properly secured staging
       areas. Do not use GSA-approved security containers for storing unclassified records.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      55


EXCEPTION:
Staging areas that receive small volumes of records (less than one cubic foot) from command
units may use file cabinets to store those files until unit personnel can combine them for
retirement to a FRC.
9.7. Storing Administrative Files. Keep only administrative files in records staging areas:
   9.7.1. Locator and Disposition File. This file consists of original SF 135 (and/or attached
   Word/Excel continuation sheets) arranged by the headquarters, installation, activity, or unit
   whose records are in the staging area. This file helps personnel locate and dispose of
   holdings.
   9.7.2. Charge-Out File. Use Optional Form (OF) 11, Reference Request-Federal Records
   Center, or AF Form 614, Charge-Out Record, or AF Form 614a, Charge Out Record
   (Continuation), to keep track of loaned, classified, and unclassified material.
9.8. Receiving Procedures.
   9.8.1. Transfer of Records. The office transferring records to a staging area prepares the SF
   135.
   9.8.2. The RM uses AFRIMS to place and retrieve staging area records.
9.9. Disposition Procedures. The RM manages the staging area and may ask for labor
assistance from organizations using the staging area.
   9.9.1. Disposing of Records. Destroy or restore eligible records in the staging area. Review
   the shipment lists in the locator and disposition file before the end of each calendar or fiscal
   year for records ready for disposition. If in good condition, reuse file folders, guide cards,
   and fasteners.
   9.9.2. Retiring Records:
       9.9.2.1. Retire records having a retention period of more than 8 years coming from units
       and organizations inactivated or moved from the installation to the appropriate FRC
       according to Chapter 8.
       9.9.2.2. Avoid numerous small shipments to keep postal and handling costs to a
       minimum when retiring records for installations or separate organizations. FRCs
       normally accept only records with 3 years or more retention remaining. WNRC does not
       store records scheduled for destruction in less than 1 year.
EXCEPTION:
Base closure.
           9.9.2.2.1. The FRC considers exceptions to the 3-year rule on an individual basis and
           only after approval has been granted through records management channels to
           SAF/XCISI. For tenant units’ records stored in a host staging area, the tenant RM
           works with the host RM to dispose of tenant’s records in staging areas. Resources
           permitting, the host RM includes all material tenants want to retire in combined
           shipments to the FRC. When insufficient resources are available, the host RM will
           request resources (personnel, boxes, etc.) from the tenants.
 56                                                           AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006


EXCEPTION:
Tenants whose parent MAJCOM has specified otherwise or who have made other arrangements
or agreements with the host RM.
           9.9.2.2.2. For large volumes or several tenants, the host RM may ask the tenant RM
           or Functional Area Records Manager (FARM) to help in disposing or preparing the
           tenant shipments. When tenants records are part of a host combined shipment to an
           FRC, separate SF 135 must be prepared for each unit and include the unit’s
           designation in item 5 of the SF 135, with the parent MAJCOM in parentheses. The
           host RM gives the tenants involved in the shipment either a copy of the FRC SF 135
           receipt (showing accession numbers, location numbers, and so on) or the accession
           and location number for the tenants to add to their copies of the SF 135 that were
           used to transfer the records to the staging area. If the unit has been inactivated, the
           host RM gives a copy of the receipted SF 135 to the parent MAJCOM of the
           inactivated unit.
NOTE:
 This information is essential to the tenant for future research or record retrieval. Recommend the
tenant give its parent organization or MAJCOM a copy of the SF 135 or the accession and
location information.
       9.9.2.3. Posting Disposition Action. Add certificates of destruction for destroyed
       classified material to the locator and disposition file.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                     57


                                          Chapter 10

                GETTING INFORMATION FROM INACTIVE RECORDS

10.1. General Information. Getting information from inactive records is the same as for active
records, regardless of their location.
10.2. Getting Records From an Air Force Organization. Write directly to the organization to
request this information.
10.3. Getting Records From a Records Center or Staging Area. These organizations may
search for and borrow retired records from:
   10.3.1. The organization that created the records.
   10.3.2. Successor organizations.
   10.3.3. A higher headquarters.
   10.3.4. Other organizations designated by the OPR or those the RM chooses. WNRC keeps a
   list of persons authorized to request, receive, and pick up classified and unclassified records
   stored at the WNRC. MAJCOM, FOA and direct reporting unit (DRU) RMs compile these
   lists annually and provide security clearance information for those individuals requesting
   classified records to SAF/XCISI for processing.
   10.3.5. WNRC requires Air Force to submit annual update/verification of individuals
   authorized to pick up and withdraw records from the center.
   10.3.6. Authorizations at base-level are restricted to the RM and one alternate. (T-1).
   10.3.7. To preclude interruption of access, submit authorizations to the supporting CRM
   before the end of the fiscal year. This access is for WNRC only and does not affect either
   personnel or medical record retrieval.
   10.3.8. Approving Loan Requests for Retired Records. The RM or the OPR approves loan
   requests for retired records only after verifying:

   service or medical record. Other requesters must have a release signed by the veteran.
   Employers and others needing proof of military service may accept as authentic the
   information shown on Armed Forces documents (such as DD Form 214, Certificate of
   Release or Discharge from Active Duty) at the time a service person left the military.

                                         Chapter 11

                        PROCEDURES TO REQUEST CHANGES

11.1. Revisions to this Instruction and/or AFRIMS RDS.
   11.1.1. Amend or reaccomplish file plans and file disposition control labels to reflect new
   disposition standards or add additional record series. Review inactive files to ensure
   dispositions are updated according to new or revised standards. Amend the SF 135 for
   staging area records to reflect changes.
       11.1.1.1. The CRM provides instruction to the OPR on submitting record disposition
       recommendations (AF Form 525).
       11.1.1.2. The CRM submits changes or negative replies based upon review of functional
       series records dispositions through the functional RM to SAF/XCIS. When processes
       change, are deleted, or new ones implemented, submit record scheduling information as
       previously stated.
11.2. Suggesting Changes, Additions, or Deletions to This Instruction and AFRIMS
RDS. Send suggestions on AF Form 847 to make comments and suggested improvements in this
instruction and AF Form 525 to request changes to tables or rules in AFRIMS RDS through the
RM and CRM to Cyberspace Capabilities and Compliance (SAF/CIO A6X), 1800 Air Force
Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1800.
   11.2.1. Using AF Form 525. Use AF Form 525 to recommend or request changes, additions,
   or deletions to AFRIMS RDS. Prepare four copies; keep one in suspense. Coordinate the AF
   Form 525 with appropriate personnel at each level before sending it to the next higher level.
       11.2.1.1. The CRM coordinates with other MAJCOM or FOA RMs who have a prime or
       joint interest in the records before sending the suggestion to the Air Force Records
       Officer. The CRM coordinates with the command history office on changes relating to
       historical records and permanent records. The CRM coordinates with the judge
       advocate’s office on suggestions relating to the legal rights of individuals or the Air
       Force. Show the coordination of the judge advocate on the AF Form 525. The CRM
       indicates in item 17 if the records are Privacy Act records. Send two copies of approved
       recommendations to the Air Force Records Officer. For further information concerning
       CRMs (to include name, phone numbers, E-mail, mailing address, etc.), reference
       AFRIMS RDS.
11.3. Justification of Changes.
   11.3.1. When a proposed new or revised record or a directive requires records not covered in
   AFRIMS RDS, the OPR sends AF Form 525 to the records management office. The affected
   records will be considered pending. The OPR may delay the draft of the directive while
   submitting AF Form 525, to include a qualifying statement such as: “Proposed disposition is
   tentative while needs of the users are determined.” In such instances, the RM or CRM holds
   AF Form 525 for at least 6 months and then asks the OPR to confirm the proposed
   disposition.
AFI33-364 22 DECEMBER 2006                                                                      61


   11.3.2. Completely justify all recommendations to keep records permanently or to increase
   an existing retention period. Justify the permanent retention of records in terms of their value
   for historical administration or for research, organizational changes, or protecting the legal
   rights of persons and the Government. In many instances, this type of justification requires a
   painstaking and searching analysis and evaluation and strong cooperation between records
   management personnel and subject matter specialists, legal advisors, and historians. Try to
   determine how many Air Force records are really essential; whether they effectively
   document Air Force activities and transactions; whether the Air Force can reduce retention
   periods; and how many so-called “permanent” records are of real enduring value. Since
   “enduring value” means keeping the records indefinitely (eventually offered for deposit to
   the National Archives of the United States), analysts accept that “permanent is forever.” No
   routine techniques can simplify the evaluation of permanent records. No substitute exists for
   a thorough and careful analysis by competent individuals.
   11.3.3. Completely justify records that protect the legal and financial rights of personnel and
   the Air Force. Coordinate the items on legal rights with the judge advocate’s office. Send its
   comments with the AF Form 525. NARA and SAF/XCISI use these comments to make an
   informed decision on the retention value of the records.
   11.3.4. Dispose of electronic media that generates paper or microform records (see AFMAN
   37-123 [will become AFMAN 33-363]).
11.4. Dispositions Pending. The Air Force Records Officer will notify all MAJCOM RMs
when an AF Form 525 has been submitted, informing them that the disposition is pending until
further notice, and AFRIMS will be annotated with disposition pending.
11.5. Information Collection, Records, and Forms.
   11.5.1. Information Collections. IRCN 0285-NAR-AR, Damage to and Unauthorized
   Disposition of Records, is mandated by this publication. See paragraph 5.5.3 Note.
   11.5.2. Records. Records pertaining to IRCN 0285-NAR-AR are created by this publication
   (paragraph 5.5.3 Note). Retain and dispose of all records according to the AFRIMS RDS.
   11.5.3. Forms (Adopted and Prescribed).
       11.5.3.1. Adopted Forms. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active
       Duty; DD Form 877, Request for Medical/Dental Records or Information; DD Form

There may be a thin line separating Federal and State records. For example, during a hurricane or
flood an ANG unit may be activated to assist with a state emergency. Should FEMA get
involved or Federal dollars be expended toward the emergency, the records created by the ANG
become Federal records. State records are the property of the state and Federal records are the
property of the agency (i.e., Air Force). When there is an issue of records being State or Federal,
the ANG Unit Base Records Manager will contact the ANG CRM for guidance. If necessary the
ANG CRM will coordinate with the Air Force Records Officer (and any applicable MAJCOM
CRM.
Vital Records—Records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of an
organization during and after an emergency and also those records essential to protecting the

rights and interests of that organization and of the individuals directly affected by its activities.
Sometimes called essential records. Include both emergency-operating and rights-and-interests
records. Vital records considerations are part of an agency’s records disaster prevention and
recovery program.
Working Files— (1) Documents such as rough notes, calculations, or drafts assembled or
created and used in the preparation and analysis of other documents. (2) In electronic records,
temporary files in auxiliary storage. An accumulation of working files may also include
nonrecord material and technical reference files. Federal regulation requires working files and
similar materials to be maintained as records, for purposes of adequate and proper
documentation, if:
 (a) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, for official
purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation , follow-up, or to communicate
with agency staff about agency business; and
(b) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments that adds to a
proper understanding of the agency’s formulation and execution of basic policies, decisions,
actions, or responsibilities. (see Record Copy)
