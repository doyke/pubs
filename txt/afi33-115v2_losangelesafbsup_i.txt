1. Introduction. The Air Force network is a critical combat capability platform.
Communications and information resources are force multipliers, and Air Force information
systems and networks have evolved to effectively implement the Expeditionary Aerospace Force
vision. To achieve the light, lean, and lethal forces our national military strategy depends on, the
DoD and United States Air Force (USAF) must ensure fully qualified personnel operate and
maintain these systems and networks.
   1.1. This instruction defines the policy and procedures for training and licensing all users
   and Air Force network professionals who access the Air Force network (af.mil) domain.
   Compliance with this AFI meets the DoD initiative to train and certify all computer users and
   to certify those network professionals who actively manage, configure, and control the
   network to a consistent, verifiable skill level ensuring the DoD information assurance (IA)
   posture is uncompromised.
2. Background. The Air Force has initiated an aggressive drive to operationalize and
professionalize its networks. In a continuing effort towards that aim, DoD 8570.01-M
implements DoDD 8570.1, Information Assurance Workforce Training, Certification and
Workforce Management. The program requirements apply to all members of the DoD
Information Assurance (IA) workforce including military, civilians, foreign nationals, local
nationals, and contractors. The Air Force Implementation Plan for DoD 8570.01-M provides
specific guidelines for the official training and certification of personnel performing as IA
privileged users or management functions. For specific program information and eligibility
requirements, units should consult their IA Manager. Certification and licensing is also included
in the Inspector General agenda. This instruction builds on the guidance provided in AFI 33-115,
Volume 1, Network Operations (NETOPS). Standard licensing criteria ensures all personnel who
access the Air Force network are knowledgeable of their roles and responsibilities for protecting
information.
3. Network License and Certification. This guidance and policy applies to: All military,
civilian, and contractor employees using or providing professional network services in the Air
Force network (af.mil or af.smil) domain on any Air Force system, network, or Air Force-
operated joint system as a part of their official duties. See AFI 33-202, Computer Security (will

become Networking and Computer Security), for guidance on granting local/foreign nationals
access to the network and/or information systems.
4. Roles and Responsibilities.
     4.1. Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information
     Officer, Directorate of Policy and Resources (SAF/XCP) will:
        4.1.1. Establish policy and guidance for the Network Professional Training Program,

      4.5.4. DELETED.
   4.6. Communications Unit (or equivalent). Administer common core network training to Air
   Force military and civilian network professionals assigned to their installations, whether host
   or tenant.
5. Network User Licensing Program.
   5.1. Introduction. Every individual who has access to the af.mil or af.smil domain,
   specialized systems, and mission systems is a network user. Before becoming an Air Force
   network user an individual must have a favorable background investigation (paragraph 5.3),
   be trained, and licensed. Client Support Administrators (CSA) assists network users in
   getting the necessary training to meet all licensing requirements. Upon verification of
   favorable background check and successful completion of appropriate training, the user is
   licensed to use the network and granted access to required network resources. This process of
   training and licensing ensures every Air Force network user is trained and aware of the basic
   principles of network security and their role in IA.
   5.2. Contractors as Network Users. Communications and information systems officer must
   ensure that all contract personnel requiring access to the Air Force network meet the
   requirements of paragraph 5 and subordinate paragraphs.
   5.3. Favorable Background Investigation. All individuals accessing the Air Force Enterprise
   Network (AFEN) must meet the investigative requirements of AFI 31-501, Personnel
6                                     AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012


    Security Management Program. The unit security manager verifies proper security clearance
    and background investigation checks (National Agency Check, Single Scope Background
    Investigation, etc.) are validated prior to the CSA granting a network user license. See AFI
    31-501 for guidance on interim approval access.
       5.3.1. Loss of Security Clearance. In cases where an individual loses their security
       clearance the Designated Approval Authority (DAA) must make a determination as to
       whether or not to also suspend the individual’s network license. The determination
       should be based on the reasons for the loss of clearance and whether or not the individual
       poses a threat to the network.
    5.4. Procedures. In accordance with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM)
    6510.01, Defense in Depth: Information Assurance (IA) and Computer Network Defense
    (CND), all DoD military, civilian, and contractors will receive documented IA training prior
    to receiving access to the network. Training required to obtain a network user license is
    standardized in the ―Air Force Information Assurance Awareness Training” Computer-
    Based Training (CBT) course. Access the CBT on the current IA training site via the Air
    Force Portal. Successful completion of this course satisfies the Air Force training
    requirement for a network user license. Additional user training may be developed locally to
    reflect local needs and concerns. CSAs administer all required training to their network users,
    track users completion of training, and document training in accordance with AFI 36-2201,
    Volume 3, Air Force Training Program On-the-Job Training Program. CSAs make training
    available to new or suspended users on an as-needed basis. When a user completes user
    licensing training and has a favorable background investigation, the CSA ensures their
    network access is granted.
       5.4.1. Administering IA training. The IA training required to access the AFEN is
       standardized and available on the current IA training site via the Air Force Portal.
       Perform training through the CBT in order to meet the tracking and reporting
       requirements put forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of
       2002. Since the individual will not have network access for initial IA training, the CSA or
       supervisor can either log onto the network for the individual to allow them access to the
       current IA training website or create strictly training user accounts configured with a
       profile that only has access to the current IA training website to allow the individual to
       complete the CBT. The individual must be monitored the entire time regardless of the
       method used. DAAs will establish local policy to standardize the procedures for
       conducting initial IA training, verifying security clearance, and documenting the process.
    5.5. Permanent Change of Station and/or Temporary Duty. The gaining CSA must confirm
    with the Unit Security Manager that the proper background investigation was conducted
    (paragraph 5.3), and verify IA training. Users do not need to retake the network training
    course(s) as long as course completion is verified. Verification can be via user-provided
    course completion certificate, validation of completion from the current IA training website,
    or verification from the member’s home/losing base. In emergency or deployment situations,
    the CSA may rely on a training record review to license a user.
    5.6. License Suspension. If a user engages in conduct inconsistent with the licensing
    principles, the CSA may, with the approval of the user’s commander, suspend their user
    license. The DAA or designated DAA representative may suspend a user’s license when
AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012                                                      7


  deemed necessary in the interest of information operations. Actions inconsistent with
  licensing principles include, but are not limited to: failure to maintain an acceptable level of
  proficiency on a critical program; actions that threaten the security of a network or a
  governmental communications system; actions that may result in damage or harm to a
  network or governmental communications system; or actions that constitute unauthorized use
  under the provisions of AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging, or AFI 33-129, Web Management
  and Internet Use.
     5.6.1. Procedural Requirements: On discovery of an action inconsistent with the terms of
     the user license, the CSA recommends to the user’s commander that the user’s access to a
     network be suspended. With the commander’s concurrence, the user’s network access
     will be removed. Once confirmed, the CSA will notify the user, in writing, of the access
     suspension, including the specific reason for the suspension and the steps the user must
     take to have access reinstated.
         5.6.1.1. The user may accept the suspension or dispute the grounds for the
         suspension by providing a written request within three duty days. User access may be
         restored after completing remedial training; normally within two duty days.
         5.6.1.2. If the user disputes the suspension, the CSA has two duty days following
         receipt of the user’s request to reconsider suspension. The CSA, after consultation
         with the user’s commander, either notifies the user in writing that the pending
         suspension was inappropriate or refers the matter to the DAA for final action by
         sending a copy of the case file. The DAA considers the case file to determine if the
         suspension is appropriate. The DAA may determine the user’s license should be
         retained; suspend the user’s license and mandate remedial training; or take other
         necessary actions. After receiving the documentation, the DAA notifies the user in
         writing, within six duty days, of the final determination.
     5.6.2. Security Infractions. Report any action that threatens the security of, or
     damages/harms network or government communications systems to the NCC officer in
     charge (OIC). The NCC OIC takes appropriate actions in accordance with AFI 33-138,
     Enterprise Network Operations Notification and Tracking. This may include suspending
     the user’s network access, notifying authorities such as security forces or the Air Force
     Office of Special Investigations, and/or other actions consistent with local IA policies and
     procedures.
     5.6.2. (LOSANGELESAFB) All network users who provide their password, pin, or
     other personal information will immediately have their network account disabled by the
     NCC at the direction of the Base Information Assurance Office (BIAO). Unit
     Information Assurance Officers (IAOs) will ensure that users re-take the Information
     Assurance Computer Based Training (IA CBT) to ensure they understand Information
     Assurance policies and procedures. IAOs will request temporary reinstatement of user’s
     network access to complete the IA CBT and submit the IA CBT completion certificate to
     the SMC Help Desk. SMC Help Desk will update IA CBT completion in Active
     Directory and re-enable the account.
  5.7. Reinstatement. Ordinarily, a suspended user is required to participate in remedial
  training. Upon satisfactorily completing retraining, the CSA reinstates the user’s license.
  However, there may be situations that indicate to the CSA and the user’s commander that,
 8                                     AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012


     even with remedial training, the user would pose a threat to the security of the system or
     operations. Under such circumstances, the DAA, following full review of the case file and all
     associated documents, may suspend a user’s privileges indefinitely.
6. Network Professional Training Program.
     6.1. Introduction. The objective of this program is to ensure all network professionals, to
     include all appointed CSAs, are trained to standardized criteria. The task qualification
     process outlines knowledge-level training and performance training (as outlined within AFI
     36-2201, Volume 3) requirements that network professionals must complete to be duty
     position qualified. Career field managers develop and field AF JQS that outline training
     requirements. These AF JQSs can be found on the Q-Flight web site located at:
     https://wwwmil.keesler.af.mil/81trss/qflight/WebPages/master.cfm.
     6.2. Non-military Network Professionals.
        6.2.1. Contractors as Network Professionals. Contractors who provide professional
        network services (all crew positions) to the Air Force are bound by the requirements
        stated in contractual agreements. Contractor personnel assigned to perform specific
        Network Operations (NETOPS) tasks are subject to evaluation. All future contracts
        (including modifications to existing multiyear contracts) for NETOPS tasks, subsequent
        to this instruction, must cite this instruction and state contractor personnel are subject to
        evaluation. When results show more training is required, the contract Quality Assurance
        Evaluator will discuss requirements with the appropriate contracting officer and prepare a
        proper course of action. Contractor personnel are to be trained in all aspects of the
        performance for the contract prior to contract award. Measure contractors on their
        knowledge, skills, and abilities by performance metrics associated with the network
        services and support to the major command (MAJCOM)/wing/base customers.
        6.2.2. Civil Service as Network Professionals. Civil service personnel assigned to
        perform specific NETOPS tasks are subject to evaluation. When results show more
        training is required, supervisors take action to increase the individual’s proficiency. Don’t
        use evaluation to disqualify civilian personnel who are hired for specific jobs under civil
        service procedures. Disqualification of civilian personnel is according to applicable
        directives.
     6.3. Process. Supervisors use applicable AF JQS (XXXXX-200XX crew position or 3A0X1-
     225D CSA), as the baseline to train network professionals. All network professionals must
     complete the network user licensing program (paragraph 5) before beginning the appropriate
     training curriculum.

        6.3.1. Procedures.
            6.3.1.1. Supervisors maintain training records on all individuals serving as network
            professionals, regardless of rank. Supervisors monitor progress of the individual using
            the applicable AFJQS and AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
            Continuation/Command JQS. Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) is the
            primary means of collecting and maintaining information pertaining to on-the-job
            training (OJT) training and is mandatory for use by all communication and

            Training Business Area (TBA) according to their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
            implementation plan.
            6.3.1.2. DoD civilians follow local civilian personnel flight (CPF) procedures, such
            as completing a Department of Defense (DD) Form 1556, Request, Authorization
            Agreement, Certification of Training, and Reimbursement, prior to starting
            position certification training. The final position certificate will be submitted by CPF
            to Air Force Personnel Center for inclusion in the civilian’s personnel record and a
            copy for the supervisor’s record (AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief).

     authority coordinates with the 3A0X1 Base/Wing/MAJCOM Functional Manager prior to
     appointment of these positions.
     7.4.2. Individuals selected are to be highly qualified personnel having extensive
     knowledge, skill, and abilities regarding NCC overall operations and equipment and well
     suited for evaluation, analysis, and support duties. Do not assign personnel with a
     Primary Air Force Specialty Code at the three-skill level.
     7.4.3. Personnel assigned to QA or appointed as work center QARs are trained by
     experienced QA personnel on management procedures, evaluation methods, and how to
     find probable causes for identified problems.

     7.7.4. Evaluations.
        7.7.4.1. Personnel Evaluations.
            7.7.4.1.1. Personnel evaluations assess the effectiveness of a work center’s
            training program, technician competence, and technical and procedural data
            adequacy. These areas are assessed to ensure equipment or systems are
            maintained in an effective and efficient manner to meet mission requirements.
            7.7.4.1.2. Performance.
                7.7.4.1.2.1. Technician performance is the measurement standard for training
                programs.
                7.7.4.1.2.2. Technicians must perform in a professional manner, but
                evaluation results may reflect deficiencies that can be rectified through
                additional training or training program improvements.
            7.7.4.1.3. Assessment.
                7.7.4.1.3.1. Evaluations assess a technician’s:
                 7.7.4.1.3.1.1. Knowledge - how much does the technician know about the
                 job. Evaluators will assess the technician’s knowledge by asking questions,
                 written tests, or using interactive training devices.
                 7.7.4.1.3.1.2. Job proficiency - how well does the technician perform the
                 job. (The criteria for evaluating and analyzing this element is identified in
                 the work center’s training plan and the system or equipment technical data
                 used to perform the job.) Evaluators observe how well tasks are performed
                 to determine if sufficient skill is demonstrated, including prioritization of
                 actions, to presume competency.
            7.7.4.1.4. Personnel. All personnel who are task qualified are subject to personnel
            evaluations regardless of AFSC. This includes personnel certified through cross-
            utilization training.

     7.7.4.1.5. In overseas units, the authorized command authority may exempt local
     national technicians from personnel evaluation (coordinate with local civilian
     personnel offices).
     7.7.4.1.6. Trainees must demonstrate the knowledge and ability to do assigned
     functions safely and effectively.
     7.7.4.1.7. Types of Personnel Evaluations. There are three types of personnel
     evaluations: primary, follow-up, and special.

             7.7.4.1.9. Conducting Evaluations.
                  7.7.4.1.9.1. Evaluators are the key to the evaluation program and are not to be
                  the same individual who certified task proficiency of the person being
                  evaluated. Ideally, the evaluator is certified on the tasks being evaluated and
                  possesses the same AFSC at a higher skill level than the individual being
                  evaluated. When this is not practical and use of a QAR is not possible, the
                  evaluator must be capable of observing and verifying task accomplishment
                  with a TO, manual, or other reference. The evaluator must be capable of
                  verifying proper procedures, tools, test measurement and diagnostic
                  equipment, and materials are used and the task performance conforms to
                  established standards.
                  7.7.4.1.9.2. Before conducting evaluations, evaluators must analyze and
                  select a minimum of 5 – 10 tasks (include any locally developed task
                  requirements) to be evaluated based on deficiency indicators, training
                  management visits, system performance data, previous evaluations done in the
                  work center, and other management indicators. If analysis does not indicate
                  any areas requiring emphasis, evaluators should select tasks not previously
16                         AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012


        evaluated in the work center. Select tasks that provide for an adequate
        assessment of the trainees ability to perform in the evaluated crew position.
        Individuals may be evaluated on any certified task in their training record.
        7.7.4.1.9.3. Coordinate evaluations with the work center supervisor. Consider
        targets of opportunity, such as exercises or managerial inspections, to perform
        personnel evaluations.
        7.7.4.1.9.4. Consider selecting alternate tasks to avoid the need to reschedule
        an evaluation when operational requirements do not permit completion of
        planned evaluations.
        7.7.4.1.9.5. Immediately preceding the evaluation, brief the technician on the
        tasks to be evaluated, the rating criteria, and the performance standards set
        forth in Attachment 2. Evaluators will focus on the evaluation process during
        the briefing, not the specific steps individuals must accomplish to pass.
        7.7.4.1.9.6. Evaluate three separate and distinct phases - preparation, task
        performance, and post performance (see Attachment 2).
        7.7.4.1.9.7. Stop the evaluation if technicians use methods or procedures that
        could jeopardize safety, cause equipment damage, or adversely affect
        NETOPS. Task evaluations may be continued after the hazard has been
        corrected.
        7.7.4.1.9.8. During the evaluation, ask relevant questions on the methods and
        procedures used by the technician, if applicable.
        7.7.4.1.9.9. Evaluations are complete when the evaluator determines that the
        technician’s performance has been sufficiently evaluated.
        7.7.4.1.9.10. Brief the individual and the work center supervisor at the
        conclusion of the evaluation.
     7.7.4.1.10. Evaluation Results.
        7.7.4.1.10.1. A technician’s performance is assessed using Attachment 2.
        Explanations and recommendations are required for each task rated as
        unsatisfactory.
        7.7.4.1.10.2. The work center supervisor, certifying official, and trainer must
        be briefed on noted problem areas as soon as practical following
        unsatisfactory task performance. Unsatisfactory task performance requires
        decertification and recertification on the particular task; it does not mean the
        individual is incapable of performing other tasks. Work center supervisors
        must understand decertification and recertification documentation procedures
        identified in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3. Do not schedule the individual for a re-
        examination for a minimum of 24 hours to allow time for additional study.

              7.7.4.1.10.5.1. Restrictions will address the specific tasks that require
              supervision until successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not
              punitive, but designed to enhance NETOPS and safety.
              7.7.4.1.10.5.2. Specific restrictions will be documented in the AF Form 803
              ―Remarks‖ section.
             7.7.4.1.10.6. Failure of a re-evaluation will be viewed as a serious lack of
             proficiency. Enter the comments in the ―Remarks‖ section of the AF Form
             803. The authorized command authority will consider the examiner’s
             comments, and within 14 calendar days review the individual’s overall duty
             performance and determine if it warrants movement of the individual to
             another duty position.
             7.7.4.1.10.7. If a decision is made to conduct a second re-evaluation, it is a
             complete evaluation, consisting of both the positional evaluation and the
             written examinations, if used.
             7.7.4.1.10.8. Document all personnel qualification evaluations on AF Form
             803, Report of Task Evaluations, or automated equivalent, in accordance with
             paragraph 7.7.4.3 and AFI 36-2201, Volume 3. File the AF Form 803 with the
             evaluation report in QA.

             7.7.4.1.10.10. DELETED.
             7.7.4.1.10.11. Personnel evaluation results are not recorded on, or made a part
             of, documents such as performance reports, or unfavorable information files.
          7.7.4.1.11. Permanent Change of Station (PCS)/Permanent               Change    of
          Assignment (PCA) and Temporary Duty (TDY).
             7.7.4.1.11.1. Upon PCS/PCA, individuals meeting the requirements specified
             in the gaining unit training directives may retain current qualifications.
             However, before performing operations duties unsupervised at a new unit,
             they must:
              7.7.4.1.11.1.1. Satisfactorily complete training requirements directed by the
              gaining unit.
              7.7.4.1.11.1.2. Have their existing duty position qualification validated by
              the local QA section on a newly prepared AF Form 803 within 60 days of
              arrival.
             7.7.4.1.11.2. The QA function may administer a complete or partial
             performance evaluation, but it is not required if the individual is transferring
             between units possessing like systems. If a performance evaluation is not
             administered, the data from the last performance evaluation is transferred onto
             the AF Form 803. Indicate that this is a validation of the individual’s
             qualification.

     7.7.4.2. Managerial Evaluations.
        7.7.4.2.1. Managerial evaluations provide Commanders and supervisors with
        factual, objective assessments of a section’s ability to meet its mission
        requirements. To do this, it is necessary to collectively evaluate management
        effectiveness and the performance and technical proficiency of assigned
        personnel.
        7.7.4.2.2. Managerial Evaluation Requirements.
            7.7.4.2.2.1. DELETED.
            7.7.4.2.2.2. QA personnel conduct managerial evaluations on each work
            center at least every 24 months (every 36 months for Air National Guard
            [ANG] units). Managerial Evaluations are not conducted on programs
            assessed by a unit self-inspection program under AFI 90-201, Inspector
            General Activities.
        7.7.4.2.3. How to perform managerial evaluations.
            7.7.4.2.3.1. Before beginning managerial evaluations, review:
              7.7.4.2.3.1.1. Reports of previous managerial and personnel evaluations.
              7.7.4.2.3.1.2. Other evaluation reports such as administrative files
              inspections, Inspector General inspections, operational evaluations, and
              local evaluations.
              7.7.4.2.3.1.3. Staff Assistance visit reports, trend analysis data, IMDS/TBA
              products, and any other relevant management indicators.
            7.7.4.2.3.2. Make impartial, factual, pertinent, and complete observations to
            identify deficiencies. Identify commendable practices and programs,
            especially those that may be useful to other work centers.
            7.7.4.2.3.3. Demonstrate proper procedures and provide assistance to help
            work center and staff personnel meet mission requirements.
            7.7.4.2.3.4. Ensure affected supervisors fully understand findings before
            writing formal evaluation reports.
            7.7.4.2.3.5. Contact the work center’s customers to determine if the work
            center is supporting their mission requirements.
            7.7.4.2.3.6. Evaluate subject areas in enough depth to ensure the results
            indicate the actual condition of the activity. Not all areas require 100 percent
            evaluation for the evaluator to make this determination. Make use of sampling
            where appropriate.
            7.7.4.2.3.7. Determine how well work centers and support functions meet
            management requirements and if established procedures are followed. The
            minimum evaluation items include:
              7.7.4.2.3.7.1. Inventory, Accountability, Transfer, and Reporting of
AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012                                                 19


               Computer Systems.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.2. Network Administration.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.3. Network Management.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.4. Information Protection Operations Management.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.5. Help Desk/Event Management.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.6. Compliance with the intent of this instruction, associated and
               local directives, safety and security rules and procedures.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.7. Perform personnel evaluations during the evaluation. Check
               adequacy of training plans and training materials. Check training
               documentation, progression, and task coverage. (NOTE: It is important at
               short tour locations that sufficient personnel evaluations are performed to
               ensure the adequacy of training programs.)
               7.7.4.2.3.7.8. Compliance with work order documentation.
               7.7.4.2.3.7.9. Technical data to include maintenance of TO files, and
               availability and use of required technical, commercial data, Air Force
               Network Operating Instructions (AFNOIS), and local procedures.
       7.7.4.3. Evaluation Reports Overview.
          7.7.4.3.1. Preparation:
              7.7.4.3.1.1. Provide complete, accurate, and impartial reports with sound
              recommendations designed to help correct discrepancies and eliminate
              underlying causes.
              7.7.4.3.1.2. Include specific references so that work center or office personnel
              understand and know where to find procedures to correct deficiencies.
               7.7.4.3.1.2.1. Reference deficiencies that result from procedural omissions
               or repeated errors. Failure to perform checks to ensure publications are
               current or determine out of tolerance system or equipment measurements
               exist are examples of procedural deficiencies.
               7.7.4.3.1.2.2. References are not required when a deficiency or isolated
               minor error is easily understood and corrective action is obvious. General
               housekeeping practices, equipment cleanliness, and standard supervisory
               responsibilities and safety practices are examples of areas that may not
               require references. Evaluators must take care not to assume all such
               practices and responsibilities are commonly recognized and understood.
               7.7.4.3.1.2.3. Deficiencies caused by inefficient or ineffective management
               practices may require the use of rationale since a specific reference may not
               be published. The authorized command authority resolves differences of
               opinion over the validity of the type of discrepancy that the QA Supervisor
               and work center cannot resolve before reports are finalized.
               7.7.4.3.1.2.4. Identify all checklists, Air Force Technical Orders, AFNOIs,
20                         AFI33-115V2_LOSANGELESAFBSUP_I 5 JULY 2012


          or local procedures used during all evaluations.
        7.7.4.3.1.3. Include recommendations for corrective actions with each
        deficiency, except where the corrective action is obvious. The goal is to
        provide ideas and guidance to assist the work center in correcting the
        deficiency.
        7.7.4.3.1.4. Document favorable comments, as well as deficiencies on
        evaluation reports.
        7.7.4.3.1.5. Note that proper report routing and follow-up are important.
        Evaluations are of no value unless the discrepancies are recognized and
        corrected by appropriate managers.
        7.7.4.3.1.6. The authorized command authority is the closing authority for
        evaluations. The authorized command authority may indicate closure by
        concurrence or non-concurrence with QA personnel recommendations. The
        authorized command authority may delegate closing authority for evaluation
        reports that identify only minor or no deficiencies.
        7.7.4.3.1.7. Note that evaluation reports need not include minor
        administrative or management deficiencies if, in the evaluator’s judgment, the
        deficiency is an isolated incident and does not indicate an overall management
        deficiency. If not included in the formal report, provide information about
        minor errors in a memo to the work center. Memorandums do not require an
        answer.
     7.7.4.3.2. Personnel Evaluation Reports.
        7.7.4.3.2.1. Document personnel evaluations on AF Form 803. Comments
        and recommendations are made on the evaluation report to eliminate the need
        for separate correspondence. The reports also provide a source for analyzing
        the effectiveness of the overall training program.
        7.7.4.3.2.2. Identify task errors, provide recommendations, and explain
        rescheduling actions.
        7.7.4.3.2.3. Explain management, system, or equipment discrepancies not
        directly reflecting on the technician’s performance in a separate report.
        7.7.4.3.2.4. Authorized command authority must review evaluation reports
        that document unsatisfactory task results.
     7.7.4.3.3. Managerial Evaluation Reports.
        7.7.4.3.3.1. Using AF Form 2420 to document managerial evaluations is
        optional. Managerial evaluation results may be prepared in a narrative style on
        bond paper and filed in the QA function.
        7.7.4.3.3.2. Reports address:
          7.7.4.3.3.2.1. Minimum coverage areas and list deficiencies found in the
          areas of management, system equipment, and task performance. Show
          correlation between deficiencies, if applicable.

                               PERSONNEL EVALUATIONS

A2.1. Performing Evaluations.
   A2.1.1. Personnel evaluations are performed to determine an operator’s or technician’s
   technical proficiency and competence, and to gauge work center training program
   effectiveness. Evaluators must make careful observations of actions taken to accomplish each
   task being evaluated by judging three separate and distinct phases; preparation, task, and post
   performance.
   A2.1.2. Errors made in any of these phases must be considered when determining results.
   The decision to declare a performance error must be based on published standards, practices,
   and Technical Order procedures.
A2.2. Preparation Errors.
   A2.2.1. Preparation errors normally indicate inadequate training on standard job preparation
   procedures or maintenance management requirements.
   A2.2.2. Task preparation mistakes cause delays; mistakes corrected before the task begins
   are considered preparation errors and if not corrected, may have a bearing on task
   performance. A preparation error example is applicable technical data not on hand.
   A2.2.3. Examples of management type preparation errors:
      A2.2.3.1. Crew Commander not notified of changes in equipment status as a result of
      task performance.
      A2.2.3.2. A Job Control Number or help desk tracking number was not obtained for
      required documentation.
      A2.2.3.3. There was no method available to document discrepancies discovered during
      the task performance.
A2.3. Task Performance Errors.
   A2.3.1. Task performance errors normally indicate inadequate task training.
   A2.3.2. Examples of task performance errors are:
      A2.3.2.1. Applicable technical data or directives not used.
      A2.3.2.2. Warnings, cautions, and notes not complied with.
      A2.3.2.3. Not all required steps performed.
      A2.3.2.4. Steps not performed in the required sequence.
      A2.3.2.5. Individuals not familiar with emergency procedures.
      A2.3.2.6. Individuals not familiar with job requirements, resulting in failure to comply
      with technical data.
      A2.3.2.7. Equipment improperly used or handled during task performance.

      A2.3.2.8. Controlling agencies not advised of changes in mission status that occur due to
      task performance.
      A2.3.2.9. Lack of coordination with required agencies to ensure a safe, timely, and
      effective evaluation.
A2.4. Post Performance Errors.
   A2.4.1. Station documentation not properly completed.
   A2.4.2. Controlling agencies not advised of change mission status upon completion of task
   performance.
A2.5. Task Performance Error Categories.
   A2.5.1. Categories aid evaluators to determine overall task performance results. Errors are
   categorized by degree of seriousness.
   A2.5.2. Category I errors are of critical importance and results in an unsatisfactory
   evaluation for that particular task. Some examples are:
      A2.5.2.1. An error that causes or has the potential to cause an injury. Such an error is
      serious enough to stop the task evaluation.
      A2.5.2.2. An error that causes or has the potential to cause damage, or system
      degradation, to any item to the extent that it prevents the item from being immediately
      used for its intended purpose. This includes the item being worked on, all support
      equipment, or any other item in the work area.
      A2.5.2.3. Task performance could not be completed because the individual lacked
      sufficient knowledge of the task or operation of required support equipment.
      A2.5.2.4. An error that causes or has the potential to cause a security violation or
      introduces a system vulnerability.
      A2.5.2.5. An out of tolerance condition or measurement was not recognized and resulted
      in the equipment not meeting technical data specifications.
      A2.5.2.6. A valid/invalid measurement or check was not recognized or performed by the
      operator or technician that resulted in an erroneous decision concerning equipment
      serviceability or caused a significant delay for unnecessary troubleshooting or repair
      actions.
   A2.5.3. Category II errors are of major importance, but do not necessarily result in an
   unsatisfactory task performance. Some examples are:
      A2.5.3.1. An error that causes or has potential to cause damage to any item but not to the
      extent that such damage has a detrimental effect on the operational life of the item, or
      operational capabilities of the network.
      A2.5.3.2. Excessive delays attributable to insufficient job knowledge or improper
      planning, coordination, or supervision, although the task was successfully completed. The
      evaluator must determine what is excessive after taking into consideration such factors as
      complexity and length of the task, adverse working conditions, and other extenuating
      circumstances.

   A2.5.4. Category III errors are of minor impact and lack the seriousness to meet the criteria
   for a critical or major error.
A2.6. Determining Results.
   A2.6.1. Results are based on overall task performance.
   A2.6.2. Evaluators must:
        A2.6.2.1. Document all errors during the progress of the evaluation and brief the work
        center supervisor and the evaluated operator or technician upon completion.
        A2.6.2.2. Determine the category of each error, using the above criteria.
        A2.6.2.3. Rate each task as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. If the sum of all the errors
        indicates the operator or technician cannot satisfactorily perform the task unsupervised,
        an unsatisfactory rating is required.
        A2.6.2.4. Brief the work center supervisor, certifying official, and the trainer as soon as
        possible when an unsatisfactory task performance occurs.
