                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This plan establishes requirements and procedures for weather support, which
must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need for written
agreements between the weather unit and supported operations. It does not cover weather
support procedures for emergency war operations or certain other special operations and
procedures as these are covered in applicable OPLANS. The 36th Operations Support Squadron
Weather Flight (36 OSS/OSW) referred to as Weather Flight (WF), and the 17th Operational
Weather Squadron (17 OWS) at Hickam AFB, Hawaii are the official weather information
agencies providing weather services to the 36th Wing (36 WG) and other units assigned to
Andersen AFB.
   1.1.1. Andersen AFB WF Mission. The Andersen AFB WF conducts timely, accurate, and
   relevant local airfield observing and reporting. Produces tailored Mission Execution
   Forecasts (MEFs), performs MISSIONWATCH, METWATCH, and acts as "eyes forward"
   for the 17 OWS. The WF is organized, trained, and equipped to conduct weather operations,
   provide weather support to deployed/contingency, and exercise combat operators, 36th Wing
   leadership, and associated agencies on Andersen AFB.
Note: ―Eyes Forward‖ Role. WF will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological information
to the technicians conducting forecasting and METWATCH operations at the 17 OWS. The WF
integrates weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection readouts, and
non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather picture and near-term trend
forecast for the 17 OWS. Eyes forward yields meaningful meteorological information not
contained in coded observations to the 17 OWS and is an integral part of the Andersen AFB
METWATCH.
   1.1.2. General Responsibilities: The WF is responsible for providing environmental support
   to 36 WG, and other tenant and deployed units at Andersen AFB (AAFB), Guam. The WF
   also provides specialized radar support to the USPACOM Typhoon Warning System in
   accordance with PACAFI 15-102 and National Weather Service-36 OSS/OSW MOA. Other
   DoD agencies on Guam may receive environmental support upon request.
   1.1.3. The WF Flight Commander also functions as the Staff Weather Officer (SWO) for the
   Commander, 36th Wing (36 WG/CC).
1.2. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The area of responsibility for products and services
provided by the WF is the terminal area, which is the area located within a 5 nautical mile radius
around the center of the AAFB airfield complex. WF also conducts MISSIONWATCH for all
areas and routes in which AAFB flying units are conducting operations. The 17 OWS Area of
Responsibility (AOR), along with all the other OWS AOR’s are depicted in Attachment 12.
1.3. Location and Hours of Operation. The WF is located in Building 17002, Andersen AFB,
Guam. The WF provides or arranges for weather support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Staff
services are available from 0730L to 1630L, Monday through Friday (except federal holidays).

1.4. Contact Information. Telephone numbers: Flight Commander (DSN 366-3176) and
NCOIC (DSN 366-1407). Operational weather personnel are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week (DSN 366-5230).
1.5. Concept of Operations. The AAFB WF and the 17 OWS work as a ―team‖ to provide
weather services and resource protection for AAFB. Guidelines for this team support are
outlined in the 17 OWS-36 OSS Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
     1.5.1. The 17 OWS will disseminate all AAFB forecast weather watches, warnings and
     advisories to the 36 WG/CP and the WF. These products, along with AAFB observed
     weather warnings and advisories, will be available to local customers via the 17 OWS web
     site: https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/.
     1.5.2. The WF, in conjunction with the 17 OWS, provides weather information to all
     supported agencies for operational and decision-making purposes, as well as protection of
     base resources. The WF tailors weather information to the specific mission requirements of
     supported agencies and provides weather services for military and military-related uses as
     listed below:
     1.5.3. Routine Weather Products and Support:
        1.5.3.1. Forecasts and observations for AAFB, which are transmitted for local and
        worldwide use. (International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) location indicator for
        AAFB is PGUA)
            1.5.3.1.1. Observations and forecasts are issued in the format described in
            Attachment 7.
            1.5.3.1.2. Andersen AFB reports winds and visibility in the following units:
               1.5.3.1.2.1. Winds are reported and encoded in knots. Wind Direction and speed
               are based on 2-minute averages.
               1.5.3.1.2.2. Visibility is reported and encoded in statute miles
        1.5.3.2. Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF) and aircrew weather briefing support to
        U.S. assets and its Allies.
        1.5.3.3. Forecast Weather Watches
        1.5.3.4. Forecast/Observed Weather Warnings
        1.5.3.5. Forecast/Observed Weather Advisories
        1.5.3.6. Staff Weather Support: The WF Commander, and/or NCOIC will perform both
        staff weather functions and operational weather functions. In addition to leadership and
        management of 36 OSS/OSW activities, these members will function as a direct interface
        with the 36 WG and associate units to provide direct support to command, control, and
        planning functions. Weather forecasters will be utilized to provide staff weather briefings
        when possible. Briefing types include but are not limited to: 36 WG and 36 OG standup
        briefings, 36 WG daily status of aircraft briefings, pre-deployment briefings, deployment
        planning briefings, Installation Control Center briefings, and Mobility Concept briefings.
        1.5.3.7. Contingency, Exercise and Wartime Support. The WF will provide contingency,
        exercise and wartime weather briefings, products, and information on an as-required
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                          7


       basis. Since the WF is organized to function in peacetime as it does in wartime, the
       weather products and information provided on a routine basis will closely mirror the
       weather products and information required during pre-deployments, deployments, or
       contingencies. The WF will coordinate any additional weather support requirements to
       ensure mission tailored products are available to meet contingency, exercise or wartime
       needs.
   1.5.4. Non-routine support/services:
       1.5.4.1. Consultant Services: The WF Commander will advise on weather problems or
       requirements, prepare necessary weather annexes/appendices to planning and operations
       documents, and prepare changes to this instruction.
       1.5.4.2. Climatological Services: As requested by units, the WF will provide routine
       climatic data for planning purposes only. The WF will also obtain climatological data or
       studies to improve mission planning as needed.
       1.5.4.3. Aircraft Accident/Incident and Investigation: The WF Commander, or a
       designated representative, will serve as the weather member of investigation boards
       whenever weather events, services, personnel, or resources are involved in an aircraft
       accident/incident. Additionally, the WF Commander or a designated representative can
       be appointed to the investigation board at the direction of the commander of the agency,
       activity, unit involved, board president, and/or HQ PACAF/A3AW (PACAF/SWO).
       1.5.4.4. Environmental Protection Committee: The WF Commander will provide inputs
       to, and serve on, the Environmental Protection Committee as required.
       1.5.4.5. Air Operations Board (AOB): The WF Commander or designated representative
       will attend AOB meetings.
       1.5.4.6. Seasonal Weather Briefings: The WF Commander or designated representative
       will present an annual typhoon climatology briefing to the 36 Wing/CC in association
       with a 36 WG/IG Tropical Cyclone Exercise or the first tropical cyclone of the year,
       whichever comes first.
1.6. Terms and Abbreviations. Attachment 1 contains a complete list of all definitions of
terms and abbreviations used in this document.
1.7. Duty Priorities. Not all WF tasks can be accomplished simultaneously. Therefore, duty
priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of relative importance and
publicized to avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty priorities will ensure
timely response to situations under normal conditions; however, the list will not replace good
judgment. The weather technician may deviate in the best interest of flight safety and/or
protection of personnel or property. The weather technician will use the following priority list in
Table 1.1 as a guide for accomplishing duties. The OWS duty priorities are listed in Table 1.2
 8                                                               36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010

1.8. Communication Systems. The WF utilizes and depends on a variety of communication
systems to receive and transmit data in performance of weather duties. These systems are listed
as follows:
   1.8.1. Primary Communication Systems: New Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS), 36 WG
   NIPR/SIPR Local Area Network (LAN), WSR-88D weather radar (NEXRAD), UHF
   (PMSV) radio and Mark-IVB Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) program. The LAN
   provides internet connectivity between the WF and 17 OWS and is critical to the timely
   execution of mission weather services and airfield resource protection to AAFB.
   1.8.2. Secondary Communication Systems: These systems include the Defense Switching
   Network (DSN), and Automated Messaging Handling System (AMHS). Secondary
 10                                                                36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


   communications systems (e.g. telephone/facsimile) serve as back-up when primary systems
   are limited or inaccessible.
1.9. Assumptions and Limitations. The WF and 17 OWS rely heavily on network
communication systems and cannot effectively conduct weather support operations without
access to network communications for receiving/transmitting data. Interruption in network
service severely degrades WF’s capability to provide effective timely support to 36 WG
operations to include, aircrew mission weather briefs and the dissemination of weather watches,
warnings, and advisories to wing agencies. A specific listing of dissemination procedures and
backup support in coordination with the 17 OWS, are listed in Attachment 3.
1.10. Release of Weather Information. Support to non-DOD agencies and the public will not
be provided unless approved by the 36 WG Public Affairs (PA) office. The National Weather
Service (NWS), Guam is responsible for public service to civilians and non-military agencies.
WF will provide or arrange for day-to-day weather support to civilian contractors who request
weather information to support government-funded projects on AAFB. WF will honor requests
for weather information for use in legal claims actions against the government only after
receiving approval from 36 WG Judge Advocate (JA) office.
1.11. Weather Station Evacuation and Alternate Observing Location (AOL) Operations.
   1.11.1. In the event that the weather station has to be evacuated, WF personnel will relocate
   to and re-establish weather services in the 36 WG Command Post (36 WG/CP), Bldg 23028.
   The contact number at the AOL is 366-2439.
   1.11.2. Weather observing will be conducted at the AOL in the 36 WG/CP Annex. The area
   approximately 25 feet from the parking lot on the flight line side of the building will serve as
   the official point of observation.
   1.11.3. If the 36 WG/CP is unavailable or the communications systems at the AOL are
   inoperable, the AOL will be located in the Air Traffic Control Tower (ATC). If the tower is
   unavailable, then the AOL will be located in another suitable facility with available
   communications, (i.e. telephone, LAN connection and a view of the airfield complex).
   1.11.4. AOL Limitations:
       1.11.4.1. The observing view at the AOL is restricted from the SE-S and partially
       restricted from the E by building 23008. Visibility in all other directions is unrestricted.
       Only the western halves of south runways are clearly visible from the observation point.
       However, since the views of these areas are not completely restricted, the majority of
       weather and sky conditions occurring over the runway complex can still be distinguished.
       1.11.4.2. Weather occurring SE-S of the AOL observation point may not be fully
       reflected in the official weather observation. A Cooperative Weather Watch (see section
       2.4), in which the Air Traffic Control, tower controllers are trained as limited weather
       observers, reduces the impact of this limitation.
   1.11.5. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) capability does not exist at the AOL. ATC tower
   personnel will monitor the PMSV frequency (344.6).
   1.11.6. Timeliness and quality of services provided from the AOL may be degraded due to
   use of backup equipment/data sources.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                      11


1.12. Changes to this Base Instruction. To request changes to this wing instruction, contact
the WF at 366-3176/1408/1407 or send written requests/inquiries to: 36 OSS/OSW, Unit 14035,
APO AP 96543-4035.
1.13. Weather Station Closure. AAFB WF will notify the 17 OWS WXR Flight Commander
of any periods when the airfield and weather station will be closed (e.g. a holiday). Details of
the handover to 17 OWS will be documented in the 17 OWS-36 OSS Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) prior to the closure. Exceptions to normal operating procedures are as
follows:
   1.13.1. 17 OWS will issue all observed lightning warnings during the hours the WF is closed
   on the condition the OWS is able to remotely access the AAFB lightning sensing equipment.
   During periods when the OWS cannot remotely access the lightning sensing equipment, the
   OWS can only provide a forecast weather watch for lightning.
   1.13.2. 17 OWS will call the WF stand-by forecaster and the 36 WG/CP as listed in the
   Notification Diagram, Attachment 4 for any weather warnings or watches issued when WF
   is closed. If unable to contact the stand-by forecaster, 17 OWS will call the Weather Flight
   Commander or NCOIC.
   1.13.3. WF will ensure personnel remain on duty anytime the severe weather watch and/or
   warning for winds GTE 50 knots is in effect. In addition, they will ensure personnel remain
   on duty when the warning for 35 knots is in effect but the Automated Observing System is
   not providing current winds to 17 OWS.
   1.13.4. WF will ensure procedures are in place to recall personnel when the severe weather
   watch and/or warning for winds GTE 50 knots is issued. In addition, they will ensure
   procedures are in place to recall personnel when the warning for 35 knot is issued but the
   Automated Observing System is not providing current winds to 17 OWS.
   1.13.5. When the AAFB WF is scheduled to close, 17 OWS will include the remark
   ―LIMITED METWATCH YYGG TIL YYGG‖ to indicate forecast is not amendable except
   when a weather warning is issued, canceled, or updated, and is not correctly reflected in the
   current TAF.
   1.13.6. 17 OWS will provide phone patch services (DSN 315-449-7926) during times when
   the AAFB WF is closed.
 12                                                                 36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Trained and certified weather forecasters monitor weather conditions and
disseminate observations when specific regulatory and locally established weather thresholds are
met. The weather forecaster will relay all pertinent information, such as changing weather
conditions; to the 17 OWS as part of the ―eyes forward‖ function and to designated base agencies
for resource protection (see attachment 4). Weather forecasters take all observations IAW
AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations and AFMAN 15-129, Air and Space Weather
Operations-Processes and Procedures.
2.2. Observation Sites
   2.2.1. Primary Observation Site.          The location of the AN/FMQ-19, Automated
   Meteorological Observing Station (AMOS), primary sensor group and the discontinuity
   sensor group is the primary observation site. The automated sensor groups are sited in
   accordance (or as close to as practicable) with the Federal Standard for Siting
   Meteorological Sensors at Airports. The primary sensor group is located on 06R and the
   discontinuity sensors are on 24L, 24R, and 06L. The automated sensor groups are the
   primary observation data for the airfield. In the case of system failure or elements that cannot
   be detected, weather forecasters will augment the system from the backup observation site.
   2.2.2. Backup Observation Site. The backup observation site is located behind building
   17002. The point of observation is 55 feet from the west side of the building.
2.3. Weather Watch. The AMOS performs an automatic, Continuous Weather Watch (CWW).
When augmentation is required, weather forecasters will perform a Basic Weather Watch
(BWW).
   2.3.1. Basic Weather Watch. Due to other weather duties, weather forecasters on duty may
   not detect and report all weather changes as they occur. The BWW observing program has
   been implemented to establish the minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper level
   of weather watch is maintained.
   2.3.2. During a BWW, weather forecasters will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not
   to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI or
   LOCAL observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or
   are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
       2.3.2.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
       2.3.2.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
       2.3.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
       2.3.2.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
       2.3.2.5. Precipitation (any form).
       2.3.2.6. Fog or Mist.
       2.3.2.7. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain
       alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI or LOCAL
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                          13


       observation. Weather personnel will also monitor local area observational and forecast
       products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of
       responsibility.
2.4. Cooperative Weather Watch. WF has established a Cooperative Weather Watch with Air
Traffic Control (ATC), and other appropriate base/post agencies, as required. Of primary
concern is the report of tower visibility different from the prevailing surface visibility, local
PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight
safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. The
cooperative weather watch will define, at a minimum, the following:
   2.4.1. The process for ATC personnel certified to evaluate tower visibility to report changes
   in tower prevailing visibility and sector visibility to the WF when tower visibility is less than
   4 statute miles (6000 meters) and different from the surface prevailing visibility.
   2.4.2. The requirement for weather technicians to reevaluate the weather conditions
   whenever a reliable source (i.e., ATC, pilots, local law enforcement, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the last disseminated observation (e.g., different ceiling height,
   visibility, present weather). Based on reevaluation of the different weather conditions
   reported and local policy, weather personnel will:
       2.4.2.1. Generate a SPECI or LOCAL (when in manual mode) observation if the
       different conditions warrant immediate dissemination.
       2.4.2.2. Include the differing conditions in the next required METAR, SPECI, or
       LOCAL observation if the conditions alone do not warrant immediate dissemination.
   2.4.3. WF will coordinate with ATC to leave runway lights on during airfield closure to
   allow the AMOS to continue reporting RVR. This is recommended in case of emergency
   aircraft divert.
   2.4.4. WF will coordinate cooperative weather watch requirements and changes with the
   Control Tower, Chief Controller. WF develops and maintains certification tests IAW USAF
   ATC guidelines. WF trains and certifies ATC Tower controllers on PIREPs and on
   evaluating/reporting tower and prevailing and sector visibility.
   2.4.5. Control Tower Observations and Weather Observing Location Actions.
       2.4.5.1. ATC Personnel. IAW FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control), Tower personnel
       shall take prevailing visibility observations and apply the observations when the
       prevailing visibility at the usual point of observation, or at the tower level is less than 4
       miles. Tower personnel certified to take visibility observations shall:
           2.4.5.1.1. Notify the WF forecaster when they observe tower prevailing visibility to
           decrease to less than, or increase to equal or exceed 4 miles (6000 meters), and is
           different from the surface prevailing visibility.
           2.4.5.1.2. When the prevailing visibility at the tower or the surface is less than 4
           miles (6000 meters), report all changes of one or more reportable values to the
           weather forecaster.
 14                                                              36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


          2.4.5.1.3. Re-evaluate surface prevailing as soon as practicable, upon initial receipt
          of a differing control tower value, and upon receipt of subsequent reportable changes
          at the control tower level.
      2.4.5.2. Weather forecasters will perform the following when augmenting the AMOS:
          2.4.5.2.1. Notify the tower as soon as possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at
          the backup observation site decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4
          miles (6000 meters).
          2.4.5.2.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon
          initial receipt of a differing control tower value, and upon receipt of subsequent
          reportable changes at the control tower level.
          2.4.5.2.3. Use control tower values of prevailing visibility as a guide in determining
          the surface visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by
          buildings, aircraft, etc.
2.5. Weather Observations. AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, and AFMAN
15-129, Air and Space Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures govern all aspects of
observing. For primary observation site, see section 2.2 Observations will be taken and
disseminated over the N-TFS hourly and when Local or Special criteria dictate.
   2.5.1. Primary Observation Equipment. The AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological
   Observing Station (AMOS) is the primary piece of equipment used to take weather
   observations at Andersen AFB.
   2.5.2. Augmentation of Primary Observation Equipment.
      2.5.2.1. Augmentation is the process of having certified weather observers manually
      add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited automated observing
      system. The two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up.
      Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an
      automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the automated observing system
      to detect and/or report. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data
      and/or dissemination to an automated weather observation when the primary automated
      method (through the AMOS) is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or
      communication failure.
      2.5.2.2. Weather forecasters will supplement data from the AN/FMQ-19 when the
      following criteria are met, and will be ready to supplement if the conditions are forecast
      to occur within two hours:
NOTE: (*) Denotes mandatory supplementation elements IAW AFMAN 15-111.
          2.5.2.2.1. When the Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) are implemented
          for:
             2.5.2.2.1.1. * Tornadoes, Waterspout, Funnel Cloud
             2.5.2.2.1.2. * Hail one half inch or greater
             2.5.2.2.1.3. High winds (> 49kts) (Winds are backed-up/edited if the FMQ-19
             reported value is not representative of current conditions). For safety purposes,
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                       15


              weather personnel WILL NOT backup winds during TCCOR 1E.
           2.5.2.2.2. * Volcanic ash is observed from the airfield.
           2.5.2.2.3. Any weather elements considered operationally significant by the weather
           technician
       2.5.2.3. Weather technicians will backup the following functions during AMOS outages
       or during unavailability of AMOS sensor data:
           2.5.2.3.1. Wind speed and direction
           2.5.2.3.2. Visibility
           2.5.2.3.3. Present Weather
           2.5.2.3.4. Cloud heights and coverage
           2.5.2.3.5. Temperature and dew point temperature
           2.5.2.3.6. Altimeter setting
2.6. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The WF monitors ultra-high frequency (UHF)
344.6 MHz continuously to assist aircraft (either airborne or on the ground). Range is
approximately 200 nautical miles (NM) at normal operating altitudes. The WF will solicit
aircrews to provide PIREPs of weather conditions over this frequency. Significant PIREPS
received by the WF will be disseminated over the N-TFS system. See Attachment 10 for
elements specific to PIREPs. The WF will notify the 17 OWS when aircrews report any urgent
PIREP or significant weather phenomena within 200 nm of Andersen AFB. During periods
when the AAFB forecast counter is closed or the technician is not available, the 17 OWS will
provide phone patch support (DSN 315-449-7926) for AAFB.
   2.6.1. Short-Term PMSV Outages: WF forecasters will notify ATC of any PMSV outage
   and expected time of return to service. Aircrews will be briefed PMSV outages during their
   flight weather (MEF) brief. Aircrews can contact 36 Wing/CP or AMCC for a phone patch
   to the WF for metro service. ATC will monitor the frequency and advise aircrew on UHF
   344.6 to contact Airfield Ops at UHF 372.2 for weather service. During PMSV outages,
   ATC personnel will relay all PIREPs to the WF forecaster as time and resources permit.
   2.6.2. Long-Term PMSV Outages: Long-term PMSV outages will be documented in the
   current airfield NOTAMS and/or FLIPs as appropriate. WF forecasters will ensure that ATC
   is aware of the current PMSV status and expected time of return to service. Aircrews will be
   briefed PMSV outages during their MEF aircrew brief. A phone patch through the 36
   WG/CP or AMCC to weather may be used during extended PMSV outages. During PMSV
   outages, ATC personnel will relay all PIREPs to the weather forecaster as time and resources
   permit."
2.7. Toxic Corridors and Chemical Downwind Messages. Upon notification of any incident
that involves a toxic spill or base emergency, the WF will provide wind direction and speed,
along with any other required information, for toxic corridor calculations (worst case) performed
by 36th Wing Disaster Response Force. Updates will be provided as required. The WF will
provide Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM’s) upon request.
 16                                                               36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


                                           Chapter 3

                             MISSION WEATHER SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF provides or arranges for tailored Mission Weather Services (MWS) and
subsequent MISSIONWATCH for all flying units assigned/deployed to AAFB. The WF works
cooperatively with the 17 OWS to develop a TAF and issue subsequent weather watches,
warnings, and advisories for AAFB when conditions warrant.
3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   3.2.1. A TAF is a forecast of required weather elements for a particular terminal covering a
   period up to 24 hours. Forecast elements in the forecast text refer to an area within 5 NM of
   the center of the runway complex. The term ―VC‖ (vicinity) appended to a weather event
   refers to an area 5-10 NM from that center.
   3.2.2. TAFs will be amended when unforecasted predetermined values of phenomena occur
   or are expected to occur. Attachment 8 lists what elements will be specified in the TAF and
   specific thresholds requiring TAF amendments.
   3.2.3. 17 OWS issues the official Andersen TAF three times each day at 02Z, 10Z, and 18Z.
   The forecast elements in the body of the TAF apply to the area within a 5 NM radius of
   AAFB. 17 OWS will disseminate the TAF via standard communication systems (e.g.,
   NIPRNET, SIPRNET) and AFW meteorological communication systems (i.e. N-TFS).
3.3. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF).
   3.3.1. Definition: A MEF is a forecast product derived from all available weather data,
   which are applicable to a unit’s mission criteria. A MEF can be anything from a flight
   weather briefing to a forecast product designed to support a specific weapon system.
   3.3.2. The WF will issue MEFs tailored to mission requirements. The requirements are
   coordinated with WF Flight Commander or NCOIC during the mission planning cycle.
   3.3.3. The 17 OWS produces a 5-day planning forecast daily and is available at
   https://ows.hickam.af.mil/ows_unique/17/floor_products/5dayForecastPGUA.pdf .
3.4. Flight Weather Briefings. The WF produces tactical-level flight weather MEFs, and
arranges with the 17 OWS for coordinated flight weather briefings to transient aircrew. Briefings
will be conducted IAW AFMAN 15-129.
   3.4.1. The 17 OWS will provide flight briefing services to USAF and USA transient
   aircrews via the 17 OWS web page.                     Pilots can access the web at
   https://17ows.hickam.af.mil. At any time, the aircrew can contact the 17 OWS at DSN
   449-8333/8335 (voice) or DSN 449-8336 (fax) with questions or for information. Transient
   aircrews should request routine flight weather briefings a minimum of two hours prior to
   briefing time to give the 17 OWS adequate time to examine the weather conditions and
   complete the required documentation.
   3.4.2. The 17 OWS will complete no-notice and short-notice briefings as time permits
   depending on the current workload, available manpower, and duty priorities. The 17 OWS
   will prioritize no-notice flight weather briefing requests behind existing requests unless
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                       17


   special circumstances warrant a higher priority (e.g., alert, search and rescue, medical
   evacuation).
   3.4.3. The WF will arrange for transient aircrew weather briefings when required by
   providing access to the 17 OWS Briefing Cell. Materials provided will include:
       3.4.3.1. Computer (with access to the OWS web page) and printer.
       3.4.3.2. Class A (DSN/Commercial capable) telephone and fax machine.
       3.4.3.3. Pertinent information (i.e. web site instructions and OWS Briefing Cell phone
       numbers/instructions, AFVA 15-136 and 15-137) to assist the transient aircrews in
       completing their briefings.
   3.4.4. The WF will provide flight briefing services to transient aircrews based on duty
   priorities and workload constraints. Transient aircrews need to request from the 17 OWS (as
   identified in 3.4.1. above), their flight weather briefings a minimum of two hours prior to
   brief time.
   3.4.5. The WF will provide or arrange for USN and USMC transient aircrew briefings based
   on duty priorities and workload constraints. If duty priorities or workload does not permit,
   the aircrew or WF will request the transient briefing through the Naval Aviation Forecast
   Detachment, Atsugi NAS (DSN: 315-264-3280).
   3.4.6. The WF will conduct both scheduled and unscheduled briefings for local customers
   and aircraft staged at AAFB 24 hours a day. Briefings will include a discussion of weather
   affecting the flight’s departure, route, and destination(s).
   3.4.7. Out-of-Station Briefings: Mass briefings can be presented at a location specified by
   the requesting agency. Agencies should provide at least a 24-hour notice and coordinate
   them with the WF Flight Commander or NCOIC. However, contingent upon personnel
   availability and mission requirements, these briefings may be requested at any time.
   Changes to the briefing schedule or route changes should be promptly passed on to the duty
   technician by the requesting agency.
3.5. MISSIONWATCH. The WF will maintain a MISSIONWATCH tailored to the mission(s)
of the day. The purpose is to ensure the most accurate weather information is provided to the
customer and to improve the mission execution forecast process.             The objective of
MISSIONWATCH is mission success. The WF should be a part of mission planning and
execution to exploit weather conditions and ensure weather is a force multiplier. The following
procedures will be used to focus on limiting meteorological impacts to ongoing military
operations:
   3.5.1. The WF should be a part of the operational decision cycle; the WF can improve the
   probability of success of a mission by notifying operational customers as significant
   unforecasted changes to mission-critical parameters occur prior to mission execution.
   3.5.2. During the mission, the WF will continuously monitor for mission-critical weather
   thresholds. If a mission-critical threshold is crossed, the WF technician will update the MEF,
   notify the mission director, mission commander, and/or supervisor of flying (SOF) via phone
   or in person immediately, and then inform the 17 OWS of the situation, as required. In
   emergencies or rapidly changing weather conditions, mission support comes first; the
 18                                                                36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


   customer will be notified by any means necessary of any mission limiting weather
   conditions.
   3.5.3. WF leadership will coordinate with the customer to determine windows of opportunity
   in which updated weather information could influence the outcome of ongoing missions.
   Theses windows of opportunity will vary from mission to mission. Methods of contact may
   include, but are not limited to, verbal relay of information to the SOF or mission commander,
   updating the MEF, a PMSV contact, a phone patch (366-5230), or by using command and
   control systems. The operations center, SOF, or mission commander will be the central
   dissemination point to update the aircrews on mission weather conditions.
   3.5.4. WF is not required to MISSIONWATCH for any aircraft not receiving a briefing by
   the WF.
3.6. Pilot Reports (PIREPS) and Air Reports (AIREPS). The WF can receive
PIREPS/AIREPS via global airways facilities, relayed from the tower, the 36 Wing/CP or
AMCC, or over the PMSV. Dissemination format will be IAW AFMAN 15-129. (See
Attachment 10 for PIREP/AIREP format and explanation)
   3.6.1. Aircrews should be encouraged to provide timely PIREPS/AIREPS when those
   reports include:
      3.6.1.1. Meteorological elements observed that may be of operational significance to
      other aircraft or to surface activities (i.e. low-level wind shear, tornadic activity, etc.).
      3.6.1.2. Specific data to fill a gap in the meteorological collecting system; for example,
      cloud bases and/or tops when departing/arriving, upper winds, or turbulence/icing at a
      point or between two points
   3.6.2. A severe PIREP (UUA) or AIREP Special (ARS) will be transmitted longline for one
   or more of the following phenomena:
      3.6.2.1. Tornadoes, funnel clouds, and water spouts.
      3.6.2.2. Thunderstorms when along a line with little or no space between individual
      storms, or thunderstorms embedded in cloud layers or concealed by haze.
      3.6.2.3. Tropical Cyclones.
      3.6.2.4. Squall lines.
      3.6.2.5. Severe or extreme turbulence.
      3.6.2.6. Severe icing.
      3.6.2.7. Low-level wind shear.
      3.6.2.8. Hail.
      3.6.2.9. Volcanic ash cloud.
   3.6.3. All routine AIREPS received will be disseminated longline. All routine PIREPS
   received will be disseminated longline unless they:
      3.6.3.1. Contain only cloud base heights which are incorporated in the surface
      observation.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                        19


       3.6.3.2. Include substantially the same data already transmitted within the past 30
       minutes.
       3.6.3.3. Contain only negative reports of icing and/or turbulence from locations outside
       forecast areas for these phenomena.
   3.6.4. All applicable PIREPs/AIREPs will be locally disseminated.
3.7. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). The only on-island flying unit the WF supports is
HSC-25 (Navy). The Navy does not require IRC Support. IRC support to deployed AF units
permanently staged at AAFB, or other TDY flying units at AAFB, will be determined upon their
arrival. Reference Chapter 7, ―Reciprocal Support‖ for more information regarding IRC
support.
3.8. Space Weather Support. The WF, in conjunction with the 17 OWS, will provide a
generalized situation awareness of past and future space environment impacts to war fighters and
weapons systems via space weather products tailored to the mission requirements. These
products will be hosted on the 17 OWS web page at https://17ows.hickam.af.mil or JAAWIN,
https://weather.afwa.af.mil . A brief definition follows:
   3.8.1. HF Communication: Depicts degradation of HF communications due to changes in
   the ionosphere where long-range HF signals are usually reflected.
   3.8.2. UHF SATCOM Communications: Depicts degradation of UHF SATCOM
   communications due to changes in the ionosphere. UHF signals are transmitted through the
   ionosphere for communications to satellites.
   3.8.3. Satellite Operations Health: Depicts the potential for or observed degradation or
   damage to satellites themselves. This damage or degradation usually results from particle
   interaction with the spacecraft. This can affect satellites such as GPS, communication,
   weather, or surveillance.
   3.8.4. Space Object Tracking/Satellite Drag: Indicates the observed and forecast potential
   for unexpected changes in the orbits of satellites. Changes in satellite orbits may result from
   an increase or decrease in the drag normally experienced at a satellite’s orbit. This change in
   drag results from the heating or cooling of the upper atmosphere due to changes in the sun’s
   radiation output, or to geomagnetic activity.
   3.8.5. Hi-Altitude Flight: Indicates the maximum level of radiation exposure at an altitude
   of 67,000 ft. It will be YELLOW for dose rates greater than 10 millirems/hr and RED for
   dose rates exceeding 100 millirems/hr. This radiation is a product of cosmic rays from
   outside the solar system as well as very high-energy protons occasionally produced by
   explosive events on the sun.
   3.8.6. Radar Interference: Depicts observed and forecast degraded operation of radars used
   to track objects in space. Radio frequency bursts from the sun can cause interference to
   radars when the sun is in their field of view.
   3.8.7. Space Weather Impact and Forecasts. The WF in conjunction with the 17 OWS will
   provide the following space weather impact and forecast products, as needed, tailored to
   mission requirements:
20                                                              36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


     3.8.7.1. HF Communication reported impact (previous 6 hr analysis) and 6 hr forecast
     (Pacific).
     3.8.7.2. UHF SATCOM 6 hr forecast, and 00-72 hr Climatological Scintillation Maps at
     177.5 E (Pacific)
     3.8.7.3. Satellite Operations Health reported impact and forecast through 72 hrs (Global)
     3.8.7.4. Space Object Tracking/Satellite Drag reported impact and forecast through 72
     hrs (Global).
     3.8.7.5. Hi-Altitude Flight reported impact and forecast through 72 hrs (Global).
     3.8.7.6. Radar Interference reported impact and forecast through 72 hrs (Global).
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                        21


                                           Chapter 4

                             TROPICAL CYCLONE SUPPORT

4.1. Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The U.S. Naval Pacific Meteorology and
Oceanography Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center (NPMOC/JTWC) at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
provides forecasts and warnings for tropical cyclones located from the international dateline
westward to the eastern coast of Africa.
4.2. Tropical Cyclone Categories.
   4.2.1. Invest: A weather system for which JTWC is interested in collecting specialized data
   sets (e.g., microwave imagery) and/or running model guidance. Once a system has been
   designated as an invest, data collection and processing is initiated. The designation of a
   system as an invest does not correspond to any particular likelihood of development of the
   system into a tropical cyclone.
   4.2.2. Poor: An area of convection or low level inflow where conditions are not favorable for
   a tropical cyclone to develop within 24 hours.
   4.2.3. Fair: A tropical disturbance for which conditions have improved but development has
   not yet commenced.
   4.2.4. Good: A tropical disturbance where conditions are favorable for development and
   development has begun. "Good" descriptions are applied to tropical disturbances covered by
   a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).
   4.2.5. TCFA: designates an area where JTWC is most likely to begin issuing tropical
   cyclone warnings within the next 24 hours. This information is provided to the DoD and
   other U.S. government agencies for operations planning.
   4.2.6. Tropical Disturbance: Disorganized area of convection with sustained wind speed less
   than 25 knots.
   4.2.7. Tropical Depression: Tropical cyclone with sustained wind speed 25 to 34 knots.
   4.2.8. Tropical Storm: Tropical cyclone with sustained wind speed of 34 to 63 knots.
   4.2.9. Typhoon: Tropical cyclone with sustained wind speed of 64 to 129 knots.
   4.2.10. Super Typhoon: Tropical cyclone with sustained wind speed of at least 130 knots.
4.3. Tropical Cyclone Products.
   4.3.1. The following applies to all tropical cyclone products: The 48-hour and 72-hour
   tropical forecasts/outlooks (or longer if issued) contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for
   planning purposes only, and are subject to change.
   4.3.2. Tropical Cyclone Warning Bulletins: are generated by the JTWC and provide
   forecasts for identified tropical cyclones. The current position, intensity, past movement, and
   5-day forecast tracks are plotted. (See Attachment 5.4)
       4.3.2.1. JTWC warnings are updated a minimum of every six hours in the Western
       Pacific and every 12 hours in the Indian Ocean until the storm has dissipated or becomes
       extra-tropical (loses characteristics of a tropical cyclone).
 22                                                             36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


      4.3.2.2. All JTWC tropical cyclone warning bulletins forecasting a tropical cyclone to
      affect Guam will be briefed to 36 WG leadership immediately with a recommendation for
      an Installation Control Center (ICC) recall if 50 knot winds (sustained) are forecast for
      Guam.
   4.3.3. AAFB WF Bulletins: when storms are forecast to, or are affecting the 36 WG AOR,
   the WF will issue to AAFB agencies, tropical cyclone updates incorporating JTWC forecasts.
   These tropical cyclone update bulletins will be emailed to 36 WG agencies (IAW
   Attachment 5.6) every six hours or when an update warning from JTWC becomes available.
   4.3.4. Also, for tropical systems upstream and within 900 nm of AAFB, the WF will e-mail
   tropical cyclone update bulletins following receipt of a JTWC warning/bulletin (if issued)
   and when updates are issued by JTWC. Storms outside of 900 nm will be updated via email
   whenever they are upgraded, downgraded, cancelled, and/or are expected to affect a 36 WG
   asset listed below:
      4.3.4.1. Canberra, Australia
      4.3.4.2. Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory
      4.3.4.3. Singapore
      4.3.4.4. Any deployed location of 36 WG assets (36 CRG, deployed fighters, deployed
      bombers).
   4.3.5. 17 OWS Bulletins: the 17 OWS will produce a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment
   Product (TC-TAP) when AAFB is expected to receive sustained winds > 35-knots during the
   next 96 hours as a result of a JTWC tropical cyclone update. The TC-TAP will be updated
   w/in 90 minutes upon receipt of a new JTWC tropical cyclone forecast.
      4.3.5.1. The TC-TAP is based off JTWC warning data, and depicts forecasted peak
      sustained wind speed and direction, peak wind gust, onset and duration of destructive
      winds (sustained winds of 50 knots or more), onset and duration of crosswinds, and
      closest point of approach (CPA) information. (See Attachment 5.5)
      4.3.5.2. The 17 OWS will first coordinate with AAFB WF prior to issuing the TC-TAP
      bulletins. Every effort will be made to have a fully coordinated TC-TAP in effect NLT
      45 minutes after the latest JTWC warning is posted.
   4.3.6. AAFB Tropical Cyclone Wind Forecast: The WF will develop an AAFB wind
   forecast based on the TC-TAP generated by the 17 OWS. The wind forecast will be briefed
   to 36 WG/CC and the ICC to help establish optimum aircraft evacuation windows and to
   determine Condition of Readiness (COR) timelines. (See Attachment 5.7)
4.4. Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (COR) Criteria and WF Actions.
   4.4.1. TCCOR Conditions:
      4.4.1.1. TCCOR 4: Sustained winds of 50 knots or greater from a tropical cyclone are
      possible within the next 72 hours. (AAFB is always in COR 4 unless changed by 36
      WG/CC due to an approaching tropical cyclone)
      4.4.1.2. TCCOR 3: Sustained winds of 50 knots or greater from a tropical cyclone are
      possible within the next 48 hours on AAFB.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                     23


     4.4.1.3. TCCOR 2: Sustained winds of 50 knots or greater from a tropical cyclone are
     possible within the next 24 hours on AAFB.
     4.4.1.4. TCCOR 1 (Caution): Sustained winds of 50 knots or greater from a tropical
     cyclone are possible within the next 12 hours on AAFB.
     4.4.1.5. TCCOR 1 (Emergency): In effect when sustained winds of 50 knots from a
     tropical cyclone are observed to occur on AAFB.
     4.4.1.6. TCCOR 1 (Recovery): When sustained winds of 50 knots or greater from a
     tropical cyclone are no longer observed or expected for AAFB.
  4.4.2. WF TCCOR Actions:
     4.4.2.1. TCCOR 4: Normal operations
     4.4.2.2. TCCOR 3, TCCOR 2 and TCCOR 1 (Caution):
        4.4.2.2.1. Brief the ICC on current JTWC warning, satellite imagery, AAFB wind
        forecasts and regional base forecasts (possible evacuation bases).
     4.4.2.3. TCCOR 1 (Emergency) and TCCOR 1 (Recovery):
        4.4.2.3.1. No TAF, Warnings/Watches or Advisories will be issued until the ALL
        CLEAR is given and the Wing returns to TCCOR 4. The TC-TAP becomes the
        official weather product and will continue to be issued at scheduled times, if at all
        possible.
        4.4.2.3.2. Weather personnel will not take outside observations during TCCOR 1
        (Emergency). The automated observation system will be set to Auto mode and will
        be the official observation.
        4.4.2.3.3. Collect as much weather data as possible for later reports and studies. Data
        will include, at a minimum, satellite imagery, hard and/or soft copies of all available
        radar products, and Internet data that may be useful. During all tropical cyclones that
        may cause damage to the base or the island, archive as much radar data as possible.
        4.4.2.3.4. Provide OPREP-3 reports to 36 WG/CP as required.

                               VOLCANIC ASH SUPPORT

5.1. Volcano Monitoring.
   5.1.1. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) monitors volcanic ash activity globally and
   issues advisory products tailored for DOD support and is responsible for production and
   dissemination of alphanumeric and graphical ash advisory products to DOD units operating
   in the Marianas region. In addition, AFWA is responsible for backup of the Washington
   Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (W-VAAC). AFWA provides text and graphical forecast
   products to civilian users during W-VAAC outage periods via NWS communication
   channels.
   5.1.2. Separately, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitors volcanoes
   throughout the Marianas region and provides a separate warning system. USGS focuses on
   volcano unrest and advises on the potential to interfere with aviation.
      5.1.2.1. Example of USGS bulletin:
Anatahan Weekly Update issued Feb 18, 2008 13:57 MPT Volcanic-
Alert Level WATCH - Aviation Color Code ORANGE
Report prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey. Reports and observations
from satellite of a low-level plume of steam, ash, and sulfur dioxide
extending from Anatahan persisted through the past week. A satellite image
from 0145 Feb. 12 UTC (11:45 MPT) showed a broad aerosol and diffuse ash
plume extending almost 500 km (300 mi), from west of Guam to east of
Pagan. Winds blew the plume over Saipan and Tinian Feb. 13 and the CNMI
Emergency Management Office issued a Volcanic Haze and Sulfur Advisory
at 9:45 am MPT Feb. 13. The EMO also received a report from Rota of haze
but no sulfur smell.
      5.1.2.2. Marianas Islands USGS Website, http://volcano.wr.usgs.gov/cnmistatus.php
5.2. Volcanic Ash Products.
   5.2.1. Volcanic Ash Eruption Updates are prepared by AFWA at least every 6 hours and
   more frequently pending new information about the eruption. The bulletin contains volcano
   name, location, and summit elevation as well as eruptions to include height of the ash plume
   and trajectory of the ash. Once published, AFWA will send these bulletins to the 36
   OSS/OSW.
      5.2.1.1. Example of a volcanic ash eruption update:

   5.2.2. AFWA also produces an animated graphic depicting ash dispersion in the atmosphere.
   The PUFF model shows direction and progression of movement of ash at different levels of
   the atmosphere. This slide will be included in staff briefs when available and pertinent to the
   situation.
   5.2.3. Satellite imagery analyzing flight level and directional movement of ash are emailed
   to the 36 OSS/OSW inbox on a routine basis and will be included in staff briefs when
   appropriate.
5.3. Notification of Ash Expected to Affect Andersen.
   5.3.1. All ash eruption bulletins which lead to forecasting ash over the AAFB airfield within
   6 hours are briefed to Wing leadership immediately in order to begin resource protection
   actions.
   5.3.2. AFWA and National Weather Service volcanic ash bulletins may be e-mailed as a
   service to Wing agencies (similar to A5.1.1). The bulletins are emailed during times when
 26                                                              36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


   the information contained on the bulletin would force an Ash Condition Color Code change.
   (See attachment 12 for an example.)
   5.3.3. Andersen Ash Condition Color Codes.
      5.3.3.1. Green: Volcano is in normal non-eruptive state. No volcanic ash expected
      above AAFB. Or after a change from a higher alert level: Volcanic activity has ceased
      or volcanic ash has evacuated the area above AAFB.
      5.3.3.2. Yellow: Volcano is in an elevated state of unrest with a detectable ash
      plume/emission. No ash is expected above AAFB within the next 24 hours. Or after a
      change from a higher alert level: Volcanic activity has decreased significantly but
      continues to be closely monitored for possible renewed release.
      5.3.3.3. Orange: Volcanic eruption/emission is occurring. Ash expected over AAFB
      within the next 12 hours. Begin preparations for protection of aircraft. Or after a
      change from a higher alert level: Volcanic ash has evacuated the area above AAFB but
      may still be present in the local flying area.
      5.3.3.4. Red: Volcanic eruption/emission is occurring. Ash expected over AAFB
      within 3 hours. Volcanic ash considered imminent. Consider termination of flying, post
      airfield advisories, seal or shelter assets as required.
      5.3.3.5. Black: Ash has been observed on or above the AAFB airfield.
5.4. Ash Reporting.
   5.4.1. Observations will include the VA remark only if ash is observed in the AAFB
   aerodrome either suspended in the air or accumulating on the surface. Smelling sulfur is not
   a consideration except to indicate the observer should be on the lookout for the presence of
   ash.
   5.4.2. WF will collect as much weather data as possible for later reports and studies. Data
   will include, at a minimum, satellite imagery, hard and/or soft copies of all available radar
   products, and Internet data that may be useful.
5.5. USGS Warning Schemes
   5.5.1. There are two warning schemes produced by the USGS. These warning schemes are
   generally what the WF will monitor when the volcanoes are not producing ash.
      5.5.1.1. USGS ranks the level of activity at a U.S. volcano using the terms "Normal", for
      typical volcanic activity in a non-eruptive phase; "Advisory", for elevated unrest;
      "Watch", for escalating unrest or a minor eruption underway that poses limited hazards;
      and, "Warning", if a highly hazardous eruption is underway or imminent. These levels
      reflect conditions at a volcano and the expected or ongoing hazardous volcanic
      phenomena. When an alert level is assigned by an observatory, accompanying text will
      give a fuller explanation of the observed phenomena and clarify hazard implications to
      affected groups.
      5.5.1.2. As part of the alert-level system, color codes (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) are
      used to provide succinct information about volcanic-ash hazards to the aviation sector.
      Volcanic activity threatens safe air travel when finely pulverized, glassy, abrasive
      volcanic material is explosively erupted into the atmosphere and dispersed as airborne

      clouds in flight paths of jet aircraft. The color codes are in accord with recommended
      ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) procedures to help pilots, dispatchers,
      and air-traffic controllers who are planning or executing flights over broad regions of the
      globe quickly ascertain the status of numerous volcanoes and determine if continued
      attention, re-routing, or extra fuel is warranted.

                                          Chapter 6

                WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS, AND ADVISORIES

6.1. General. The 17 OWS or WF will issue forecast and observed weather warnings, watches,
or advisories for the base when conditions warrant. The term ―base‖ is defined as an area 5
nautical miles in radius centered on the AAFB runway complex. Weather watches, warnings,
and advisories for the wing will be issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The WF will
coordinate all requirements for and ensure timely issuance of weather watches, warnings, and
advisories in accordance with AFMAN 15-129, Air and Space Weather Operations-Processes
and Procedures.
6.2. Forecast Weather Watches. A special notice provided to advise of the potential for
weather conditions that might pose a threat to property or life. When a weather watch is issued,
customers must take preparatory actions, including reviewing applicable checklists to ensure
rapid response in the event a subsequent weather warning is issued.
   6.2.1. * Forecast weather watches are issued IAW the guidance in AFI 10-229 and AFMAN
   15-129. The 17 OWS will issue a forecast weather watch for Andersen AFB when the
   potential for the criteria defined in Table 6.1 exists within 5 nautical miles (NM) of the
   center of the runway. The forecast lightning watch is an exception. The watch area is 5 nm
   around the entire AAFB complex (AAFB, 36 MXS munitions complex, Det 5, 22 SOPS, and
   Northwest Field). See attachment 6 for weather impacts on customers and attachment 13
   for the watch area for AAFB complex.

Table 6.1. * Forecast Weather Watch Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times.
Criteria                                                               Desired Lead-Time

Winds > 50 Knots (including gusts)                                     4 hours
Lightning within 5 NM of AAFB Complex                                  30 minutes
Hail > ½ inch                                                          As potential warrants
Tornado/Funnel Cloud/Waterspout within 5 NM of AAFB complex            As potential warrants
   6.2.2. The following are examples of message text for weather watches:
       6.2.2.1. Lightning Watch: WEATHER WATCH
VALID 21/0134Z (21/1134L) TO 21/0534Z (21/1534L)
THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR LIGHTNING W/IN 5 NM OF THE ANDERSEN AFB
COMPLEX. A WARNING WILL BE ISSUED IF REQUIRED.
       6.2.2.2. Severe Wind Watch (Winds GTE 50 knots): WEATHER WATCH
VALID 21/0134Z (21/1134L) TO 21/1334Z (21/2334L)
THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR SURFACE WIND GUSTS TO GREATER THAN OR
EQUAL TO 50KTS AT ANDERSEN AFB. A WARNING WILL BE ISSUED IF REQUIRED.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                      29


   6.2.3. 17 OWS will not issue weather watches for winds 35-49 knots, heavy rain or snow,
   freezing precipitation, blizzard conditions, or sandstorms. AAFB leadership, as owner of the
   ORM process, has elected to tailor the criteria to the items in Table 6.1, above.
6.3. Forecast/Observed Weather Warnings. A special notice is provided when an established
weather condition is occurring or imminent and poses a threat to property or life. When a
weather warning is issued, customers must take immediate action in accordance with their
established weather checklists to safeguard property and lives. There are two types of weather
warnings: Observed warnings, which require no Desired Lead Time (DLT), and forecasted
warnings, which require a DLT.
   6.3.1. Weather warnings are issued IAW the guidance in AFI 10-229 and AFMAN 15-129
   and local requirements. 17 OWS will issue forecast weather warnings for Andersen AFB
   when the criteria defined in Table 6.2 occurs, or are expected to occur, within 5 NM of
   center of runway. The observed lightning warning is an exception; the warning area is 5nm
   around the entire AAFB Complex (AAFB, 36MXS munitions complex, Det 5 and Northwest
   Field). See attachment 14 for the warning area for AAFB complex. The Andersen
   forecaster will issue observed warnings as defined in Table 6.2 See attachment 6 for
   weather impacts on customers.

Table 6.2. Weather Warning Criteria and Associated Minimum Desired Lead-Times.
 Criteria                                                                    Desired Lead-
                                                                             Time

      6.3.2.3. Heavy Rain Warning (Heavy Rain GTE 4 inches in 6 hours):
FORECAST WEATHER WARNING
VALID 21/0133Z (21/1133L) TO 21/0333Z (21/0533L) HEAVY RAIN IS EXPECTED AT
ANDERSEN AFB WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF GREATER THAN 4 INCHES IN 6
HOURS.
      6.3.2.4. Lightning Warning:
OBSERVED WEATHER WARNING
VALID 21/0133Z (21/1133L) TO UFN (UFN)
LIGHTNING OBSERVED WITHIN 5 NM OF THE ANDERSEN AFB COMPLEX WITH AN
ESTIMATED DURATION TIL 0215Z (1215L).
   6.3.3. Weather warnings will:
      6.3.3.1. Not be issued if there is an unforecasted occurrence that has stopped and is not
      expected to reoccur.
      6.3.3.2. Be canceled or downgraded when the warning criteria is no longer expected to
      occur.
   6.3.4. Forecast weather warnings/watches with a specified lead-time will have a forecast
   valid period. A warning/watch may be canceled early or extended based on evaluation by the
   technician.
   6.3.5. Observed lightning weather warnings will be issued with an end time of ―Until Further
   Notice (UFN),‖ but the text will state an estimated duration time. Lightning warnings will be
   canceled when criteria are no longer observed IAW AFMAN 15-111.
   6.3.6. There will be at most one warning valid at any one time. If multiple criteria are valid,
   they will be encompassed into one warning to reduce the number of warnings valid at the
   same time. EXCEPTION: Observed lightning warning may be issued when other warnings
   are valid.
   6.3.7. 17 OWS will not issue weather warnings for, heavy snow, freezing precipitation,
   blizzard conditions, or sandstorms. AAFB leadership, as owner of the ORM process, has
   elected to tailor the criteria to the items in Table 6.2 above.
   6.3.8. If the WF evacuates its primary duty location, and is unable to provide observed
   weather warning support from its alternate location, 17 OWS will assume responsibility for
   observed weather warnings if the capability to METWATCH exists (e.g. the radar must be
   operational).
   6.3.9. OWS will issue all observed lightning warnings during hours the AAFB WF is closed
   on the condition the OWS is able to remotely access the AAFB lightning sensing equipment.
   During periods when the OWS cannot remotely access the AAFB lightning sensing
   equipment, the OWS can only provide a forecast weather watch for lightning.
6.4. Forecast/Observed Weather Advisories. Weather advisories (WAs) are special notices
provided to a supported agency when an established weather condition that could affect its
operation is occurring or is expected to occur. A dissemination diagram is contained in
Attachment 4. Forecast advisories are issued based on required lead-times. Observed
advisories are issued based on observation of advisory criteria.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                      31


   6.4.1. Forecast weather advisories (FWA) are issued IAW the guidance in AFMAN 15-129
   and local requirements. 17 OWS will issue forecast weather advisories for Andersen AFB
   when the criteria defined in Table 6.3 occur, or are expected to occur within 5 NM of center
   of runway. See attachment 6 for weather impacts on customers.

   6.4.2. The following is an example of message text for a FWA:
      6.4.2.1. Wind Advisory:
FORECAST WEATHER ADVISORY
VALID 21/0131Z (21/1131L) TO 21/1530Z (22/0130L)
SURFACE WIND GUSTS FROM 25-34 KNOTS ARE EXPECTED AT ANDERSEN AFB.
MAX WINDS EXPECTED ARE 28 KTS.
      6.4.2.2. FWA’s with a specific lead-time will have to include a forecast valid end time.
      An advisory may be cancelled early or extended based on evaluation by the technician.
   6.4.3. Observed weather advisories (OWA) will be issued by Andersen IAW the guidance in
   AFMAN 15-129 and local requirements when the criteria defined in Table 6.4 occur. For
   crosswinds and low-level convective shear, they are issued when observed within 5 NM of
   center of runway. For lightning occurring greater than 5 NM but less than 25 NM, issuance
   will occur when observed using a combination of lightning detection sensors and radar.
   Anytime a waterspout is observed outside of 5 NM of the AAFB complex, or reported by
   reliable personnel (Base Tower, Security Forces, Aircrew, etc.), a waterspout advisory will
   be issued. See attachment 6 for weather impacts on customers. Anytime a tornado, funnel
   cloud, or waterspout is within 5 NM of the AAFB complex, or reported by reliable personnel
   (Base Tower, Security Forces, Aircrew, etc.), a tornado warning will be issued.

VALID 21/0131Z (21/1131L) TO UFN (UFN)
LIGHTNING GREATER THAN 5 NM BUT LESS THAN 25 NM FROM AAFB HAS BEEN
OBSERVED..
       6.4.3.3. OWA’s with ―As Observed‖ listed lead-times will have UFN as a valid end time
       until cancelled. They will be terminated when criteria are no longer observed.
          6.4.3.3.1. Tornado, Funnel Cloud, or Waterspout Advisory outside of 5 NM of
          AAFB complex:
OBSERVED WEATHER ADVISORY
VALID 21/0131Z (21/1131L) TO UFN (UFN).
A WATERSPOUT HAS BEEN OBSERVED OUTSIDE OF 5 NM OF AAFB COMPLEX.
6.5. Dissemination of Forecast Weather Watches/Warnings/Advisories. The 17 OWS
Operations floor will disseminate forecast weather watches, warnings, and advisories via AFW
meteorological communications systems (i.e. N-TFS, IWWC). The 17 OWS will make key
agency confirmation calls to the Andersen forecaster and to the 36 WG Command Post for
forecast weather watches, warnings and advisories. The Andersen WF will issue observed
weather warnings and advisories via AFW meteorological communications systems (i.e. N-TFS).
The Andersen WF will make key agency confirmation calls to the 17 OWS, 36 OSS Airfield
Management and Air Traffic Control, and the 36 WG Command Post for observed weather
warnings and advisories. Watches/Warnings/Advisories are also posted to the 17 OWS website
on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.
   6.5.1. The dissemination diagram for weather watches, warnings, and advisories affecting
   AAFB is contained in attachment 4.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                      33


   6.5.2. AAFB WF may issue weather warnings for forecast phenomena when imminent
   weather conditions pose a hazard to life and property. AAFB WF will contact 17 OWS as
   soon as possible after local dissemination is made for 17 OWS to assume
   responsibility/accountability for the warning. If the WF leadership determines a forecast
   review is needed, then the review will be a collaborative effort led by the WF.
   6.5.3. Backup Dissemination Procedures.
      6.5.3.1. Confirmation calls by 17 OWS to the Andersen WF and the 36 WG Command
      Post, are used as backup in case N-TFS fails to electronically disseminate forecast
      weather watches, warnings and advisories.
      6.5.3.2. Confirmation calls by the Andersen WF to 17 OWS and 36 WG Command Post,
      are used as backup in case N-TFS fails to electronically disseminate observed warnings
      and advisories.
6.6. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The WF and 17 OWS will cooperatively
initiate and maintain a heightened meteorological watch and implement severe weather action
procedures IAW AFMAN 15-129 whenever a severe weather warning or watch is issued.
   6.6.1. Severe Weather at AAFB is defined as winds gusting to 50 knots or more, hail greater
   than or equal to ½ inch and tornadic activity. See attachment 6 for weather impacts on
   customers.
   6.6.2. When a severe weather watch or warning is issued, 17 OWS personnel will coordinate
   with AAFB WF on-duty forecaster for proper implementation of the following actions at
   AAFB WF:
      6.6.2.1. Recall the AAFB WF forecaster if the station is currently closed.
      6.6.2.2. Recommend additional forecaster assistance be recalled to augment the WF.
      6.6.2.3. Increase radar, METSAT, Lightning Detection System, METWATCH at WF.
      6.6.2.4. Increase Observational METWATCH at WF.
   6.6.3. When a severe weather watch or warning is issued 17 OWS personnel (Zone
   Supervisor) will:
      6.6.3.1. Inform the Lead Meteorologist.
      6.6.3.2. The Lead Meteorologist will determine which extra forecaster will provide
      assistance.
      6.6.3.3. The extra forecaster will man the radar and answer Tropics Forecast phones.
   6.6.3.4. The Tropics Forecaster will be the single POC for all information and decisions for
   the team. He/she will amend TAFs, conduct an intensified METWATCH, issue warnings
   and advisories as needed, and be the main interface with the AAFB WF.
   6.6.4. In case of unforeseen circumstances such as communications lines failure, a critical
   equipment outage at either the OWS or WF, etc., the WF is obligated to institute, at a
   minimum, actions defined in paragraph 6.6.2.1.
   6.6.5. When severe weather is forecasted to occur on Andersen AFB, the 17 OWS will
   contact the AAFB WF forecaster, who will initiate SWAP actions as soon as practical by
 34                                                               36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


   contacting the Flight Commander or NCOIC by phone or cell phone. The 17 OWS will
   contact the AAFB Flight Commander or NCOIC if unable to contact the duty forecaster.
   Phone numbers will be maintained in 17 OWS’ Tropics Forecaster Procedures. The 17 OWS
   and AAFB WF staff will review procedures/numbers on a quarterly basis.
   6.6.6. The WF and 17 OWS will conduct and document exercises of the SWAP procedures
   on an annual basis. An actual severe weather event can be documented instead of the review
   exercise.
   6.6.7. Post-severe weather event procedures will include a verbal review of the actions taken
   by the WF and OWS. This review will be held over a conference phone between the senior
   WF forecaster and the 17 OWS/WXR. If deemed necessary by the WF or OWS, or if
   damage occurs requiring an OPREP-3 report, a full forecast review will be accomplished
   IAW WF and OWS SOPs.
   6.6.8. AAFB will provide 17 OWS severe weather reports not normally available through
   standard observations.       These include reports from indigenous sources, local law
   enforcement, local news media, and unit personnel. These reports will be passed
   immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement (e.g. special or local weather
   observation). If this is not possible, then pass the reports as soon as possible, so the 17 OWS
   can use reports in post-analysis and verification. Pass reports to the 17 OWS Tropics
   Forecaster at DSN 449-8334.
6.7. Weather Watch/Warning/Advisory Numbering. 17 OWS and AAFB WF will issue
weather watches, warnings, and advisories using the N-TFS or IWWCs numbering convention.
The first two digits represent the current month and the following three digits represent the
number of the watch, warning, or advisory that month. All will be numbered sequentially and
independent of one another. Example: WW 07-011 would be the 11th warning issued during
July. WA 06-005 would be the 5th advisory issued during June. When IWWCS (Integrated
Weather Warning Control System) software is used by the 17th OWS, it will annotate an ―A‖
instead of ―0‖ as the first digit of the second group. Example: WW07-A11.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                     35

      altitude qualified, aircrew will fly no lower than the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for
      Special Use Airspace and Military Training Routes. Over the open ocean, crews will fly
      no lower than 500ft AGL. Flying these minimum altitudes is authorized only when
      conditions permit 3 nm visibility, operating clear of clouds and visual contact with the
      ground. Aircrew will comply with AFI 11-2B-52V3 low-altitude equipment restrictions
      and limitations.
      7.15.4.4. Length of Support.
          7.15.4.4.1. Section 7.15 of this document will be in effect until the deployed unit’s
          presence is removed from AAFB, or the terms in this document are significantly
          changed by future rotations and a complete revision is required. Other assigned
          rotational units with differing weather requirements or parameters (ex. Tankers,
          Fighters, B-2s, B-1s, etc.), will coordinate directly with the WF leadership for tailored
          weather support. This weather support will be formalized via a Memorandum/Letter
          of Agreement coordinated by the 36 OSS/CC.

      within 15 minutes after returning to duty if a METAR was not filed during the 15 min.
      Or, if augmenting observations after a period of AUTO observations, SPECI is not
      required.
A2.2. LOCAL Weather Observation Criteria.
   A2.2.1. LOCAL observations are used to disseminate information that does not need to be
   shared outside of the local area. They are issued when the automated system is being
   augmented for elements beyond its sensing capability or component(s) are not functioning.
      A2.2.1.1. Aircraft Mishap. During FMQ-19 augmentation and immediately following
      notification or sighting of an aircraft mishap at or near the station, unless there has been
      an intervening METAR or SPECI observation taken. These observations consist of
      elements normally included in a METAR observation.
      A2.2.1.2. Altimeter Setting. At an interval not to exceed 35 minutes, disseminate single
      element LOCAL when there has been a change of at least 0.01 Hg or more since the
      observation. Required for Tower and RAPCON. Pressure measured with backup
      equipment is annotated ALSTG/SLP ESTMD in the observation remarks.
      A2.2.1.3. Change in Runway. Following notification of a change in the runway in use,
      where the runway is dual-instrumented, weather sensors must be changed and allowed
      sufficient time to update with current information before taking the observation.
      A2.2.1.4. Any meteorological situation, which, in the opinion of the technician, is critical
      to the safety of aircraft operations.

       A3.2.1.1. If Andersen AFB loses base network connectivity, and/or access to N-TFS or
       the 17 OWS web site, the 17 OWS will fax selected weather products and information.
       The following list contains the minimum standard products suite the 17 OWS will
       provide the Andersen WF:
          A3.2.1.1.1. All Forecaster-in-the-Loop (FITL) graphics for the Andersen AFB local
          area, including the Horizontal Weather Depiction (HWD) and standard level analyses
          A3.2.1.1.2. All applicable hazard charts
          A3.2.1.1.3. Standard flight level winds
          A3.2.1.1.4. Local area TAF’s, to include PGUM, PGSN, PGRO, RODN, and RJTY
          A3.2.1.1.5. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
          A3.2.1.1.6. In addition to the standard products listed above, 17 OWS will provide
          other products as requested by the WF forecaster.
36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010                                                                      51


     A3.2.1.2. If the weather dissemination system and fax methods of dissemination are not
     operational, 17 OWS will verbally pass weather products and information to the
     Andersen WF.
A3.3. Andersen AFB WF Information, Products and Services Backup Dissemination
Procedures.
  A3.3.1. If the WF cannot transmit an airfield observation longline, or if network connectivity
  with the 17 OWS is lost, the AAFB WF will communicate all observations via telephone to
  17 OWS. The 17 OWS is available to enter observations into the Automated Weather
  Network database. Additionally, during periods of lost network connectivity with the 17
  OWS, the WF will disseminate the following products to the 17 OWS through whichever
  means available (i.e telephone or fax): Observed weather warnings/advisories,
  A3.3.2. For local back-up dissemination if the N-TFS is inoperative, WF products (i.e.
  observations, weather warnings, warnings, advisories) will be disseminated by phone in the
  following priority: ATC Tower, SOF, HSC-25 Ops Desk, Deployed Wx Ops Cell, AMOPS
  and 36 WG/CP; contacts will be logged on AF Form 3130. (Refer to attch7, paragraph
  A7.1.1. for local observation format)
  A3.3.2.1. If AAFB WF cannot produce or disseminate their tactical MEFs due to unforeseen
  (emergency) situations, then the WF will contact the OWS to coordinate MEF production
  and dissemination. This will minimize interruption of current customer MEF support
  provided by the WF.
A3.4. WF SUPPORT DURING OWS OUTAGES/EVACUATIONS.
  A3.4.1. Sources of Products and Services to AAFB WF.
     A3.4.1.1. The AAFB WF will assume responsibility for providing all weather support
     for AAFB in the event that 17 OWS operations are impaired due to lost communications,
     system failure, evacuation or any termination of service at Hickam AFB.
     A3.4.1.2. The WF will retain this responsibility until such time that 17 OWS is ready to
     reassume its weather responsibilities role for the AAFB WF after activation of its
     alternate location.
  A3.4.2. AAFB WF-Required Products and Services.
     A3.4.2.1. 17 OWS will provide all forecast products listed in paragraph A3.2.1.1 from its
     alternate location. In addition, 17 OWS will produce regional graphic charts listed
     below:
     A3.4.2.2. All Forecaster-in-the-Loop (FITL) graphics for the Andersen AFB local area,
     including the HWD, standard level analyses, all applicable hazard charts and standard
     flight level winds. Generation of these products may be significantly delayed due to
     limited processing capability and bandwidth at the alternate location.
  A3.4.3. The primary method to disseminate products listed in paragraph A3.2.1.1 will be via
  N-TFS and 17 OWS website (http). The backup method for dissemination for both types of
  products will be via facsimile.
A3.5. 17 OWS SUPPORT DURING WF OUTAGES/EVACUATIONS.
52                                                             36WGI15-101 28 MAY 2010


  A3.5.1. Sources of Products and Services to 17 OWS.
     A3.5.1.1. The 17 OWS will reassume responsibility for providing all weather support for
     AAFB in the event that the WF’s operations are impaired due to lost communications,
     system failure, evacuation or any termination of service at Andersen AFB.
     A3.5.1.2. The 17 OWS will retain this responsibility until such time that the WF is ready
     to reassume its weather responsibilities role for AAFB, either after activation of its
     alternate location or resumption of normal operating services at the primary WF location.
     A3.5.1.3. The 17 OWS will provide back-up products and services to AAFB customers
     according to the three-tiered order as outlined in AFM 15-129, Table 1.1:




  A3.5.2. 17 OWS-Required Products and Services.
     A3.5.2.1. The WF will provide copies of the latest MEF, SOPs, Bomber PTOBs and
     Bomber planning weather packages to the 17 OWS via the WF’s local web page hosted
     by the 17 OWS. Additionally, the WF will send soft copies of these products to the 17
     OWS to keep as back-up.
     A3.5.2.2. The 17 OWS will produce AAFB MEF(s) and MEF related products IAW WF
     SOPs and disseminate to the WF via fax and/or post to the 17 OWS web page (if network
     is working) until such time the WF is able to resume operations.
     A3.5.2.3. In addition to above, 17 OWS will provide back-up support as described in
     A3.2 and A3.3.

   WEATHER IMPACTS TO AIR OPERATIONS, AIRCRAFT LIMITATIONS AND
      THRESHOLDS/SENSITIVITIES AND SPACE WEATHER IMPACTS

A7.1. General Impacts on Air Operations:
   A7.1.1. Ceiling/Cloud and Sky Cover: Limits operations requiring aircraft clear of clouds.
   May preclude landings or increase danger in takeoffs and landings. May preclude bombing
   missions, rescue operations, UAV flights, etc.
   A7.1.2. Visibility: Affects landing and takeoff capabilities, and reconnaissance and target
   acquisition. Affects reconnaissance and target acquisition. Low visibility increases flight
   hazards. Affects target designation and terminally guided munitions.
   A7.1.3. Electrical Storms and Thunder: Hazardous to in-flight operations. Hazardous to
   refueling operations. Hazardous to rearming operations.
   A7.1.4. Precipitation: Affects visibility and safety of flight. Affects density altitude by the
   change in temperature when it rains.
   A7.1.5. Icing: Affects aerodynamics of aircraft.       Any intensity of icing can preclude
   aviation operations.
   A7.1.6. State-Of-The-Ground: Impacts effectiveness of aerial delivered munitions.
   A7.1.7. Turbulence:    Affects reconnaissance and surveillance--shear affects systems
   performance. May cause aircraft structural damage. May affect aircraft control. Severe
   turbulence may cancel operations.
   A7.1.8. Wind (Surface): Affects aircraft control near the ground. Affects landing and
   takeoff, and ground speed for low-level flights.
   A7.1.9. Wind (Aloft): Affects navigation, and ground speed at higher flight altitudes.
   A7.1.10. Density Altitude: Affects lift capabilities and reciprocating engine performance.
   Limits fuel and weapons load.
   A7.1.11. Pressure Altitude: Affects reciprocating engine performance.
   A7.1.12. Temperature (Surface): High temperatures reduce lift capabilities. Cold
   temperatures increase maintenance requirements and time to perform. Reduces personnel
   carried due to weight and bulk of protection gear.
   A7.1.13. Dew point: Affects engine efficiency calculations. Serves as warning of possible
   fog formation or icing conditions.
   A7.1.14. Illumination: Affects operations using night vision devices.

A7.2. Space Weather Impacts: Types of communications used during missions should be
considered as well as knowing critical thresholds for space weather and its effects on these
communication systems. Aircrews need to know when HF/UHF communications might be
degraded or interrupted by solar activity. This allows crews to be proactive and prepared for
possible outages of critical communication equipment. Provided below are space weather
impact tables with specific systems and potential impacts listed. If the customer has a unique
space weather requirement, WF will request assistance from AFWA or supporting OWS for any
identified requirements which cannot be satisfied by current suite of space weather products.

                 TAF SPECIFICATION AND AMENDMENT CRITERIA.

A9.1. Specification Criteria. The elements in the TAF will be specified IAW the guidance in
AFMAN 15-129 and general flight rules stated in AFI 11-202 Vol. 3. 17 OWS will issue the
TAF using the criteria listed in Table A9.1

Table A9.1. AAFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Specification Criteria.
 Forecast Element/Occurrence          TAF Specification Criteria
 Ceiling observed or later expected   3,000 feet
 to decrease to less than, or if      1,000 feet
 below, increase to equal or          800 feet
 exceed:                              700 feet
                                      500 feet
                                      200 feet
 Prevailing visibility observed or    3 miles
 later expected to decrease to less   2 miles
 than, or if below, increase to       1 mile
 equal or exceed:                     1/2 mile
 Surface Winds                        Speed change of > 10 knots and/or the difference between
                                      the observed gust is > 10 knots from the forecast gust.

                                      Direction change > 30 degrees when the predominant wind
                                      speed or gusts are expected to be over 15 knots.
 Icing, not associated with           The beginning or ending of icing first meets, exceeds, or
 thunderstorms, from the surface      decreases below moderate or greater thresholds and was not
 to 10,000 feet AGL                   specified in the forecast.
 Turbulence (for Cat II aircraft),    The beginning or ending of turbulence first meets, exceeds,
 not associated with                  or decreases below moderate or greater thresholds (for CAT
 thunderstorms, from the surface      II aircraft) and was not specified in the forecast.

 Non-convective low level wind        Begins or ends.
 shear
 Thunderstorms                        Begins or ends.
 Weather Warning criteria and/or      A forecast weather warning and/or advisory has been issued
 Weather Advisory criteria            (ensures consistency between forecast weather warnings
                                      and/or advisories and the TAF).
   A9.1.1. Deviations from standard Air Force Weather Criteria. The ceiling/visibility
   categories for support of various airframes periodically deployed to Andersen AFB are
   different from the Air Force Weather standard. Andersen AFB WF needs ceiling thresholds
   of 800, 700, 500, and visibility threshold of 1 SM in its TAF specification criteria. Low
   Level Wind Shear (LLWS) also presents a significant hazard to the various airframes
   periodically deployed to Andersen AFB, which is why LLWS has been added to the TAF
   specification criteria as well.

A9.2. Forecast Amendments. 17 OWS will ensure the TAF is representative of expected or
actual conditions. 17 OWS forecasters may amend the TAF anytime they consider it advisable
in the interest of safety, efficiency of aircraft operations, flight planning, operational control, or
in-flight assistance to aircraft to ensure the forecast is representative of actual or expected
conditions. As a minimum, the elements in the TAF will be amended IAW the guidance in
AFMAN 15-129 and general flight rules stated in AFI 11-203 Vol. 3. The 17 OWS will amend
the TAF IAW the list in Table 8.2
   A9.2.1. Anytime an unforecasted change occurs, is expected to occur or is expected to last
   more than 59 minutes and is not correctly forecast by the next whole hour from the time of
   occurrence. (e.g., if the time is 2147Z, the next whole hour is 2200Z).
   A9.2.2. Anytime a forecast condition does not occur by the specified hour and is not
   expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
   A9.2.3. Anytime a temporary (TEMPO) group becomes predominant or is not expected to
   occur.
A9.3. Amendment Criteria.
   A9.3.1. At a minimum, the 17 OWS will amend the TAF IAW Table 8.2

Table A9.2. AAFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Amendment Criteria.

A11.1. PIREPs are weather observations from airborne or recently landed aircraft concerning in-
flight conditions. They are obtained from flight crews via PMSV or relayed from the CP/ATC.
Significant PIREPs will be disseminated both locally and longline. Significant PIREPs are
reports issued whenever the criteria listed below the example exist within the local flying area
(200NM of AAFB). They will contain at least the type report, location, time, flight level, type of
aircraft and at least one other element.

                       MISSION EXECUTION FORECASTS (MEF)

A15.1. MEF Specification Criteria
   A15.1.1. Specification criteria is a rule set based on mission limiting thresholds for each
   airframe. The purpose of using the criteria is to inform mission planners and decision makers
   of potential weather limiting factors that may occur during the mission window.
   Specification criteria are only used in the initial writing of the MEF. Any necessary changes
   after publication are dealt with using Amendment criteria.
   A15.1.2. Specification criteria for the Bomber MEF are dependent on the airframes deployed
   to AAFB at the time. Thus, the Bomber MEF will use the SPECI criteria listed in
   Attachment 2 and the Mission-Limiting Thresholds in Attachment 7.
   A15.1.3. Specification criteria for the Airfield MEF (AMEF) are as follows:
       A15.1.3.1. Ceilings
          A15.1.3.1.1. 3000 feet
          A15.1.3.1.2. 1500 feet
          A15.1.3.1.3. 200 feet
       A15.1.3.2. Visibility
          A15.1.3.2.1. 3 miles
          A15.1.3.2.2. 1/2 mile
       A15.1.3.3. Combined Seas
          A15.1.3.3.1. 10 feet
          A15.1.3.3.2. 12 feet
       A15.1.3.4. Space Weather
          A15.1.3.4.1. Minor Communications/Targeting Errors
          A15.1.3.4.2. Severe Communications/Targeting Errors
       A15.1.3.5. Crosswinds
          A15.1.3.5.1. 15 knots
          A15.1.3.5.2. 25 knots
A15.2. MEF Amendment Criteria
   A15.2.1. Amendment criteria is a rule set using ORM and tailored based on mission
   parameters to update mission planners on previously un-forecasted parameters that, presently
   or in the future, will affect the mission. The MEF is corrected to account for this criteria and
   resubmitted to the mission planners.

   A15.2.2. Amendment criteria for the Bomber MEF are dependent on the airframes deployed
   to AAFB at the time. Thus, the Bomber MEF will use the SPECI criteria listed in
   Attachment 2 and the Mission-Limiting Thresholds in Attachment 7.
   A15.2.3. Amendment criteria for the Airfield MEF are the same as the specification criteria.
   Any un-forecasted change where the conditions are worse than forecast, will drive the
   forecaster to amend the AMEF.
