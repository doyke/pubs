Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to report Fraud, Waste, and Abuse,
mismanagement, a violation of any Air Force instruction, an injustice, deficiency, or like
condition, to a superior or commander in the chain of command, to an Inspector General (IG) or
other appropriate inspector, or within established grievance channel. (Complainants should
understand they are submitting official statements within official command channels.
Accordingly, they remain subject to punitive action for intentional submission of false
statements).

Although complainants have a right to file an IG complaint at any level without first notifying or
following the chain of command, they are encouraged to use the chain of command to resolve
issues whenever possible before entering the IG system. The supervisory chain of command can
often resolve complaints more quickly and effectively. The IG system should be used when
referral to the command chain would be futile or there is fear of reprisal.

The IG Complaints Program does not usually handle matters that are covered by other Air Force
instructions, directives or agencies. Below are a few such matters; however, the list is not all-
inclusive:
Appeal of OPR/EPR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . AFI 36-2401 (Military Personnel Flight)
