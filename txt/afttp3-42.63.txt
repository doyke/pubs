                                            MISSION

1.1. AFSOC Medical Mission Statement. Deploy with and in support of (ISO) Special
Operations Forces (SOF) in order to (IOT) deliver SOF combat medical support and to
modernize and advance SOF medical capabilities, medical technologies IOT maximize war-
fighter performance. Provide high quality, state-of-the-art prevention-based health care for Air
Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) members, families and beneficiaries.

1.2. AFSOC Medical Capabilities. AFSOC medics provide a comprehensive medical platform
for SOF personnel across the health care continuum--prevention through intervention and
rehabilitation. SOF medics ensure deployable AFSOC forces via the employment of AFSOC
medical unit type codes (UTCs). AFSOC medics deploy with SOF IOT provide preventive
healthcare, routine healthcare, urgent/emergent point-of-injury trauma care, forward
resuscitative/stabilization surgery, intensive care, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) and critical
care casualty evacuation. Additionally, SOF medics provide medical support for humanitarian
operations, noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), civil affairs (CA) missions, irregular
warfare (IW), unconventional warfare (UW) missions, foreign internal defense (FID) missions,
healthcare engagement, healthcare capacity building and health care infrastructure development
capabilities ISO counterinsurgency (COIN) operations, stability/security operations, and medical
support for other unique US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) missions/taskings.

1.3. The Challenge of AFSOC Medicine. Provide the highest quality healthcare/health service
support for AFSOC and joint special operations forces, frequently without the benefit of
additional pillars of health services support, and often without the benefit of fully developed
traditional echelons of care in areas of significantly higher medical and operational threat/risk.

1.4. SOF Aerospace and Operational Physiology Team (AOPT) Mission.
The primary mission of SOF AOP is to fly in support of High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support
(HAAMS) operations, determine employment of the EEHS, enhance human operational
performance through analyses of SOF facilities and operations, provide critical aircrew training,
and support mishap prevention and investigation efforts.

2.1. Purpose. This document describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures for UTCs
FFQE5, SOF AOPT, and FFQEP, SOF AOP Equipment. IAW AFI 11-409, HAAMS personnel
are specially trained Aerospace and Operational Physiologists (43A3) and Physiology
Technicians (PTs) (4M0X1). PTs provide in-flight physiological support to aircrews performing
unpressurized airdrop operations at 20,000 feet MSL and above (or upon aircraft commander’s
request). These airdrops could be, but are not limited to: DoD Special Operations High Altitude
Low Opening (HALO)/High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) personnel and equipment drops,
MISO, equipment testing and research operations, and humanitarian aid operations. Any
unpressurized airdrop missions at 20,000 feet MSL and above require Air Force HAAMS
trained/certified PTs IAW AFI 11-409, AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program,
AFI 11-2C-17V1, C-17 Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2C-17V3, C-17 Operations Procedures, AFI
11-2C-130V1, C-130 Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2C-130V3, C-130 Operations Procedures, and
Army FM 3-05.211, Military Free-fall Parachuting Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. SOF
AOP personnel are also responsible for evaluation and employment of the emergency evacuation
hyperbaric stretcher (EEHS). The EEHS allows for the evacuation and treatment of individuals
suffering from decompression sickness or acute mountain sickness. SOF AOP teams assist the
treating physician with the operation of the EEHS during treatment and transportation of the
patient in the EEHS. SOF AOP teams conduct human performance (HP) analyses at SOF
locations, provide critical aircrew training, support mishap prevention and investigation efforts,
and make recommendations to deployed commanders to improve performance enhancement and
sustainment efforts.

2.2. Background. The SOF operations tempo and diverse operating locations makes it
necessary to enhance the physiological and performance mission support. SOF AOP teams are
specially trained and equipped to understand, assess and implement performance enhancement
and sustainment measures required by SOF operations. The HAAMS Program has been in
existence for well over forty years and its technicians have successfully provided high altitude
physiological and technical support from the Vietnam War to our most recent conflicts in
Operation Enduring Freedom.

2.3.6. SOF AOP NCO. The SOF AOP NCO receives and reviews non-contingency standard
mission requests from the Wing Plans office (SOW/XP) via USSOCOM Form 111 and AFSOC
4M0X1Consultant for AOP. The AOP NCO coordinates Aeronautical Orders with Aviation
Records Management Office (Flight Records) for PTs upon receipt of tasking letter. He/she
ensures individual team members have appropriate flight equipment, line badges, passports,
approved standardized paperwork, and oxygen equipment needed to perform mission. The AOP
NCO provides input to unit budget for HAAMS and forecasts annual man-months requirements
to the AFSOC 4M0X1 Consultant for AOP. When deployed, duties include facilitating all
aspects of HAAMS operations, performing in-flight PT duties, evaluating employment, and
replacing of EEHS units, and performing HP threat assessments. These NCOs must meet or
exceed the qualification and training requirements of a Primary PT and be in the grade of Staff
Sergeant (E-5) or higher

2.3.7. Primary PT. The Primary PT coordinates mission-specific requirements with aircrew
and/or parachutists prior to HAAMS operations. They brief aircrew and additional personnel
prior to first mission on physiological considerations, the importance of proper oxygen discipline
and pre-breathing, and other human factors using the HAAMS Briefing Guide (Attachment 2).
They advise the aircraft commander and crew on use of oxygen equipment, depressurization
schedules, and preflight supplemental oxygen equipment. They advise and assist loadmasters in
loading, positioning, and securing mission-specific oxygen equipment. The PT flight duty
station will be required to monitor crewmembers, additional personnel, and oxygen equipment.
A minimum of one PT will be on interphone at all times. They will monitor and record pre-
breathing times and exposure times at or above 10,000 ft, 20,000 ft, and peak altitude on trip
report. They advise aircraft commander and/or jumpmaster and manage the disposition of any
in-flight or post-flight physiological incident until relieved by Flight Surgeon or appropriate
medical personnel. All physiological incidents will be reported to the appropriate safety agency
and into the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) IAW AFMAN 91-223 and AFI 91-
204. They acquire copy of AFTO Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document,
signed by the aircraft commander, for each sortie flown.

2.3.8. Deployed Commander. Depending on the contingency, the deployed SOF AOP team
will work directly or indirectly for the Air Force Air Operations Commander in the Area of
Responsibility (AOR). When possible, the deployed commander will provide the necessary
resources to establish HAAMS Operations in the AOR. If the contingency requires long term
sustainment, HAAMS Operations should be located at an established military location for
logistical support. Coordinate and report physiological events (i.e. DCS) to the appropriate
safety agency IAW AFMAN 91-223.

2.4. Threats. The tactical advantage of conducting airdrop operations at high altitudes is that it
minimizes potential attacks from ground launched ordinances and/or enemy combatant forces
and improves overall mission flight safety. Deployed PTs are uniquely trained to ensure optimal
safety of aircrew, parachutists, and other passengers are observed during unpressurized high
altitude operations.

3.1. SOF Aerospace and Operational Physiology Team Equipment Capability and Tasks.
The primary mission of SOF AOP is to fly in support of High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support
(HAAMS) operations, determine employment of the EEHS, enhance human operational
performance through analyses of SOF facilities and operations, provide critical aircrew training,
and support mishap prevention and investigation efforts. This mission includes delivery of pre-
flight briefings on the physiological/physical hazards of the mission, pre-breathing procedures,
effects of environmental stresses, proper use of in-flight supplemental oxygen equipment, and
any other special physiological considerations depending on the mission profile to all aircrew,
parachutists, and additional passengers prior to mission. PTs monitor aircrew, parachutists, and
additional passengers during mission and manage in-flight physiological reactions until relieved
by flight surgeon. PTs advise aircraft command and jumpmaster on safe decompression
schedules, altitude and time restrictions, and the disposition of in-flight decompression sickness
reactors requiring hyperbaric treatment. PTs also advise and assist aircrew and jumpmasters on
aircraft high altitude operation equipment rigging and in-flight operation/monitoring of
supplemental oxygen consoles and aircrew/parachutists' portable oxygen equipment. SOF PTs
advise on the operational need for and coordinate the employment of the EEHS. PTs provide all
recurrent training pertaining to the EEHS IAW AFSOCI 48-112, Decompression Sickness
Treatment Program.

                                         OPERATIONS

4.1. Introduction. The Air Force Surgeon General’s Office provides medical, technical, fiscal,
and administrative supervision needed to carry out the HAAMS Program to ensure peacetime
HAAMS operations produce highly qualified and skilled PTs to support world-wide
contingencies. This program applies to active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air
National Guard personnel on flying status, passengers in certain types of aircraft, and other
personnel who perform high altitude airdrop missions. During contingency operations, HAAMS
operations are considered any Joint Airborne/Air Transportability (JA/ATT) mission, Special
Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM), or other flight operation that involves the use of PTs or
AOPs to support unpressurized aircraft flight, to include HALO/HAHO personnel and equipment
drops, equipment testing and research, humanitarian aid operations, and MISO. Use of the
EEHS by the USAF has only recently been utilized. The EEHS can be used to treat and
transport aircrew and personnel with diagnoses such as decompression sickness, acute mountain
sickness, and carbon monoxide poisoning. SOF PTs are AFSOC’s EEHS experts and trainers.
SOF PTs will assist the treating physician with operations of the EEHS during treatments and
transportation of patients. SOF PTs are well trained in human factors affecting the SOF
community and can assist commanders in optimizing factors such as the physical layout of
facilities, coordinating personnel schedules, and determining nutritional and fitness strategies to
enhance or preserve performance of deployed personnel.

4.2. Employment. High altitude personnel and equipment airdrop procedures may be employed
during clandestine operations or in areas where small arms threats preclude conventional low-
altitude deliveries. Airdrops above 3,000 feet above ground level (AGL) are considered high
altitude drops. Only personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training
described in AFI 11-403 are permitted on mission aircraft for unpressurized operations above
10,000 feet MSL. At least one SOF PT is required per 16 personnel, or as required by mission
design series (MDS)-specific instructions, for all unpressurized high altitude missions conducted
at or above 20,000 feet MSL. It is recommended that at least two PTs be assigned to each
mission, at least one of which must be a primary PT. PTs also may support high altitude airdrop
missions below 20,000 feet MSL, when requested by an air tasking order, the aircrew, or the
responsible user’s operations mission planner. All HAAMS operations will be conducted IAW
AFI 11-409. The EEHS is relatively small and can be positioned at forward operating locations
where the threat of DCS or AMS are most likely. Use of and personnel qualifications must be
IAW AFSOCI 48-112. SOF PTs can be employed at any SOF operating location to assess for
HP optimization and provide input to the deployed location on mechanisms and strategies for HP
enhancement and sustainment.

4.3. Mission Planning and Coordination.

4.3.1. Preliminary Planning and Coordination. Have current regulations, instructions, and
briefing guide for review.




                                                                                                  9
4.3.2. Prior to First Mission Sortie. PTs will be placed on operational support aeronautical
orders and receive required intelligence threat briefings based on mission. PTs will brief and
coordinate procedures for transfer of reactors to hyperbaric facility. Brief Aircrew Commander
and OIC/NCOIC user group on handling procedures of in flight equipment and medical
emergencies (e.g. transfer of reactors to hyperbaric facility) using the briefing guide in
attachment 2, brief both flight crew and user group prior to any drop at or above 20,000 feet
MSL.

4.3.3. During Mission Sorties. The PTs will provide adequate support to crew and jumpers
during flight(s). Maintain oxygen discipline and monitor and record times and altitudes to which
crew and jumpers were exposed.

4.3.4. Post Mission. The team leader is responsible for accomplishing post-mission checklist
and briefs other HAAMS members on overall mission.

4.3.5. Mission Folder. All HAAMS PTs will maintain a mission folder which will contain, at a
minimum, the following items: Current AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order (PA) Aviation
Service, AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying for Special Operational Duty;
AF Form AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record or AF Form 1274,
Physiological Training; AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document (blank); AFI

                               ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

5.1. Command and Control. When activated, SOF PTs will report directly to the Air
Operations Center for specific guidance on how they can support the high altitude operation.
OPCON, ADCON, and TACON, should be addressed in operational planning process

5.2. Intelligence Support. SOF AOP personnel can perform site surveys and gather medical
intelligence information for operational deployments when required. SOF PTs submit medical
intelligence reports to HQ AFSOC/SG for review and forwarding to the National Center for
Medical Intelligence (NCMI) and other pertinent agencies as required.

5.3. Communications/Information Systems Support. A landline (telephone), secure telephone
instrument (STI), or radio must be supplied to facilitate communication between the PTs and the
primary flying organization requesting high altitude airdrop support. The ranking PT and/or
HLO should have access to a Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNET) account and secure
telephone equipment to facilitate communication.

5.4. Integration/Interoperability with Other Systems. The PTs and HLO integrate directly
with the organization supporting high altitude operations and are considered additional aircrew
members.

5.5. Training. All PT and HLO training requirements are outlined in AFI 11-409, AFI 11-403,
AFSOCI 48-101, and AFSOCI 48-112.

5.6. Logistics. Depending on the contingency, FFQEP will be deployed to provide necessary
logistical support and sustainment. SOF AOPT will need to coordinate local procurement of
aviator's oxygen, compressed air and medical supplies with host medical treatment facility.

5.7. SOF AOP Mission Essential Task Lists (METLS). SOF AOP METLS are listed in
Attachment 3.

                                  HAAMS BRIEFING GUIDE

A2.1. This briefing will be given to all personnel participating in any unpressurized airdrop
operations conducted at or above 20,000 feet MSL, prior to the first sortie flown. Additional
briefings will be given, as required, for new personnel not briefed previously and during
extended missions for refresher purposes. PTs also should brief personnel on any special interest
items or problem areas which may impact the mission.

A2.2. All personnel on any flight during which cabin altitude will exceed 10,000 MSL will be
current in physiological training. Check for currency by questioning personnel, insuring that any
untrained personnel are not allowed on the mission/sortie.

A2.3. Ensure all personnel have the proper oxygen equipment available. Proper equipment
includes helmet with mask or strap-harness assembly; Quick-Don assemblies are not authorized.

heat load on both aircrew and jumpers, conserves oxygen versus starting at ground level prior to
take-off A2.10.4. Coordinate P/B completion with the 10 or 20 minute warning (attempt to
minimize time at altitude and on oxygen)
A2.10.5. Keep cargo compartment as comfortable as possible in regards to temperature
A2.10.6. Upon completion of P/B, cabin depressurization rate will not exceed 3,000 feet/min

A2.11. Oxygen discipline:
A2.11.1. Eyes must be kept open at all times. No sleeping while on oxygen.
A2.11.2. If having problems, do not break mask seal or remove mask unless absolutely necessary
- Notify PT/Oxygen Technician of problem
A2.11.3. If P/B is broken - (See paragraph 2.4. for guidance)
A2.11.4. If applicable, explain procedures for changing bad mask, oxygen bottle, etc....
A2.11.5. On descent, remain on oxygen until below 10,000 feet MSL (Helps prevent low grade
hypoxia)
A2.11.6. Jumpers not required to be on oxygen between 10,000 feet and 13,000 feet MSL as
long as exposure does not exceed 30 minutes (above 13,000 feet MSL must use oxygen)

                                                                                                 15
A2.12. Factors limiting effective denitrogenation:
A2.12.1. Body positions that limit good circulation i.e. crossed legs, etc....
A2.12.2. Equipment straps and clothing that limit good circulation
A2.12.3. Cold temperatures may cause decreased blood flow to extremities
A2.12.4. Dehydration - decreased blood fluid base (avoid carbonated/alcoholic beverages - drink
plenty of water!)
A2.12.5. Disconnecting from oxygen console or aircraft regulator
A2.12.6. Moving regulator automix lever from 100% to normal
A2.12.7. Breaking mask seal

A2.16.3. Follow all other ground egress training procedures as briefed during pre-flight



                                                                                                 16
A2.17. Physiological incidents:
A2.17.1. Evaluate situation and advise the jumpmaster and/or aircraft commander on best course
of action
A2.17.2. If reaction is suspected DCS:
A2.17.2.1. Immobilize effected area of individual (if applicable, place individual in horizontal
position)
A2.17.2.2. Administer 100% oxygen via aviators mask (don’t use same mask individual used for
operation)
A2.17.2.3. Cabin altitude to sea level or field elevation of evacuation site as soon as possible
