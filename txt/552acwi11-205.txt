written waivers with this instruction IAW AFI 33-360, Volume 1.
1.4. System Description.
   1.4.1. MSLITE Program. The MSLITE program provides a means to supplement AWACS
   and CRC mission crew training. MSLITE provides a capability to use the Joint Surveillance
   System (JSS) radar, Identification Friend/Foe (IFF), and radio networks shared by the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and North America Aerospace Defense Command
   (NORAD) to conduct live training events.
   1.4.2. CRC MTC. The CRC MTC provides operations training, system integration and
   testing, as well as a platform for future “Proof of Concept” CRC operational uses. The CRC
   MTC will allow CRC operators to obtain up to 50% of their ready aircrew program (RAP)
   and continuation training (CT) requirements in accordance with the ACC RAP Tasking
   Memorandum and AFI 13-1 CRC Volume 1. Additionally, 552 ACG personnel will be able
   to perform functional tests of developed software changes prior to Combat Air Force (CAF)
   fielding. The CRC MTC utilizes the JSS radar, IFF, and radio networks shared by the FAA
   and NORAD.
   1.4.3. Sensor Data.
       1.4.3.1. Radar and IFF sensor data are fed from selected JSS radar site(s) and are
       networked at the Air Defense Sectors.
       1.4.3.2. The sensor data is forwarded to the 552 ACW Patch and Test Facility via the
       Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and routed to the Sensis box, Advanced
       Simulation Inter-face Buffer (ASIB), or Multi Source Correlator Tracker (MSCT) to
       interface with the designated mission system.
       1.4.3.3. Four facilities can accommodate MSLITE operations: AWACS Legacy Mission
       Simulators (MSIM), Facility for Interoperability Testing (FIT), OG MTC and the CRC
       MTC.

    1.4.4. Communications.
       1.4.4.1. Voice radio communications for fighter control are provided through NORAD
       Ground Air Transmitter Receiver (GATR) sites as coordinated with the appropriate
       NORAD Air Defense Sectors. The communications are routed into the 552 ACW Patch
       and Test Facility via DISN. They are forwarded to the General Dynamics provided
       Communications System, to the Simulation Communication Switch (SCS), and then into
       the FIT, MSIM, OG MTC or the CRC MTC to control aircraft.
       1.4.4.2. Phones are available in the facilities for technical coordination among the CRC
       MTC, FIT, MSIM OG MTC, 552 ACNS/SCOI communications, 552 ACNS/SCOM sim
       maintenance and the Air Defense Sector.
       1.4.4.3. Direct communications with FAA Air Route Traffic Control Centers or military
       Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies are on dedicated shout-down lines routed to consoles
       via Direct Access Channels (DACs).

                                 MISSION OPERATIONS

5.1. System setup. MCs will begin system setup and check out no later than 90 minutes prior to
activity start time. 552 OG setup will be IAW MSLITE Mission Coordinator Ready Reference.
CRC MTC setup will be IAW unit SOPs.
   5.1.1. (552 OG only) Unless replaced by civilian or contract position, squadron CDMTs
   will start system initialization NLT 90 minutes prior to activity start time. After the MC
   verifies the system is configured correctly for operations, the CDMT will need concurrence
   from the Mission Supervisor to perform any manual system interrupts or “restarts”.
   5.1.2. The MS/CRC MCC/SRO must approve continued operations of malfunctioning
   equipment that could potentially affect the mission. The MS/CRC MCC/SRO will evaluate
   the impact of using degraded equipment against the mission tasking and the inability to meet
   that tasking. The MS/CRC MCC/SRO will coordinate system maintenance requests through
   the Mission Coordinator/552 ACNS.
   5.1.3. If system or equipment malfunctions are significantly hampering mission task, the
   MS/ CRC MCC/SRO will discuss mission cancellation considerations with the respective
   squadron’s operations supervisor.             Squadron operations officers, or designated
   representatives, are the decision authority for mission cancellations.
   5.1.4. The crew will be on position NLT one hour prior to airspace time. Military Radar
   Unit (MRU) and Tactical Monitor (TM) operations will be IAW procedures outlined in the
   applicable Letter of Agreement (LOA) and FAA Order JO 7610.4, Special Operations.
   5.1.5. The MC/CRC MCC/SRO will ops check the UHF Guard (243.0 MHz) frequency and
   monitor the frequency while aircraft are under contol.
5.2. Execution.
   5.2.1. All missions that involve control of live airborne assets will have voice and data
   recorded. The MC will enable recording or prompt the squadron-assigned CDMT to enable
   data recording. For accurate data playback, the computer systems will be intialized with
   accurate GMT Zulu time. The AWACS Patch and Test Facility has the ability to record
   voice data.
5.3. Cancellations.
   5.3.1. Supervisors may recommend mission cancellation if mission profile does not support
   crew training requirements per Mission Design Series (MDS) AFI or syllabus.
       5.3.1.1. For E-3 Initial Qualification Training (IQT), the mission does not meet syllabus
       standards or would be negative training.
       5.3.1.2. For CT, the mission does not provide creditable RAP training IAW MDS
       specific Volume 1 and current fiscal RAP Tasking Message.
   5.3.2. If aircraft are already under control, i.e. accepted flight transfer from ATC, the
   supervisor will coordinate with flight lead and ATC for fighter autonomous operations, or as
   permited by LOA.
552ACWI11-205 19 MARCH 2014                                                                  13


   5.3.3. Advise the appropriate Air Defense Sector, ATC agency, and MC if the mission
   cancels prior to scheduled airspace time, if the mission changes airspace, the mission timing
   changes, or of any emergency transmissions received requesting sector assistance. The MS
   will call 552 OSS/OSOS and their squadron’s Operations Officer, or designated
   respresentative, to notify them of mission changes prior to leaving the respective control
   facility.
5.4. Post Mission. The MS/CRC MCC/SRO will fill out a mission summary (552 OG Form
49A, DMO/MSLITE Mission Tasking & Summary or AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log) with all
pertinent information regarding training effectiveness and mission deviations. This mission
summary is critical to brief the wing leadership at wing standup the day following the mission
and is essential to formulate effective lessons learned.
