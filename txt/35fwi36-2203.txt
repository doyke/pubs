        1.1.2. The flag security detail and honor flight will be posted in position at the flagstaff
        for the retreat ceremony in front of building 507, Wing Headquarters at 1620. The
        protocol procedures are found at paragraph 1.2. Utility uniform or equivalent is required
        unless otherwise directed or approved by the Command Chief.
        1.1.3. Three times each year, base-wide formal retreat ceremonies will be held to present
        proper military respect for Memorial Day, Patriot Day (11 September Memorial) and
        POW-MIA Day. Each military service will be equitably represented at the ceremony.
        Unit taskings and other specific requirements will be forwarded from the assigned project
        officer one month prior to the ceremony.
            1.1.3.1. For the Memorial Day ceremony each group, to include 373 ISRG and NAF,

35FWI36-2203 25 JULY 2011                                                                     3


     1.2.1. No later than 1620, the flag security detail and the honor flight will be formed and
     dressed, positioning themselves facing the flagstaff.
     1.2.2. As soon as the honor flight is positioned, the honor flight commander commands
     “Flight ATTENTION,” then “Parade REST.” The commander then faces the flagstaff,
     assumes the position of parade rest and waits for Retreat to be played.
     1.2.3. At the sound of Retreat over the base public address system, the two junior
     members of the flag security detail arrange the halyards of the flagstaff for the proper
     lowering of the flag.
     1.2.4. After playing of Retreat, the Command Post will create a momentary delay before
     the national anthems begin. (NOTE: Command Post must coordinate with Command
     Chief’s office to confirm retreat ceremony.) During this delay the flight commander
     comes to attention, does an about face and commands, “Flight ATTENTION” followed
     by “Present ARMS.” As soon as the troop executes present arms, the flight commander
     executes an about face and faces the flagstaff and assumes present arms. The two senior
     members of the flag security detail execute present arms upon the command of the flight
     commander.
     1.2.5. As the Japanese and American national anthems are played, the junior members of
     the flag security detail lower the flag slowly. The flags should reach the bottom of the
     flagstaff at the same time the music stops.
     1.2.6. The flight commander executes “Order ARMS” when the last note of the music is
     played and the flag has been securely grasped by the flag security detail. The flight
     commander then executes an about face and gives the honor flight “Order ARMS,” and
     again, does an about face facing the flagstaffs.
     1.2.7. The flag security detail folds the flag. The senior members of the detail remain at
     attention while the flags are folded unless needed to control the flag.
     1.2.8. When the flags are folded, the flag security detail, with the most senior member on
     the right and the flag bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the
     flight commander. The senior member salutes and reports: “Sir/Ma’am, the flags are
     secured.” The flight commander returns the salute and the flag security detail marches
     into building 507. The flight commander then dismisses the honor flight.
2. PROCEDURES FOR READINESS RUN.
  2.1. Procedures.
     2.1.1. The base-wide run will be conducted on the first Friday of every month, weather
     permitting. The 35th Fighter Wing, Command Chief Master Sergeant assigns units, who

  audiences, and limit weather impacts.
     3.1.1. Some dates are subject to change based on higher headquarter assignments.
  3.2. Attachment 5 lists each of the events and the OPRs/OCRs. For some, the OPR/OCR
  alternate each year.
  3.3. When assigning project officers to these events, every effort should be made to allow
  the alternate project officer one year to become the primary project officer the next year.
  This ensures continuity of critical information.
  3.4. The 35th Fighter Wing Director of Staff is the point of contact for all recurring events.
