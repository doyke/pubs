1. Mission. Maximizing America's Power through the exploitation of timely, accurate, and
relevant weather information: Anytime, Everywhere. The overall Field Operating Agency
(FOA) mission is described in Air Force Mission Directive (AFMD) 52, Air Force Weather
Agency.
2. Command. AFWA is a Field Operating Agency, reporting to Headquarters, United States
Air Force Director of Weather, Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and Space Operations, Plans and

     2.1. AFWA exercises administrative and operational control over assigned forces and, when
     activated, AFWA gained Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard forces. AFWA will
     have operational control (OPCON) when the Air National Guard is on “Title 10/Air National
     Guard of the United/ANGUS” status and assigned to AFWA. Administrative control
     (ADCON) is “shared” with the 201st Mission Support Squadron, Andrews AFB, MD for
     anything less than a “full/total mobilization.” Full/Total Mobilization means the ANG would
     become part of the Air Force.
     2.2. Lead Command for Air Force Weather (AFW) AF multi-command terrestrial weather
     systems and capabilities, ground-based space weather systems, training and communications.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. The AFWA Commander:
        3.1.1. Implements Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
        directives addressing administration and policies concerning assigned forces.
        3.1.2. Maintains forces in a constant state of readiness to meet the tasked wartime
        support requirements for all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
        3.1.3. Plans and programs for centralized weather, space environment, and
        climatological services to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force, Army, designated unified
        commands, and other agencies as directed by the USAF Chief of Staff.
        3.1.4. Directly supports the President, the National Command Authorities, the National
        Reconnaissance Office, the unified commands, and national programs of the highest
        priority.

glossary and Attachment 3 is a list of related directives.
5. Relationship to Other Units or Agencies. AFWA is authorized direct communications with
HQ USAF in all functional areas and with Air Force MAJCOMs. DoDI 4000.19, Support
Agreements, governs inter- and intra-service communications.
6. Special Instructions. Requests to establish, change, or revise this directive or change the
