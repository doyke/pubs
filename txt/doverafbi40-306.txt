      3.9.2. Accountability and management of safety recalls and health device alert
      notifications will be accomplished utilizing DMLSS.
4. AED Model Selection:
   4.1. AED model selection will be determined by the purchasing Unit Commander in
   collaboration with the PAD Medical Director and Medical Logistics. Ideally, a single AED
   model should be purchased for the installation. Standardization of AED models will ease
   responder familiarization, unit maintenance, and supply logistics. AED models should be
   considered based on simplicity of use, durability, battery life, internal memory, warranty,
   cost, available training packages, and ability for BMET to maintain. However, selection of a
   particular model should not be construed as an endorsement by the AHA or the Air Force.
5. AED Location and Installation:
   5.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early CPR and defibrillation, when
   indicated. Therefore, AEDs should be strategically placed throughout a unit’s facility to
   reduce time between victim collapse and ability to provide initial shock when indicated to a
   heart attack victim.
      5.1.1. Factors to consider in determining number of AEDs and AED placement include
      the following:
          5.1.1.1. Facility size and or accessibility.
          5.1.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
          5.1.1.3. Identified high risk environments.
 6                                                          DOVERAFBI40-306 8 APRIL 2014


            5.1.1.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
            5.1.1.5. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency response
            crews.
            5.1.1.6. Use of high voltage electrical equipment.
            5.1.1.7. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for a facility,
            keeping in mind that early initial shock when indicated increases potential for
            survival.
     5.2. To achieve optimal area coverage within a building, an AED should be positioned no
     more than one minute's travel time (one way at brisk pace) from any given point within the
     building.
     5.3. Optimal response time from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED
     on-scene is three minutes or less.
     5.4. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
     shock (i.e., drop-to-shock) should be less than five minutes.
     5.5. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not lose
     time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide items such as gloves,
     scissors, razor, tape, extra electrodes and a barrier mask (Attachment 5).
     5.6. If the capability is available, AEDs should be stored in such a way that an alarm is
     activated when the unit is removed for use. This can be set up as a central alarm, whereby
     the local EMS is automatically notified, or as a local sounding alarm that can draw assistance
     to the scene.
6. Emergency Response:
     6.1. An event timeline for a responder should ideally be as follows:
        6.1.1. Minute #1.
            6.1.1.1. Discovery of “downed” victim: Initiate Chain of Survival; Activate 9-1-1.
            6.1.1.2. Decision to retrieve AED.
            6.1.1.3. Identify closest AED.
        6.1.2. Minute #2-3.
            6.1.2.1. Retrieval of AED (round trip).
        6.1.3. Minute #4.
            6.1.3.1. Re-familiarization with AED instructions.
            6.1.3.2. Preparation of victim and application of chest pads.
            6.1.3.3. Detection of shockable rhythm.
            6.1.3.4. Delivery of shock.
     6.2. AEDs in the following areas will contain both adult and child chest pads: the BX,
     Commissary, Elementary School, Youth Center, Child Development Center, Bowling Alley
     and Base Theater. AEDs with both adult and child leads will be clearly marked by a sign
DOVERAFBI40-306 8 APRIL 2014                                                                 7


  stating “This device is equipped with both Adult and Child chest pads. Please check to ensure
  appropriate pads are utilized.” on the outside of the AED cabinet. Specialized child chest
  leads are labeled CHILD on the package to prevent accidental misuse. Users should check to
  ensure they have the correct chest pads prior to application.

               TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A4.1. Traumatic Stress Response
   A4.1.1. What is TSR?
      A4.1.1.1. The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency in those exposed to
      potentially traumatic stress. This is accomplished through preparatory education for
      those likely to experience potentially traumatic stress, and through education, screening,
      psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic stress. TSR
      teams (1) serve as trauma response consultants to unit leaders; (2) prepare personnel
      likely to be exposed to potentially traumatic events; and (3) provide screening, education,
      psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic events.
      This document also provides revised training guidance.
A4.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services?
   A4.2.1. TSR services may be provided in response to events at the request of the unit
   commander. The services provided will vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the
   needs of the units involved in the mishap. In general, the commander of any unit that incurs
   loss of personnel or significant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should consult with
   a TSR team leader to determine whether there is a need for TSR support. Then, if the
   commander subsequently requests service, the nature of those services should be developed
   by the commander in collaboration with the TSR team leader.
   A4.2.2. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community
   traumatic stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.)
   and small scale disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence
   event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after traumatic events to help those who have
   experienced the events. The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with
   the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the
   impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A4.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services?
   A4.3.1. The office of record for TSR services is the Mental Health Office. The affected
   Wing Commander will support or arrange for consultation between the TSR team chief and
   the affected unit commander to determine what level of service, if any, is needed.
