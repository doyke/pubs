   use various library technologies.
   3.5.3. All staff members using AFLIS must complete the online AFLIS training module
   within one month of being assigned.
3.6. Technical Services. Libraries use current technology and centrally contracted services to
acquire, catalog and process materials.
   3.6.1. Use centrally funded cataloging service contracts or OCLC services for cataloging
   records and enter holdings in the OCLC Online Library Union Catalog (OLUC). Other
   cataloging services may be used upon approval from AFPC/SVXL. When materials are
   deleted from the collection, holdings must also be removed from OCLC and/or other
   cataloging sources.
       3.6.1.1. Holdings in the Integrated Library System (ILS) should accurately reflect OCLC
       records for disaster recovery purposes.

3.8. Official Mail. Libraries may use official and priority mail for all transactions, including
interlibrary loans, as specified by DoD 4525.8-M, DoD Official Mail Manual. Libraries will not
be charged for mailing official mail such as overdue notices, interlibrary loans and other official
correspondence in connection with the mission. E-mail notifications are preferred to save
postage costs.
3.9. Marketing and Public Relations. Library directors conduct aggressive advocacy,
marketing and public relations programs to promote library and information services, as well as
to obtain funding, staffing, facility improvements and community involvement. Use AF
approved social media applications to the maximum extent possible. Librarians use market
survey data to identify and analyze market trends and to develop a marketing plan. Annual
customer satisfaction surveys should address mission, readiness, education and quality of life

                      LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SERVICES

A3.1. General libraries meet the complex, multifaceted information needs of the military
community as well as provide quality-of-life support. Libraries support mission, readiness,
professional education, voluntary and technical education and personal information
requirements; encourage self-development; promote literacy; and improve quality of life.
A3.2. Academic libraries are an integral part of the instructional and professional development
programs of either an AF formal school or a college-level educational institution.
A3.3. Scientific or technical libraries and information centers provide information to personnel
who work in RDT&E programs or support other technical functions.
   A3.3.1. Information centers operate in close cooperation with the scientific and technical
   information officer (STINFO). Professional librarians or information specialists may be
   designated as the STINFO. See Attachment 4.
A3.4. Contractor-Operated, Most Efficient Organization (MEO) and NAFI MOA libraries are
identified to AFPC/SVXL by the FSS. Contract, MEO and NAFI MOA operations are part of
the AF library program and must comply with applicable directives and instructions and meet
program standards.
   A3.4.1. Any contract document used for the description of services when contracting for
   general library services must address this instruction and DoDLS.
   A3.4.2. Professional librarians or information specialists with a Masters Degree from an
   ALA accredited program operate contract, MEO and NAFI MOA libraries.
   A3.4.3. Professional library staff in contract, MEO and MOA general libraries have
   applicable degrees and qualifications. Reference librarians have professional expertise and
   experience in reference work, including online search and retrieval skills using commercial
   and government databases as well as with traditional materials, services and bibliographic
   instruction. Technical Information Specialists have a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer or
   Information Sciences and/or applicable library computer systems and/or local/wide area
   network experience. Full-time positions are required for key personnel: library director,
   reference librarians or technical information specialists, and lead library technician.
   A3.4.4. AFPC/SVXL maintains a list of key personnel and library staff prior to the start of
   any contract and updates as staff changes occur.
A3.5. Library directors establish office reference collections when an organization needs
reference materials on hand to meet mission essential informational requirements. Quasi-
libraries, or small libraries formed by an activity to house oversized office collections and
managed by administrative staff or clerks should not be created.              Exceptions are
communications/computer documentation libraries and TR or equipment manual collections.
A3.6. Extension services include the following types of libraries:
   A3.6.1. Branch Libraries offer a full range of materials and services. They have set
   operating hours, separate quarters, paid staff and a basic collection of materials. A main
   library directs branch operations.

                          TECHNICAL LIBRARY OPERATIONS

A4.1. Purpose and Structure.
   A4.1.1. Technical libraries enable and enhance access to scientific and engineering
   information. These specialized libraries provide relevant and timely information using new
   information technologies and the technical librarians’ expertise. Research librarians provide
   scientists and engineers with information required to capitalize on prior research, prevent
   redundant research, help researchers maintain their expertise and share research results.
   When appropriate to its mission, the libraries interface, collaborate, support or use other
   technical library data, information or knowledge-based initiatives, platforms or tools.
   A4.1.2. Technical library collections focus on science, engineering and other specialized
   areas of research. Technical libraries acquire and manage in-depth, specialized information
   resources and services tailored to the needs of technical organizations. They serve the real-
   time, daily needs of research personnel; a broad range of research and development projects;
   and the associated information requirements that directly affect the course of those projects.
   A4.1.3. AF Materiel Command (AFMC) Technical Library Council. The AFMC technical
   libraries belong to a multi-site consortium, the AFMC Technical Library Council, and host
   periodic face-to-face meetings, video teleconferences and phone conferences. Key library
   personnel attend these meetings.
   A4.1.4. Customer Eligibility. Customers eligible for service at technical libraries include the
   technical organization researchers working on the installation, all AFMC and AFRL
   personnel, authorized contractors and any other installation organizations with which the
   library has agreements. Special categories of customers include contractors; visiting faculty
   or scientists; foreign nationals; Inter-agency Personnel Agreements (IPAs); students;
   Voluntary Emeritus Corps (VEC); VEC employed by a contractor; and retirees.
      A4.1.4.1. Contractors. Additional registration requirements include signatures of
      government monitor and company officer authorized to expend funds. Registration
      requirements include government awareness of contractor requests and company officers
      agreeing to compensate for lost or damaged materials. Special precautions must be taken
      to ensure that certain types of limited or proprietary information are not released to
      contractors.
      A4.1.4.2. Students or visiting faculty or scientists are considered in a similar category as
      contractor personnel in terms of services provided and registration requirements.
      Registration requires the signature of a government sponsor who will be responsible and
      monitor any service needs.
      A4.1.4.3. Foreign nationals assigned to AFMC or AFRL are eligible for library service
      by virtue of being an AFMC employee, however, they do not have access to the AFMC
      network.
      A4.1.4.4. IPAs are considered AFMC personnel and as such are eligible for library
      service.
 38                                                          AFI34-150 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


      A4.1.4.5. VEC can be considered government employees and therefore eligible for
      library services. They are also qualified to see DoD or government-only data. A
      government supervisor or branch chief must certify their need to know for using
      classified information.
      A4.1.4.6. VEC employed by a contractor. The technical library’s organization
      determines whether the VEC sees limited (proprietary, DoD-only or government-only)
      documents. Release of documents is situational and depends on whether there would be
      a conflict of interest between the company and the VEC’s project. In this case, consult
      with the local legal office and release documents only to a government sponsor.
      A4.1.4.7. Retirees are generally referred to the installation library as their servicing
      library. They may be allowed to use resources within the technical library on a site-
      specific basis.
A4.2. Operational Requirements.
   A4.2.1. Facilities. Each research and development site shall be responsible for establishing
   and maintaining an on-site technical library devoted primarily to serving site personnel. See
   paragraph 2.3 These guidelines provide criteria for determining program requirements, site
   evaluation, site planning and overall facility design.
   A4.2.2. Collection Development and Management. Libraries provide an appropriate mix of
   print, electronic and multimedia resources consistent with local needs and leveraging
   corporately-purchased resources. Librarians prepare a collection development plan which
   describes the scope of the library collection, areas of interest, and selection, acquisition,
   preservation and deselection procedures. The plan addresses TRs such as those produced
   locally or acquired through DTIC and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA). The plan also addresses space management in existing facilities and requirements
   for remote storage access and delivery.
   A4.2.3. Acquisition of Electronic Resources. Technical libraries procure commercially-
   developed electronic journal and database platforms. Wherever possible, and consistent with
   technical library business practices, libraries leverage industry-developed resources,
   recognizing that maintenance and continual upgrading are best performed by the private
   sector. Open source software alternatives are researched and a list is provided to customers
   upon request.
   A4.2.4. Special Acquisitions. Under special circumstances and contingent on available
   funding, libraries obtain, upon request, mission-essential publications that might not be
   available via interlibrary loan, may be needed quickly, or that a customer recommends as a
   permanent addition to the collection. All efforts shall be made to meet the format or
   language needs of the requestor. Technical libraries generally do not acquire multiple copies
   to be distributed at the discretion of a requestor. Refer to paragraph 3.6
   A4.2.5. Use of Government purchase card for office collections. IAW AFI 64-117, Air
   Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program, for books, periodicals or manuals
   in direct support of the mission of the technical library, offices coordinate with the library to
   determine if library funds are authorized and available or if a copy is available for review.
AFI34-150 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     39


  A4.2.6. Vaults, Secure Rooms, and Safes. Library personnel staff and maintain vaults,
  secure rooms or safes to house limited and classified documents. Librarians develop
  procedures, consistent with proper security practices, to allow access to the documents.
  A4.2.7. Technical Literature. Librarians coordinate with the local Scientific and Technical
  Information Office (STINFO) Officer and with DTIC to preserve, protect and provide access
  to the technical literature. Installation produced technical efforts include, but are not limited
  to TRs, technical memos and technical papers. All technical literature produced by local
  scientists and engineers are accessible through the DTIC database.
     A4.2.7.1. Technical Literature Archive. Library personnel maintain a paper (or other
     permanent format) archive of the original technical effort produced at that site. Original
     reports often contain color images, charts, graphs, or formulas which do not reproduce
     well. Quality copies or reports that are easily readable in digital formats must be
     available for future researchers. If a report contains multimedia not reproducible in
     paper, the report may need to be retained in several formats. Reports more than 40 or 50
     years old may be retired to the National Archive and Records Administration IAW
     Executive Order 13292, Classified National Security Information or retained in the
     library collection if they are considered a convenience of reference IAW AFI 33-322.
     A4.2.7.2. Deselection of technical literature must be coordinated with other technical
     library research sites to determine the disposition of the reports.
     A4.2.7.3. Older technical literature is scanned and forwarded to DTIC to replace
     deteriorating DTIC microfilm. The older literature must have a distribution statement for
     DTIC acceptance. A full-text version of the technical literature is then available via
     Scientific and Technical Information Network (STINET).
     A4.2.7.4. Declassification and Downgrading. Libraries coordinate with the STINFO and
     security offices of the respective technical library organizations to oversee the periodic
     review for downgrading and reclassification of TRs. Library personnel plan and initiate
     the process, ensuring that the reviewed documents are properly marked and notifications
     are sent as appropriate to the technical directorates, DTIC and other AF offices IAW AFI
     31-401, Information Security Program Management, Chapter 3.
     A4.2.7.5. . Electronic Access to Technical Literature. The standard method of accessing
     the technical efforts in a technical library collection is through the DTIC STINET
     database. TRs may also be accessed through a local ILS. Follow DTIC guidelines to
     ensure that limited or classified records are not accessible through a public-access
     database.
  A4.2.8. Corporate Purchasing Program. HQ AFRL corporately funds technical and
  scientific electronic resources. The corporately funded resources are maintained and the user
  licenses are managed by members of the AFMC Library Consortium. Sub-units may join
  with AFMC and other technical libraries or may enter into separate multi-site agreements.
  A4.2.9. Web Sites. Technical libraries maintain web sites that allow organization of
  corporate and local resources to best meet the needs of their customers. Web sites conform
  to the requirements of AFI 33-129, paragraph 5, and are consistent with AF standards. The
  web site links to the appropriate parent organization. Links will also be maintained to the AF
40                                                           AFI34-150 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


  Portal, and to AFRL, AFMC and AF library and information resources. Guidelines shall be
  prominently posted which explain the usage limitations of electronic resources
  A4.2.10. ILS. Technical Libraries shall maintain an ILS system which employs current
  technology to organize and make accessible their unique collections. See paragraph 5.3
  A4.2.11. Document Delivery. The research needs of technical libraries require ILL support.
  Document delivery mechanisms are maintained to ensure that published articles, books or
  other documents can be obtained quickly and in a cost-effective manner. A database of ILL
  activity is maintained to assist in collection development on a local and AFMC/AFRL
  corporate level.
  A4.2.12. Reference Services. Professional librarians provide reference service and require
  knowledge of the scientific and technical databases and sources to respond to complex
  research requests, including but not limited to fully-mediated literature searches or preparing
  bibliographic instruction for using library resources.
  A4.2.13. Information Analysis Centers (IACs). IACs established by DTIC are located at
  technical library sites. In general, librarians consult with the IAC to answer specific requests.
  A4.2.14. Literature Search - New Research Efforts. Librarians perform literature searches
  required for any new research efforts and document searches on the AFMC Form 14, Request
  for Computer-Aided Literature Search. These searches are performed by a librarian with the
  researcher present. For future new start efforts, while it is recommended that the researcher
  be present, the librarian may perform the search and forward the results to the researcher.
  The librarian must sign the AFMC Form 14 to certify the appropriateness of the search.
  Contract librarians do not have access to proprietary Independent Research and Development
  database and the DoD-only or US Government only records in DTIC. Contractor librarians
  then refer the search to other Government librarians to complete, or provide the appropriate
  search strategy to other DTIC-certified Government personnel. DTIC certification requires
  attending private STINET training course held at DTIC.
  A4.2.15. Critical Appraisal Literature. Using the results of the literature search, professional
  librarians perform analysis of search results focused on search topics to identify, appraise,
  select and synthesize the research results. Using an explicit, objective and transparent
