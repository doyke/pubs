       eliminate or reduce the hazard or cease operations and withdraw exposed personnel. If
       corrective action is not taken, the Fire Chief, Fire Marshal, Chief of Safety,
       Bioenvironmental Engineer, and Commander will personally observe or review the
       operation and determine methods to eliminate or reduce the hazard (ORM). If
       discussions with these individuals fail to resolve the problem, the Installation
       Commander may be notified and asked to determine if the operation is to continue or be
       terminated.
    2.12. Fire Prevention Visits (Inspections).
       2.12.1. The following guidance is used to assess facilities, areas, operations, equipment,
       and practices during fire prevention visits: AFOSH Standards, Air Force Instructions

       2.12.2. Order of precedence is ETL, UFC, AFI, DoDI, OSHA, NFPA, and other
       applicable national consensus standards.
       2.12.3. The fire prevention visit is the quality control element of the 319 ABW fire
       prevention program, and the AF Form 1487 is the quality control tool for documenting
       hazards/discrepancies noted during the fire prevention visit and programming them for
       corrective action.
       2.12.4. Fire prevention visits are conducted in accordance with AFOSH STD 91-301.
       2.12.5. The Fire Chief determines which facilities will be visited. Frequency is
       determined by DoDI, AFI, NFPA, and local needs. Facilities are inspected at least
       annually.
GRANDFORKSAFBI32-2001 7 AUGUST 2012                                                             9


     2.12.6. The fire inspector shall attempt to schedule the visit with the facility manager or
     designated representative, but in the event the facility manager cannot be contacted or
     one has not been assigned the fire inspector shall coordinate with a supervisor, the
     Commander, or real property to gain access and perform the inspection. Inspections are
     not required to be scheduled, they can be performed ―No Notice.‖
     2.12.7. Facility Managers, supervisors or contractors or a designated representative shall
     accompany the fire inspector during fire prevention visits.
     2.12.8. If a hazard is discovered that presents an imminently dangerous situation it shall
     be brought to the attention of the supervisor who shall take immediate action to either
     eliminate the hazard, reduce the hazard to an acceptable level or shall halt the operation
     and withdraw exposed personnel until such time that the operation can be performed
     safely.
     2.12.9. After completing the visit, the Fire Inspector shall inform facility
     managers/supervisors/commanders of fire hazards and deficiencies.

     2.13.13. Blocks 20/21/22 are completed by the ―Functional Manager‖. Once the report
     has been fully answered and has been signed by the functional manager, please return it
     to the fire prevention inspector who wrote it.
     2.13.14. Facility Managers shall maintain their copy of the AF Form 1487, Fire
     Prevention Visit Report in the facility manager’s facility manager’s binder for a minimum
     of 2 years or until all identified items have been corrected.
     2.13.15. Periodically (at least annually) review all open discrepancies and determine

     or the 319 ABW/CC .
  2.14. Fire Reporting Procedures.
     2.14.1. The fire reporting number is 9-1-1; it is not necessary to dial a prefix.
     2.14.2. When dialing 9-1-1 on GFAFB, you will reach the downtown Grand Forks
     Dispatch Center. Ensure that you inform the operator that you are calling from GFAFB
     and need to speak to the GFAFB emergency dispatch center. The call will then be
     forwarded to an on base dispatcher and the operator will dispatch the necessary
     emergency responders. Fast and accurate reporting of fires/emergencies is essential to
     minimize damage to property and injury to personnel.
     2.14.3. Always report fires/emergencies by dialing 911, even if a facility is equipped
     with an automatic fire detection system that reports into the dispatch center; doing so
     functions as a failsafe and insures that the emergency responders are notified.
     2.14.4. Falsely reporting fire alarms (Prank Calls) and/or falsely activating fire alarm
     pull stations when no emergency conditions exist, tampering with or compromising
     installed fire protection system/s, or use of fire extinguishers for anything other than
     extinguishing an actual fire is punishable under the UCMJ and civil law.
GRANDFORKSAFBI32-2001 7 AUGUST 2012                                                            11


  2.15. Fire Reaction Procedures.
     2.15.1. Should a fire occur, implement and emergency action/fire reaction plan and take
     the following actions:
         2.15.1.1. Notify facility occupants, verbally and by activating the fire alarm system.
         2.15.1.2. Always dial 911 to report an emergency. Dialing 911 acts as a back up to
         the facility alarm system and ensures emergency responders are notified.
         2.15.1.3. If the facility is equipped with portable fire extinguishers use them to
         attempt to extinguish the fire.
         2.15.1.4. If the facility is equipped with a manually activated fire suppression system
         that covers the area where the fire is located, activate it. Follow your fire reaction or
         emergency action plan.
         2.15.1.5. When evacuating the facility for a bomb threat ―DO NOT‖ activate the fire
         alarm system. Use runners and clear the facility room by room.
         2.15.1.6. When the dispatch center operator answers your call remain calm; speak
         clearly, answer the operator’s questions; provide the number for the phone you’re
         calling from (callback number); provide your building/house/apartment number and
         street address; give the operator the location, type and size of the fire (i.e. what is
         burning, how long has it been burning, where is the fire located, is anyone injured, if
         yes, what injuries have the suffered; provide any other relevant information that
         might be useful to the emergency responders, and ―Do Not‖ end the phone call until
         directed to do so by the dispatcher.
         2.15.1.7. Close the doors and windows in the fire area if time permits and if you can
         do so without placing yourself in undo danger prior to exiting the building.
         2.15.1.8. Evacuate all personnel to a predetermined location at least 75 ft. (or 1 ½ x
         height of the structure) from the facility and take an immediate count (roll call) of all
         assigned personnel for accountability.
         2.15.1.9. Report the number of personnel both present and unaccounted for to the
         Senior Fire Officer (SFO), include the last known location of each person you cannot
         account for; the importance of having an accurate accountability list for all assigned
         personnel is critical to search and rescue operations; account for personnel on leave,
         at lunch, at appointments, in meetings, etc.
         2.15.1.10. Designate one individual to be the liaison and communicate with the
         senior fire officer to prevent the SFO from receiving conflicting information.
         2.15.1.11. The ―SPEED‖ system shall be used during emergencies.               ―SPEED‖
         utilizes the following sequence of actions:

  2.16. First Aid Firefighting.
     2.16.1. If you encounter that does not constitute an immediate threat to your life, use the
     assigned hand held portable fire extinguisher and/or installed fire suppression
     system/equipment and attempt to control and/or extinguish the fire. If at any time you
     become injured, if the fire or smoke becomes life threatening, or your first aid firefighting
     efforts are ineffective, evacuate and report to the facility manager/supervisor/commander.
         2.16.1.1. Only attempt to extinguish the fire after initiating the facility evacuation
         process and notifying the fire alarm communications center.

         method:




         2.16.1.7. Use the correct type of fire extinguishing agent, i.e. water for class ―A‖
         fires (wood, paper, ordinary combustible solids), ABC or BC class ―B‖ extinguishers
         for burning liquid fires (hydrocarbons, alcohols). Dry chemical, Co2, Halon are
         examples of extinguishing agents rated for ABC or BC type fires.
     2.16.2. All fires shall be reported, even if the fire has burned itself out or has already
     been extinguished.
  2.17. Fire Drill Procedures.
     2.17.1. Fire evacuation exercises shall be coordinated with the fire department.

     2.17.6. A single designated representative shall be appointed to communicate with the
     fire department senior fire officer at the scene.
        2.17.6.1. Provide the SFO with a report detailing the number of people that
        evacuated, the number and last known location of any unaccounted for personnel, the
        nature and/or location of the emergency, and any other information pertinent to the
        situation.
     2.17.7. Total evacuation is mandatory during any alarm activation unless otherwise
     directed by fire department personnel, per pre-existing agreement and/or mission
     requirements (Command Post).

        command post. C.P. operators will remain in-place unless or until the situation
        actually becomes life threatening at which time they will follow their E.A.P. and react
        accordingly.
     2.17.8. Pre-planning shall identify mobility impaired members/occupants; the evacuation
     plan shall identify those occupants and shall designate personnel to assist them.
     2.17.9. Units having classified material or equipment must ensure prior arrangements are
     made to secure those items during an evacuation.

     4.4.8. UL has determined that deep fat ―Turkey Fryers‖ are too dangerous for their stamp
     of approval. These devices can be dangerous, but are authorized for use on GFAFB
     providing all the following safety precautions are strictly adhered to:
        4.4.8.1. Comply with the manufacturer’s instructions.
        4.4.8.2. The use of a thermostat to gauge and monitor the temperature of the oil is
        mandatory; do not allow the temperature to surpass 475 degrees F.
        4.4.8.3. Turkey fryers should always be used outdoors a safe distance (10 ft.) from
        buildings/overhangs, combustibles.
        4.4.8.4. Do not place turkey fryers on combustible surfaces.
        4.4.8.5. Never use turkey fryers on wooden decks, under wooden decks, underneath
        roof overhangs or inside facilities.
        4.4.8.6. Users shall ensure fryers are used on a flat surface to reduce accidental
        tipping. Fryers shall not be left unattended; they shall be monitored constantly when
        in use. NEVER leave fryers unattended! It takes just minutes for oil to reach
        flashover and then fire-point temperature (the point at which the oil spontaneously
        ignites and then becomes self-sustaining).
        4.4.8.7. Never let children or pets near the fryer when in use. Even after use, never
        allow children or pets near the turkey fryer. The oil inside the cooking pot can
        remain dangerously hot, hours after use.
        4.4.8.8. To avoid oil spillover, do not overfill the fryer.
GRANDFORKSAFBI32-2001 7 AUGUST 2012                                                              27


        4.4.8.9. Use well-insulated potholders or oven mitts when touching pot or lid
        handles. If possible, wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from oil splatter
        4.4.8.10. Ensure the turkey is completely thawed and be careful with marinades. Oil
        and water don't mix; water agitates hot oil and can easily cause it to boil up and spill
        over causing a fire or even an explosion hazard.
        4.4.8.11. The National Turkey Federation recommends refrigerator thawing and to
        allow approximately 24 hours for every five pounds of bird thawed in the refrigerator.
        4.4.8.12. Maintain a serviceable all-purpose ABC rated or Class K fire extinguisher
        nearby. Never use water to extinguish a grease fire. Remember to use your best
        judgment when attempting to fight a fire. If the fire is manageable, use an all-purpose
        fire extinguisher. If the fire increases, immediately call 9-1-1 for help.
        4.4.8.13. Even after use, never allow children or pets near the turkey fryer. The oil
        inside the cooking pots remains dangerously hot, hours after use.
     4.4.9. Cooking shall be supervised at all times. Unattended cooking is strictly
     prohibited. Unattended cooking is the most frequent cause of fires in Air Force Military
     Family Housing and one of the top causes of fires in commercial food preparation
     establishments.
     4.4.10. When cooking with hot oil only use a pot or pan that has a tight fitting lid
     designed for the particular pot or pan that is being used.
     4.4.11. Users of cooking equipment shall ensure oven mitts/pads for handling hot
     appliances, pots, and lids are available.
     4.4.12. In the event that a pot or pan catches fire notify the Fire Department by calling 9-
     1-1 at the first available opportunity no matter how small the fire (even if extinguished).
     4.4.13. Outdoor cooking devices including charcoal grills, gas operated grills, and
     smokers shall be placed at least 10-ft. from a structure when in use.
        4.4.13.1. These devices shall not be used inside any structure, under carports, eaves,
        overhangs, or pavilions, unless the structure is designed for that purpose.
     4.4.14. All cooking devices shall be constantly attended when in use.
     4.4.15. Used charcoal shall be thoroughly soaked with water prior to disposal and
     adequate time shall be allowed for the cooking device to cool before storing it away.
     4.4.16. Cooking appliances shall not be moved from their designated locations without
     the prior approval of the fire prevention office. Moving commercial cooking equipment
     may require alteration to the fire extinguishing system and shall be accomplished prior to
     moving any equipment protected by a system.
     4.4.17. Cooking equipment that produces grease laden vapors, such as, but not limited to,
     deep fat fryers, ranges, griddles, broilers, woks, tilting skillets, and braising pans shall be
     protected by automatic fire-extinguishing equipment.
     4.4.18. Residential cooking equipment used in a non-residential setting shall be protected
     by the following:
