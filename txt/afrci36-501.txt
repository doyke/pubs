                                             Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM ELEMENTS

1.1. Definitions:
     1.1.1. ART. A full-time civilian employee who is required, as a condition of employment, to
     maintain active reserve membership in the unit in which employed. In addition to his or her
     civilian assignment, he or she is assigned to equivalent positions in the reserve organization
     with a reserve military rank or grade. The Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) authorized on
     the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) for the civilian (RIC 163) and the drill (RIC 0020 or
     0120) counterpart position must be equivalent.
     1.1.2. UMD. A detailed manpower listing reflecting the distribution of manpower allocations
     into a finite structure of authorizations (e.g., by unit and work center) which includes
     approved position, grade and approved Core Personnel Documents (CPDs)/ Position
     Descriptions (PDs) numbers.
     1.1.3. CPD. A computer generated product which combines the Position Description (PD),
     performance plan, promotion evaluation pattern, and training plan into a single core civilian
     personnel document.
     1.1.4. Standardized CPD/PD. A single CPD/PD used for a number of like positions. For
     ART positions, CPDs/PDs prescribe specific duties and responsibilities performed by the
     incumbent in order to support unit mission requirements.
     1.1.5. Crew Chief. An ART Aircraft Overhaul Leader, WL-8801-10, who is responsible for
     the total airworthiness of one or more assigned aircraft. These may be aircraft that are being
     prepared for flight test after overhaul, or they may be in operational status. This is not a
     supervisory position for classification purposes.
     1.1.6. Primary Aerospace Vehicle (Aircraft) Inventory (PAI). Aircraft permanently assigned
     to an AFRC flying unit.
     1.1.7. Backup Aerospace Vehicle (Aircraft) Inventory (BAI). Aircraft temporarily assigned
     to an AFRC flying unit.
     1.1.8. Position Management. Development of organizational structures that are comprised of
     a balanced mix of skills, grade levels and/or salaries, logical job ladders to support employee
     development and career progression when possible. Position management decisions are
     based on good business decisions and mission requirements.
1.2. ART Central Classification Authority:
     1.2.1. AFRC fully supports the lawful principle of equal pay for substantially equal work.
     AF Instruction 36-1401, paragraph 3.4 authorizes AFRC to administer a centralized
     classification program for ART positions and to issue prescriptive CPDs/PDs.
     1.2.2. ART positions are subject to classification laws and are classified according to
     existing OPM classification standards, and DoD and HQ USAF/A1C guidance. Duties and
     responsibilities performed by an ART solely in a reservist capacity, which military pay rather
     than civilian pay is received, are not considered in determining the classification of the ART
     position.
AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013                                                                    5


1.3. Objectives:
   1.3.1. Comply with statutory classification requirements.
   1.3.2. Balance mission needs, operational economy and efficiency, skills and career paths,
   employee development and motivation, and recruitment and retention of competent people.
       1.3.2.1. Position management decisions have a direct impact on compensation
       management, the civilian pay budget.
       1.3.2.2. A low cost position structure is very important from an economic standpoint.
       Significant changes and increases in complexity of the duties and responsibilities of a
       position are required to support a higher grade level.
       1.3.2.3. Impact of poor position management. Relying solely on raising grade levels of
       the position structure results in problems such as:
          1.3.2.3.1. Pay inequity between comparable skill level jobs.
          1.3.2.3.2. Escalated salary costs and/or grade creep.
          1.3.2.3.3. Poor internal operations due to ineffective distribution of work.
          1.3.2.3.4. Unwarranted organizational growth to accommodate higher graded
          specialists and managers and unnecessary supervisory levels.
          1.3.2.3.5. Unbalanced work force and skill levels as lower level positions are
          abolished and their duties absorbed into higher graded positions.
          1.3.2.3.6. Resentment on the part of higher grade personnel who are required to do
          lower grade work.
       1.3.2.4. Violation of the legal requirement of providing employees equal pay for
       substantially equal work.
          1.3.2.4.1. Maintain standard organizations and position structures.
1.4. Thirty Percent Rule (Mixing ART and non-ART Duties):
   1.4.1. By agreement with OPM, ART and non-ART positions are in separate competitive
   levels because of the ART’s condition of employment, which is active Reserve affiliation.
   Adding more than 30 percent ART duties to a non-ART position or more than 30 percent
   non-ART duties to an ART position, negates the basis for separate competitive levels. (FPM
   Supplement (Internal) 930-71.)
   1.4.2. Whether the position is ART or non-ART, additional duties assigned must be in
   keeping with the purpose and functional intent of the position to which the duties are added.
   Such duties must also be comparable to the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by
   assigned position. (FPM Supplement (Internal) 930-71.)
1.5. Audits and Reviews (as appropriate):
   1.5.1. ART organizations and positions are subject to normal classification audits and
   reviews, the same as non-ART organizations and positions. (See Chapter 8)

 10                                                           AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013


   due to budget constraints, lack of available candidates, etc, it should still be established in
   DCPDS.
   3.6.2. Establish ART positions at the authorized grade shown on the UMD, Civilian
   position, prior to any subsequent action such as restructuring the position for fill purposes.
   3.6.3. When manpower authorizations are lost within a work function, initiate action to
   cancel the appropriate number of positions (ART and non-ART).
   3.6.4. When requesting that a civilian position be converted to an ART position, provide a

   3.7.2. Establish positions in DCPDS, ensuring data includes UMD line number for ART and
   non-ART positions.
   3.7.3. Fill ART positions consistent with manpower authorizations shown on the UMD,
   Civilian position. The servicing classifier, (e.g., local CPS or AFPC), restructures positions
   for fill purposes. Position numbers assigned to restructured positions must be selected from
   the sequence 70000 to 72999. (Numbering sequence is a retained practice from obsolete
   AFM 30-130, Volume IV, 1 Apr 89). Assistance will be provided by HQ AFRC/A1CC as
   needed.
   3.7.4. Process minor modifications to ART CPDs/PDs which do not impact the title, pay
   plan or schedule, series, grade, the nature and purpose of the position, or the normal career
AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013                                                                     11

   classification assigned to any ART position.
   3.7.6. Notify HQ AFRC/A1CC when:
      3.7.6.1. A situation occurs which impacts the grade, pay schedule assigned to an ART
      supervisory position. Include in the notification a brief narrative description of the
      change and the recommended grade, pay schedule to be assigned.
      3.7.6.2. Local management declines to comply with an ART CPD/PD. Include in the
      notification, in writing, work situations not consistent with approved ART CPDs/PDs.
      3.7.6.3. Information is received that OPM, DoD, HQ USAF, or other authority has
      changed the classification of any AFRC position (ART or non-ART). Include in the

          which the position is assigned.
   3.7.7. Notify HQ AFRC/A1CC in writing when any classification action of an AFRC
   position is proposed by means of Impact of Person on the Job (IPJ). Include with the
   notification a copy of the current CPD/PD and the "Impact of Person on the Job-Amendment
   to Position Number____________" outline (Attachment 2) supporting the IPJ action. When
   the impacted position is vacated, the IPJ amendment is no longer considered a part of the
   CPD/PD and the position, therefore, reverts to the original classification. Document the
   following requirements in order to consider recognition of IPJ:
      3.7.7.1. Evidence that the IPJ is so significant that the job is graded one grade higher
      than otherwise derived from the applicable classification grading standards.
      3.7.7.2. Recognition of IPJ determinations other than special attributes of the employee.
      Impact of the incumbent is documented on the IPJ amendment outline to include all the
      factors contributing to the IPJ determination. The amendment becomes a part of the
      established CPD/PD which is being impacted.
   3.7.8. Provide the unit commander advice and periodic information on upward trends in
   grade levels, increasing salaries, and position management concerns such as excessive
   layering and job dilution.
   3.7.9. Refer all proposed actions by managers/supervisors that are inconsistent with AFI 36-
   502, Managing Civilian Personnel Resources, and AFRC procedures on position
   management to the AFRC unit commander for final decision.
3.8. Supervisors/Management:
   3.8.1. Explain the classification of employees’ positions to employees.

   CORE PERSONNEL DOCUMENTS (CPDS)/ POSITION DESCRIPTIONS (PDS)

4.1. Requirements:
   4.1.1. CPDs/PDs outline the nature and purpose of ART positions. Any additional duties
   locally assigned are to be closely related to those outlined in the ART CPD/PD.
   4.1.2. Neither ART nor non-ART CPDs/PDs should contain any language which infers, or
   makes reference to, specific job qualification requirements which do not affect the
   classification of the position. Also, unless a position is classified in one of the professional
   occupational series (e.g., engineering, scientific, medical/physician, etc.), CPDs/PDs should
   not reference any educational requirements or specialized training needed for qualification in
   the position. (FPM Supplement (Internal) 930-71)
   4.1.3. All ART CPDs/PDs must have the following statements:
      4.1.3.1. The incumbent’s regular assignments consist primarily of ART duties; however,
      the incumbent may be assigned some non-ART duties, generally not to exceed 30 percent
      of total responsibilities.
      4.1.3.2. Incumbent may be required to fly in commercial and military aircraft to perform
      temporary duty assignments.
      4.1.3.3. Incumbent is required to meet and maintain Air Force Reserve requirements.
      4.1.3.4. ART officer positions also require the following statement: This is a designated
      mobility position. Incumbent must be willing to move/transfer to another unit/location on
      a lateral or promotion as directed by HQ AFRC.
 14                                                          AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013


                                          Chapter 5

      AUTHORIZATION, ESTABLISHMENT, AND FILLING OF ART POSITIONS

5.1. UMD:
   5.1.1. Positions are classified and authorized on the UMD at the journeyman grade level.
   The civilian grades shown on the UMD are the maximum grades.
5.2. Classification of Deputy/Full Assistant Positions:
   5.2.1. Comply with the criteria in OPM General Schedule Supervisory Guide (GSSG) for
   positions classified under General Schedule as well as HQ AFRC/A1M instructions.
5.3. Establishment of Supervisory Positions:
   5.3.1. An employee exercising authority for technical direction, coordination, and oversight
   of other workers in accomplishing trades and labor work does not necessarily make the
   position supervisory. A GS or FWS supervisor must:
       5.3.1.1. Perform supervisory duties as a regular and recurring part of the job and on a
       substantially full-time and continuing basis. The requirement for supervision is
       "paramount" in the position in order to accomplish the primary duties and responsibilities
       of the job.
       5.3.1.2. Must have a minimum of 5 subordinate employees (HQ AFRC/A1CC position
       management policy) to justify a first level supervisor.
   5.3.2. Establishment of supervisory positions in a very small work operation may have an
   adverse impact on the base level non-supervisory journeyman work supervised. The
   journeyman grades may be reduced due to the amount of supervision received. The
   establishment of supervisory positions over small shops or small organizations of
   journeyman employees seriously inhibits the planning, judgment, decision making, and other
   aspects of responsibility which are required at journeyman grade levels.
5.4. Establishment of Small Shop Chief Positions (FWS Positions Only).
   5.4.1. If a position is needed to be responsible for technical direction, coordination, and
   oversight of a small (that is, from two to four subordinates) FWS work operation, a small
   shop chief position is appropriate. Such positions should be established when it is not
   management’s intent to have as a "paramount" requirement, substantially full-time
   supervision.
       5.4.1.1. Establishment of a permanent small shop chief position is not an additional
       manpower authorization. Instead, it is the reclassification of an existing journeyman
       position based on the additional duties and responsibilities assigned.
       5.4.1.2. Small shop chief positions are graded on their non-supervisory work with one
       grade added over the full performance level supervised. A small shop chief position is
       significantly limited as to the range of responsibility in planning, work direction and
       administration and is not a supervisory position for classification purposes.
       5.4.1.3. One or two-worker shop operations are excluded from this definition even
       though one worker is held fully and technically responsible for the shop.
AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013                                                                         15


      5.4.1.4. The UMD, drill position, counterpart position of the new ART position is
      normally the most senior military authorization.
5.5. Crew Chief Positions:
   5.5.1. One ART crew chief position is authorized for each Primary Aerospace Vehicle
   (Aircraft) Inventory (PAI) assigned. A temporary crew chief position may be established for
   each Backup Aerospace Vehicle (Aircraft) Inventory (BAI) temporarily assigned.
   Authorizations are based on data provided by HQ AFRC/A4 and HQ AFRC/A1CC.
   5.5.2. A crew chief position is not an additional manpower authorization to the normal
   complement of Aircraft Mechanic, WG-8852-10, positions. Instead, it is the cancellation of
   an existing WG-10 position and establishment of an Aircraft Overhaul Leader, WL-8801-10,
   position. The UMD, drill position, counterpart authorization of the ART position is normally
   the most senior military grade. If a unit permanently loses/gains a PAI aircraft, HQ
   AFRC/A4 notifies HQ AFRC/A1CC to make appropriate adjustment in crew chief
   authorizations. The UMD, civilian position, reflects authorized permanent crew chief
   positions based on the number of PAI assigned to the unit.
   5.5.3. HQ AFRC/A1CC authorizes, at the request of HQ AFRC/A4, a temporary crew chief
   position for each BAI. The position does not exceed two years or the loss/conversion of a
   BAI, whichever occurs earlier. This temporary position is established against an existing
   permanent WG-10 authorization and is identified on the UMD, Civilian position, as WG-10.
   HQ AFRC/A4 evaluates the situation if the BAI remain at the same unit for at least two
   years. They determine if the BAI is to be permanently assigned to the unit.
   5.5.4. AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions, and other governing regulations
   determine if temporary crew chief positions are to be filled competitively or
   noncompetitively.
   5.5.5. HQ AFRC/A1CC provides a memorandum for implementation certifying
   establishment of a new crew chief position. Upon receipt of the memorandum, the unit
   initiates position fill action. The receipt of additional aircraft is not an automatic authority to
   establish an additional crew chief position. HQ AFRC/A1CC must provide such authority.
   5.5.6. HQ AFRC/A1CC and HQ AFRC/A4 periodically review and assess the effectiveness
   of this procedure and make adjustments as necessary.
5.6. Ten or More Position Changes (AFPC and Other Servicing CPSs):
   5.6.1. If any personnel action will impact the classification of 10 or more AFRC positions,
   notify HQ AFRC/A1CC prior to taking action.
      5.6.1.1. Provide reason for the impact, number and type of positions and information as
      to whether the positions are encumbered.
      5.6.1.2. Allow HQ AFRC/A1CC an opportunity to review information, and concur or
      non-concur with rationale.
5.7. Restructuring:
   5.7.1. Positions may be established and filled at a lower grade level at the discretion of the
   local AFRC management official.
16                                                            AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013


  5.7.2. Supervisory positions are not normally restructured. Any restructuring of an ART
  supervisory position has to be approved by HQ AFRC/A1CC.
  5.7.3. Any restructuring of an ART position must be within the same line of work leading to
  the target grade of the position.
  5.7.4. In cases where the unit commander desires to restructure an ART position to a lower
  grade for fill purposes, the commander has the authority to modify the ART CPD/PD. This
  can be done by deleting or lining out significant grade controlling defining duties, rewriting
  the ART CPD/PD, or developing a statement of differences to reflect the variance between
  the full performance and the restructured position.
  5.7.5. Whichever method is used, the servicing classifier is consulted to ensure that only the
  grade level of the ART position changes, not the series and typically, not the job title. In rare
  cases, the job title may be modified as well as the grade level.
AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013                                                                    17

     CLASSIFICATION DISAGREEMENTS AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

6.1. Difference of Opinion on ART Classification Matters:
   6.1.1. When there is a difference of opinion between the servicing CPS and the unit
   commander which cannot be resolved at the local level:
   6.1.2. In conjunction with the functional manager, submit the case file to HQ AFRC/A1CC
   for resolution.
   6.1.3. The servicing CPS classifier assembles all appropriate documents (that is, current and
   proposed CPDs/PDs; written statements to support the rationale of the classification opinion;
   evaluation statements (when available); etc.) and coordinates them through the unit
   commander to HQ AFRC/A1CC.
   6.1.4. The unit commander attaches a summary of his or her opinion to include why he or
   she disagrees with the CPS Classifier. Classification disputes involving non-ART positions
   should be handled IAW AFI 36-1401, dated 1 August 1997, Air Force Position Classification
   Guidance Memorandum, dated 5 March 2012 and Air Force Personnel Center Classification
   Procedures, Relook Policy, dated 12 February 2012.
6.2. Management Dispute over ART Position Classification Determinations:
   6.2.1. Supervisors who disagree with a classification decision made by the servicing ART
   classification authority (A1CC) must prepare a Reclama based on the appropriate
   classification standards and guides and submit to A1CC for review.
   6.2.2. If A1CC does not concur with the Reclama classification rationale of the supervisor,
   the issue will be elevated through the supervisor’s chain of command to the HQ AFRC Vice
   Commander (CV). Once a final decision is rendered, AFRC/CV will notify A1CC of the
   decision in writing. The notification must include the technical classification rationale, the
   certification statement and the signature of the AFRC/CV as the classification authority.

I have reviewed the applicable OPM and AF classification guidance regarding impact of the
person on the job and determined that the individual’s contributions warrant the addition of a
grade for that reason. I understand that upon vacancy, the position reverts back to the previous
grade.

      JOB GRADING GUIDANCE FOR AFRC SMALL SHOP CHIEF POSITIONS

                                       WORK COVERED

This guide is used to grade the jobs of small shop chiefs in the Air Reserve Technician Program
who, as a regular and recurring part of their jobs, are responsible for the overall operation of
small maintenance shops involving trades and labor type work.

                                    WORK NOT COVERED

This guide should not be used to grade work which involves the following:

Supervising other workers when such supervisory work does not have as the paramount
requirement for its performance, experience in and knowledge of trades and labor work. Such
work is properly classified by the appropriate General Schedule Supervisory Guide (GSSG) for
General Schedule (GS) employees.

Supervising other workers in accomplishing trades and labor work when such supervisory duties
are performed as a regular and recurring part of the job and on a substantially full-time and
continuing basis. Additionally, must meet HQ AFRC/A1CC position management guidelines as
specified in this instruction. Such work is properly classified by the appropriate Job Grading
Standard for Federal Wage System (FWS) Supervisors.

 Leading prevailing rate workers as a regular and recurring part of the job, and on a substantially
full-time and continuing basis, in accomplishing trades and labor work. Such work is properly
classified by the Job Grading Standard for Leaders, WN/WL.

Journey level or sub-journey level work. Such work is properly classified by the appropriate Job
Grading Standard for the type of work performed.

                                      CODES AND TITLES

Occupational Code/Series - The occupational code or job series of a small shop chief job is the
one that best reflects the nature of the overall work operations in the shop.

Title - Small shop chief jobs covered by this guide are identified by the job title of the journey
level positions in the occupation selected.

                                   DEFINITION OF TERMS

Small Shop - A small organizational segment in a maintenance function in which specialized
work is performed. A small number of employees, usually less than five, are assigned who all
perform work in the same job series.

                                     GRADING CRITERIA
 24                                                            AFRCI36-501 30 AUGUST 2013



Positions graded under these criteria are graded one grade above the representative journey level
grade in the shop. For a position to be evaluated by this guide, incumbent of the position must
meet all of the following:

-Possesses the knowledge and skills found at the journey level grade as well as those required for
planning, accomplishing, and maintaining a functional shop maintenance program.

- Independently determines appropriate maintenance procedures such as how and when the work
should be accomplished. Prepares estimates manpower, equipment, and material requirements
and advises supervisor.

- Devises and maintains all program plans and records; is skilled in troubleshooting techniques,
and is able to determine maintenance/repair procedures needed without benefit of technical
supervisory guidance.

- Plans, organize, and direct shop maintenance programs under general supervision.

- Determines approaches, methods, and courses of action required to accomplish the mission of
the shop in an effective and efficient manner.

- May provide recommendations and input to the supervisor concerning personnel actions such
as performance appraisals, awards, position description changes, disciplinary actions, leave, etc.
Since positions performing small shop chief duties do not fully meet Work Situation 1 of the
FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors, they are properly classified as small shop chiefs
(WG) instead of Wage Supervisors (WS).
