This chapter covers:
   •   How we define communication.
   •   Why communication is important in today’s Air Force.
   •   Characteristics of effective communication.
   •   Common problems encountered when people try to communicate.



This is an exciting time to be in the United States Air Force! Our mission and our
operations tempo reflect the larger world around us—a world of rapidly accelerating
technology and nearly unlimited access to information. Airmen are successfully
accomplishing more missions with fewer people than ever before, and there is a constant
battle to cover the bases with limited resources. With many demands on their time, why
should the men and women of the Air Force care about effective communication? This
chapter answers that question, identifies five principles of effective communication, and
describes common speaking and writing problems.




                                          –3–

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY COMMUNICATION,
                             …AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

 com•mu•ni•ca•tion n 1: an
 act or instance of transmitting                                              Why are we
 information; 2: a verbal or                                                  here again?
 written message; 3: a process
 by which information is
 exchanged between individuals
 through a common system of
 symbols, signs or behavior.




Communication is defined as the process of sharing ideas, information and messages with
others. In the Air Force, most communication involves speaking and writing, but this
definition includes nonverbal communication such as body language, graphics, etc.
Any communication can be broken into three parts: the sender, the message and the
audience. For communication to be successful, the audience must not only get the
message, but must interpret the message in the way the sender intended.
Since communication requires effort, it should always have a purpose. If the purpose
isn’t clear to the audience, you will have a problem! Most Air Force communication is
intended to direct, inform (or educate), persuade or inspire. Often the sender has some
combination of these motives in mind.
Chapter 3 describes the process of determining your purpose and audience in detail, but
here are a few examples of Air Force communication targeted toward a specific
objective:
The headquarters staff (the sender)
         writes a new policy on trip report procedures (the message)
                  and sends a copy to all subordinate units (the audience).
         Purpose of this communication: to direct
An aircraft technician (the sender)
         reports the results of an aircraft engine inspection (the message)
                  to his supervisor (the audience).
         Purpose of this communication: to inform
A branch chief (the sender)
         requests additional funding for new computers (the message)
                  in a meeting with the division chief (the audience).
         Purpose of this communication: to persuade


                                                      –4–
                                                             A Basic Philosophy of Communication


Most communication outside the Air Force falls in these categories as well. Can you spot
the purpose of each of the following sentences?
       “You didn’t wash the car like you promised.”
       “But Dad! Everyone else is going to the beach. Why can’t I go?”
       “Son, I know you’re a fine young man, and fine young men keep their promises.”

       “Aw, Dad…”
       “Wash the car NOW!”
If you look carefully, you can see the efforts to inform, direct, persuade or inspire in this
common conversation.
COMMUNICATION, TEAMWORK AND LEADERSHIP
Communication skills are vitally important in any environment where teamwork is
important. Simply put, communication enables us to come together to accomplish things
better than we can accomplish as individuals. Communication skills are particularly
important for leaders. The ability to communicate a vision and direction, to motivate and
inspire others and to persuade our superiors are all essential in bringing people together to
achieve a common goal.
The military environment is unique, and much of its uniqueness requires extraordinary
communication skills. We operate highly technical equipment in a lethal environment
and we are held to very high standards by the country we serve. Miscommunication can
cause expensive mistakes, embarrass our organization and in some cases cause accidents
or even death.
A CALL TO ARMS…
This book is designed to give you tools and ideas that will help you learn to communicate
better … and to teach others as well.
Both the Air Force and the large culture we live in are drowning in a sea of information.
Around-the-clock media coverage, universal electronic mail (e-mail), and the expansion
of the Internet and other electronic information sources make it difficult for us to sift out
the valuable information we need to accomplish our mission. Now, more than ever, it’s
important to communicate with clarity and focus.
The only way to become a better writer and speaker is to work at it—there are no short
cuts. The good news is that service in the Air Force will provide plenty of opportunities
for you to improve. Your communication skills will become stronger with practice,
regardless of your initial ability, and this book is designed to help you on your journey.

               long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake
               somebody up.”

PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Once you accept that communication is important, it’s important to understand what
makes communication succeed and what makes it fail. Most mistakes are caused by
forgetting one of five principles of good communication. This section addresses these
core principles, which we’ve organized to spell out the acronym FOCUS. It also
describes some of the most common mistakes that occur when you miss the mark.

c FOCUSED: ADDRESS THE ISSUE, THE                              FOCUS Principles

                               1. Answering the wrong question. This happens when
                               we don’t understand the assignment or what the audience
really wants. Have you ever written what you thought was an excellent paper, only to be
told you answered the wrong question or you missed the point? Have you ever asked
someone a question and received a long answer that had nothing to do with what you
asked?
2. Answering only part of the question. If a problem or question has multiple parts,
sometimes we work out the easiest or most interesting part of the solution and forget the
unpleasant remainder.
3. Adding irrelevant information. Here the communicator answers the question, but
mixes in information that is interesting but unnecessary. Though the answer is complete,
it’s hard to understand—it’s like finding that needle in the haystack.



                                          –6–
                                                       A Basic Philosophy of Communication


Failure to focus can really hurt staff communication. Time and time again our efforts
crash and burn because we never carefully read the words or really listen to the speaker
for the real message … for the specific question! Most executive officers will tell you
that failing to answer the question is one of the primary reasons staff packages are
dumped back into the laps of hapless action officers.
Chapter 3 provides suggestions on how to be clear on your purpose and avoid these
problems.

d ORGANIZED: SYSTEMATICALLY PRESENT YOUR INFORMATION AND
IDEAS
Good organization means your material is presented in a logical, systematic manner.
This helps your audience understand you without reading your words over and over,
trying to sort out what you’re really trying to say.
When writing or speaking is not well organized, audiences become easily confused or
impatient, and may stop reading or listening. Even if you’re providing useful, relevant
information, your audience may underestimate its value and your own credibility.
Chapter 6 is full of suggestions on how to organize well. Problems with organization are
relatively easy to fix, and the payoffs are enormous. In these high-tempo environments, a
little effort on your part will save your audience a lot of time and pain.

e CLEAR: COMMUNICATE WITH CLARITY AND MAKE EACH WORD COUNT
This principle covers two interrelated ideas. First, to communicate clearly, we need to
understand the rules of language—how to spell and pronounce words, and how to
assemble and punctuate sentences. Second, we should get to the point, not hide our ideas
in a jungle of words.
People are quick to judge, and mangled, incorrect language can cripple your credibility
and limit acceptance of your ideas. Acceptable English is part of the job, so commit to
improving any problems you may have. Developing strong language skills is a lot like
developing strong muscles—steady commitment produces steady improvement. Always
remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal.
Grammar scares most of us, but the good news is that many common mistakes can be
corrected by understanding a few rules. Start by scanning our section on editing
sentences, phrases and words on pages 95-101. If you want to dig deeper, then check out
some of the books and Internet sites that address grammar and writing—contact your
local librarian or our References section for some suggestions.
Using language correctly is only half of the battle, though—many Air Force writers and
speakers cripple themselves with bureaucratic jargon, big words and lots of passive voice.
These bad habits make it hard to understand the message. See Chapter 7 pages 73-88 for
some suggested cures to these problems.

f UNDERSTANDING: UNDERSTAND YOUR AUDIENCE AND ITS
EXPECTATIONS
If you want to share an idea with others, it helps to understand their current knowledge,
views and level of interest in the topic. If you’ve been asked to write a report, it helps to
understand the expected format and length of the response, the due date, the level of
formality and any staffing requirements. It’s easy to see how mistakes in understanding
your audience can lead to communication problems, and I’m sure you’ve watched others
make this mistake. Check out Chapter 3 for some helpful hints on audience analysis.

g SUPPORTED: USE LOGIC AND                            sup·port n information that
SUPPORT TO MAKE YOUR POINT                            substantiates a position.
                                                      v to furnish evidence for a position.
Most writers and speakers try to inform or
persuade their audience. Part of the
communicator’s challenge is to assemble and organize information to help build his or
her case. Support and logic are the tools used to build credibility and trust with our
audience.
Nothing cripples a clearly written, properly punctuated paper quicker than a fractured fact
or a distorted argument. Avoiding this pitfall is most difficult, even for good writers and
speakers. Logic is tough to teach and learn because it challenges the highest levels of
human intellect—the ability to think in the abstract. We slip into bad habits at an early
age, and it takes effort to break them. Chapter 4 provides practical advice on how to use
support and logic to enhance your effectiveness as a speaker and how to avoid common
mistakes.

SUMMARY
In this chapter, we defined communication as the process of sharing ideas, information,
and messages with others, and described how effective communication enables military
personnel to work together. To help writers and speakers stay on target, we introduced
five FOCUS principles of effective communication. In the next chapter, we’ll describe a
systematic approach to help you attain these principles and meet your communication
goals.

  This chapter covers:
     •   A systematic process to help achieve communication success.
     •   How this process helps attain FOCUS principles from Chapter 1.
     •   Where to find detailed information on each step in later chapters.


Chapter 1 introduced five FOCUS principles of good communication. In this chapter, we’ll
introduce a seven-step approach to hitting the target. Here you’ll get the big picture introduction,
but later chapters will describe each of the seven steps in greater detail.
You can tailor the steps to your own style and approach, but completing each of them will
increase your chances of speaking and writing success. These steps are not always used in
sequence, and for long and complicated assignments you may find yourself moving back and
forth between steps. That’s OK—it’s better to deviate from a plan, than to have no plan at all.

c ANALYZE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE
                              “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”
                                                         — Proverbs 29:18
Too many writers launch into their project without a clear understanding of their purpose
or audience. This is a shame—a few minutes spent on this step can save hours of
frustration later, and help determine whether you end up looking like an eagle or a turkey.
You’re much more likely to hit the target if you know what and who you’re aiming at.
Carefully analyzing your purpose helps with FOCUS Principle #1: “Focused—answer the
question, the whole question and nothing but the question.” In some cases, if you take a
hard look at the purpose you might find that a formal paper or briefing might not be
needed. You’d be startled at how many briefings, paper documents and electronic
messages are processed in a typical day in a MAJCOM or wing. Formal communication
takes effort and costs money—make sure you don’t unnecessarily add to everybody’s
workload.
If you take the time to “understand your audience” (FOCUS Principle #4) and think about
their current knowledge, interest and motives, you’ll be better able to tailor your message
so that you’ll accomplish your purpose, regardless of what it is. Instructing a hostile
audience about changes in medical benefits will be different than inspiring a friendly
audience at a Veteran’s Day celebration, and writing for the general’s signature will be
different than writing for the base newspaper. Chapter 3 has lots of helpful suggestions
about analyzing purpose and audience.
d RESEARCH YOUR TOPIC
               “Truth is generally the best vindication against slander.”
                                                     — Abraham Lincoln
Remember that FOCUS Principle #5 states good communication should be supported
with information relevant to your point. Step Two—“Research your topic”—gives you
the raw material to build your case.
For many of us, “research” sounds intimidating—it brings back memories of painful
school projects and hostile librarians who wouldn’t let us sneak coffee into the building.
Don’t let the idea of research scare you. In the context of the seven-step approach,

                                                          Seven Steps to Effective Communication


research is the process of digging up information that supports your communication
goals. Think of it as “doing your homework” to get smart on your communication topic.
Chapter 4 is full of helpful advice on how to approach the challenge. For those of you
interested in academic research, Appendix 2 has additional information on the topic.

e SUPPORT YOUR IDEAS
               “If you can’t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bull.”
                                                                  — Anonymous
Often our communication goal involves persuasion. In such cases, throwing information
at our audiences isn’t enough—we have to assemble and arrange our facts to support our
position. Different kinds of information gathered during the research process can be used
to form a logical argument. A logical argument is not a disagreement or a fight—it’s
how we assemble information to make decisions and solve problems.
At the same time we are trying to persuade others, others are trying to persuade us and
not all their arguments are airtight. A logical fallacy is a weakness or failure in the logic
of an argument. Chapter 5 describes logical arguments and several common logical
fallacies—allowing you to recognize mistakes in other’s arguments and avoid them in
your own.
Building logical arguments are part of everyday life. We build arguments when we
decide which new car to buy, who to nominate for a quarterly award or how we should
spend our training budget. You’ll find that many of the ideas described in Chapter 5 are
part of the way you think, even if you didn’t know the formal terminology.

f ORGANIZE AND OUTLINE
       “Organizing is what you do before you do something, so that when you do it,
       it’s not all mixed up.”
                                — Christopher Robin in A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh
You know your purpose and audience, you’ve done your homework—it’s time to deliver
your message, right? Not so fast! Before starting to write sentences and paragraphs (or
deliver your speech), you’ll save time and frustration by organizing your thoughts and
developing an outline of how you are going to present your information.
Successful communicators organize their material logically and in a sequence that leads
their audience from one point to the next. Audiences often “tune out” a speaker or writer
who rambles on without a logical pattern. Poorly organized essays are a common
complaint in both civilian and military schools. Save yourself and your audience a lot of
pain—read Chapter 6 to learn different patterns and techniques to organize and outline
your material.
FOCUS Principle #2 states that good communication should be organized so that the
audience can efficiently understand your point. You’ve taken the first steps towards
accomplishing this principle when you take the time to organize and outline your work
before starting to write … but how you actually draft and edit paragraphs will take you
the rest of the way.

                       DRAFTING AND EDITING:
                 WHEN THE FINGERS HIT THE KEYBOARD
The first four steps are identical for both writing and speaking assignments, but the
drafting and editing processes are somewhat different for the two forms of
communication. In this section we’ll describe the steps from a writing perspective, and
Chapters 9 and 10 will describe how the steps are adapted for Air Force speaking.

g DRAFT
               “Writing is easy. All you do is stare at a blank sheet of paper until drops
               of blood form on your forehead.”
                                                                           — Gene Fowler
When we think about the writing process, we immediately think of drafting sentences and
paragraphs. If you’re uncomfortable with your writing skills, this step usually causes the
most anxiety. The good news is that your work on Steps 1-4 will make the drafting
process less painful and more efficient.
Once you’ve completed the preliminaries and are ready to write, there are several
practical ways to ensure you connect with your readers.
•  First, get to the point quickly—use one or more introductory paragraphs to state your
purpose up front. Most Air Force readers don’t have the time or patience to read a staff
paper written like a mystery novel with a surprise ending.
•  Second, organize your paragraphs so the readers know where you’re leading them,
and use transitions to guide them along.
•  Third, make sure your sentences are clear and direct. Cut through the jargon and
passive voice, use the right word for the job and don’t make them wade through an
overgrown jungle of flowery words.
•  Finally, summarize your message in a concluding paragraph that connects all the dots
and makes the message feel complete.
Chapter 7 is full of practical advice on drafting, and it takes a top-down approach. It
begins with preliminaries such as writing tone and formats, transitions to paragraph
construction, provides practical tips on writing clear, vigorous sentences, then concludes
with advice on overcoming writer’s block.
h EDIT
Experienced writers know that editing should be a separate, distinct process from
drafting. When you draft, you create something new. When you edit, you shift from
creator to critic. This change in roles can be tough, and no one wants to admit that his
baby is ugly. Remember that criticism and judgment are inevitable in communication.
The better you are at critically evaluating and correcting your own writing, the fewer
people will be doing it for you.

                                                        Seven Steps to Effective Communication


There are two important aspects of the editing process—WHAT you are editing for, and
HOW to edit efficiently. What to edit for is simple—remember those FOCUS principles
from Chapter 1? How to edit is a little more complicated, but we recommend starting
with the big picture and working down to details like spelling and punctuation.
Ironically, many people do just the opposite; they focus on details first. Some even think
that editing is all about the details. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Though
details are part of editing, they’re only part of the puzzle.

i FIGHT FOR FEEDBACK AND GET APPROVAL
               “Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you’d have
               preferred to talk.”
                                                                          — Doug Larson
When you’ve completed the editing process and done what you can to improve your
communication, it’s time to move outside yourself to get feedback. We are all limited in
our ability to criticize our own work, and sometimes an outside opinion can help us see
how to improve or strengthen our communication. Your objective is to produce the best
possible product; don’t let pride of authorship and fear of criticism close your mind to
suggestions from other people. Also, what we write or say at work often must be
approved by our chain of command through a formal coordination process. Your
supervisor needs to see it, the executive officer needs to see it, then the big boss, and so
on…. Chapter 9 provides tips on how to give and receive feedback and how to manage
the coordination process.

SUMMARY
In this chapter, we summarized a systematic process—Seven Steps to Effective
Communication—that will help you achieve the five FOCUS principles. These steps
will help you improve your writing and speaking products. Each step is described in

     •   Audience analysis—know yourself, your unit, and the audience.
     •   Tips for success with your audience.



In Chapter 2, we introduced the Seven Steps for Effective Communication. Now we’re going to
discuss the first of these steps in further detail. First and most importantly, you can save yourself
a lot of work by asking yourself if the PowerPoint briefing, memo, meeting, e-mail, you name it,
is going to help get the mission done or a task accomplished. In today’s fast-past work
environment, we don’t need to create unnecessary work for anyone.

Once you’re clear on the need for communication, Step 1 requires you to get clear on your
purpose and audience. As you’ll see in this chapter, these are not two distinct categories. The
characteristics of your audience will influence all parts of your message, and your purpose often
involves influencing your audience.
KEY QUESTIONS
Masters in the art of communication stay focused on their objective and approach audience
analysis seriously. The more you know about your audience, the more comfortable you will feel
writing that memo or delivering that briefing to the commander. Where do you start in this?
Here are some questions to help you begin to analyze your purpose and audience and get you on
the right track. We’ll discuss many of them in more detail later in the chapter.
•  What is the overall purpose of the communication? Are you trying to make a change in your
audience? Are you writing just to inform your audience?
•   If you had one sentence or 30 seconds to explain your specific objective, what would you
write or say?
•   What format are you using to communicate? How much time do you have to prepare?
•  Is there anything unusual about the time and place your audience will receive your
communication? (i.e., is it 1600 on a Friday before a holiday weekend?) A lengthy informative e-
mail sent out late on a Friday afternoon may not be appreciated or even worse—not read!
•  Who will read this communication? Your boss? Your subordinates? Civilians? The
answers will have a direct bearing on the tone and formality of your message.
•   What are the education levels, career fields and areas of expertise of your readers/listeners?
•   Do you need to supply any background information, explanation of terms, or other
information to your audience? Does your audience have experience with the ideas and concepts
you are presenting?
•   What does the audience think of you? Are you known and trusted?
•   Is your audience motivated to hear/read your communication?
•   Do you need to coordinate your communication?
•   Are you making promises your organization will have to keep?

                                                                   Analyzing Purpose and Audience


WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?
Most Air Force writing or speaking falls under one of the following purposes: to direct, inform,
persuade or inspire. Your task is to think about the message you want to send (the “what”) and
make some sort of determination what your purpose is (the “why”). Some communication has
primary and secondary purposes, so don’t kill yourself trying to make sure your message fits
neatly in one of these categories. Once you decide the purpose, you’ll know where to place the
emphasis and what the tone of your communication should be. Here’s a quick synopsis of these
purposes and how they might work for you.
•   To Direct. Directive communication is generally used to pass on information describing
actions you expect to be carried out by your audience. The emphasis in directive communication
is clear, concise directions and expectations of your audience.
•   To Inform. The goal of informative communication is to pass on information to the
audience. The communication is successful if the audience understands the message exactly the
way the speaker or writer intended. The emphasis in informative communication is clear, direct
communication with accurate and adequate information tailored to the education and skill levels
of the audience. Audience feedback and interaction may be appropriate in some situations to
make sure they “got the message.”
•   To Persuade. Persuasive communication is typically used when you are trying to “sell”
your audience on a new idea, new policy, new product or change in current operations. Though
emotions are one tool of persuasion, most persuasive communication in the workplace requires
convincing evidence put together in a logical way. Audience analysis is critical, because
different audiences have different views on what evidence is convincing. Since the purpose is to
guide your audience to a specific course of action, you cannot overlook tone and delivery.
Chapter 5, Supporting Your Ideas, describes how to build your persuasive skills.
•   To Inspire. One final purpose for writing or speaking that doesn’t get much attention but is
frequently used in the military is to inspire. As you climb the leadership ladder you will
increasingly be requested to perform retirements, promotions, commander’s calls—opportunities
where you will want to inspire the audience with your profound insight on someone’s career or
possibly your philosophy on leadership. Although protocol drives portions of these events, the
opportunity to send a personal message and inspire the audience should not be overlooked. The
emphasis in inspirational communication is delivery, a thorough knowledge of your topic and
likewise your audience.
Regardless of whether your mission is to inspire, direct, persuade or inform, there are general
principles that apply to almost all communication. See “Tips for Success” at the end of this
chapter to round out your portfolio for analyzing purpose and audience.

GET CLEAR ON YOUR BOTTOM LINE: DRAFTING A PURPOSE STATEMENT
OK, we’re making progress. You have a feel for the general purpose of your communication (to
direct, inform, persuade or inspire), but what is your “bottom line” you need to communicate to
your audience? If you have difficulty nailing down your objective, your audience will be equally
confused.
One way to make sure you’re clear on your objective is to write a purpose statement, which is
one sentence that captures the essence of what you’re trying to do—your “bottom line.” It’s the
one sentence you’d keep if you were allowed only one.
Developing a clear purpose statement will help you in two ways:
•   It will help you FOCUS as you develop your communication.
•   It will help your audience FOCUS when you deliver your message.
Think about it; your audience wants a clear statement of your position and where you are going.
This is especially true when your audience consists of higher-ranking individuals with many
demands on their time and issues requiring their attention.
Let’s look at some examples of draft purpose statements:
Purpose Statement: To inform individuals in the Civil Engineering Squadron about new
policies on hazardous waste disposal.
Purpose Statement: To encourage (inspire) at-risk high school students to work hard, stay in
school and have hope in the future.
Purpose Statement: To persuade the division chief to buy three laptops for use during official
travel.
As we’ll mention in Chapter 5, you may update your purpose statement after researching your
topic. (For example, you might find out you need four laptops, not three.) Even if it isn’t locked
down, a draft statement will help guide your research and support efforts.

ANALYZING PURPOSE: OTHER ISSUES
Knowing your “bottom line” is not the end of analyzing purpose. Here are some questions you
want to ask to make sure you look at all parts of the equation. The answers will help refine your
purpose and shape your entire project.
•   What format will I use to communicate? Today’s commanders are increasingly more
vigilant of the value of their troops’ time—and their own. Make sure that the communication is
required and that you select the most appropriate format for delivery. Think about how much
time you will have to deliver your message before you go any further. Will you have 2 minutes
in a staff meeting with the general that starts in 1 hour? One hour at your commander’s call next
week?
•   How much time do I have to prepare my communication? The breadth and scope of a
report your boss needs the next day will be different than a staff project due by the end of the
fiscal year. What’s the suspense? How long is it going to take to write the report? Be sure to
budget adequate time for all “Seven Steps,” especially “Researching your Topic” (Step 2),


                                              – 20 –
                                                                     Analyzing Purpose and Audience


“Drafting” (Step 5), and “Editing” (Step 6). If coordination is part of the master plan, it will also
affect your timelines.
There’s more to successful communication than getting clear on purpose. There’s always that
human factor, and in the communication game that translates to analyzing your audience.

AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: THE HUMAN FACTOR
As stated in Chapter 1, all communication involves a sender, a message and an audience. “A”
sends the message (either verbally or in writing) with a specific intended meaning to “B.” “B”
receives the message, processes the message and attaches perceived meaning to the message.
This is where it gets interesting. Did the intended message actually get to “B” (or not to “B”—
that is the question)? Was the perceived meaning what “A” intended? If not, why not? Ah, thus
begins our journey into audience analysis.
KNOW YOURSELF: Before you look around, you need to look in the mirror. Knowing your
strengths and weaknesses will help you meet your communication goals.
•   Do you do better with certain communication formats than others? Be aware of your
personal strengths. If you know that you’d rather be buried in a pile of fire ants than speak in
public, you may choose to send your message in writing—if that’s an option. If not, spend some
time in Chapter 10 and improve your speaking skills!
•  Are you an inexperienced briefer that needs notes? If so, make sure they are written in a
format that is easy to refer to while the general is listening intently and watching the beads of
sweat form on your forehead.
•   Do you have expertise in the area? If so … great! But don’t lose your audience with lots of
lingo and unfamiliar jargon. You may think it’s cool; others may not. On the other hand, if you
lack expertise in the area, you will need to focus your research to beef up on unfamiliar territory.
Remember, there’s always someone in the crowd that knows as much or more—no pressure!
•  What is your relationship with the audience? Are you personally familiar with them? You
may be able to present a more informal briefing or written document if you know this is
acceptable to the audience. See the section on tone for more guidance.
KNOW YOUR ORGANIZATION: Once you’ve taken a hard look at yourself, you need to
take a look at your work environment and your organization. In the military we rarely act or
speak in a vacuum. Often we represent our organization, unit or functional area and must
understand them and accommodate their views, capabilities or concerns in our communications.
The following questions may help bring things into focus.
•   Am I promising something my organization can deliver? (You can substitute boss or
personnel for organization.) If not, why are you bothering?
•   Is what I’m saying consistent with previous policy or operating philosophy? If not, you need
to shift to a persuasive tone and explain why your approach warrants a change or breach in
policy.

•  Who needs to coordinate on this? Who else owns a piece of this action? The coordination
game can be a mind maze, but if you leave a key player out, you will undoubtedly hear about it.

KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE: The receiving audience falls into one of four sub-categories.
Depending on the type of communication and coordination necessary, you may or may not deal
with each and every one of these.
•   Primary receiver: The person you directly communicate with either verbally or in writing.
•   Secondary receiver: People you indirectly communicate with through the primary
receivers. Let’s say, for example, that you’re a group commander. You send a written memo to
the unit’s first sergeants (primary receivers) identifying establishments near your base that are
now designated “off limits” to the troops. The first sergeants post these areas in the squadron
orderly rooms for “widest dissemination.” The secondary receivers would be the troops that read
(and hopefully heed!) the commander’s directive.
•   Key decision makers: These are the most powerful members of the audience … the ones
that really make the decisions. Knowing who they are will help focus your attention and
potentially your delivery in larger briefings and certain written communication.
• Gatekeepers: These are people in the chain that typically review the communication before
it reaches your intended audience. Knowing who they are and what their expectations are can
save you embarrassment and help ensure your success in the long run. We all know that
administrative assistants are keenly aware of their bosses’ preferences. Listen to their inputs!
         “Therefore I say: Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never
         be in peril. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of
         winning or losing are equal. If ignorant of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain in
         every battle to be in peril.”
                                                                                        — Sun Tzu
Sun Tzu was ahead of his time. He knew the importance of audience analysis! We’re not
recommending you view your audience as “the enemy,” but Sun Tzu had the right idea. Read on
for some final tips for connecting with your audience.

                                                                   Analyzing Purpose and Audience


TIPS FOR SUCCESS WITH YOUR AUDIENCE
• RANK—don’t be afraid of it. Differences in military rank can be a real barrier to
communication in the Air Force. Too many of us become tongue-tied when communicating with
those senior in rank, and cursory or impatient with those who are junior in rank. We must
constantly remind ourselves we are all communicative equals and should strive to be candid,
direct and respectful with everyone.
•   JARGON—tailor to your audience. Don’t overestimate the knowledge/expertise of your
readers, but don’t talk down to them either. Be careful with excessive use of career-field specific
jargon and acronyms. Yes, they are second nature to most of us in the military, but you can lose
your audience with unfamiliar terminology.
•   Be INCLUSIVE—remember our diverse force. Sometimes we inadvertently exclude
members of our audience by falling into communication traps involving references to race,
religion, ethnicity or sex. Remember this concept when designing your visual support. Your
visual aids should show a range of people who represent our Air Force. Avoid traditional
stereotyping of jobs based on sex or race. Inclusiveness also applies to humor. Humor is not
universal, and joke telling is the biggest area where otherwise sensitive people unknowingly get
themselves into trouble. Knowing your audience and adhering to good taste and sensitivity will
keep you in check.
•  TONE—it’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. Closely tied to the purpose of your
communication is the tone you take with your audience. Speakers have gestures, voice and
movements to help them communicate. Writers only have words on paper. How many times
have you seen colleagues get bent out of shape over a misunderstood
e-mail? Why? Because the nonverbal signals available during face-to-face communication are
absent. Recognize this disadvantage in written communication and pay close attention to it.
Words that carry uncomplimentary insinuations (ignorant, opinionated) make negative
suggestions (failure, impossible) or call up unpleasant thoughts (liable, unsuccessful) can
potentially defeat your purpose.
•    COURTESY—be polite (please!). The first rule of writing is to be polite. Forego anger,
criticism and sarcasm—strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Try not to deliberately embarrass
someone if it can be avoided with a more tactful choice of words. Rudeness is a weak person’s
imitation of strength.
•   Make it PERSONAL—but it’s not all about you! When appropriate, use pronouns to
create instant rapport, show concern and keep your reader involved. Using pronouns also keeps
your writing from being monotonous, dry and abstract. The pronouns you’ll probably use the
most are you, yours, we, us and our. Use I, me, and my sparingly. One rule of business writing
is “put your audience first,” so when possible, avoid using I as the first word of an opening
sentence and avoid starting two sentences in a row with we or I unless you’re trying to hammer
home a point. These guidelines will help you to avoid sounding self-centered and repetitive.
•   Be POSITIVE. To cultivate a positive tone, give praise where praise is due; acknowledge
acceptance before focusing on additional improvements; and express criticism in the form of
helpful questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or clear directives rather than
accusations. When having to give bad news, lead with a neutral comment before jumping in
with the bad news. Save the positive for the closing by offering alternatives, etc. Stay away

from using clichés, restating the refusal, hiding bad news in a fog of wordiness and inappropriate
apologizing. Your audience always appreciates sincerity and honesty. To get you started
thinking “positive,” listen for the tone of the following sentences:
    Commanders will recommend only qualified persons for training. [Constructive]
    Commanders may not recommend for training any person who is not qualified. [Destructive]

    Positive                                                Negative

•   FORMAL (“To be, or not to be”) versus INFORMAL (“hey dude”). Different
communication situations require different levels of formality. The informal tone is more like a
conversation between you and your reader, and it is characterized by clear, direct, active
language. In today’s Air Force, most of your writing will be informal, though ceremonies and
awards may require more elaborate (formal) language. Whether your tone is formal or informal,
you still need to follow the accepted rules of grammar. In any case, the best advice is to keep
your writing clear, concise and simple. We’ll cover this in more detail under “drafting clear and
concise sentences” in Chapter 7.

SUMMARY
This chapter covered the key concepts of analyzing your purpose and audience—the first step
towards developing effective communication. Getting clear on your purpose early in the process
helps you focus your preparation. Taking the time to understand your audience will help you
tailor your message to their knowledge, interests and motives. Once you’ve determined your
purpose, nailed down your purpose statement, and carefully analyzed your audience, you need to
do some homework on your topic…
                                                            …it’s called R-E-S-E-A-R-C-H.

                                              YOUR TOPIC




 This chapter covers:
     •   Things to think about before getting lost in the library.
     •   Where to go to get information.
     •   Internet searches.
     •   Tips for evaluating sources.
     •   A list of useful references for Air Force personnel.


Whether your communication goal is to persuade or inform, you’ll need more than fancy
words to win the day—you’ll need substance as well as style. Once you’re clear on your
purpose and audience (Step 1), you’ll need to research your topic to uncover information
that will support your communication goals.
In some ways, research has never been easier—electronic databases and the Internet give
us access to quantities of information unthinkable 20 years ago. But new opportunities
bring new challenges. With so much information, how do we find the data we need to
meet our purpose? And how do we know a source should be trusted? This chapter gives
some basic suggestions that will be useful in nearly any assignment.

and Audience, you should have a good idea of
what you need, but sometimes your purpose
and scope may evolve as you learn more about the topic. You may also need to do some
preliminary research just to get smart enough to scope out the effort. If you’ve been
handed a vague topic, try to get some feel for how far you should go in your research,
what you can realistically do, and where you should stop.
•   Assign yourself a deadline for the research effort.
It’s easy to get lost in the research process. Don’t do an outstanding job of data retrieval,
then a marginal job on the presentation because you ran out of time. For larger projects,
assign yourself a time budget for the data-gathering process.
• Ask the boss—Are there unusual sources or knowledgeable individuals you
should seek out?
Your boss gave you this research problem for a reason—he or she thought that you were
capable of finding the answer. Even if you can eventually find the answer on your own,
you might save some time by asking for suggestions on where to start. An early vector
could be particularly helpful if you’re working on a practical problem that’s “local,”
specialized, or requires information that isn’t available to the general public.
•   How much do I know about this topic and what are my biases?
Before you look for answers outside yourself, look in the mirror first. You may have
valuable knowledge about an assigned research project, but you need to acknowledge and
guard against your own biases in working a research problem. It’s tough to keep an
unbiased attitude; in fact, it’s probably impossible if you know anything about the subject
in question. The good news is once you realize you may be biased, you’ll be less likely to
automatically dismiss data that’s not consistent with your personal philosophy.

                                                                      Researching Your Topic


WHERE SHOULD I LOOK FOR INFORMATION, AND WHERE DO I START?
Three things will probably influence how you approach the data gathering process:
•   Your research topic.
•   Your experience as a researcher, and your expertise in this research area.
•   Your experience with Internet and electronic database searches.
If you are seeking information that’s publicly available and are comfortable with
electronic search tools, you’d probably start with the Internet. If you are dealing with a
local problem, a sensitive topic, or feel uncomfortable with the research process or search
technology, you’ll probably want to start by talking to another person. Regardless of the
order you approach them, here are four major categories of information:

c COWORKERS AND BASE PERSONNEL that you can easily meet face-to-face
may be subject matter experts on your topic. They may also know where you can get
valuable information on local projects, even if they are not subject matter experts
themselves. The person who gave you the research assignment may also be a resource.
Get clear on the big picture and be specific when you ask others for information—you’ll
save everybody’s time.

d YOUR OFFICE FILES AND REFERENCES, both in paper form and on your
computer network, may be valuable sources of information. We haven’t totally evolved
to a paperless workplace, but in most offices, a great deal of current information on
policies and procedures is contained on the office computer network. Paper files are still
used for correspondence, sensitive information and older archives. Each office has its
own policies—check them out.
In addition to office files, larger units typically produce unit histories that can be very
useful for staff research. They tell what happened, when it happened, why it happened
and where it happened. A good history also shows how past experiences relate to current
plans and how recent experiences relate to future plans.

e THE INTERNET—Become an instant expert on anything without leaving your
chair! The amount of information available from your desktop computer has exploded
over the last decade. The web can be intimidating for those who didn’t grow up with
computers, but set your fears aside—the payoffs are enormous. The two biggest
challenges in using the Internet are (1) finding the information you need, and (2) sorting
out what you can believe and what you can’t. Remember—anyone with an ax to grind
can build a web site, and there’s no one out there checking to see if the facts are even
remotely correct. It’s an interesting environment—information ranges from official,
credible sources to the lunatic fringe, and web sites may appear and disappear without
notice. Later in this chapter, we’ll give you details on searching the net and evaluating
what you find.

f THE LIBRARY—Libraries have unique benefits for the researcher:
•   Librarians (real, honest-to-goodness humans!) who can help you find information and
    give basic research advice.
•   Free access to books and periodicals—most of which aren’t available on the Internet.
•   Free access to the Internet and electronic databases.
•   Interlibrary loans that let you get at nearly any book in print—even at small libraries
Though the Internet is a convenient source of information, a great deal of information
needed for serious research is not on the Internet—it’s still found in books and
periodicals. Libraries purchase these sources, and then give you free access to them.
Isn’t America great?
Someone other than the author has critically reviewed most information you find in a
library. The end result is less trash and outright errors than you find out on the Internet.
Public libraries are available in most bases and cities … and don’t forget about your local
college or university! Even if you can’t borrow books, many of them allow nonstudents
to visit and read books.
“Virtual libraries” are another important resource—they’re web sites that give you access
to several library resources. Though these can be reached through an Internet browser,
the information meets the same quality standards as the material in the physical library.
Air University Library’s World Wide Web page—PortAUL—is an example of a virtual
library that contains several on-line research tools and traditional library resources. They
include access to search engines, full-text bibliographies, online library assistance, full-
text periodicals, relevant research links and assignment assistance for the Professional
Military Education (PME) schools located at Maxwell Air Force Base. PortAUL is
available online at http://www.au.af.mil/au/aul/aul.htm.

HOW CAN I ACCESS THE INTERNET TO GATHER DATA FOR MY RESEARCH?
•   For the computer phobic: the absolute minimum you need to know.
There is nothing to fear but fear itself. But seriously, accessing the Internet is easy …
even if you don’t want to spend any time learning about it. If someone gives you a web
site address, just open your Internet browser software and type it in exactly as it is given.
If you DON’T know exactly what you want, you’ll need to use a search engine to find
web sites that have useful information. Search engines use key words and phrases to
search the Internet. Some allow you to type in questions, and most have catalogues that
sort a limited number of sites by topic.
One popular and user-friendly search tool worth mentioning is Google. To get to Google,
simply type www.google.com into your Internet browser. Once you are at the site, type
in a few words or phrases that describe the main concepts of a topic. Google only returns
web pages that contain all the words you type in, making it easy to refine or narrow your
search.
•   Refining your keyword searches to improve search efficiency.

Once you’re comfortable with the Internet, you may want to learn some tricks to improve
your search efficiency.
Use “and” or the plus symbol “+” to make sure that your search engine gives you pages
that have all the words you enter. For example, either of these searches will keep you
away from sites that describe military aviation, but not military aviation accidents.
       Military AND aviation AND accidents
       Military+aviation+accidents
Use “not” or the minus symbol “-” to eliminate sites with unrelated words that clutter
your search. For example, if you’re looking for Windows 95 information but keep
getting Windows 98 or Windows 3.1 sites, you can eliminate them by using the following
search:
       Windows -98 -3.1
       Windows NOT 98 NOT 3.1                                      Fun fact: The words AND,
                                                                   OR and NOT, when used
The Google search engine requires a space before the               between keywords in a

                                                                   Boolean operators are

       Operation+Desert+Storm

Combining Operations: Once you’ve got the basics down, you can combine operations.
For example:
       “Operation Desert Storm” AND “Air Operations”

gives you relevant sites on the war in the air. If you don’t want to hear about Gulf War
Syndrome, you can subtract it out:
       “Operation Desert Storm” + “Air Operations” – “gulf war syndrome”
Internet searches require some judgment. If you don’t use enough keywords to narrow
your topic, you’ll end up spending a lot of time scanning sites and trying to find the ones
that are most relevant. On the other hand, a tightly focused search might overlook a
relevant citation. There are no easy answers, but through trial and error you’ll probably
find the balance that works for your particular topic.
Search Engine Options. If you’re having trouble finding material on your topic, you
might try more than one search engine. Different search engines may yield different
results, and some specialize in certain fields of study. To find out more details, do an
Internet search for current rankings and recommendations.
Though anything on the web is subject to change, here are some of the top rated search
engines at the time of publication: Google, Alltheweb.com (fast), Yahoo, MSN Search,
Lycos, Ask Jeeves, AOL Search, Teoma, Wisenut, Altavista and Netscape Search.

Specialized Military Search Engines. Several search engines located on the Internet are
tailored to search for military and government information. FirstGov, Jane’s Defence
Discovery Search, Searchmil.com and Google!Unclesam may be useful for such topics.
Call’s Military Domain Search Engine (http://call-search.leavenworth.army.mil/) also
searches multiple military related sites, including CALL, Army, Army Field Manuals,
Army regulations, Corps of Engineers, Early Bird, Joint Service, Mitre Corp., NATO,
Navy, Rand, USAF, USCG, and USMC sites.
Metasearch Engines. Meta search engines search other search engines. Since they
often search smaller, less well-known search engines and specialized sites, they are a
good choice if you are struggling to find relevant materials on your topic. Again,
consider an Internet search to find out if one of these engines specializes in your field of
interest. Flipper, Iboogie, Infogrid, Infonetware Real term search, Ithaki, Ixquick,
Kartoo, Profusion, Qbsearch, Query Srver, Searchonline, Vivisimo, Dogpile, Excite,
Metacrawler and Webcrawler.

EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF INTERNET SOURCES
Once you’ve found web sites on your topic, you need to decide which ones to take
seriously. Some feel that a positive attitude is key to success in life, but in the case of the
Internet, your attitude should be deep suspicion unless the source is official and you can
confirm the site is what it pretends to be. There are lots of credible web sources with a
known pedigree (the Air University Library, for example), but there are also many sites
that are either factually incorrect or deliberately misleading.
When looking at a web site, ask yourself some questions. Who is responsible for the web
site, and can you confirm that? How distant are the authors from the “event” they are
writing about? (See page 32 for a description of primary, secondary and tertiary sources.)
What are the authors’ motives? Are they part of a group whose goal is to influence
public opinion or to sell you something? Are there things about the site that make you
question its accuracy, objectivity or currency? Take a look at the checklist on the next
page for more specifics to add to your paranoia.
Another way to build confidence in the information you gather is to seek confirmation of
the facts from multiple sources. The weaker the source, the more important it is to get a
second opinion before believing it. Most of us instinctively do this in the workplace—we
have a very short list of people we absolutely believe every time they open their mouths
(these folks usually don’t talk much!), we have a longer list of people who are right most
of the time, and then there’s usually one or two who have no credibility whatsoever. If
the issue is important and you want to be sure, try to get the answer in stereo.


               The less you know about a topic, the more authoritative the
               sources sound.

                          How to Recognize an Informational Web Page
An informational web page is one whose purpose is to present factual information. The URL Address
frequently ends in .edu or .gov, as many of these pages are sponsored by educational institutions or
government agencies.
Examples: Dictionaries, thesauri, directories, transportation schedules, calendars of events, statistical
data, and other factual information such as reports, presentations of research or information about a
topic.
Questions to Ask About the Web Page
NOTE: The greater number of questions listed below answered “yes,” the more likely it is you can
determine whether the source is of high information quality.
Criterion #1: AUTHORITY
Is it clear who is responsible for the contents of the page?
Is there a link to a page describing the purpose of the sponsoring organization?
Is there a way of verifying the legitimacy of the page’s sponsor? That is, is there a phone number or
postal address to contact for more information? (Simply an e-mail address is not enough.)
Is it clear who wrote the material and are the author’s qualifications for writing on this topic clearly
stated?
If the material is protected by copyright, is the name of the copyright holder given?
Criterion #2: ACCURACY
Are the sources for any factual information clearly listed so they can be verified in another source?
Is the information free of grammatical, spelling, and typographical errors? (These kinds of errors not
only indicate a lack of quality control, but can actually produce inaccuracies in information.)
Is it clear who has the ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the content of the material?
If there are charts and graphs containing statistical data, are they clearly labeled and easy to read?
Criterion #3: OBJECTIVITY
Is the information provided as a public service?
Is the information free of advertising?
If there is any advertising on the page, is it clearly differentiated from the informational content?
Criterion #4: CURRENCY
Are there dates on the page to indicate the following:
     When the page was written?
     When the page was first placed on the web?
     When the page was last revised?
Are there any other indications that the material is kept current?
If material is presented in graphs and/or charts, is it clearly stated when the data was gathered?
If the information is published in different editions, is it clearly labeled what edition the page is from?
Criterion #5: COVERAGE
Is there an indication that the page has been completed, and is not still under construction?
If there is a print equivalent to the web page, is there a clear indication of whether the entire work is
available on the Web or only parts of it?
If the material is from a work which is out of copyright (as is often the case with a dictionary or
thesaurus) has there been an effort to update the material to make it more current?

PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY SOURCES: HOW CLOSE IS A
SOURCE TO WHAT IT REPORTS?
When evaluating a source, one factor to consider is the distance between the writer and
his or her subject. Since people and their research are often misquoted, it’s better to refer
back to original material than rely on someone else’s interpretation of existing work.
This is true for research published in books and print journals, as well as Internet sites.
The material you find can be classified as either a primary, secondary or tertiary source.
A primary source is a first-hand account of an historical event, a physical artifact or
record of that event or a description of research written by the people that actually
performed it.
A secondary source is one step removed from the event or research. It documents the
findings of someone else who took the time to review primary sources.
A tertiary source summarizes findings published in secondary sources.
Let’s look at some examples. If you were doing research on a friendly fire incident,
primary sources would include interviews of the parties involved, radio recordings, gun
camera footage and black box recordings. The Summary of Official Findings published
by the investigation board would be a secondary source. A tertiary source might be a
magazine article that quoted the Summary of Official Findings as part of a larger
discussion on the topic.
If you wanted to learn about the foundations of logic and persuasion in Western culture, a
primary source would be essays on the subject by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, a
secondary source would be an academic textbook that refers back to these writings, and a
tertiary source would be a lecture given by an instructor that used the academic textbook
as a reference.
In general, primary and secondary sources are considered more reliable than tertiary
sources. Each level of interpretation can introduce potential errors or bias, and ideas can
be misquoted or quoted out of context. On the other hand, sometimes a tertiary source
might be useful to get a “big picture view” of a topic before you start slogging through
primary sources and secondary sources.
A List of Useful Resource Sources
In some situations, you may want to start your research by referring to one authoritative
and relevant source instead of searching the library or Internet for all possible sources of
information. This might be particularly useful for staff research, or for situations where
you want a quick and official answer to a relatively noncontroversial topic. We’ll
conclude this chapter with a list of sources that are either “official” in nature or involve
publications that include at least one layer of critical review.

SUMMARY
When you’re trying to inform or persuade others, you need to do your homework. In this
chapter, we covered the basics of how to research your topic and gather the data you
need. The Internet, the library, your office files, and your coworkers are all potential
sources of information. Modern technology and the Internet make it easier to gather data
than ever before, but remember that you need to critically evaluate your sources.
Research can be enjoyable and rewarding, but make sure you review your purpose, scope
and schedule before you begin—it helps you stay focused and keeps you from getting lost
in the data.

                                                        YOUR IDEAS



 This chapter covers:
     •   Logical arguments—what they are and how to build them.
     •   Types of evidence and characteristics of “good evidence.”
     •   Common problems with logic.
     •   Ethical issues with arguments.


Once you’ve researched your topic and collected information, you need to figure out how to use
what you’ve found to meet your communication goals. If you’re dealing with a controversial
question or problem, throwing facts at your audience won’t be enough—you’ll need to assemble
it into a logical argument that can stand up to critical attack. This chapter will give you some
helpful pointers on how to build an argument and support your ideas.
Logical arguments are instruments of power. They’re how you make things happen. It’s worth
the effort to understand some basics, even if some of this chapter makes your head hurt.


         “A moment’s thought would have shown him. But a moment is a long time, and
         thought is a painful process.”
                                                             — A.E. Housman

WHAT ARE LOGICAL ARGUMENTS, AND WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT?
When you present a solution to a problem or answer a controversial question, persuasion is part
of the assignment. There are different approaches to persuade members of your audience—you
can appeal to their emotions, their ability to reason or even your own credibility on the topic
being discussed. In the Air Force environment, your best approach to support your ideas and
persuade others is by building a solid logical argument.
Though the word “argument” is commonly used to describe a quarrel or disagreement, it also has
a more positive meaning—it’s a series of statements intended to persuade others. In this chapter,
when we use the term logical argument, we’re referring to a coherent set of statements that
provide a position and support for that position based on information and facts, not just
emotions.
Why should you care about all this stuff? First, you build logical arguments every day—when
you talk to a child about chores and allowance; when you talk to your boss about your workload
and schedules; and when you sort out how best to accomplish the mission. If you build strong
arguments, things are more likely to work out the way you think they should. Second, others are
aiming arguments at YOU every day—and some of them are pretty shaky. If you understand
how arguments are constructed and where they go wrong, you’re less likely to buy into
somebody else’s muddy thinking.

ELEMENTS OF A LOGICAL ARGUMENT
Logical arguments contain four elements:
                                                                 Different textbooks have
•   a claim                                                      different terms and approaches
•   evidence that supports the claim                             to describe logical arguments.
                                                                 This chapter uses terminology
•   warrants linking pieces of evidence to the claim             found in The Craft of

next section. Don’t panic if it doesn’t seem clear at first—
the example will help clarify each point.
THE CLAIM. Your claim is simply your position on an issue, your answer to a controversial
question or your recommendation for resolving a problem. In some academic writing, a claim is
also called a thesis.
EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE CLAIM. By definition, every argument has evidence
intended to give reasons for your claim. A less formal word for evidence is support. (The words
“support” and “evidence” are used interchangeably in this chapter.)
If a piece of evidence is questionable, it may be attacked as a subclaim. At that point, you either
have to provide additional evidence to prove your subclaim is true, or eliminate it from your
argument.

WARRANTS THAT LINK EVIDENCE TO THE CLAIM. With every piece of evidence,
there are often assumptions, either stated or unstated, that link the evidence to the claim and
explain why the evidence is relevant to the argument. These linking statements or concepts are
called warrants. Warrants are important because they can be potential weaknesses in an
argument.
QUALIFICATIONS. Sometimes the argument will have qualifications—conditions that limit
the claim. You can think of a qualification as a statement you attach to the claim with a big IF
statement. We often notice these qualifications as we critically look at the evidence we have and
realize its limitations.

ELEMENTS OF A LOGICAL ARGUMENT—A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE
Let’s use a real life example of a logical argument to show
                                                                 ev·i·dence: n the data by

to produce a logical argument.
CLAIM: We should invite Ms. Jane Doe to teach topic XYZ at this year’s class.
EVIDENCE, item #1: Ms. Doe has spent 26 years working with XYZ and is an expert in this
field.
WARRANT, item #1: Spending 26 years of working with XYZ makes her an expert. (Another
implied warrant is that we want an expert to teach topic XYZ.)
   If someone wanted to attack this bit of evidence, he might ask you to prove the fact that she’s
   spent 26 years in the field—let’s see a resume!
   If someone wanted to attack the underlying warrant, he may argue that she isn’t really an
   expert—maybe she’s been doing an entry-level job for 26 years.
   But let’s suppose that Ms. Doe is indeed an expert in the field and this is solid evidence.
EVIDENCE, item #2: Last year’s course directors all thought she did an excellent job.
WARRANT, item #2: These people know what they’re talking about.
   If someone wanted to challenge this evidence, he might ask you to produce letters of
   recommendation. How enthusiastic are the directors about the job she did?
   If someone wanted to attack the underlying warrant, he might question the course directors’
   judgment. Maybe they were new to the job and didn’t know much about the topic. Maybe
   they were TDY during the presentation, and were basing their recommendation on what they
   heard from others.
   In this case, let’s assume that the course directors are both credible and enthusiastic.

EVIDENCE, item #3: Ms. Doe is a very dynamic lecturer.
WARRANT, item #3: It’s good to have a dynamic lecturer.
   Recall that evidence you provide to support your claim can be attacked as a subclaim … and
   this last bit of evidence looks vulnerable. How do we know that Ms. Doe is a dynamic
   lecturer? To back it up, you’d have to “support your support” on item #3 with something like
   this:
SUBCLAIM: Ms. Doe is a very dynamic lecturer.
SUBCLAIM EVIDENCE #1: Students provided five times the amount of feedback than is
typical for a lecture.
SUBCLAIM WARRANT #1: Student interest is proportional to volume of feedback.
SUBCLAIM EVIDENCE #2: Ninety-two percent of feedback was very favorable, and 8
percent was very unfavorable.
SUBCLAIM WARRANT #2: Polarized feedback implies a dynamic lecture.
Well, this additional information really does back up the fact that Ms. Doe is a dynamic lecturer,
but it also indicates her views are controversial—8 percent of the student population really didn’t
like her presentation. You may believe that your school’s goal is education and not to make
every student happy, but you might qualify your claim with the following “IF” statement:
QUALIFICATION:
                       Ms. Jane Doe should be invited back to teach topic XYZ
                                            IF
                   it is acceptable to have a controversial speaker at the school.

TYPES OF EVIDENCE
As you see, individual pieces of evidence are used to build your argument. In this section, we’ll
identify some common types of evidence as well as approaches to help explain your ideas to
your audience.
A definition is a precise meaning or significance of a word or phrase. In an argument, it can be
helpful to establish a common frame of reference for important or ambiguous words, so don’t
underestimate the importance of definitions.
An example is a specific instance chosen to represent a larger fact in order to clarify an abstract
idea or support a claim. Good examples must be appropriate, brief and attention arresting.
Quite often they are presented in groups of two or three for impact.
Testimony uses the comments of recognized authorities to support your claim. These comments
can be direct quotations or paraphrases, but direct quotations tend to carry more weight with
listeners or readers. When using testimony as support, make sure the individuals being quoted
are both generally credible—no unknown relatives or convicted felons, please—and
knowledgeable in the field under discussion.

                                                                             Supporting Your Ideas


Statistics provide a summary of data that allows your audience to better interpret quantitative
information. Statistics can be very persuasive and provide excellent support if handled
competently. Keep them simple and easy to read and understand. Also, remember to round off
your statistics whenever possible and document the exact source of your statistics.
The persuasive power of statistics means that you need to be particularly careful to use them
properly. Many people will put blind trust in numbers and fall prey to people or papers that
spout numbers or statistical proof. (Ironically, people who work with numbers for a living are the
most cautious about trusting someone else’s statistics!)
Always, always examine the basic assumption(s) on which the analysis rests. Some of the most
compelling statistical arguments turn out to be intricate sand castles built on a foundation of
shaky assumptions. The math may be technically correct, but the assumptions can’t stand up to
scrutiny.
In their book Writing Arguments, John Ramage, John Bean and June Johnson define a fact as a
noncontroversial piece of data that can be confirmed by observation or by talking to communally
accepted authorities. The authors distinguish a fact from an inference, which is an interpretation
or explanation of the facts that may be reasonably doubted. They recommend that writers
distinguish facts from inferences and handle inferences as testimony.
Definitions, testimony, statistics and facts provide data that you can use to construct an
argument. This next category—explanation—can also be helpful in supporting your ideas.
Explanation makes a point plain or understandable or gives the cause of some effect. It can be
used to clarify your position or provide additional evidence to help make your case. The
following four techniques can be used as part of an explanation:
•  Analysis: The separation of a whole into smaller pieces for further study; clarifying a
complex issue by examining one piece at a time.
•   Comparison and Contrast: Comparison and Contrast are birds of similar feather. Use
comparison to dramatize similarities between two objects or situations and contrast to emphasize
differences.
•  Description: To tell about in detail, to paint a picture with words—typically more personal
and subjective than definition.

CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
               “There are two kinds of truth. There are real truths and there are
               made-up truths.”
                                          — Marion Barry, mayor of Washington DC,
                                                         on his arrest for drug use
Though different professions and academic fields have their own standards of what is “good”
evidence, there are some common characteristics to consider.
Is the information from an authoritative source?
Will your audience trust this source? And should you? In the previous chapter we stressed the
importance of being cautious with Internet sites, but you should be wary of any source’s
credibility. Also, remember that it’s better to refer back to original material than rely on
someone else’s interpretation of existing work since people and their research are often
misquoted. Refer back pages 30-32 for questions to consider when evaluating the credibility of
your sources.
Is the information accurate and free from error?
Check and recheck your facts—errors can seriously damage your credibility. Critically evaluate
your sources, and if you’re uncertain about your facts, be honest with your audience. You can
increase your confidence in the accuracy of your information by using multiple sources to
confirm key facts.
Is your information appropriately precise?
When we talk about “precision,” we mean the information should be specified within
appropriately narrow limits. The level of required precision will vary with the topic being
discussed. Describing regulations for uniform wear may require a precision of fractions of an
inch, and telling someone that his operational specialty badge should be in the middle of their
shirt or within a meter of his belt buckle is not adequately precise. On the other hand, when
reporting on the designated mean point of impact for munitions, a measurement in meters or feet
would be an appropriate level of precision.
When talking about some subset of a group, explain how many or what percentage of the total
you’re talking about. If you find yourself constantly using qualifiers like “some, most, many,
almost, usually, frequently, rarely…” you probably need to find some convincing statistics to
help you make your case.
Is your evidence relevant?
Evidence can be authoritative, accurate and precise, yet still be totally irrelevant. Don’t shove in
interesting facts that have nothing to do with the claim; help the reader understand the relevance
of your material by explaining its significance. Explain charts, graphs and figures and use
transitions in your writing (pages 70-73) to “connect the dots” for the reader.




                                               – 46 –
                                                                                Supporting Your Ideas


Is your evidence sufficient to support your claim and representative of the whole situation
or group?
If you are trying to form some conclusions about a situation or group, you need data that
represents the complete situation. For example, if you were trying to form conclusions about the
overall military population, you would want to gather evidence from all services, not just one
career field in one service.
If you find that your evidence is either not representative or not sufficient, you need to either find
more evidence, limit the claim to what you can prove, or qualify your claim. You may have to
let go of evidence that doesn’t fit or data that is no longer current.
COMMON MISTAKES IN ARGUMENTS: INFORMAL LOGICAL FALLACIES
         “Many people would sooner die than think–in fact, they do so.”
                                                  — Bertrand Russell
Some of you may have studied formal logic in school. These classes used a lot of complex
language and theory to describe what makes an argument “good” or “bad.” Unfortunately, many
real life arguments outside of math and engineering are more “squishy” … and sometimes it’s
hard to draw a diagram or write an equation to explain exactly what’s wrong.
Common errors in reasoning are called informal fallacies. They are called “informal” fallacies
because they’re harder to pin down than some of the “formal” errors in logic. Still, you see them
around you every day—especially in advertising, talk radio or political debates. Keep them out
of your staff work and learn to identify them in others.
The informal fallacies below have been clumped into major categories that make sense to the
editors, but there’s no universally accepted approach to categorizing them. Also note that
labeling something as a fallacy requires some judgment—after all, many of these are “grey
areas.”
1. An Asserted conclusion is the practice of slipping in an assertion and passing it off as a fact.
Two variations include circular reasoning and loaded questions.
   1a. Circular reasoning (also known as begging the question) involves rewording your
   claim and trying to use it as evidence, usually with a lot of other “filler sentences” designed
   to confuse the other person. This is popular in advertising where different versions of the
   claim are repeated over and over again. After a while, it’s easy to forget there’s absolutely
   no support there at all.
   CLAIM:
               “Hey guys! Drink Brand X beer, and you’ll be popular!”
   SUPPORT:
               “Beautiful women in bikinis will compete for your attention!”
               “You’ll have many good looking and physically fit friends!”
               “Women will want you, and men will want to be like you…”
               If the advertisers have their way, you may not notice that the “support” merely
               restates the claim using different words—a textbook case of circular reasoning.

   1b. A Loaded question has an assertion embedded in it—it’s another form of an asserted
   conclusion. One example of a loaded question is “Do you think John Smith is going to
   improve his rude behavior?” The phrasing of the question itself implies that John has
   behaved poorly in the past—regardless of how you answer the question. “When are we
   going to stop sinking money on this expensive program?” has an embedded assumption: the
   money we’ve spent to date hasn’t been effective.
Sometimes an arguer will assert a conclusion, then challenge someone else to disprove it. The
best defense is to ask him or her to prove their claim. “How do you know these programs are
effective?” puts the listener on the defensive. The proper response would be, “How do you know
the programs are not effective?” Remember, those who assert should have the burden of proof.
2. Character attack involves an assault on your opponent as an
                                                                     The classic name for a
individual, instead of his or her position. It’s very common in
                                                                     character attack is the Ad
political advertisements, but you see it in the workplace as well.   Hominem fallacy (in Latin,
Here are some examples:                                              Ad Hominem means “to the
                                                                     man”). Character attacks are
“Mr. Smith is a tax and spend liberal who voted himself a pay
                                                                     also sometimes called

legislation, this is irrelevant to the core of the debate).
“That guy is a egotistical windbag—what would he know about A-76 contract transitions?” (He
may know a lot—his personality is irrelevant to the issue).
3. Emotional appeals try to persuade the heart, not the head. Though emotion plays a role in
persuasion, when emotion replaces reasoning in an argument, you’ve committed a foul. Often
arguers attempt to appeal to our emotions in an argument through biased language, vivid
language and stirring symbols. They may try to persuade us using “character” issues such as
glowing testimonials from popular but noncredible sources. Here are some examples of logical
fallacies in this area:
   3a. Emotional appeal (to force): An argument that targets the audience’s fear of
   punishment. What characterizes these examples as fallacies is that they make no attempt to
   persuade using anything other than pressure.
       “Keep this quiet, or I’ll implicate you in my wrongdoing.”
       “Give me your lunch money, or I’ll give you a busted lip.”
   3b. Emotional appeal (to pity): An argument that targets the audience’s compassion and
   concern for others. Though most people would agree that ethics and values should be part of
   the decision-making process, an appeal solely to emotion, even a positive one, can be
   dangerous and misguided.
       “You can’t give me an D on this paper—I’ll lose my tuition assistance!”
       “We’ve got to stop the warlords—look at the poor, starving people on the news!”




                                              – 48 –
                                                                             Supporting Your Ideas


   3c. Emotional appeal (to popularity/tradition)
   1. Appeal using Stirring Symbols: Using a powerful symbol or attractive label to build
   support.
       “I stand before our nation’s flag to announce my run for President….”
       “Good management principles demand we take this course of action.”
   2. Bandwagon Appeal: Using peer pressure to build support.
       “It must be right—everybody else thinks so.”
       “Buy the Ford Escort; it’s the world’s #1 best seller.”
       “Every good fighter pilot knows….”
   3. Precedent as sole support: Using custom as the only justification for a decision.
       “It must be right—we’ve always done it that way.”
       “The RAF has found the procedure very useful and we should try it.”
       “The last three commanders supported this policy and that’s good enough for me.”
4. False authority is a fallacy tied to accepting facts based on the opinion of an unqualified
authority. The Air Force is chock-full of people who, because of their position or authority in
one field, are quoted on subjects in other fields for which they have limited or no expertise.
Don’t be swayed (or try to sway someone else).
A false authority variant is called the primacy-of-print fallacy, where facts are believed because
they are published in a book, periodical or on a web site. Be as skeptical and thoughtfully
critical of the printed word as you are of the spoken word and check out the suggestions on
evaluating sources on pages 30-32.
5. False cause (also known as the Post Hoc fallacy) occurs when you assume one event causes
a second event merely because it precedes the second event. Many people observe that Event B
occurred after Event A and conclude that A caused B. This is not necessarily true—maybe a
third factor, Event C, caused both A and B.
Consider the following example:
       Event A = At Base X, “Retreat” plays over the intercom at 1635 each day.
       Event B = At Base X, outbound traffic increases at the gate at 1640 each day.
There is a statistical correlation between these two events: if Event A happens, Event B is more
likely to happen and visa versa. Does that mean A causes B? Not necessarily—possibly a third
event may “cause” both A and B:
       Event C = At Base X the official duty day ends at 1630 for much of the workforce.

6. A Single cause fallacy occurs when you assume there is a single cause for an outcome, when
in fact multiple causes exist.
Let’s consider a real life example of a single cause fallacy. Suppose you’re very physically fit,
and in a few months you’ll take a fitness test that measures your heart rate on a stationary bike.
You’ve set a goal to score in the top 10 percent for your age group—an “outstanding” rating.
You know that a disciplined exercise program will cause you to improve your score, but is it this
simple?
       Event A = disciplined, intense exercise program
                              CAUSES
       Event B = outstanding score on the fitness test
People who’ve had trouble with similar fitness tests would be quick to point out that cause and
effect may be a little more complicated in this case:
       Event A = disciplined, intense exercise program
       Event B = genetically low resting heart rate
       Event C = no caffeine or nervousness about the test
       Event D = planets all in alignment and a strong tail wind…
                              CAUSES
       Event E = outstanding score on the fitness test
On the other hand, people who have the genetically low heart rate and nerves of steel may think
an outstanding rating has a single cause because they’ve never had to deal with the other ones.
7. Faulty analogy. Though we often make analogies to make a point, sometimes they go
astray—there’s something about the comparison that isn’t relevant. A faulty analogy implies
that because two things are alike in one way, they are alike in all the ways that matter. It can be
thought of as one example of a non sequitur fallacy (see item 11).
       “Leading a coalition is just like leading a fighter squadron.”
Well, not exactly. Leadership is required in both situations, but leading a coalition requires the
ability to work with people from other services and countries, and requires greater
communication, tact and diplomacy. Leading a fighter squadron may require a higher level of
current technical proficiency in the cockpit. There are people who would excel in one situation
and fail in the other.
8. Faulty dilemma. A faulty dilemma is that implication that no middle ground exists between
two options. Typically one option presented is what the speaker prefers, and the other option is
clearly unacceptable.
       “Spend one hour a day reading Tongue and Quill to improve your writing skills … or
       stay an incoherent loser. It’s your choice.”
Clearly this is a faulty dilemma—it falsely suggests you only have two choices, when you really
have many options. Maybe you can read The Tongue and Quill once a week or once a month.
Maybe you’ll find some other way to improve your writing skills—take a class, find a grammar

website, get feedback from your boss, etc. Though sometimes life really does give us an “either-
or” choice, in most cases we find a considerable range of options between two positions.
9. Hasty generalization results when we “jump to conclusions” without enough evidence. A
few examples used as proof may not represent the whole.
       “I asked three student pilots what they thought of the program, and it’s obvious that
       Undergraduate Pilot Training needs an overhaul.”
One of the challenges with this fallacy is it’s hard to determine how much evidence is “enough”
to form a reasonable conclusion. The rules will vary with the situation; more evidence is needed
to form a conclusion if the stakes are high. The Food and Drug Administration may require a
great deal of evidence before deciding a drug is safe for human use, while SSgt Snuffy may
require very little evidence before forming a generalized conclusion about which candy bars
should be sold at the snack bar.
10. Non sequitur is a generic term for a conclusion that does not necessarily follow from the
facts presented—non sequitur means “it does not follow” in Latin. The facts may not be
relevant, or there may be some sort of illogical leap made. Several of the fallacies listed here,
including faulty analogy and hasty generalization, can be thought of as different types of non
sequitur.
       “John Doe will make a great squadron commander because he was a hot stick in the F-
       15.”
This is a non sequitur because it implies that because he has strong technical skills, he also has
the skills needed to command. Another fairly common non sequitur in military circles assumes
that athletic prowess translates into leadership ability.
11. Slippery slope implies that if we take one small step in an unpleasant or dangerous
direction, we’ll have to go all the way—like slipping down a hill. Here’s an example from the
book of Writing Arguments by Ramage, Bean and Johnson:
       “We don’t dare send weapons to Country X. If we do so, next we will send in military
       advisors, then a Special Forces battalion and then large numbers of troops. Finally, we
       will be in an all-out war.”
Though not every slippery slope argument is false, in some cases we can identify lines that we
will not cross.
12. Red herring fallacies occur when an arguer deliberately brings up irrelevant information to
get the audience off track. The origins of the “red herring” name are debatable, but imagine
someone dragging a large smelly fish across a scent trail that a bloodhound is following—the
dog would probably lose the scent.
13. Stacked evidence is the tendency to withhold facts or manipulate support so that the
evidence points in only one direction. It also happens when you gather only the data or opinions
that support your position. Though sometimes this is done deliberately, in other cases it occurs
due to unconscious bias or carelessness. We don’t even see counterarguments or alternative
ways of interpreting the information because of our firm belief in our own position, or we just
stop gathering information once we we’ve found enough data to make our case.

The Tongue and Quill


Even if you decide to push for your favorite interpretation of the data, never stack evidence by
misrepresenting or manipulating the basic information. Also, even if you decide that you don’t
want to discuss the opposing viewpoint, you should at least be aware of it, so you can prepare a
counterpunch if needed.
14. Straw man is a fallacy where you fail to attack your opponent’s argument directly. Instead,
you make up a weaker, grossly simplified version of the opponent’s argument, and then attack it.
In effect, you are attacking a “straw man”—the argument that you wished your opponent made,
not the one he actually did.
Straw man fallacies are popular in political campaigns. Suppose a candidate believed that a
major goal of prisons should be rehabilitation—breaking the cycle of violence—not just
punishment. An opponent could exploit that with a straw man attack:
       “My opponent coddles convicted felons and wants to make life easier behind bars than on
       the street. I believe prison should be a deterrent, not a reward for bad behavior!”
This list of fallacies captures most of the common errors we hear and see daily. Our challenge is
to sharpen our professional sense of smell so we can quickly sniff out the rational from the
ridiculous, and avoid adding to the epidemic of poor reasoning and weak support we encounter
around us.

ETHICS AND ARGUMENTS: PERSUASION, THE QUEST FOR TRUTH, AND ISSUES
OF CREDIBILITY
           “We believe that argument is a matter not of fist banging or of win-lose
           debate but of finding, through a process of rational inquiry, the best
           solution of a problem.”
                                    – from Writing Arguments, by John D. Ramage,
                                                  John C. Bean, and June Johnson
We’ve all had experience with using logical arguments to persuade someone else. In the middle
of such a discussion, you may have asked yourself, “What’s my goal—to persuade the other guy
and make my case? Or to find out the truth and the best answer to the problem?” (This usually
comes up when your opponent comes up with a valid point you hadn’t considered before.) Ever
since the ancient Greeks were walking around in togas, people have struggled with this issue.
There will always be reasons to use argument as a tool of persuasion—you want your
subordinate to win that award, you really need additional funding for your branch, and you want
your wife to visit her in-laws over the Thanksgiving weekend.
Sometimes in the heat of verbal battle, it’s tempting to focus on persuasion and forget about
truth. Don’t do it. Integrity is one of our Air Force Core Values, and you have to look at
yourself in the mirror every morning. You don’t have to be a doormat, but if you find out about
some new information that may change your position, keep an open mind. In most situations,
you don’t only want YOUR WAY, you want THE BEST WAY. Besides, if you pull a fast one
and get your way through deception, you’ve won a battle, but your credibility is shot and you’ve
crippled yourself for future skirmishes.
Other ways to build credibility with your audience include being knowledgeable and fair.
Research your topic carefully, and take the time to get the facts right. Don’t bluff if you don’t

have an answer, or mislead others about the strength of your support. Consider your audience’s
values and assumptions when selecting evidence. Make sure you get the easy things right—the
spelling of names, significant dates, and other details like grammar and punctuation.
Demonstrate goodwill in your writing tone—don’t be condescending or act superior. If you
make a mistake, acknowledge it and move on. Credibility takes a long time to build, but it is
invaluable when trying to support your ideas and persuade others.
SUMMARY
In this chapter we covered several topics that should help you support your ideas.
We defined a logical argument as a set of statements designed to persuade others. Logical
arguments have four components:
•   a claim—your position on a controversial topic
•   evidence that supports your claim
•   warrants that identify why the evidence is relevant (these are often implied)
•   qualifications that limit the claim
Your argument is built upon evidence, and it should be authoritative, accurate, precise, relevant,
and adequate to support your claim. As you build or listen to logical arguments, watch out for
logical fallacies—common mistakes many people make when building an argument.
Arguments are everywhere. To write and speak persuasively, it helps to understand how
arguments are constructed and where they go wrong. These insights will be helpful as you start
to organize and outline your thoughts—the next step of the process.

 This chapter covers:
     •   How to develop a purpose statement.
     •   The importance of a three-part structure.
     •   Different formats for organizing your outline.


After completing the first three steps, you are well on your way to an outstanding spoken or
written product. Now it’s time to talk about organizing and outlining, the final step in
prewriting. A detailed outline helps you arrange your material logically, see relationships
between ideas, and serves as a reference point to keep you on target as you write your draft.
Think of your outline as the blueprint for your communication product, and realize that the time
you spend preparing it will pay off when you start writing sentences and paragraphs.

You’re less likely to go astray during the outlining process if you
write down your purpose statement and refer to it often. Every
main point and supporting idea in your outline should support that purpose statement—irrelevant
facts or opinions should be eliminated. Discipline at this stage will save pain later.

ORGANIZING: GET YOUR BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT (MOST OF THE TIME)
         “In the future, authors will take a long time to get to the point.
         That way the book looks thicker.”
                                             — Scott Adams in The Dilbert Future:
                                                 Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century
In nearly every communication situation, you need to state your bottom line early in the
message. In a direct or deductive approach, state your position, main point or purpose up front,
then go into the details that support your main point. When you take a direct approach to
communication, your audience is better prepared to digest the details of the message and
logically make the connections in its own mind.
There is an exception to every rule, and you might want to be less direct when trying to persuade
a hostile audience. In such a situation, if you state your bottom line up front, you risk turning
them off before you build your argument—regardless of how well it is supported. In this case
you might consider using an indirect or inductive approach: you may present your support and
end with your bottom line. Sometimes this successfully “softens the blow” and gives your
audience time to warm up to your views.
In the inductive approach, you still need an introduction, but it would be less direct. Here’s an
example of two purpose statements:
       Direct:         Women should be allowed in combat because….
       Indirect:       The issue of women in combat has been hotly debated, and both sides have valid points….
Use the inductive approach with caution; it’s an advanced technique and difficult to execute
without confusing your audience. In an academic setting, seek your instructor’s advice before
applying this method to your assignments.

                                                              Organizing and Outlining Your Thoughts


THE OUTLINE: WHY DO I NEED ONE?
To some people, preparing an outline looks like a painful chore. Though an outline does take
some effort, it’s a time-saver, not a time-waster. An outline contains your main points and
supporting ideas arranged in a logical order. It allows you to see and test the flow of your ideas
on paper without having to write out complete sentences and paragraphs. If some ideas don’t fit
together or flow naturally, you can rearrange them without a lot of effort. Like the blueprint of a
house, an outline makes the “construction process” more efficient and often results in a better
quality product.
Does all writing require you to take the time to write a detailed outline with several layers of
detail? No. If you plan to write a short letter, message or report, a list of main points may be all
you need. For longer papers, Air Force publications, reports, staff studies, etc., you’ll find a
detailed outline is usually an indispensable aid.

OUTLINING: THREE-PART STRUCTURE
Chapter 7 will describe how most writing and speaking is organized in a three-part structure
consisting of an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Most of the work in developing an
outline involves organizing the body of your communication, but if you are building a formal or
detailed outline on a lengthy written product, you should probably include the introduction and
conclusion in the outline. A skilled communicator writing an informal outline on a short
assignment may just outline the body and work out the introduction and conclusion during the
drafting process.

OUTLINING FORMATS:
HEADINGS AND STRUCTURE USED IN FORMAL OUTLINES
Though most outlines you produce will never be seen by anyone else, in some cases you might
be asked to produce a formal outline for “public consumption.” Here are some possible
scenarios:
•   Your boss wants to review what you plan to cover before you start drafting.
•   Your document will have numbered headings and subheadings.
•   You’re organizing the efforts of multiple writers who must work together.
In these situations, it’s helpful to have a consistent approach to numbering or lettering the
different components of your outline. Be consistent once you pick your approach.
One option for an outline format is to use a numerical structure to identify different levels of the
outline. In complicated documents like military publications, these levels may also be used as
headings in the finished document to help readability. Another classic option is to use a mix of
Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and uppercase and lowercase letters to identify the different
levels. (For a refresher on Roman numerals, check out on page 336. A third option is to use the
same headings as the paragraph labels in an official memo; see page 185 for details).
Note that some sections of your outline may be more detailed than others. In the below outline it
is perfectly acceptable to divide section 1.2 into smaller elements and leave section 1.1 and 1.3
undivided.

                     OUTLINING THE BODY: PICK A PATTERN
Your next step is to select a pattern that enables you and your readers to move systematically and
logically through your ideas from a beginning to a conclusion. Some of the most common
organizational patterns are listed below. Your purpose, the needs of your audience, and the
nature of your material will influence your choice of pattern.

1. TOPICAL/CLASSIFICATION PATTERN
                                                                       Outline: Comparison of
Use this format to present groups of ideas, objects or events         F-15 and F-16 Performance
by categories. This is a commonly used pattern to present          A. General Description
general statements followed by numbered listings of                    1. F-15
subtopics to support, explain, or expand the statements.               2. F-16
                                                                   B. Detailed Comparison
A topical pattern usually follows some logical order that              1. Spec 1
reflects the nature of the material and the purpose of the              - F-15
communication. For example, if you are giving a briefing                - F-16
                                                                       2. Spec 2
on helicopters, you might separate them into light, medium,             - F-15
and heavy lift capabilities and briefly describe the weight             - F-16
limits for each category. You could begin with the lightest            3. Spec 3
capability and move to the heaviest or begin with the                   - F-15
heaviest and move to the lightest.                                      - F-16
                                                                       4. Spec 4
 Tip: To help your readers absorb complex or                           - F-15
unfamiliar material, consider organizing your material to               - F-16
move from the most familiar to the unfamiliar or from the
simplest category to the most complex. When using this pattern, experiment to find the
arrangement that will be most comfortable for your audience.

2. COMPARISON/CONTRAST PATTERN
Use this style when you need to discuss similarities and/or differences between topics, concepts,
or ideas.
When you are describing similarities and differences, it often helps the reader to see a point-by-
point comparison of the two items. For example, if you were writing a document that compares
and contrasts certain characteristics of the F-15 and the F-16, you might go item by item,
discussing similarities and differences between the two as you go.

3. CHRONOLOGICAL PATTERN
When you use this pattern, you discuss events, problems or processes in the sequence of time in
which they take place or should take place (past to present or present to future). This commonly
used pattern is used in writing histories, tracing the evolution of processes, recording problem
conditions, and documenting situations that evolve over time.
This approach is also used in official biographies, which are written in chronological order
because they serve as a history of the member’s professional career.




                                              – 59 –
The Tongue and Quill


This pattern is simple to use, but judgment is required when deciding what events to leave in and
what events to leave out. For example, if you were preparing a short biography to introduce a
distinguished guest speaker, you may decide to emphasize experiences that demonstrate his
subject matter expertise and leave out other important but less relevant details. When unsure
what to include, think back to your purpose and audience.
 Tip: You may want to consider a chronological approach to your topic when it is known to
be controversial. Many writers and speakers will announce, “First let’s take a look at the history
of the problem.” This starts the sender and audience out on neutral ground instead of just
launching into the issue at hand. This is a type of inductive approach, and again, should be used
with caution.

4. SEQUENTIAL PATTERN
The sequential or step-by-step approach is similar to the chronological pattern. Use this
approach to describe a sequence of steps necessary to complete a technical procedure or process.
Usually the timing of steps is not as important as the specific order in which they are performed.
The outline on the first page of this chapter (“Seven Steps to Effective Communication”) is an
example of a sequential approach.
The sequential approach is often used in manuals and other instruction books. For example, a
Security Forces NCO in charge of small arms training might use this pattern when rewriting the
teaching manual on how to safely inspect, load, fire, disassemble, and clean weapons. Since
safety is paramount, the process must be written in a precise, stepwise fashion to ensure that
nothing is overlooked.
 Tip: When describing a procedure, explain the importance of sequence so your audience is
mentally prepared to pay close attention to the order, not just the content, of the information.

5. SPATIAL/GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN
When using this pattern, you’ll start at some point in space and proceed in sequence to other
points. The pattern is based on a directional strategy—north to south, east to west, clockwise or
counterclockwise, bottom to top, above and below, etc. Let’s say you are a weather officer
briefing pilots about current and anticipated conditions in the geographic region where they will
be flying a mission. You would most likely describe conditions in reference to the terrain and
describe weather systems that will affect their mission on a map.
 Tip: CAUTION! Make sure to use appropriate transitions to indicate spatial relationships—
to the left, farther to the left, still farthermost to the left; adjacent to, a short distance away, etc.
These signal the flow of the communication; if missing, your audience can easily become

6. PROBLEM/SOLUTION PATTERN
You can use this pattern to identify and describe a problem and one or more possible solutions,
or an issue and possible techniques for resolving the issue. Discuss all facets of the problem—its
origin, its characteristics, and its impact. When

well when your goal is more than just discussion of problems and possible solutions. Use this
pattern when your mission is to present research that will lead your audience down the path to

position, try to look at this issue through their eyes. Start out with the support they are most
likely to accept, and then move into the less popular issues that support your main point.

SUMMARY
A well-planned outline can ease the pain of writing your first draft. Remember, building a house
is much easier with a blueprint! This invaluable tool will help you remain focused on your
purpose statement and help ensure your support is organized, relevant and tailored to your
mission and audience. The outline will also help in the editing process. Take a break after
working on your outline and start fresh before you begin your draft. Good luck!

              PREWRITING PROCESS SUMMARY: STEPS 1-4
BEFORE STARTING YOUR DRAFT, YOU SHOULD KNOW…

STEP 1. ANALYZE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE
 Your purpose: to direct, inform, persuade or inspire (reference page 19).
 Your purpose statement: one sentence that captures your bottom line (reference page 20).
 Your schedule for the assignment.
 Your communication format: Point paper? Staff study? Academic essay?
 Your audience: experience, education, attitudes about topic, etc. (pages 21-22).
 Your unit’s position: Could you create problems for others? Should you coordinate this?
 The appropriate tone will depend on purpose and audience: usually polite, personal,
    positive, and inclusive; often informal and direct (pages 23-24).

STEP 2. RESEARCH YOUR TOPIC
 Relevant information from boss, coworkers, office files, Internet and the library.

STEP 3. SUPPORT YOUR IDEAS
 How to use relevant information to support your ideas and meet your purpose.
 How to “build a case” (a logical argument) for your position, if needed.
 How to use facts, definitions, statistics and testimony as evidence for your position.
 How to avoid mistakes in your logic and notice problems with your evidence.

STEP 4. ORGANIZE AND OUTLINE
 Your chosen organizational pattern (topical, chronological, problem/solution, etc.).
 Your outline, which graphically shows the flow of your main points.

  This chapter covers:
     •   Drafting using a three-part structure (introduction, body and conclusion).
     •   Drafting effective paragraphs.
     •   Drafting clear and concise sentences.
     •   Overcoming writer’s block.


After completing the prewriting process, you’ve got what you need to produce a first rate
communication product. Congratulations! You’re ready to write your first draft! In this chapter
we’ll take a “top down” approach to writing a draft. We’ll start with the big picture: a three-part
structure consisting of the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. Next, we’ll describe how
to write effective paragraphs within the body. Finally, we’ll dig down deeper into the sentences,
phrases, and words that make up the paragraphs of your draft.

                      “The basic rule every military writer ought to live by is this:
                     ‘I will write only when I must.’”

DRAFTING BASIC PHILOSOPHY
Keep a few things in mind as you start the drafting process. A draft is not the finished product,
and each sentence does not have to be polished and perfect. Your focus should be to get your
ideas on paper. Don’t obsess about grammar, punctuation, spelling, and word choice at this
point—that comes later. You don’t have to fix every mistake as you see it—you can catch these
during the editing process.
On the other hand, it’s helpful to keep an eye on your outline when drafting your masterpiece,
especially when you’re writing something longer than a page or two. By periodically checking
your outline, you are less likely to lose focus and include irrelevant information.
Okay, this sounds great, but have you ever sat down to start your first draft and found yourself
just staring at the blank computer screen or paper? If you suffer from writer’s block, we’ll cover
strategies for overcoming this fairly common problem at the end of this chapter.

THREE PART STRUCTURE: AN INTRODUCTION, BODY AND CONCLUSION
What is your draft going to look like? Is it going to be one huge paragraph? No, in most cases,
you’ll organize your draft in a three-part structure—introduction, body and conclusion.
•  The introduction must capture your audience’s attention, establish rapport and announce
your purpose.
•   The body must be an effective sequence of ideas that flow logically in a series of paragraphs.
•   The conclusion must summarize the main points stated in the body and close smoothly.
Let’s take a closer look at this structure. We’ll examine these parts out of order—first, the
introduction, then the conclusion and lastly the body where we’ll spend most of our “time.”

DRAFTING THE INTRODUCTION
The introduction sets the stage and tone for your message. Although the content and length of
your introduction may vary with the assignment, the introduction should, at a minimum, clearly
state your purpose (“bottom line”) and the direction
you plan to take the audience.                                 Stage Setting Remarks:
                                                                   Use them properly!
A typical introduction has three components: stage

•   The overview is like a good roadmap—it clearly presents your main points, previews your
paragraph sequence and ties your main points to your purpose.
Here’s an example of a short introduction that contains all three components:
       Communication is essential to mission accomplishment, and all Air Force personnel should be
       able to write effectively. (Stage Setting Remarks) This handbook provides general guidelines and
       specific formats for use in both staff environments and Professional Military Education schools.
       (Purpose Statement) It begins with an overarching philosophy on military communication, then
       describes processes and techniques to improve writing and speaking products, and summarizes the
       most common formats used in Air Force communication. (Overview)

Even though readers read the introduction first, you don’t have to write it first. If
the introduction doesn’t come easily or naturally, you can work on another part of the
communication and then return to it. Some writers backpedal and don’t want to work on
the introduction until the rest of the communication is written. Others insist it guides
them in shaping the content or body of their message. Regardless of when you write the
introduction, make sure that it captures your purpose and make sure it prepares your
audience for what is to come.
Here’s the bottom line on your introduction: It must be an appropriate length for your
specific communication and it should contain a clear
statement of your purpose and direction.
                                                                         Introductions and conclusions:

For effective endings, restate the main ideas or observations or emphasize the main thrusts of
arguments. Under no circumstances apologize for real or perceived inadequacies or inject weak
afterthoughts. Conclude your communication with positive statements based on your preceding
discussion. Generally, avoid bringing up new ideas in the conclusion; these belong in the body
of your communication. Opening up new “cans of worms” will just confuse your reader.
Your introduction and conclusion should balance each other without being identical. To check
this, read your introduction and then immediately read your conclusion to determine if your

conclusion flows logically from your introduction and whether it fulfills your purpose. An
effective conclusion leaves you with a sense you’re justified in ending your communication.
You’re ready to call it a day only when you assure your audience you’ve accomplished the
purpose stated in your introduction.
Recall our sample introduction on page 67; here’s a short conclusion derived from that
introduction and the body (which we don’t have right now):
       As Air Force personnel, we can’t accomplish our mission without effective communication. Hopefully, this
       handbook has provided you with some practical tools to improve your communication skills, specifically
       speaking and writing. Keep it handy and refer to it often as you prepare and review a variety of spoken and
       written products throughout your career.


Even without the “body” available, you can see how the introduction and conclusion
complement each other.

DRAFTING THE BODY
The body of your communication is the heart of your message. It includes your main ideas about
your subject and supporting details under each main idea.
The body typically consists of several paragraphs. The total number of paragraphs (and overall
length of the body) will depend on your purpose and subject. As a general rule, write a separate
paragraph for each main idea—you might confuse your reader if you have two or more main
ideas in a single paragraph. In a longer communication, you may find it necessary to use more
than one paragraph to cover one main point or idea.
So much for a quick review of introductions, conclusions and bodies. Now, let’s dig down a
little deeper into the paragraphs that make up the body of your communication.

                               DRAFTING EFFECTIVE PARAGRAPHS
PARAGRAPHS SHOULD CONTAIN ONE MAIN POINT
Paragraphs are the primary vehicles to develop ideas in your writing. They serve three purposes:
c To group related ideas into single units of thought.
d To separate one unit of thought from another unit.
e To alert your readers you’re shifting to another phase of your subject.
An effective paragraph is a functional unit with clusters of ideas built around a single main point
or idea and linked with other clusters preceding and following it. It’s not an arbitrary collection
designed for physical convenience. It performs a definite, planned function—it presents a single
major idea or point, describes an event, or creates an impression.
Most staff writing depends on relatively short paragraphs of three to seven sentences. If you
follow this practice, you’ll be more likely to develop clear, easy-to-read paragraphs. The length
of individual paragraphs will vary because some main points need more supporting details than
others.

In general, the flow of your paragraphs will follow the organizational pattern or format you
selected in Step 4: “Organizing and Outlining” (Chapter 6). That is, you build your paragraphs
to meet the structural requirements of your overall communication. But you can use analogy,
examples, definition, and comparison and contrast to develop single paragraphs within your
overall pattern. The guiding principle is to develop one main idea or point in each paragraph.
TOPIC SENTENCES

In staff writing, it’s helpful to start off each paragraph with a

reader’s mind, or serve as a transition to the next topic sentence. (We’ll talk more about
transitions in the next section.) Eliminate any “extra” sentences that don’t perform one of these
functions!
Though most writers will draft an entire paragraph at a time, an alternate drafting strategy is
to first write all the topic sentences in your body. Once the topic sentences are completed, go
back and write the rest of the paragraphs, one at a time. Drafting the topic sentences first
requires the writer to stay focused on the “big picture” and can help produce a clear and well-
organized draft. This technique can be very useful for longer writing assignments and is
recommended for writers who struggle to organize their writing.
Here’s the bottom line on paragraphs in the body: Each paragraph should have one main
point/idea captured in a topic sentence, preferably at the beginning of the paragraph. Use
supporting ideas to prove, clarify, illustrate and develop your main point. Your objective is to
help your readers see your paragraphs as integrated units rather than mere collections of
sentences.

TRANSITIONS: BRIDGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT IDEAS
One way to make sure your paragraphs flow together, both internally and externally, is by using
transitions in the form of words, phrases, and sentences. Internal transitions improve the flow of
sentences within a paragraph, while external transitions link separate paragraphs together within
the body of your communication. Though some inexperienced writers are intimidated by the
idea of transitions, a few examples usually make the point.

INTERNAL TRANSITIONS
Internal transitions are one or more related words that show the relationship between ideas
within a paragraph. Woven skillfully into your writing, internal transitions help your reader
follow your line of thought.
Some internal transitions show a relationship between two ideas inside a single sentence:
       “First go home and then clean your room.”

Other internal transitions show a relationship between two or more sentences within a single
paragraph:
       “Our plan for Saturday afternoon involves both business and pleasure. First, all the kids will come home
       at noon and we’ll eat lunch. Next, we’ll get the house cleaned—the whole mess. Finally, we’ll go out for
       ice cream and a movie.”
Take a look at page 70 for a bulletin board of transitional words and phrases that provide the
ideal logic links between your key points and the mind of the reader. In most cases, favor the
short, spoken ones over the long, bookish ones. For example, use but more than however, so
more than therefore, and also more than in addition. (Note that different transitions require
different punctuation. If you’re uncertain about the rules, check out guidelines for comma and
semicolon usage on pages 282 and 307.)
       “The movie was too long; therefore, we left after three hours.”

       “The movie was too long, so we left after three hours.”
There are many ways to bridge gaps in thought and move the reader from one idea to another.
One classic transitional approach involves repetition of key words at the beginning of individual
sentences. This is especially popular in formal or ceremonial writing or speaking. Notice how
the writer of the following paragraph repeated simplicity, incisiveness and focus to make points
clear:
       The effective presentation of concepts depends on simplicity, incisiveness and focus. Simplicity is
       necessary under time constraints when there’s insufficient time for complicated relationships.
       Incisiveness fixes an idea in the listener’s mind, appeals to common sense and facilitates
       understanding. Focus limits the subject to essentials, promoting the presenter’s objectives.
Internal transitions, in the form of one or more related words, are key to a well-written paragraph
because they guide the reader between related ideas. But how do we move from paragraph to
paragraph? We need external transitions to knit together their main points.

EXTERNAL TRANSITIONS
External transitions are typically sentences or paragraphs that guide the reader between
separate paragraphs and major sections of your communication.
Transitional paragraphs are usually reserved for long papers, books, and reports that contain
major sections or chapters. They are used to summarize one section and lead the reader to the
next section, or they introduce the next section and tie it to the preceding section. Transitional
paragraphs are not commonly used in staff writing, but are often seen in books and academic
essays.
The short paragraph immediately above this section (“Internal transitions, in the form of one or
more related words…”) is an example of a transitional paragraph. As you can see, it sums up the
previous section on internal transitions and then introduces the new section on external
transitions.
Let’s look closer at transitional sentences, which you’ll probably use more frequently than
transitional paragraphs. A transitional sentence is often used to bridge man points in two
separate paragraphs (though not every new paragraph requires an external transition). There are
three options of a transitional sentence bridging paragraph 1 and paragraph 2:
   1) It can be a stand-alone sentence at the end of paragraph 1.
   2) It can be a stand-alone sentence at the beginning of paragraph 2 (In this case, paragraph 2’s topic sentence
      is the second sentence in the paragraph).

   3) It can be merged with the topic sentence of paragraph 2 (In this case, the “transitional” part of the sentence
      is a separate clause at the beginning of the sentence).
Let’s look at a situation where a transitional sentence is appropriate. Suppose we have two
paragraphs:
       Paragraph 1 describes parking problems.
       Paragraph 2 describes potential solutions to the parking problems.
Here’s an example of a stand-alone transitional sentence for these paragraphs:
       Fortunately, we can solve these parking problems if we offer our people some incentives to
       use car pools. (transitional sentence)
If this sentence were at the end of paragraph 1 (option 1), paragraph 2 would start with a topic
sentence written something like this:
       We can offer our personnel three incentives to participate in car pools: preferred parking
       spaces, guaranteed duty hours and distant parking for nonparticipants. (topic sentence)
If our transitional sentence were at the beginning of paragraph 2 (option 2), then our topic
sentence would be the second sentence in paragraph 2, like this:
       Fortunately, we can solve these parking problems if we offer our people some incentives to use
       carpools. (transitional sentence) We can offer them three incentives: preferred parking spaces,
       guaranteed duty hours, and distant parking for nonparticipants. (topic sentence)
Now let’s look at our third option where we merge the transition with the topic sentence of
paragraph 2. In this case, we have one sentence instead of two, like this:

                                                     – 72 –
                                                                                          Writing Your Draft


       Fortunately, we can solve these parking problems (transitional clause) by offering our people
       three incentives to participate in car pools: preferred parking spaces, guaranteed duty
       hours and distant parking for nonparticipants (topic of paragraph 2).
Whether used at the end or beginning of a paragraph, transitional sentences can make your
writing smoother and make your reader happier!

HEADINGS
Another effective way to transition from one major area to another, especially in a longer report,
is to use headings. They allow your reader to follow along easily, even at a glance. Headings
are also helpful when topics vary widely. Be informative and avoid relying on headings that use
one or two vague words. You’ll note that headings are used effectively in this publication! Here
are a couple examples.
       For: Procedures
       Try: How to Complete AF Form XXXX

       For: Contractors
       Try: How Much Contractors May Charge
Now that you have a good idea of how to draft “the big picture” part of your communication—
your introduction, conclusion and paragraphs in the body—it’s time to dig a little deeper. It’s
time to look at building effective sentences within your paragraphs.

                          DRAFTING EFFECTIVE SENTENCES
To draft clear and concise sentences, choose clear and concise words and phrases to make up
your sentences. In this section, we’ll cover some of the most important considerations when
writing effective sentences: active voice, smothered verbs, parallel construction, misplaced
modifiers, using the right word for the job and avoiding wordy words and phrases. Let’s get
started with probably the most common pitfall to clear and concise sentences—not writing
actively.
WRITE ACTIVELY: DOERS BEFORE VERBS
Is your active voice all bottled up? Active voice shows the subject as the actor. For example:
The girl sang a song. By using mostly active voice, your writing is clear, concise, and alive—it
reaches out to the reader and gets to the point quickly with fewer words. Unfortunately, many
writers overuse passive voice. Passive voice shows the subject as receiver of the action. For
example: A song was sung by her. Besides lengthening and twisting sentences, passive verbs
often muddy them. Whereas active sentences must have doers, passive ones are complete
without them. When you overuse passive voice and reverse the natural subject-verb-object
pattern, your writing becomes lifeless.
       Your support is appreciated …
       Requisitions should be submitted …
       The IG team will be appointed …
       It is requested that you submit …




                                                  – 73 –
The Tongue and Quill


Yawn. The actor (or doer) in the sentence is either obscure, absent altogether or just lying there.
Who appreciates? Who should requisition? Who appoints? Why not write …
        I appreciate your support …
        Submit your requisitions …
        Colonel Hall will appoint the IG team …
        Please submit …

THE SYMPTOMS OF PASSIVE VOICE AND THREE CURES
How can you diagnose passive voice? You don’t have to be a grammarian to recognize passive
voice. First, find the verb by asking yourself, “What’s happening in this sentence?” Then find
the actor by asking, “Who’s doing it?” If the actor comes after the verb, its passive voice. Also,
watch for these forms of the verb to be (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been) and a main verb
usually ending in -ed or -en. Let’s look at a few examples:
        Passive: The mouse was eaten by the cat.
        Active: The cat ate the mouse.
        Passive: Livelier sentences will be written by you.
        Active: You will write livelier sentences.
        Passive: Water is drunk by everybody.
        Active: Everybody drinks water.
To correct a passive sentence, try one of these cures:
1. Put the actor (doer) before the verb.
        This:    The handlers must have broken the part.
        Not:     The part must have been broken by the handlers.
2. Drop part of the verb.
       This: The results are in the attachment.
       Not:     The results are listed in the attachment.
3. Change the verb.
        This:    The replacement has not arrived yet.
        Not:     The replacement has not been received yet.


Though most writers overuse passive voice sometimes it’s appropriate. Clear and forceful
language may be inappropriate in diplomacy or in political negotiations. Passive voice is also
used to soften bad news, or when the doer or actor of the action is unknown, unimportant,
obvious or better left unnamed. Here are a few examples:
        The part was shipped on 1 June. (The doer is unimportant.)
        Presidents are elected every four years. (The doer is obvious.)
        Christmas has been scheduled as a workday. (The doer is better left unnamed.)
The bottom line: Passive voice is wordy, indirect, unclear and reverses the natural order of
English. Active voice is clear and concise. So, activate your writing!
As you can see, using verbs correctly—actively—is key to writing clear, concise and interesting
sentences. For that reason, let’s look at another way to keep your verbs active—don’t smother
them!



                                                     – 74 –
                                                                                            Writing Your Draft


WATCH OUT FOR SMOTHERED VERBS
Make your verbs do the work for you. Weak writing relies on general verbs that take extra
words to complete their meaning. Don’t use a general verb (make) plus extra words (a choice)
when you can use one specific verb (choose). For example:
       Wordy:         The IG team held a meeting to give consideration to the printing issue.
       Better:        The IG team met to consider the printing issue.
       Wordy:         They made the decision to give their approval.
       Better:        They decided to approve it.
Here’s another tip on verbs—watch out for words ending in -ion and -ment. These are verbs
turned into nouns. Whenever possible, change these nouns to verb forms, and your sentences
will be shorter and livelier. For example:
       Wordy:         Use that format for the preparation of your command history.
       Better:        Use that format to prepare your command history.
       Wordy:         The settlement of travel claims involves the examination of orders.
       Better:        Settling travel claims involves examining orders.
We’ve spent a lot of time looking at verbs because they’re the most important words in your
sentences. The bottom line: keep verbs active, lively, specific, concise, and out in front, not
hidden. Another potential stumbling block for readers is “unparallelism.”

USE PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION (PARALLELISM)
Use a consistent pattern when making a list. If your sentence contains a series of items separated
by commas, keep the grammatical construction similar—if two of three items start with a verb,
make the third item start with a verb. Violations occur when writers mix things and actions,
statements and questions, and active and passive instructions. The trick is to be consistent.
Make ideas of equal importance look equal.

                      transmit instructions and implementation of decisions.

                      a noun.]

       Acceptable:     Universal military values include commitment to integrity,
                       dedication to duty, service before self, and the belief that
                       freedom is worth dying for.
If one of the items in a list can’t be written in the same grammatical structure, place it at the end
of the sentence. In the previous example, “the belief that freedom is worth dying for” does not
match the three-word construction of the other items, but its placement helps the sentence’s
readability.
Active voice, strong verbs and parallelism can help make your sentences clear and concise.
Now, let’s look at some more things you can do to write effective sentences—using the right
word for the job.

USE THE RIGHT WORD FOR THE JOB
BE CONCRETE. Without generalizations and abstractions, lots of them, we would drown in
detail. We sum up vast amounts of experience when we speak of dedication, programs,
hardware and lines of authority. But such abstract language isn’t likely to evoke the same
experiences in each reader’s mind. Lazy writing overuses vague terms such as immense
dedication, enhanced programs, viable hardware and responsive lines of authority. It especially
weakens job descriptions and performance evaluations, etc.
Do not write “The commander will give guidance,” or “The equipment must meet specs.” Your
reader might wonder what kind of guidance and what kind of specs? Neither you nor your
readers can tackle the problem until you are specific. Be as definite as the situation permits.
Include only the ideas your reader needs and then give those ideas no more words than they
deserve.

       commanders           MAJCOM commanders                     Ford                Ranger

       car, vehicle         Ford                                  plane               F-117
       computer             Pentium                               socialize           mingle, meet
KNOW VARIOUS SHADES OF MEANING. Use different words to express various shades
of meaning. The writer with an adequate vocabulary writes about the aroma of a cigar, the
fragrance of a flower, the scent of perfume or the odor of gas instead of the smell of all these
things.
JUDGE THE JARGON. The aim of all communication is to make a personal contact in the
simplest possible way, and the simplest way is to use familiar, everyday words. Above all, it
must be adapted to specific circumstances with a minimum of jargon. Jargon consists of
“shorthand” words, phrases or abbreviations that are peculiar to a relatively small group of
people. DEROS (Date Eligible to Return from Overseas) and AWOL (Absent Without Leave)
are examples of military jargon. Every profession has it. NPO which means Nil Peros (nothing
by mouth) and contusion (bruise) are examples of medical jargon. Writers often use jargon in
their sentences to fill space and impress the naive. Unfortunately, overuse of jargon can backfire
on you by actually confusing your reader. CAUTION! Before you use jargon, make sure you
have carefully assessed the audience! Keep it simple with everyday words and phrases, or at
least explain any jargon you must use. If you use an abbreviation, spell it out the first time it

appears. If it appears only twice or infrequently, spell out the term every time and avoid the
abbreviation entirely. For more on abbreviations see Appendix 1.
CLICHÉS. Clichés are expressions that have lost their impact because they have been
overused. Strive for originality in your choice of words and phrases. The list below is not
exhaustive. You just may not find your favorite here.

WORDY WORDS AND PHRASES
Many people use certain words and phrases because they think it makes them appear learned or
they think padding emphasizes or rounds out a passage. Don’t force your reader to trudge
through a dictionary. Also, many needless phrases are introduced by prepositions like at, on, for,
in, to and by. They don’t give sentences impressive bulk; they weaken them by cluttering the
words that carry the meaning. So prune such deadwood as to the purpose (to), etc. The longer it
takes to say something, the weaker you come across. Pages 81-87 list big words or phrases and
simpler ones to try.

The Tongue and Quill


DOUBLEHEADERS. The Word by Rene J. Cappon details how to avoid writing a project’s
importance and significance when importance will do. Even a person’s success and achievement
is okay with just success. Pairs of words with similar meanings add needless bulk. Whatever the
differences are between test and evaluate, for example, they aren’t worth calling attention to if
you just want to give a general idea. When you’re tempted to use two words, try one to say it all.
Thomas Jefferson said: “The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when
one will do.”

REPETITIVE REDUNDANCY. Not every noun needs an adjective. Not every adjective
needs an adverb. Not every writer has gotten the message. Keep your pencil from adding
modifiers to those nouns that need no additional voltage. Serious danger, stern warning, deadly
poison, grave crisis are examples; the nouns operate better without the modifiers.

The Tongue and Quill


We’ve been looking a lot at how to write clear and concise sentences—what to do and what to
avoid. Before we leave this section on effective sentence writing, there are two more areas we
need to cover that have an impact on readability—sentence length and using questions.

SENTENCE LENGTH
The purpose of words on paper is to transfer thoughts in the simplest manner with the greatest
clarity. You should avoid long, complicated sentences over 20 words (average is 17 words).
Break up long, stuffy sentences by making short sentences of dependent clauses or by using lists.
Short sentences increase the pace; long ones usually retard it. The key is to vary your pattern
since constant use of either form can be monotonous.

ASK MORE QUESTIONS
Use questions now and then to call attention to what you want. You’re actually reaching out to
your reader when a sentence ends with a question mark. In a longer communication, a question
can definitely be a welcome change. Can you hear how spoken a question is?
Well, that’s it—the general guidance for writing your first draft. You now have some great
guidance on using the three part structure (introduction, body and conclusion) and writing
effective paragraphs and sentences. As promised earlier in this chapter, under Drafting Basics,
we briefly mentioned “writer’s block.” We didn’t give you any solutions, but we’re going to
give you some now. When you sit down to start on your first draft, don’t waste time staring at a
blank screen or paper—try some of the tips on page 89.




                                             – 88 –
                                                                                    Writing Your Draft



                   ADVICE ON OVERCOMING WRITER’S BLOCK
If you occasionally suffer from writer’s block, you’re not alone—even experienced writers have
a hard time getting started. Before we get to some cures, exactly what is writer’s block? It’s a
temporary inability to get words on paper (or on the computer). Like many other problems, it
has a life cycle—denial, despair, acceptance and recovery. What leads to writer’s block,
anyway? There are five fears that can cause it: fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of success,
fear of offending and fear of running dry (out of ideas). So now that we know what writer’s
block is and what causes it, what can we do about it?
In most cases we just need a gentle nudge to get us back on track. In her book The Complete
Idiot’s Guide to Creative Writing, Laurie E. Rozakis, PhD, provides several suggestions on how
to overcome writer’s block. Here are some of her ideas, as well as some of our own:
♦ Brainstorm or “free write” to get your creative juices flowing. Just get the words down as
  fast as they come, preferably on the computer so they will be easy to edit. Spill your brains,
  don’t worry about punctuation—just get it down. Stick pretty close to your outline. Don’t
  revise. Don’t polish. If your outline is comprehensive, you may only need to string the ideas
  together with brief transitions. If your outline is a series of key words in a logical pattern,
  you’ll have to fill in the larger blanks.
♦ Start wherever you want. Don’t feel you need to start with the introduction; some writers do
  that section last. The key here is to just start writing. Try starting with the part that’s easiest
  to write.
♦ On a similar note, try writing just the topic sentences for each paragraph. Once you do this,
  the other, support sentences will start really flowing.
♦ Avoid procrastination. Waiting until the last minute just increases your “blockage”!
♦ If page length, word count, or some other constraint is holding you back, forget about it on
  the first draft. You can reshape later, once you have something to revise.
♦ Tell your ideas to a friend.
♦ Briefly do some mindless activity—but only briefly!
♦ Try changing your writing mode—if using the computer, try writing longhand and visa versa.
♦ Use visuals, like pictures or diagrams, to show what you mean. This can help ignite your
  ideas and thoughts. Then, you can write them.
♦ Develop rituals or routines to get in the mood for writing—a cup of coffee, an early arrival at
  the office, etc.
♦ If you work in a crowded or noisy office, try using earplugs to cut down on noise and
  distractions. It may sound strange, but it really works!

SUMMARY
Writer’s block is very common and usually very temporary and curable. There are lots of ways
to overcome it. Hopefully, the tips here will help you. Always remember—writing should be
fun, not frightening!
Congratulations! The most difficult task is over—you’ve successfully written the dreaded first
draft. Take a break and step back from your draft. When you come back, you’ll be ready to
revise and edit it.




                                                 Is it writer’s block, or
                                                 just a lack of focus?

  This chapter covers:
     •   Editing fundamentals: our goals and some advice on how to get there.
     •   Edit in multiple steps—always start with the big picture.
     •   Common grammatical problems to check for when editing.


Spotting problems in our own writing is not easy. Many of us take great pride in what we write.
Once our words are on paper, we resent the suggestion that something could be wrong. We
don’t like to check and change the words, the organization, the limits of the subject, the spelling,
the punctuation or anything else, and we often have trouble making time to edit properly.
Yet editing is critical. Take the time to make sure you have a cohesive, clear, error-free product
that the audience can relate to. Here’s the good news: if you completed the steps described in
Chapters 3-7, the editing will be a lot easier... and at this point, you’re almost home free.


         “… When you revise from the top down, from global structure to paragraphs to
         sentences to words, you are more likely to discover useful revisions than if you start
         at the bottom with words and sentences and work up.”

This is the easy part. Remember the FOCUS
principles from Chapter 1? Good editing all relates to those principles and will tell you how well
you followed the steps for effective writing. As you read through this chapter on editing, keep
FOCUS in mind. Here are the principles again for your review:
EDITING FUNDAMENTALS
When you edit, there are a few key rules to remember:
1. EDIT WITH FRESH EYES. Give yourself some time between drafting and editing. By that
we mean put the draft on a shelf, in a desk drawer or under a paperweight and let it sit a spell,
preferably for several hours for shorter projects and at least a day for longer ones. After this
down time you’ll come back fresh and will be more likely to catch errors.
2. REVIEW THE BASICS. Take the time to review earlier sections on writing tone (pages 23-
24), drafting clear and concise sentences (pages 73-88), common grammatical errors (pages 97-
101), and any other material that represents a problem area for you. Editing is your last chance
to apply the guidelines you’ve read about in earlier chapters. If the concepts are fresh in your
mind when you start editing, you’ll be better able to spot problems in your draft.
3. SLOW DOWN AND TAKE YOUR TIME. You aren’t in a race. If you read at your normal
pace you’re more likely to miss errors. Try different approaches to slow yourself down,
including reading aloud and reading one line at a time using a “cover” to hide the rest of the
page. If you’re checking for misspelled words, move backwards through a sentence.

4. REMEMBER YOUR READERS. Try to put yourself in the role of your audience as you
edit. You may catch some areas that may need revision if you read it from their perspective and
knowledge base. Also consider your secondary audience—even if you’ve got your primary
audience targeted correctly, are you unnecessarily insulting others that may end up reading this?
5. START WITH THE BIG PICTURE, then work down to the details. When you begin to edit,
don’t focus in on the nitty-gritty—look at the big picture first. Misuse of “there” and “their” is
really not that important if your paper lacks cohesion, is poorly organized or fails to include a
clear purpose statement. Again, anyone can use spellchecker, but a well-edited paper requires
much more and begins with The Big Picture.

              EDITING EFFICIENTLY … A THREE STEP APPROACH
One way to make sure you edit efficiently is to read your document at least three times to allow
yourself to really look hard at the problem areas that could botch your product. In the first pass,
look at the big picture; in the second pass, look at paragraph construction; and the third pass,
look at sentences, phrases and words.
FIRST PASS: THE BIG PICTURE
                           “If it needs major surgery, it’s best to know early!”
In this first “go around” you should be paying attention to the arrangement and flow of ideas.
Here are some areas to think about:

•   First read your introduction and then read your conclusion.
•  Do they sound like they go together without being identical? Does the introduction declare
your purpose and does your conclusion show your readers you’ve accomplished your purpose?
•   Do you let your readers down gradually? Or do you stop with a jerk?
•  Does the conclusion sum up your point? Don’t introduce any new ideas here—you’ll leave

SECOND PASS: PARAGRAPH
STRUCTURE AND CLARITY
After your first pass, you know the paper contains what it needs to do the job. In the second
pass, you will check whether the main points and supporting ideas are appropriately organized in
paragraphs.
Let’s take a close look at individual paragraphs in the body of your writing. For each paragraph,
ask the following questions:
Unity of Focus
•   Is there one, and only one, main point of the paragraph?
•   Is all the information in the paragraph related enough to be in the same paragraph?
•   Can you identify the central idea of each paragraph?



                                                 – 94 –
                                                                                    Editing Your Draft


Topic Sentence
•   Does the paragraph have a topic sentence—one sentence that captures the central idea of the
    paragraph?
•   Is the topic sentence the first sentence of the paragraph? (Or, if you’re starting with a
    transitional sentence, the second sentence?)
Supporting Ideas
•   Do sentences expand, clarify, illustrate and explain points mentioned or suggested in each
    main idea? Your goal is to lead the reader in a smooth, step-by-step process to each main
    idea.
•   Are there enough details in the paragraph to support the central idea?
•   Are there any “extra sentences” that seem to be irrelevant to the main point?
•   Do all transitional words, phrases, and clauses improve the flow and show proper
    relationships?
•   Do most paragraphs contain three to seven sentences?
If you did a lot of rearranging of paragraphs in this step, try the organizational editing check on
the previous page—just to make sure you’re on track.
THIRD PASS: SENTENCES, PHRASES AND WORDS
Now you’re ready to look at the details. Though you’ve probably corrected some minor errors in
the first two passes, now is the time to really concentrate on the “small stuff” that can sabotage
your communication: passive voice, unclear language, excessive wordiness, grammatical errors
and spelling mistakes. Some of these concepts were covered in the chapter on drafting; while
others will be introduced in this section.
Let’s start with some general advice. Read the paper out loud. Reading the paper out loud will
increase your chances of catching errors because it requires you to slow down and use two
senses—seeing and hearing. What one sense misses, the other may pick up!
Listen to the sound of words, phrases and sentences. Remember, the quicker your audience can
read and understand it, the better. If you have to read a sentence two or three times, chances are
they will too. Not good!

DRAFTING BASICS: DID YOU APPLY THEM?
As part of your editing step, you need to check some of the same concepts discussed in the
previous chapter on drafting. Remember these guidelines, and refer back to the referenced pages
if you need more details or additional examples.
1. Write in active voice (pages 73-74). In active voice, the subject comes first in the sentence.
In passive voice, the “doer” or subject of the sentence shows up late in the sentence or is missing
entirely. Avoid overusing passive voice; it often creates lengthy and confusing sentences.
   Passive: Captain Smith was given a choice assignment by his career field monitor.
   Active: The career field monitor gave Captain Smith a choice assignment.
2. Avoid smothered verbs (page 75). Use one specific verb instead of a general verb and
several extra words.
   Smothered: This directive is applicable to everyone who makes use of the system.
   Better: This directive applies to everyone who uses the system.
3. Check for misspelled or commonly misused words (pages 78-79). In today’s computer
age, your software’s spell checker is your first line of defense against misspelled words. Still,
you can get into trouble by misusing synonyms or easily confused words like “there” and “their”
and “accept” and “except.” Spell check will not flag these words because they are spelled
correctly, but used in the wrong context. When in doubt, check the dictionary—it still exists!
4. Use parallel construction (parallelism) in lists and series (pages 75-76). Use a similar
grammatical construction within a list or series. Make items of equal importance look equal. If
one starts with a verb, start the other with a verb. If three items in a list are commands, make the
fourth a command. Parallelism helps make sentences clear.
   Needs work:          Remember the following when editing: write in active voice, parallelism, smothered
                        verbs should be avoided, and spelling.
   Better:              Remember the following when editing: write in active voice, use parallel construction in
                        lists, avoid smothered verbs, and check for misspelled words.
5. Avoid unnecessary redundancy and word doublings (page 80).
Don’t use one word to modify another unless both add value.
   Needs work:          Repetitive redundancy hurts readability.
   Better:              Redundancy hurts readability.
Don’t use two nearly identical words unless both add value.
   Needs work:          We must comply with the standards and criteria for controlling and reducing
                        environmental pollution.”
   Better:              We must comply with the standards for reducing environmental pollution.”

COMMON GRAMMAR TRAPS…
Grammatical errors can confuse your readers and undermine the credibility of your
communication. We’ve listed some of the most common mistakes below—look out for them
when editing your work.

1. MISPLACED MODIFIERS
 A modifier is a group of words that describes another group of words within the sentence.
Modifiers should be placed near the words they describe. Improperly placed modifiers can
create ambiguity or imply an illogical relationship. There are two kinds of misplaced modifiers:
dangling and ambiguous.
   a. Dangling modifiers literally hang illogically on sentences, usually at the beginning.
   They are placed so they seem to modify the wrong word and, thus, show an illogical
   relationship. To correct a dangling modifier, either place the modifier next to the word it
   modifies or change the subject of the sentence to clarify your intent.
   Confusing:         Approaching the flight line from the east side, the operations building can be easily
                      spotted by a pilot. [The operations building doesn’t approach the flight line—the pilot
                      does!]
   Better:            A pilot approaching the flight line from the east side can easily spot the operations
                      building.
   Confusing:         To make a climbing turn, the throttle is opened wider. [The throttle doesn’t make a
                      climbing turn.]

   Better:            To make a climbing turn, open the throttle wider. [The subject you is understood.]
   b. Ambiguous modifiers seem to modify two different parts of a sentence. Readers can’t
   tell whether they modify words that come before or after them. To correct an ambiguous
   modifier, place the word so its relationship can’t be misinterpreted.
   Confusing:         People who drive cars to work occasionally can expect to find a parking space.
   Better:            People who occasionally drive cars to work can expect to find a parking space.

   Confusing:         Although working conditions improved slowly employees grew dissatisfied.
   Better:            Although working conditions slowly improved, employees grew dissatisfied. [Case #1:
                      the conditions improved slowly]
   Better:            Although working conditions improved, employees slowly grew dissatisfied. [Case #2:
                      employee morale dropped slowly]

2. ERRORS IN SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT
Plural subjects take plural verbs and singular subjects take singular verbs. Another way to
state this rule using grammatical terms is “Subjects and verbs must agree in number.”
The key to avoiding most problems in subject-verb agreement is to identify the subject of a
sentence, determine whether it’s singular or plural, and then choose a verb in the same number
and keep it near its subject.
Generally subjects that end in s are plural, while verbs that end in s are singular. (There are
exceptions to this rule—for example, the word ballistics is singular.)
a. Phrases between the subject and verb do not change the requirement that the verb must
agree in number with its subject.
    An inspection team consisting of 36 people is investigating that problem.
    A general, accompanied by 3 colonels and 15 majors, is attending the conference.
b. A linking verb agrees with its subject, not with its complement.
    The commander’s main problem is untrained Airmen.
    Untrained airmen are the commander’s main problem.
c. A compound subject consists of two or more nouns or pronouns joined by one of these
conjunctions: and, but, or, for or nor. Some compound subjects are plural; others are not. Here
are guidelines for subject-verb agreement when dealing with compound subjects:
•   If two nouns are joined by and, they typically take a plural verb.
    The Air Force and the Army are two components of the nation’s defense forces.
•   If two nouns are joined by or, nor, or but, the verb should agree in number with the
    subject nearest it.
    Either the President or his cabinet members are planning to attend.
    Either the cabinet members or the President is planning to attend.
•   Use a singular verb for a compound subject that is preceded by each or every.
    Every fighter pilot and his aircraft is ready for the mission.
    Each boy and girl brings a snack to school.
•   Use a singular verb for a compound subject whose parts are considered a single unit.
    The Stars and Stripes was flown at half-mast at the Headquarters building.
    Ham and eggs is a delicious breakfast.
d. Use a singular verb with collective nouns (and noun phrases showing quantity) treated as a
unit, but a plural verb when treated as individuals.
    The thousand wounded is expected to arrive soon. [A quantity or unit]
    A thousand wounded were evacuated by air. [Individuals]

e. Use singular verbs with most indefinite pronouns: another, anybody, anything, each,
everyone, everybody, everything, neither, nobody, nothing, one, no one, someone, somebody and
something.
   Everyone eats at the cafeteria.
   The President said everybody was welcome to join.
   Everyone in the squadron takes a turn leading a service project.
f. With all, any, none and some, use a singular or plural verb, depending on the content.
   All of the money is reserved for emergencies. [singular-equivalent to “The money is reserved for
   emergencies.”]
   When the men arrive, all go straight to work. [plural—equivalent to “The men go straight to work”]
   All are expected to have a tour of duty overseas.
3. ERRORS IN PRONOUN REFERENCE (“Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement”)
A common error in pronoun use involves
agreement in number. If the noun is singular,                         Grammar Review: Pronouns
the pronoun is singular. If the noun is plural,              Pronouns are words that replace nouns and
the pronoun should be plural, too.                           refer to a specific noun. The noun being
                                                             referred to or replaced by the pronoun is
Let’s look at an example of an incorrect                     called the antecedent. Some examples:
pronoun reference:                                           SSgt Smith is our nominee for the award and
   Incorrect: Everyone should bring their books to           he has a good chance of winning.

                                                             replacing the noun later in the sentence.]
When correcting such a sentence, try for                     Three lieutenants arrived late to the meeting.

approach is to make the subject plural and                   [Three lieutenants is the antecedent; Their
                                                             and them are pronouns replacing the
keep the pronoun unchanged:
                                                             antecedent in the next sentence.]
   Correct: All students should bring their books to
   class.

Of course, using his or her is also acceptable, but it gets cumbersome when overused:
   Also correct: Everyone should bring his or her books to class.

With a compound subject joined by and, use a plural pronoun:
   My advisor and I can’t coordinate our schedules. [our is a plural pronoun]

When parts of an antecedent are joined by “or” or “nor,” make the pronoun agree with the
nearest part:
   John or Steve should have raised his hand.
   Neither the student nor his roommates will have their deposit returned.

The Tongue and Quill



Avoid awkward phrasing by placing the plural part second if one part of the antecedent is
singular and one part is plural.
   Awkward: Neither my parents nor my sister has stayed on her diet.
   Better: Neither my sister nor my parents have stayed on their diet.

Remember that embedded descriptive phrases can be tricky:
   Incorrect: He is one of those ambitious people who values promotion over personal ethics. [Values
   should be value because the pronoun who refers to people, not one. Clarification: he is one, but not
   the only one, of many ambitious people.]
Here are some other examples of incorrect pronoun reference:
   •   The Air Force maintains different types of numbered forces, but the organization of its
       headquarters is similar. [Its should be their to refer correctly to types.]
   •   The committee plans to submit their report by the end of the month. [Their should be its
       because committee functions as a single unit in this sentence.]
4. COMMA PLACEMENT AROUND PARENTHETICAL EXPRESSIONS
There are many rules about using commas to punctuate sentences, and we recommend you check
out Appendix 1 for the complete list. One class of common mistakes is nearly universal and
worth covering in this chapter—placement of commas around groups of words that interrupt the
sentence’s flow. Here’s the basic rule:
   Enclose nonrestrictive or parenthetical expressions with commas.
What does this mean? If an expression (a group of words) can be removed from the sentence
without changing its meaning, then enclose the expression with commas.
Though the rule is simple, applying the rule requires some judgment. Advocates of open
punctuation would argue that if the group of words does not “significantly” interrupt the
sentence, you don’t need commas. (See pages 274-275 for more about the open and closed
punctuation debate). Another judgment area is deciding which expressions are restrictive and
which are nonrestrictive. A restrictive expression limits or restricts the meaning of the words it
applies to, so it can’t be removed from the sentence without changing the meaning. A
nonrestrictive expression merely adds additional information. Here’s the bottom line: If you
can remove the expression from the sentence without changing the meaning, it is a nonrestrictive
expression that should be enclosed by commas.
Which punctuation is correct?
   1. People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.
   2. People, who live in glass houses, shouldn’t throw stones.
Answer #1 is correct. The expression who live in glass houses is restrictive. If you eliminate it,
the sentence changes meaning: People shouldn’t throw stones.

   1. My friend the architect who lives in a glass house has a party every year.
   2. My friend the architect, who lives in a glass house, has a party every year.
The correct answer depends on your situation. If you are in the Air Force and have one friend
who is an architect, then answer #2 is correct. The expression who lives in a glass house is
nonrestrictive—it provides information that is not essential to the sentence’s meaning, and it can
be removed without impact. On the other hand, if you work in an architecture firm and all your
friends are architects, then answer #1 is correct. In this case the expression identifies which one
of your architect friends has a party every year—it’s the one who lives in a glass house.
Though there’s some judgment involved in deciding if something is nonrestrictive, once you
decide to enclose an expression, don’t forget one of the commas.
       Incorrect:         The new faculty, including the civilians must show up at 0600 tomorrow for physical
                          training.

                          training.

       Incorrect:         Grammar errors including misplaced commas, inhibit writing clarity.

SUMMARY
Always edit! Editing is crucial to producing professional communication. Without solid editing
your writing can be disjointed, your reader becomes confused, and your message may be lost.
Does it take time? Absolutely! Budget time for editing—especially for time-critical
assignments—and with practice the whole process will seem second nature.
Editing isn’t the final step, however. Yes, someone else needs to look at your work of art. Get
ready to put on your thick skin, as this is not for the meek and timid. Read on to the final step to
better communication … how to fight for feedback.

                                GETTING APPROVAL




 This chapter covers:
     •   Informal feedback—how to get it, how to give it.
     •   Staff coordination—the players.
     •   Staff coordination—the process.


Fighting for feedback and getting approval for your communication are both activities that are
part of life in the Air Force. When you fight for feedback, you voluntarily seek out someone
else’s views on your speaking or writing product. Feedback can be very informal and it doesn’t
have to be from people with impressive job titles. When you get staff approval, you’re going
through a more formal process that allows individuals to review and comment on your
communication product. Feedback and coordination are closely linked: if you do a good job at
fighting for feedback, you’ll find that the coordination process becomes much smoother.

                                 FIGHTING FOR FEEDBACK
WHY FIGHT FOR FEEDBACK?
So, why should you fight for feedback? Perhaps the biggest benefit is getting a second set of
eyes to review your work. Even the best writers and speakers can become so close to their
projects that they can’t see where they can be made stronger. They may omit vital information,
fail to see a weakness in their argument or just overlook the need for a transition between two
main points. Their closeness to the material and pride of authorship can distort or obscure their
viewpoint. Smart communicators realize this tendency and seek objective feedback from a fresh
set of eyes. If you seek out and listen to feedback you are much more likely to produce accurate,
understandable communication that “answers the mail” and resonates with your audience.
Another reason to fight for feedback is that it often saves time during the coordination process.
Whether it’s the staff package you’ve been working hard on for 3 weeks or the briefing you have
to present Friday, getting feedback from someone else’s point of view will help smooth things
out later as your package makes its way up the chain of command. In some cases having
someone review and provide feedback can also be a smart political move—if individuals “buy
in” early in the process, they may be a source of support later if it becomes necessary to defend
the material.
WHERE CAN I GET FEEDBACK?
Meaningful feedback can come from many different sources. Coworkers or fellow staffers may
be a good choice because of their familiarity with the issue and its jargon. They may have also
had to brief or write for the same people on similar issues; if so, they can give you some tips or
lessons learned. You may also choose to go to different people for different aspects of your
work. For example, you may find it helpful to solicit suggestions for improving grammar,
organization and content from three different “trusted agents” who are strong in those particular
areas. You may even want to use a trusted agent who’s totally outside your organization to see if
your message makes sense to someone with no clue about the material.
WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK SHOULD I ASK FOR?
Once you’ve picked out your feedback sources, you should let them know what kind of feedback
you’re looking for. (We’re not suggesting you say, “Tell me how wonderful this is—I’ve
worked so hard on it!”) Unless you give them clear guidance, reviewers may focus on details
like spelling, grammar and margins. Though these are important, make it clear that you want
feedback on the big picture, too. Here are some examples of items you should ask them to
address:
Is my purpose clear and am I properly targeting my audience? For starters, you want to give
your reviewers a sense of your audience and your purpose. Will the audience positively receive
the message you intend to convey? Ask them to tell you the bottom line they walked away with
after reviewing your material. Was it what you intended?
Did I address the issue at the right level of detail? Too many details can obscure your
message while too few details can lead to confusion, questions and delays. Ask your reviewers if
you’ve addressed the issue(s) without going too far into the weeds. You could also have them
ask you questions on the material. Have you anticipated possible questions? If you don’t feel
comfortable answering their questions, you may need to go back and do more research. Along

                                                          Fighting for Feedback and Getting Approval


the same lines, reviewers may help you pinpoint inconsistencies or unclear material that your
final audience might find as well.
Are there other viewpoints I need to consider? Finally, your reviewer may offer differing
viewpoints on the material. If that’s the case, ask for clarification on their viewpoint if
necessary, but don’t argue with them. Instead, ask yourself if their ideas may come up again
later. If so, you probably need to address them in your material.
The bottom line to getting feedback is having an open mind and being able to accept criticism.
Don’t take comments personally, even though they are attacking your baby. Accept feedback
willingly and use it constructively—it’s part of the process of developing a quality product.
HOW TO GIVE FEEDBACK
There are certain things to keep in mind when giving feedback. First, effective feedback is
consistent, objective and sensitive to the stated purpose. If someone asks you to review a
package, make sure you understand what the person wants from your review and stick to it.
Second, distinguish between necessary, desirable, and unnecessary changes. A page full of red
marks is hard to interpret. Instead, give the author a sense of what really needs to be changed
versus the “happy to glad” kinds of suggestions. Next, helpful suggestions pinpoint specific
problems, such as awkward sentences, grammar, etc. A general statement like “you need to
work on your sentence structure” isn’t as helpful as underlining specific sentences that need help.
Finally, you should concentrate on improving the message’s content, not the style or personal
preferences of the author (unless the author has asked you specifically to comment on writing
style).
FEEDBACK PHILOSOPHY
Feedback should describe rather than judge. Authors are more likely to listen and
incorporate feedback if it’s phrased constructively. Avoid judgmental language—it places
people on the defensive. Remember, feedback should be directed at a person’s work or behavior,
not at the person.
Feedback is both positive and negative. A balanced description of other people’s work takes
both strong and weak points into account. Both types of feedback give useful information to
those people who want to change and improve their work.
Feedback should be specific rather than general. General statements about other people’s
work do not indicate the performance elements they may need to change and the elements that
may serve as models. Highlight or underline specific items you want to bring to the author’s
attention, and make annotations or comments in the margins. See page 102 for commonly used
proofreading marks.
Feedback should consider the needs of both the receiver and the giver of the feedback.
Feedback often reflects the state of mind of the reviewer, not just the quality of the work. If
you’re seeking feedback from someone else, try to pick an appropriate time to make the request
and be realistic about the time required for the review. Similarly, reviewers should make sure
they are in the right frame of mind before analyzing the material and offering feedback.




                                               – 107 –

Feedback should be directed at behavior the receiver can control. Only frustration results
when people are reminded of shortcomings they cannot control. A suggestion to improve the
briefing room’s temperature, for example, is probably beyond the individual’s control. However,
briefing skills and mannerisms are within the person’s ability to control.
Feedback should be analyzed to ensure clear communication. Discuss or clarify any
feedback you’re not sure of to clear up any misinterpretations. The sender’s intended message is
not always what the receiver hears.
Feedback should be solicited rather than imposed (except for the supervisor-subordinate
situation). Feedback is most useful when the receiver asks for it. The receiver is more likely to
be receptive to your inputs in that case, as opposed to an attitude of “Who asked you?”
A WORD ON SUPERVISOR-SUBORDINATE FEEDBACK
As a supervisor, you need to be tactful and patient, especially when approving and disapproving
the communications of subordinates. As a supervisor, you are obligated to help your people
improve their work. This obligation may mean helping them to revise or rewrite their
communication, especially if they are inexperienced. Whatever your role, tact and patience
come more easily to people once they really understand feedback in its broadest context.

                  GETTING APPROVAL (a.k.a. COORDINATION)
A formal coordination process gives interested individuals an opportunity to contribute to and
comment on a communication product. Though most staff coordination involves written
products (i.e., “the staff package”), important briefings can also be subjected to a formal review
process. Formal coordination gives affected individuals a chance to comment, and helps ensure
the best course of action is presented to the decision maker. Coordination also lets the decision
maker know who supported or disagreed with the position stated in the paper and who agreed to
take subsequent actions within their areas of responsibility.
Getting a staff package fully coordinated takes a lot of time, diligence, and hard work. The
coordination process has to be closely monitored by the package’s OPR to make sure the
package gets seen by everyone who needs to see it and doesn’t get forgotten in someone’s in-
box. Here are several considerations that may reduce headaches as you work your package up to
the decision maker.
THE “WHO” OF COORDINATION
One of the first things you need to decide as you get ready to put your package through the
approval process is who needs to see the package.
Check your organization’s policies on coordination. In many organizations, policies exist on
coordination requirements for routine packages: find out if your product falls in this category.
Your boss may have a list of people who need to see your package. Also check to see what
guidance is available electronically—many units have an Action Officer’s Guide posted on their
website.

                                                          Fighting for Feedback and Getting Approval


Check with key contacts in the organization. Contacts throughout the organization can be
very helpful during the staffing process. Fellow staffers, executive officers and secretaries can
provide advice on who needs to coordinate on your package, including individuals or agencies
that you hadn’t thought of. Also, they can give you perspectives on what the bosses will and
won’t accept. As you build and get to know this “underground of expertise,” use it to your
advantage.
Realize that the coordination list may grow with time. Don’t be surprised if other offices are
added as the coordination process occurs. Depending on the material and which level of staff
you’re dealing with (wing staff versus Air Staff), you may be unaware of all the offices that need
to see your package.
Is there a person on your coordination list who carries a lot of clout? When planning your
coordination strategy, you should probably determine who the “Heavy” is. Who is the one
person that can make or break your package during coordination? Who is the one person who
could kill your project with a nonconcur? These people often have strong feelings about how and
when they are approached. Some of them may hate a “surprise package” and always want to be
the first to be consulted on an issue. In this case you may want to get early buy-in—which can
help ensure that others fall into line. Others may want to see what others have to say about the
issue before it ever reaches their desk. Use your contacts to find out who these influential people
are, what their preferences are and how they like to be approached.
THE “HOW” OF COORDINATION
Aside from deciding who needs to coordinate on your package, you have other things to consider
prior to releasing your package for coordination.
Do you want to send out a preview copy? You may want to send a draft package out early to
potential coordinators, especially for issues that are complex or for offices whose inputs are
crucial to your package’s success. Doing so allows them time to study the issue and also saves
time later during formal coordination. Also, you may want to coordinate by telephone for small
packages, for people who are extremely familiar with issue or with off-base agencies.
How are you going to route your copy/copies to the various coordinating offices? You need
to consider how you’re going to send your package around. Will you have only one copy that is
routed to all affected offices? This may work for high-level packages that don’t have a lot of
offices to go through, but the more offices you add to the coordination list, the longer this
process will take. Instead, you may want to “shotgun” out a number of copies of the package so
a number of offices can coordinate on the package at the same time. This will speed up the
process, but you will have more copies of the package to keep track of and the various offices
won’t get to see what each other are saying about the material. You will have to figure out
which way will work better for your particular case. Also, don’t forget to determine when the
“Heavy” will coordinate on your package.
Consider the boss and the schedule. You’re not done yet. There are some more things you
want to do while preparing to go for coordination. For one, get your boss’s blessing before
going out-of-office. You want to make sure the boss agrees with what you are saying. You
probably want to establish a tentative schedule, based on any deadlines you are up against. If
you have a deadline for completion, build a schedule backwards from that point to allow for



                                               – 109 –
The Tongue and Quill


reviews, changes and recoordination. As part of your schedule planning, check to see if any key
personnel coordinating on your package are going to be TDY or on leave for extended periods.
If you’re using e-mail to send your package around, consider the following. Specify who is
coordinating, who is getting an informational copy, and who will be approving the package.
Consider using “COORD,” “INFO,” “APPROVE,” or other keywords in the Subject line. Use
clear instructions (i.e., how do you want comments documented and what do you want the
offices to do with the package when they’re finished with it?) and finally, attach all attachments.
WAIT! One final check. Before you hit the SEND button or before you go to make all of those
copies to send out, get someone else to review the package to make sure you haven’t forgotten
something obvious. Do one last check for spelling and grammar errors—don’t make others
proofread your work.
FOLLOWING YOUR PACKAGE
Know where your package is at all times. Use secretaries, contacts or automated tracking
systems to track your package(s) and follow up, follow up, follow up. Keep the package moving
according to your schedule. You want to avoid suspensing higher offices, but at the same time
you want to let them know what the situation is so they can help push your package along. As
you get the packages back, keep all correspondence and comments and make sure you retrieve
all coordination copies before going for signature. Make sure you’ve incorporated any
appropriate suggestions into the final product. You may want to summarize the comments and
inputs for the approving authority.
NONCONCURRENCES
How do you handle a nonconcur? Generally, you only want to send up packages that have
received concurrence from all offices. So, do you change the package or do you just include the
nonconcurrence in the final package? That may depend on where the nonconcur is coming from.
You probably would concede the point to someone with a lot of clout; otherwise your package is
as good as dead. Short of that, what can you do? You may be able to persuade the other party to
see your point of view. If that doesn’t work, do you give in by making small concessions or
make a stand? Before you decide to make a stand, you probably want to think about a couple of
things. For one, is the issue THAT important, or can you make a concession? Remember also
that with the give and take of staff work, a compromise now may help you later. Choose your
battles carefully; however, there comes a time to stand firm when you know you’re right.
Finally, do you have the full support of your boss? Any unresolved disputes at your level may
need to be highlighted for resolution at a higher level.
STARTING OVER
Too many substantial changes may require you to start the coordination process all over. You’ll
have to decide if you’ve crossed this threshold once you see what kind of inputs you’re getting
on the package. If you decide to start over, recirculate both the original and changed packages to
illustrate the changes you’ve made and why you’ve made them.

                                                         Fighting for Feedback and Getting Approval


FINISHING UP
Don’t give up. You’ll eventually work your way up the chain until you reach the final audience.
Remember what we said at the beginning: getting that staff package fully coordinated takes a lot
of time, diligence and hard work. Don’t get frustrated. Along the way, you will receive lots of
suggested improvements to your package, but remember why you are coordinating this material
in the first place—to present the boss with the best course of action and to tell him or her who
agreed with it and had inputs to it. So don’t be surprised by inputs that keep your message
consistent with previous decisions by the boss and the other supervisors in your chain of
command.
COORDINATING ON OTHERS’ PACKAGES
When asked to coordinate on someone else’s package, don’t put it off. Review it, make your
inputs to it and keep it moving. It helps keep your desk clear and the other person may
remember your efficiency when he or she gets your package. This will also keep you from
busting the suspense. If you need more time to review the material, ask for an extension. But
don’t wait until the suspense to ask for an extension—be proactive. Finally, ask if there are any
nonconcurrences on the package so you can take that into consideration.
SUMMARY
As a staffer, you have to remember the big picture. Your job is to get the corporate stamp on the
package. You do this by first getting feedback from a few key individuals to make sure your
message is loud and clear. Then, you get other offices to approve what you are proposing
through the coordination process. Only after the package is fully coordinated can you provide
the boss with the best course of action and tell him who is supporting that action.
Proper coordination is the oil that lubricates complex organizations and enables efficient
operations. How you view the process and your critical role is crucial. Is coordination just a
bureaucratic hassle that you have to endure, or will you meet the challenge head-on by doing a
professional, proper job? Your attitude is key to success.

                                COORDINATOR’S CHECKLIST
          Before routing to others, prepare the package and all of its attachments. As
          necessary…
          ; Prepare a “camera-ready” copy of the material.
          ; Regarding the material you are presenting, ask yourself:
              ;    Are all facts—pro and con—given, and are they accurate?
              ;    Are some of your “facts” actually assumptions or opinions?
              ;    Is the material concise and clearly presented?
              ;    Does the final recommendation represent a sound—the best—position?
              ;    Can I justify my proposal if asked?
              ;    Are all administrative procedures completed and accurate?
          ; Get feedback on your package from a trusted agent.
          ; Would you sign the paper yourself if you were the approving official?
          ; Modify your paper according to the above guidance and questions.
          After taking the necessary actions above, you should:
          ; Decide who will coordinate (and in what order), ensuring each office has a continuing
            interest in the substance of the paper. Seek your chief’s guidance, if necessary.
          ; Decide how you will route the package through the above offices.
          ; Map out a schedule for coordination, based on your routing plan.
          ; Coordinate the paper within your own directorate first, and get the chief’s signature on the
            paper so that coordinators will know they’re coordinating your office’s position, not
            yours.
          ; Hand carry coordination whenever time permits or when the subject is complex.
          ; Coordinate by telephone and e-mail when feasible and practical.
          ; Attach any nonconcurrence to the package if it cannot be resolved with the appropriate
            official and send a summary of the disputed issues to your chief to resolve. Show future
            coordinators the nonconcurrence.
          ; Provide copies only if required or upon request. Save paper!
          ; Keep all correspondence and comments.
          ; Retrieve all coordination copies and incorporate/address suggestions before going for
            final signature/approval.

 This chapter covers:
     •   The basics of verbal communication: It’s all in the delivery!
     •   Conquering those crazy quirks.
     •   Delivery formats.
     •   Using visual aids to your advantage.


Sooner or later, you will have to speak in public. It comes with being in the military,
there’s little you can do to avoid it, and the requirements will increase as you climb the
ranks. If the thought makes you nervous, you’re not alone! Research shows that most
people place fear of public speaking second only to fear of dying. If you are
inexperienced, the fundamentals and tips for polished speaking in this chapter will help
you solve these problems. If you are an accomplished speaker, use this as a review … or
skip it.
One goal should be to improve your self-concept as a speaker. Think positively, and
focus on improvement, not perfection. Like writing and listening, speaking is a skill;
once you grasp the basics, the rest is practice, polish and style. You may be embarrassed
by your initial mistakes, but you’ll survive. Few of us will become guest speakers, but all
of us can become more effective if we practice the basics. Learn all you can from your
contemporaries; some of them are accomplished speakers. If you are already a speaker
extraordinaire, share your views, tips and personal hang-ups about speaking with others.
Everyone improves when they receive timely and objective feedback.


               “Practice doesn’t make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect.”

when preparing an oral presentation, but we
all know there’s more to it than that. Let’s
talk about delivery techniques.

                        IT’S ALL IN THE DELIVERY:
                   PART ONE—VERBAL COMMUNICATION
How effectively do you use your voice to drive home your ideas or information? You
have control over rate, volume, pitch, pause and other aspects of your speech. So, use
your voice to create interest in your presentation. Read on to find out what we mean.
RATE
There is no correct rate of speed for every speech. However, you might consider this:
People can listen 4 to 5 times faster than the normal spoken rate of 120 words a minute.
So, if you speak too slowly, you will lose the interest of an audience who is processing
information much faster than you are delivering it! On the other hand, you don’t want to
use the same rate of speech all the time. Use the rate of speech that you need to add
emphasis to what you want during your presentation. Consider speaking at a faster rate
to indicate excitement or sudden action or a slower rate to hint at calm or a more serious
tone.
VOLUME
Volume is another verbal technique that can give emphasis to your speech. If possible,
check out the room to know how loudly you must talk, remembering you will need to talk
louder with a crowd since the sound is absorbed. Ask someone in the back of the room if
you can be heard. Remember your voice will carry further when the room is empty
versus full. If the audience must strain to hear you, they will eventually tune you out
from utter exhaustion. A portable microphone may be a good idea if you know you tend
to speak quietly, and one is often required in large auditoriums. Speak louder or softer to
emphasize a point—a softer level or lower volume is often the more effective way to
achieve emphasis.
PITCH
To use pitch effectively, you need to practice the talents of a singer. Pitch is really the
use of notes (higher or lower) in voice range. Start by speaking in a voice range that is
comfortable for you and then move up or down your scale for emphasis, using pitch
changes in vowels, words or entire sentences. You can use a downward (high to low)

                                          – 116 –
                                                                          Air Force Speaking

inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty and an upward (low to high) inflection for
an air of uncertainty. Variety in speech pitch helps to avoid monotone and capture the
listener’s attention.
PAUSE
The pause gives you time to catch your breath and the audience time to collect your
ideas. Never hurry a speech; pause occasionally so your audience can digest your
comments. The important question is this: Where? Pauses serve the same function as
punctuation in writing. Short pauses usually divide points within a sentence, and longer
pauses note the ends of sentences. You can also use longer pauses for breaks from one
main point to another, from the body to the conclusion of your speech, or to set off an
important point worthy of short reflection. A pause may seem long to you, but it’s
usually much shorter than you think … and your audience will appreciate it. However,
don’t get pause-happy and make your speech sound choppy.
ARTICULATION AND PRONUNCIATION
Your articulation and pronunciation reflect your mastery of the spoken English language.
Articulation is the art of expressing words distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability to say
words correctly. Of course, you may be able to articulate your thoughts and still
mispronounce words while doing so. Unfortunately (and unfairly), many people consider
word pronunciation or mispronunciation a direct reflection on your intelligence. Listen
to yourself and make your words distinct, understandable and appropriate to your
audience. If you are not sure of your pronunciation, consult a current dictionary—before
you get up and do your thing. You can even look up dictionaries on-line with audio links
that will pronounce the word for you!
LENGTH
                              “Be clear, be quick, and be gone.”
                                     — from Presenter’s University
Have you ever taken a PME course in-residence and wondered why the instructors were
so big on the timing of your briefings? It is because the length of your presentation is
crucial. In our military environment, you must be able to relay your thoughts and ideas
succinctly. A key rule in verbal communication is to keep it short and sweet. There are
few people who will tolerate a briefer or speaker who wastes the audience’s time. Have
your stuff together before you speak. Know what you want to say and then say it with
your purpose and the audience in mind.
OK, we’ve just hit the highlights of controlling and managing your voice to optimize the
delivery of your briefing. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to actually
practice these tips so that you will soon have the “radio voice” that public speakers dream
about. But wait, you’re not done yet! There’s more to the fine art of public speaking
than your managing your voice. You need to manage your gestures, movement, and that
pesky thing called nervousness.

               PART TWO—NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION
                  “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”
                                                               — Anonymous
Numerous studies have shown that people remember less than 10 percent of what is
verbally presented, but first impressions are largely based on nonverbal communication
such as how you dress, carry yourself, and use gestures and other body language. Your
biggest nonverbal challenge to conquer will be your nervousness, so you must be
prepared to overcome (or at least diminish) stage fright. Stage fright is often nothing
more than misdirected energy, meaning the excitement and/or possible anxiety you feel is
displayed in some form or fashion for all to see. You probably have witnessed a great
presentation “gone bad” solely due to nerves that have gone unchecked. Here’s a
checklist on how to overcome stage fright and put your best foot forward ... or at least
fool your audience. Remember, it may be impossible to be entirely free from
nervousness—that’s OK! But you don’t want the nervousness to disable you from
sending your message.




                           It
                         never
                        gets old!

         OVERCOMING “SWEATY PALMS SYNDROME”
Analyze your audience: listening traits, needs, desires, behaviors, and educational
background. This will reduce your fear of the unknown and the resulting
nervousness.
Check out the place where you’re speaking. Is it large enough to accommodate the
number of people? Does it have a blackboard, microphone, arrangement for visual
aids, tables, chairs, ventilation, lighting, pencils, paper, telephones, extra projector
bulbs, etc? Does the equipment operate properly?
Practice, practice, practice. Using a tape recorder, a video camera, a full-length
mirror or even your peers can be really helpful. Try doing a “dry run” at the office
or where you’ll be.
Memorize your introduction and transition into the main point. It’ll help you
through the first and most difficult minute.
Smile and be positive! Your audience wants you to succeed! Keep your
nervousness to yourself ... chances are your audience won’t even notice if you don’t
mention it.
Take a short walk right before you “go on stage” to help release some energy.
Deliver your message. Focus your attention where it belongs ... not on yourself.
Make eye contact and look for feedback. Play your audience. Let them know you
are looking at and talking to them. It holds their attention. If you look only at your
notes, you may lose your listeners—and you can’t wake them up if you don’t know
they’re asleep!
Use simple, everyday language appropriate for your audience. Use contractions
and keep sentences short. Use personal pronouns, if appropriate. Repeat key words
and follow with specific examples if you get into abstract or complicated reasoning
Involve members of your audience by soliciting their answers and information.
Enhance your presentation through creative use of newspaper clippings, cartoons,
music, appropriate quotes and relevant, self-deprecating experiences to get a point
across.
Use your excess energy naturally: facial expressions, pertinent gestures, walking,
or pressing fingertips or thumbs against lectern or chair. Use your facial
expressions, hands and arms to reinforce your speech and your points of
emphasis—just don’t overdo them. Leaning on the lectern, rocking back and forth
or side to side or slouching on one leg and then the other is never a positive way to
use your excess energy. Read on for more tips on those dreaded nervous habits.
Looking good builds confidence and builds your credibility with the audience. Do
you need a haircut? Is your uniform pressed? Are your ribbons, nametag and
insignia attached correctly? Your buttons buttoned? Your shoes shined? Are you
standing erect and feeling alert, but relaxed? Remember, in your audience’s mind,
a frumpy uniform and sloppy bearing equals an equally frumpy presenter. Fair or
not, that’s the way your audience’s mind works. We’re all critics!

COMMON NONVERBAL QUIRKS
Here are some final thoughts on nervousness. Most of us have quirks when we are put in
the limelight. The key is to be cognizant of yours and don’t overdo them. Keep yourself
in check, and as always, seek feedback. In time you will have it down to an art. We’ve
named a few of the more common quirks below. Do any hit home for you?
•   The life raft. This is the speaker who clings for dear life to podium or lectern. Their
    ultimate fear is leaving the comfort and security of that piece of wood in front of
    them, so they hold onto it with both hands in desperation. Walking about the room is
    incomprehensible to these speakers.
•   The fig leaf. This is the speaker who is recovering from the above habit, is now
    venturing out in front of the audience, but is still not quite sure what to do with those
    pesky things called hands. He or she wants to run back to the safety of their life raft,
    but instead may lay one hand over another at the end of stiff arms, with hands resting
    … where a fig leaf would be. Do you get the picture?
•   The hand washer. This is a speaker who stores all nervousness in their hands.
    While they speak, they wash and they wash. You may think with all that friction they
    would suffer thermal injury to their palms, but they’re indestructible. Too bad you
    missed their message while you focused on the quirk.
•   The caged tiger. Listening to these speakers is like watching a tennis match. These
    speakers continually pace from one side of the room or stage to the other, never even
    stopping to check their pulse. They expend so much energy that their briefing
    qualifies as aerobic exercise. Their calorie expenditure goes up even higher when
    they combine this technique with hand washing.
•   The rocker. Rockers are caged tigers on the road to recovery. They have conquered
    the worst phases of stage fright and no longer fear visible perspiration or dry mouth,
    but they have some residual fear of standing still and simply talking. Speaking
    experience has tamed this beast, but not to the point of total comfort with the art of
    public speaking. There are two style variations: 1) the fore-and-aft rocker and 2) the
    side-to-side rocker.
•   Pocket maniacs. OK, it’s against regulation, but these folks should consider sewing
    their pants pockets shut because whenever they speak they start counting the change
    from their last trip to the soda machine. Many of these speakers are trying
    desperately not to be hand washers or fig leafers and end up jamming their hands in
    their pockets. They are often oblivious to the new distraction and annoyance they
    inflict on their audience. These speakers may find that holding something—
    anything—will help them refrain from this habit and prevent them from “hand
    washing.”
•   Pen clickers. These speakers are related to the pocket maniacs. They have to be
    doing something with their hands. All pens, pencils and other similar objects should
    be removed from their possession before they get up to give a presentation because
    the temptation is just too great. They are compelled to manipulate and click any pen
    in their possession, which does not make for high marks on audience critiques.

 By themselves, these quirks won’t make you fail as a speaker, but they can create
 problems if they are severe—the audience begins to focus on the quirk instead of your
 message. Again, most of us have done some of these things at one time or another. Try
 to be aware of your own mannerisms, keep them in check and make sure they are not
 becoming habit and detracting from your message.

                                                              Please don’t hurt

                           DELIVERY FORMATS:
                   IMPROMPTU, PREPARED AND MANUSCRIPT
Your approach to delivery of the spoken message may be affected by several factors,
including the time you have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three common
delivery formats are listed below.
Impromptu speaking is when we respond during a meeting or “take the floor” at a
conference. It’s what we do when we speak publicly without warning or on a few
moments’ notice. To do it well requires a great amount of self-confidence, mastery of the
subject and the ability to “think on your feet.” A superb impromptu speaker has achieved
the highest level in verbal communications.
                                            Prepared (formerly extemporaneous speaking or
    Both students and instructors have      briefing) refers to those times when we have ample
    had trouble differentiating impromptu   opportunity to prepare. Most military briefings are
    and extemporaneous speaking in the      done in this format. This doesn’t mean we write a
    PME classroom. Why? Because             script and memorize it, but it does require a

    these terms. Some, including The        practicing. The specific words and phrases used at
    Cambridge Dictionary of American        the time of delivery, however, are basically
    English, define extemporaneous as       spontaneous and sound very natural.
    “done or said without preparation”
                                            A manuscript briefing is used in situations that
    (synonymous with impromptu). The

                                            script of what you are going to say. Such a script
    extemporaneous speech “is prepared

•     Ensures key information won’t be omitted.
•     Avoids repercussions caused by a briefer’s inadvertent ad-libbing.
•     Imparts exact definitions and precise phrasing, if these are important.
•  Allows anyone to present a “canned briefing” without extensive preparation and
rehearsal time—including less knowledgeable personnel.

CAUTION! Manuscripts make a briefing a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Unless you
are a talented speaker, reading words aloud sounds dull. People frequently tend to lack
spontaneity, lack eye contact and stand behind the lectern with their script. You may also
lose credibility. The audience may think you’re hiding behind the script and reading
something you really don’t know anything about. Finally, know your audience! They
may feel insulted if you read something they could have just as well read themselves. If
you can deliver a manuscript briefing without error and still maintain a natural and direct
contact with your audience, you have a masterful command of “speak-reading.”
Here are some key points in preparing and presenting a manuscript briefing.
•   Prepare the briefing:
    - Use a large, easy-to-read font (at least size 12) in all capital letters
    - Write as if you were speaking
    - Fill only the top two-thirds of page so that your eyes won’t drop and you won’t lose
      eye contact with your audience
    - Double or triple space; never break a word at the end of a line or a sentence at the
      end of a page
    - Number pages with bold figures
    - Underscore or highlight words you wish to emphasize … insert double slashes (//)
      where you plan a major pause
    - Use a loose-leaf binder (e.g. in case of windy days or nervous fingers) or stack
      pages loosely to turn pages
    - Mark script with red dots to show visual aid changes
• Practice, practice, practice:
    - Read and reread until you’ve practically memorized it
    - Add the ingredients of volume, inflection and eye contact
    - Avoid combinations of words that are difficult to say
    - Look at your audience when uttering emphatic words and during the closing words
      of a sentence
    - Practice using gestures—strive for enthusiasm
    - Dry run your visual aids
• Close with confidence:
    - Never explain why you choose to read (it won’t be apparent if you’ve prepared!)
    - Be flexible; if necessary (and appropriate), know where you can shorten the speech
    - Avoid being lengthy after saying “In conclusion.”
    - Don’t add new information at the end

Individuals who can strongly present briefings in all three types of delivery formats are
the envy of everyone. They appear knowledgeable and comfortable in their roles as
speakers because they have done their homework. They may be experts on their subject
and know how to present their views with clarity on a moment’s notice (impromptu
speaking). They have researched and rehearsed their presentations (prepared and
manuscript briefings). They think carefully before they speak, outline their main ideas,

                  FYI … BRIEFINGS IN THE JOINT ENVIRONMENT
In the Air Force, the term briefing is loosely applied to almost any oral presentation
given in the context of military activities. The following list was adapted from Army
FM 101-5, and serves as a reference for those who may find themselves in a joint
assignment. This terminology is not commonly used in the Air Force; the intent is to
familiarize you with what else is “out there.” If you are in a joint assignment, you may
hear briefings defined and named according to their purpose. Here are four types of
briefings and their characteristics.

Informative briefing: Purpose is to keep listener abreast of the current situation and
supply specific information.
•   Designed to inform the listener and gain his understanding
•   Deals with
        High priority facts and information requiring immediate action
        Complex information on complicated plans, systems, statistics, or visuals
        Controversial information requiring explanation
•   May have conclusions or recommendations

Decision briefing: Purpose is to produce an answer to a question or obtain a decision
on a specific problem.
•   Briefer must be prepared to present
        Assumptions
        Facts
        Alternative solutions
        Reasons/rationale for recommended solutions(s)
        Coordination involved
        Visual information
•   Briefer states he/she is looking for a decision; asks for decision if one is not
    forthcoming at conclusion.
•   Advises appropriate staff elements of commander’s decision after the briefing.

Staff briefing: Main purpose is to secure a coordinated effort and
        Rapidly disseminate information orally
        Aid group decision-making
        Secure a united effort
•   Most widely used and most flexible briefing—used at all levels of command
•   Visuals will make complex issues clearer
•   Keeps commanders/staffs abreast of situation
•   May involve an exchange of information, issuance of directives, or presentation of
    guidance

Mission briefing: Purpose is to impart information that is used to elaborate on an
order, give specific instructions, or instill an appreciation for the mission.
•   Briefer must exercise care to avoid confusion or conflict with orders
•   Use maps and graphic representations of the situation
•   Mission briefing format varies from command to command

A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS…
                   “Enough with the bells and whistles–just get to the point.”
                                                      — General Hugh Shelton

                                                                      As always, check with

understand the content of your message. Remember,
comprehension rises dramatically when we see something rather than when we just hear
about it. The average person retains 5 percent of what is heard and 65 percent of what is
seen. More dramatically, the human brain processes visuals 400,000 times faster than
text! In other words, “show and tell” is better than just “tell” alone.
Slides are the most common visual aid used for briefings in today’s Air Force. They help
the briefer to remember key points and help to keep the presentation brief. The presenter
makes the slide simple and fills in the “white space” with concise spoken words.
Before we launch into Slides 101, let’s take a second to stress one point—you are also a
visual aid. If you are well groomed, professional and well prepared, you’ll be the most
effective visual aid in your presentation. It doesn’t matter how awesome your slides are.
If you look like a slob and appear insecure and awkward, the audience most likely won’t
take you or your message seriously. Take the time to put on a freshly pressed uniform
and look sharp!
PREPARING YOUR SLIDES
The capabilities of computers today make it easy to produce a                     Attention
blizzard of flashy visual aids. Instead of drawing up a dozen slides             PowerPoint
on a legal pad and running them over to the printing department, we               Rangers!
can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving
our desks.
Each organization is different when it comes down to how your slides should look.
However, most organizations in today’s Air Force agree that the information we present
shouldn’t be too complex. Don’t pack your slides with every detail and custom
animation feature you can dig up. You don’t need Venetian blind effects and fancy
backdrops; all you need is the information!
COLOR. Color is a very important communication tool. Good designers limit their
color palettes even if 256 different colors may be available.
•   Use colors in a standard manner throughout your presentation.
•   Limit your choices to 4 or 5 colors.
•   Use light colors on a dark background and vice versa.
•   Use colors to emphasize key elements, but try to avoid red lettering.




                                           – 126 –
                                                                        Air Force Speaking

•   Use the same background color on all images.
•   Avoid red/green and blue/red color combinations.
•   Use bright colors (yellow, orange, etc.) sparingly.
•   Maintain good contrast between important information and background.
TEXT. The first rule here is “less is more.” Less experienced briefers are often tempted
to pack presentations with every detail they can think of for fear they might leave
something out during the real thing. Slides should have minimal content and lots of
“white space.” Slides aim at the visual portion of the brain and will only confuse the
audience if they are jam-packed with data. The slides should not be self-explanatory. If
they are, you probably have too much stuff on them. Remember, you should add value to
the presentation and should supplement the slides with your eloquent speaking abilities.
•   Keep it simple. Use the “7 x 7 rule:”
    − No more than 7 words per line
    − No more than 7 lines per slide
•   Spelling is important!
•   Don’t read slides—it’s insulting.
•   If you have more than one slide per main point, add “Continued” on subsequent slides
    to keep flow.
•   Have only one thought per slide—it gives the audience time to refocus on you.
•   Avoid hyphenation at end of lines.
•   Use upper and lower case for three reasons:
    − Helps identify acronyms, which we love in the military!
    − More comfortable for audience, because this is how we read.
    − Makes your presentation look more professional.
•   Emphasize key words with boldface, italicized, underlined or colored text.
•   Left-justify your text.
•   Font size: Use the same type font throughout the presentation.
    − Title: 40 point
    − Subtitle: 30 point
    − Text: 22-26 point
•   Most importantly, you fill in the information. So, you should always know and be
    ready to present one level of detail below a piece of information. If you don’t, you
    will end up reading slides or the audience will have many questions left unanswered.

GRAPHICS. Whether designed for a briefing or written report, no graphic should be so
elaborate it becomes an end in itself and obscures your intended message. However,
when used wisely graphics can certainly add to your presentation. Although text is
important, audiences remember more when content is graphically presented. A 60-
minute briefing can be pretty boring if it is all done in text. But, on the flip side, cool
graphics do not guarantee an effective briefing. Read below for some tips to keep you in
check when using graphics.
•   Use only artwork suitable for your presentation. Know your audience!
•   Use graphs (bar charts, pie charts, etc.) to convey statistics.
•   Be careful with graphs: too many can be confusing.
•   Line graphs show trends over time.
•   Bar graphs compare values.
•   Pie charts compare values against a whole.
•   Tables: Don’t use if you can convey information verbally or in a graph—they usually
    appear overly “busy” on a slide.
    − Limit to 4 rows and 7 columns.
    − Use footnotes to remove distracting data from tables.
    − Round off numbers if possible.
    − Don’t put decimal points in numbers like 10 or 100. The audience may interpret
      “100.00” as “10,000.”
•   Place your graphics off-center—use them to lead your audience to important text
    information.
•   Be careful with animation:
    − Sound: Use sparingly and make sure they add impact.
    − Slide transitions: Most briefers overuse slide transitions. If you decide to use
      transitions, use the same type throughout your entire briefing, and make sure they
      add, not detract from your presentation.
•   Video can be quite effective, but again, use sparingly.
Make it Big, keep it Simple, make it Clear, and be Consistent!
OK! We’ve just highlighted how to develop effective slides for your briefing or
presentation with proper use of color, text and graphics. Remember, local policy will
always supersede the guidance we have provided. Let’s close this part of the chapter
with some general tips on slide presentations.

SUMMARY
Use vocal characteristics such as rate, volume, pitch and pause to enhance the impact of
their message.
Be aware of any nonverbal quirks; reduce nervousness through solid preparation.
Select an appropriate delivery format: impromptu, prepared, or manuscript.
Visual aids can enhance oral presentations, but don’t lose sight of the big picture.
Remember the basics of delivery, keep focused, and do your homework.
The more often you speak in front of or with a group, the more self-confident you
become. High confidence and thorough knowledge of your subject are important
prerequisites for speaking. Remember, if you have the time to prepare—do it!

  This chapter covers:
      •   Why listening is important to Air Force personnel.
      •   Three active listening strategies: Informative, Critical and Empathic approaches.
      •   Cultivating the motivation to listen well.



Listening is a valuable communication skill, but one that gets little respect and attention. Some
of us spend hours preparing and practicing our briefings; how much time and effort do we spend
on preparing and practicing to listen? Because listening is so undervalued, we’ll first make the
case for why it’s so important, and then describe ways to improve your listening skills.

               person to draw a breath is declared the listener.”

UNDERSTANDING HEARING AND LISTENING
To better understand the listening process, let’s begin by distinguishing between hearing and
listening. Hearing occurs when your ears pick up sound waves being transmitted by a speaker or
some other source. Hearing requires a source of sound and an ear capable of perceiving it. It
does not require the conscious decoding of information. Each day, you hear numerous sounds—
background music in an elevator, the hum of the computer, cars passing by outside—sounds you
may not even be aware of unless someone draws your attention to them.
Listening, on the other hand, involves making sense out of what is being transmitted. Listening
involves not only hearing; it involves attending to and considering what is heard. As you listen,
you receive sounds, and you consciously and actively decode them. Effective listening is an
active process, and active listening involves exerting energy and responding appropriately in
order to hear, comprehend, evaluate, and remember the message.
WHY IS LISTENING SO IMPORTANT?
Though listening is usually ignored in formal education, it is the most common form of
communication. According to Dr. John Kline, an authority on Air Force communication and the
author of Listening Effectively, studies have shown that we spend 70 percent of our waking hours
in some form of communication. Of the time we spend communicating, 10 percent is spent
writing, 15 percent is spent reading, 30 percent is spent speaking and 45 percent is spent
listening.
When speakers and listeners fail to communicate, the outcomes can be disastrous. Planes can
crash, unit morale can deteriorate, “routine” surgeries can have horrendous outcomes and
families can self-destruct. Though we often focus on the speaker’s role in communication, good
listening skills can often make the difference between success and failure.
Both Air Force and civilian managers put a premium on good listening. In a recent study, 282
members of the Academy of Certified Administrative Managers identified listening as the most
crucial management skill. In another study published in Communication Quarterly, business
people were polled on the most important communication skills they used at work and the one
they wished they had studied in college: Listening was the #1 answer to both questions.
Listening is especially important in the Air Force, and actually in any military unit. Success is
literally a matter of life and death, and we routinely maintain and operate equipment worth
millions of dollars. Receiving, comprehending, and remembering spoken information is critical,
and any miscommunication is potentially catastrophic. Effective listening helps to build the trust
and mutual respect needed to do our job. Military personnel must understand their team
members and the situation, and leaders with good listening skills often make better decisions and
have a stronger bond with their troops.
To summarize, listening allows us to learn the facts, evaluate situations, understand our team
members, and build trust with others. These are all really important, so why do so few people
listen well? Why is it so hard? And how do we get better at it?

MOTIVATIONAL BARRIERS TO LISTENING
Listening takes a lot of effort. Our willingness to exert that effort is linked to our motivation to
listen. Techniques to improve listening skills are worthless without cultivating the motivation to
use them.
To help yourself evaluate your own listening motivation, scan the questions below.
? Do I pretend to listen?
? Do I seek distractions?
? Do I criticize the speakers?
? Do I stereotype topics as uninteresting?
? Do I prejudge the meaning and intent of speaker’s messages?
? Do I avoid difficult and complex topics?
? Do I get emotionally charged up about minor points a speaker has made?
? In a conversation, do I tune out the speaker because I’m preparing my response?
? Do I interrupt others? Has anyone told me I sometimes interrupt others?
? Do I spend a disproportionate amount of time talking in meetings or social events?
? Does everything a speaker describes remind me of something that happened to me?
Though we’ve all been guilty of these once in a while, if you answered “yes” to three or more
questions, then you might benefit from some of the suggestions to improve your self-motivation
later in the chapter.
Sometimes we have blind spots and overestimate our success as listeners. In his book, Listening
Effectively, Dr. Kline describes how most individuals in groups will rate their own listening skills
as a 7.5 out of 10, while rating the rest of the group as a 4.1 out of 10. These data indicate that
most people see listening as a problem in others, but not in themselves.
Here’s another set of “workplace climate” questions to consider. If you have “yes” answers to
several of these questions, you might want to take a closer look at how you listen and interact
with others.
? Do employees go around you to talk to others about work issues?
? Do you often learn about important events after the fact?
? Do you frequently find yourself putting out organizational fires?
? Are you rarely tasked with complicated responsibilities?
? Do you receive lots of information in writing … including some items that would normally be
  handled face to face?
Sometimes it takes a deliberate effort to cultivate our motivation to listen. In today’s culture, a
“good communicator” is often defined in terms of one’s speaking ability, yet many would argue

                                               – 133 –

that listening is just as important, if not more so. Today’s effective listeners command respect
and admiration because listening is crucial to solving problems and making decisions.
PICK THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB: INFORMATIVE, CRITICAL, AND EMPATHIC
LISTENING
There are different situations where listening is important and different reasons to listen. It’s
important to acknowledge and identify these differences because appropriate listening behaviors
in one situation might be inappropriate in another situation.
Part of the challenge of listening is sorting out what situation you’re in and what response is
appropriate. One way to approach this sorting process is to look at three major reasons why we
listen in the workplace. We’ll talk more about each of these three categories in later sections, but
here’s a summary:
We listen to collect information from others (Informative Listening):
•   Receiving radio instructions in an aircraft cockpit.
•   Listening to an instructor lecture on good writing technique.
•   Receiving a briefing on a change to the assignment process.
•   Obtaining medical instructions from a doctor.
•   Learning your boss’s expectations during an initial feedback session.
We listen to judge—to evaluate a situation and make decisions (Critical Listening):
•   Investigating causes of a fatal mishap.
•   Determining which Airman to nominate for a quarterly award.
•   Helping the user formally specify requirements for a new weapon system.
•   Deciding which disciplinary action to administer.
We listen to understand and help others in situations where emotions are involved and the
speaker, not just the message, is important (Empathic Listening):
•   A subordinate is seeking advice on whether to reenlist.
•   Your spouse is worried about your next deployment.
•   A coworker is unsure how to deal with subtle discrimination.
•   Your teenager doesn’t want to move during senior year; you’ve got orders.
•   You’re trying to mend fences with a coworker after a major conflict.
Informative, Critical, and Empathic listening categories can be used in two different ways. First,
they can be used to characterize listening situations—that is, WHY we should be listening in this
situation. Second, they can be used to describe listening approaches—the behaviors we use in a
given situation and HOW we are listening.
The real fun begins when the approach and situation are mismatched—for example, using an
informative listening approach (taking notes, asking focused questions) in an empathic listening
situation (an angry spouse who feels you’re neglecting the family).

INFORMATIVE LISTENING
In informative listening, the listener’s primary concern is to understand information exactly as
transmitted. A successful listening outcome occurs when the listener understands the message
exactly as the sender intended. Informative listening is important when receiving information
from an established authority, or receiving information that is not open for debate.
For example, if you’re receiving a briefing on changes to the assignment system, your goal
should be to understand exactly what the rules are, not to sort out the reasons why you think the
rules are stupid. If you’re receiving formal training that will be followed by a test, your primary
goal should be to understand the material, not to evaluate whether the material should be taught
at this level.
SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING INFORMATIVE LISTENING:
1. Keep an open mind. If your primary goal is to understand the message, set aside your
preconceptions about the topic and just listen.
2. Listen as if you had to teach it. Many education and training specialists suggest this
technique. Typically we expend more effort to understand a subject when we know that we have
to teach it to someone else. By taking this approach, we have the mental fortitude to focus
longer, ask questions when we don’t understand, and think more deeply on a topic.
3. Take notes. Focus on main points, and don’t attempt to capture everything. This classic
technique is used in situations where you are trying to capture objective information, such as in
classes, staff meetings, etc. Note that if the listener and speaker are in a less formal, emotionally
charged situation, note taking might be misconstrued as hostile behavior (i.e., being put “on the
record,” or being documented for future adverse action) so use your judgment on whether it is
appropriate to the situation.
4. Exploit time gap between thinking and speaking speeds: The average speaking rate is:
180 words per minute, while most listeners can process 500 words per minute. Use this extra
time to mentally repeat, forecast, summarize and paraphrase the speaker’s remarks.
5. Respond and ask appropriate questions: Good informative listening questions help you
clarify and confirm you understand the message. Remember that you are trying to absorb as
much information as possible, and you are less focused on making value judgments on the
material. Here are some examples of appropriate questions or responses:
•   Repeat exact content back to the speaker—(this is common in radio communication).
    “We need toner, copy paper, and a three-hole punch from supply. I’ll get them now.”
•   Paraphrase in your own words.
    “So if I understand you, then….”

•   Ask for more specifics or details.
    “When you say a draft is due on 15 April, is that before or after the internal coordination
    process?”
    “How does the situation change if you’re married to another military member?”
•   Request an example for clarity.
    “If asking good questions can help listening performance, can you provide some examples?”
CRITICAL LISTENING
Critical listening can be thought of as the sum of informative listening and critical thinking. In
this case, the listener actively analyzes and evaluates the message, and listening success requires
understanding the message and assessing its merit. The listener is evaluating the support offered
by the speaker—as well as the speaker’s credentials and logic—and may either agree or disagree
with the message.
Critical listening may be appropriate when seeking input to a decision, evaluating the quality of
staff work or a subordinate’s capabilities, or conducting research.

help you stay focused on the speaker.
3. Exploit time gap between thinking and speaking speeds: Part 2: Use the time gap
described on the message. Remember to try to understand first and then evaluate second. Even
when you are listening critically, don’t mentally argue with the speaker until the message is
finished.

4. Ask appropriate questions: Good critical listening questions will be probing in nature so
you can better evaluate the intellectual content of the speaker’s message. Some examples of
good critical listening questions can be found in The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking by
Dr. Richard Paul and Dr. Linda Elder. The questions help the listener evaluate how the message
stacks up with universal intellectual standards like accuracy, relevance, fairness, etc.
   Accuracy: How could we verify or test that? Are others reporting the same results?
   Relevance: How does that fact relate to the problem?
   Breadth: Do we need to consider another point of view?
   Logic: Do our conclusions flow from our evidence?
   Significance: Is this the central idea? The most important problem?
   Fairness: Do we have any vested interests here? How would our opponents view this issue?

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING EMPATHIC LISTENING SKILLS
For empathic listening to be successful, the listener must understand the content of the message
and the speaker must feel understood. It’s this second half—making the speaker feel
understood—which requires some specialized skills.
Don’t you hate it when others want to “one-up” your story with something else? Or jump in and
give advice before they understand? If you’d like to improve your emphatic listening skills, try
to avoid the following invasive responses—they get in the way when you’re “seeking to
understand:”
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL STORIES: “Your situation is just like something that happened to
me…” “When I was your age…”
ADVISING: Immediately providing counsel based on our own experience—whether or not it
was requested.
PROBING: Asking questions solely from our own frame of reference.
EVALUATING: Immediately agreeing or disagreeing.
These types of responses are discouraged because they distract the speaker from the critical part
of the message, and they allow the listener to derail the conversation. Extroverts have more
difficulty avoiding autobiographical responses than introverts do. Parents often use these
responses with their children—the trick is to decide how much is too much. These responses are
appropriate after the speaker feels understood and is looking for advice or help … it’s just
important to wait until that point. The listener should return to empathic listening if emotions
rise again.
The skills involved in empathic listening are easy to describe, but difficult to practice. To help
you remember them, think about the acronym “HEAR”
       H = HEART: Commit to listening sincerely, avoid manipulation; remember the importance of
       the person, as well as the issue.
       E = EMOTIONS: Look and listen for speaker’s emotions as much as their words.
       A = AVOID: Avoid advice, autobiographies, evaluation; don’t interrupt or change the subject.
       R = REFLECT: Reflect back meaning and feeling until the speaker feels understood.

SOME FINAL THOUGHTS ON LISTENING: MOTIVATION MATTERS!
Think about the times you did a good job of listening…. Why did you do well? One of the
reasons was probably your level of motivation. Here are four suggestions on how to enhance
your motivation to listen in future situations.
1. Recall why this listening situation is important. Listeners should try to remember why this
particular situation is important. (Speakers should try to remind their audience why it’s
important to listen, too).
Informative and listening situations:
   •   Is it critical to mission success? Will this help me do my job better?
   •   Will this information help me make a better decision?
   •   Is it on the test? Is it a prerequisite for other material that is on the test?
   •   Can someone get hurt if we mess this up?
   •   Will our outfit look bad if I don’t “get” it? Will I look bad?
   •   Will we be discussing this later? Will I have to teach this to someone else?
   •   Is understanding this important to my personal or family goals?
Critical listening situations:
   •   Do I have to decide which position to take?
   •   Is the evidence strong and the logic sound?
   •   What unanswered questions surround this issue? What things are being left unsaid?
Empathic situations:
   •   Is this speaker having trouble communicating the facts because of strong emotions?
   •   Do I need to mend fences with this coworker?
   •   In this negotiation, am I really sure I know what is most important to the other party?
   •   Does this family member count on me for emotional support?
   •   Do I have a personal commitment to this person, as well as this issue?
2. Identify and correct barriers to listening motivation. Both listeners and speaker can
benefit from a hard look at factors that may inhibit listening. What factors can you control?
What factors do you just have to live with? Fix what you can, and acknowledge what you can’t.
  Physical barriers may block listening—noisy equipment, visual distractions, etc. Avoid
  distractions when possible: If you can, sit up front. This puts less noise and visual distraction
  between you and the speaker, and allows you to more clearly see any visual aids. Sitting next
  to quiet (or boring!) people also helps you to focus on the speaker.
  Personal barriers such as physical fatigue, illness and discomfort, as well as psychological
  distractions like work, family or financial problems, can also affect listening.

The Tongue and Quill


  Semantic barriers may create obstacles: words or phrases with more than one meaning;
  ideas, objects or actions with more than one word image; slang, jargon or organizational
  acronyms. For example, the word “crusade” may have one connotation with an audience in
  Ohio, but have a different connotation when used in a press conference in the Middle East.
3. Look for common ground. Our listening motivation is crippled when we adversely
stereotype speakers or topics. Are you carrying around biases that might be triggered by a
speaker’s age, race, religion, gender, ethnicity or personal appearance? Have you already
decided that this topic is uninteresting, irrelevant or taught at a level that is below you? This
kind of thinking can be lethal to listening motivation.
To break the pattern, ask yourself some more empowering questions. What are the underlying
commonalities and interesting interrelationships between your interests and those of the speaker?
Relate the topic at hand to your own interests. Sometimes this small, simple exercise creates an
interesting challenge and bridges the gaps that exist.
4. Treat listening as a learning opportunity and an intellectual challenge. So, how do you
become motivated to listen to a topic that may, at first glance, seem boring, unrelated or
irrelevant?
If you’re listening to an informational briefing on a topic you’re already an expert on, listen to
improve your ability to teach the topic to someone else. How did the speaker organize the talk?
What terms were defined? What terms were not defined? Did the speaker use interesting
examples that you could “borrow” when you try to explain to someone else?
If you’re listening to a speaker who’s failing miserably, ask yourself how could he or she do
better? Make some notes, and offer tactful but constructive feedback later.
Translate the problem to a personal, intellectual challenge. Effective and active listening is an
exercise in critical thinking and can serve to sharpen your concentration skills. Develop a
“remember game” and make listening a learning activity.
SUMMARY
In our eagerness to make our point or make our mark, we often forget there’s more to the story
than what we know. Listening is a critical communication skill that doesn’t get the attention it
deserves. Misunderstandings and mistakes in communication can be lethal in the military
environment, and listening helps build trust between members of the Air Force team.
In this chapter we have talked about three approaches to listening—informative, critical and
empathic listening. Different situations call for different approaches and the listening skills used
should be tailored to the situation.

E-MAIL AT WORK: KNOW WHEN IT’S AUTHORIZED
Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-119, Official Messaging, provides guidance on what constitutes
official and authorized use of e-mail. Official use includes communications (including
emergency communications) the Air Force determines necessary in the interest of the Federal
Government. This category includes communications by deployed Air Force personnel, if
approved by commanders in interest of morale and welfare.
Authorized e-mail includes personal e-mail approved by the “agency designee,” who is the first
commissioned officer or civilian above GS/GM-11 in the chain of command or supervision of
the employee concerned. AFI 33-119 identifies several common-sense guidelines that should be
considered when approving personal e-mail—it should be of reasonable frequency and duration,
and it should not add significant cost or overburden the computer system and so on.
Commanders and supervisors may authorize any use that is directed by the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ) and Joint Ethics Regulation, and does not interfere with mission
performance.
AFI 33-119 specifically prohibits the following on government communication systems:
•   Distributing copyrighted materials without consent from the copyright owner.
•   Using e-mail for financial gain.
•   Intentionally misrepresenting your identity or affiliation.
•   Sending harassing, intimidating, abusive, or offensive material.
•   Using someone else’s UserID and password without proper authority.
•   Causing congestion on the network by sending inappropriate e-mail messages (propagation
    of chain letters, etc.) or excessive data storage on the e-mail server.
Remember that the network, like the phone, is subject to monitoring. Your e-mail is saved on
backup tapes and servers, and it can be used against you!

                                      ELECTRONIC MAIL
E-MAIL BASICS
Though some communication guidelines are universal (FOCUS principles, the Seven Steps to
Effective Communication, etc.), e-mail is a truly unique medium.
Remember the three e-mail advantages:
       It’s fast.
            It can get to more people.
                It’s paperless.
Remember the three e-mail disadvantages:
       It’s fast … a quickly written e-mail can fan as many fires as it extinguishes.
           It can get to more people … too many copies can clog the network and can be
                       forwarded into the wrong hands.
                  It’s paperless … but it does leave an electronic trail and power
                          fluctuations can make things disappear.
E-mail started off as a very informal communication technique, but today it covers a spectrum
from personal to professional. Personal e-mail often includes language that is a mixture of
shorthand and slang. (Check out page 149 for some examples ☺). It doesn’t necessarily affect
the Air Force (unless you make a very big mistake) and you probably wouldn’t include a
signature block at the end of the message.
Professional or official e-mail is different—it’s more like a business memo. It does affect the
Air Force and the rules you follow should conform to military courtesy. Though professional
e-mail is often less formal (and less carefully reviewed) than most “paper copy” correspondence,
there are some basic guidelines to help keep you on track.

   Get approval before sending to large groups or the
   public. Check local policies for the wickets you must
   jump through before using large mail groups (all base personnel, all users, etc.) or the general
   public. Excessive e-mail sent to large mail groups can waste a great deal of time and
   overload the server. Also, just because the material is attached to an e-mail doesn’t mean
   you can avoid the standard clearance procedures.

ELECTRONIC STAFFING
If properly managed, using e-mail for coordination and staffing can increase efficiency. Use
organizational accounts when sending correspondence to offices for coordination or action. Each
MAJCOM typically issues their own guidance on the details of how electronic staffing should be
implemented, and local commanders may provide additional guidelines that take into account the
local conditions and unit operating procedures. Check out pages 222-223 for the ABCs of staff
packages, then see your local guidance for implementation details.

E-MAIL PROTOCOL
                           “When thou enter a city, abide by its customs.”
                                                             — The Talmud
E-mail protocol or “netiquette” provides guidelines for proper behavior while on-line. There are
many ways to make social blunders and offend people when you are posting. To make matters
worse, there is something about cyberspace that causes a “brain burp” and erases the reality that
we are dealing with live human characters and not some ASCII characters on a screen. Respect

the social culture, and remember that the net is multicultural. Nuances get lost in transmission.
For the newbies floating around out there, cruise through the Netiquette suggestions on the next
few pages. As always, remember some practices are dictated by aspects of the e-mail system
itself (software, gateways, hardware).
RULE #1: BE CLEAR AND CONCISE
   Make the “Subject” line communicate your purpose. Be specific: avoid titles like
   “Status”—call it “OI 36-109 Update Status.” Some audience members keep a lot of
   messages in their inboxes—a clear title will help them find your message later.
   Lead with your most important info. If your goal is to answer a question, then paste the
   question on top for clearer understanding.
   Use topic sentences if the e-mail has multiple paragraphs (see Drafting Effective Paragraphs
   [pages 68-69]).
   Be brief and stick to the point. Follow all the basic rules for drafting clear and concise
   messages (pages 73-88). They’re even more important in e-mail because it’s tougher to read
   from a computer screen. Address the issue, the whole issue, and nothing but the issue … and
   you get extra points if you can get your message in 24 lines (size of one screen on most
   computers).
   Use bold, italics or color to emphasize key sentences. If your e-mail doesn’t allow these, a
   common convention is to use a star on either side of key passages for emphasis … this
   highlights the *key points.*
   Choose readable fonts. Use 12 point or larger font size. Use easy-to-read fonts and save
   the script fonts for your signature.
RULE #2: WATCH YOUR TONE
                  “Life is not so short but that there is not enough time for courtesy.”
                                                                   — Ralph W. Emerson
   Be polite. Treat others as you want to be treated. Use tact. Then use more tact. Then, for
   good measure, use more tact. Think of the message as a personal conversation. If you were
   face to face, would you say the same words and be as abrupt? If not—rewrite the message
   with a more positive tone (see pages 23-24).
   Be careful with humor, irony and sarcasm. Electronic postings are perceived much more
   harshly than they are intended, mainly because you cannot see body language, tone of voice
   and other nonverbals that make up 90 percent of interpersonal communications. Positive
   enthusiasm can be easily mistaken for angry defiance when you use capital letters,
   exclamation points and strong adjectives and adverbs.
   DON’T SHOUT. Do not write in CAPITALS—it’s the e-mail version of shouting and it’s
   considered very rude.
   Keep it clean and professional: E-mail is easily forwarded. Harassing, intimidating,
   abusive, or offensive material is obviously unacceptable, but aim for a higher standard. If
   you wouldn’t want it overheard or posted on the office bulletin board, it probably doesn’t
   belong in an e-mail.

The Tongue and Quill


   Don’t send in haste, repent at leisure. E-mail can get you into trouble—its informality
   encourages impulsive responses (like a conversation), but your words can be printed out and
   forwarded. If you’re really mad about an issue, go ahead and draft an e-mail, but don’t send
   it until you calm down and read it over. Never flame! If you do, be prepared to apologize.

RULE #3 BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT MESSAGES YOU SEND
   Don’t discuss controversial, sensitive, official use only, classified, personal, privacy act or
   unclassified info requiring special handling of documents. You just may one day see
   yourself on CNN or America’s Most Wanted.
   Remember OPSEC (Operational Security). OPSEC is a continuous analytical process which
   involves identifying sensitive information, recognizing that information could be valuable to
   an adversary, and making changes in the way we do things to reduce our risk that the
   information will be compromised. Even unclassified information, when brought together
   with other information, can create problems in the wrong hands.
   Don’t create junk mail, forward it, or put it on a bulletin board.
   Don’t create or send chain letters. They waste time and tie up system.
   Don’t use e-mail for personal ads; put these comments on an appropriate BBS or web page.
   Don’t fire/promote someone by e-mail. Some messages aren’t appropriate.

RULE #4 BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHO GETS THE MESSAGE
   Reply to specific addressees to give those not interested a break.
   Use “reply all” sparingly.
   Get permission before using large mail groups.
   Double-check the address before mailing, especially when selecting from a global list where
   many people have similar last names.

RULE #5 CHECK YOUR ATTACHMENTS AND SUPPORT MATERIAL
   Ensure ALL info is provided the first time to keep from repeating e-mail to “add just another
   fact!” Support Your Ideas (pages 41-53).
   Before sending, check your attachments. (It’s the most common mistake.)
   Cite all quotes, references, and sources. Respect copyright and license agreements.

RULE #6 KEEP YOUR E-MAIL UNDER CONTROL
   Sign off the computer when you leave your workstation—defamers may read your mail or
   send hostile messages under your e-mail address!
   Create mailing lists to save time. REMEMBER: Time is a dime!
   Read and trash files daily. Create an organized directory on your hard drive to keep mailbox
   files at a minimum. Ensure record copies are properly identified and stored in an approved
   filing system.

   Acknowledge important or sensitive messages with a reply to sender: “Thanks,” “done,”
   “I’ll start working it immediately,” etc.
   If you will be away from your e-mail for an extended period, consider setting up an Auto
   Reply message that gives people an alternate point of contact.

PERSONAL E-MAIL
Personal e-mail sometimes contains shorthand and slang that would be unacceptable in a
professional communication. Emoticons (facial expressions) or abbreviations are sometimes
used with humor or satire in an attempt to make sure the audience doesn’t “take things the wrong
way.” They are a resource, but use them sparingly. Some of them are more clever than clear,
and much of your audience may only know the smiling face. (In fact, some software
automatically substitutes the icon “☺” for the emoticon below.)
        :-)—I’m smiling                                        CU—see you (as in see you later)
        :-(—I’m unhappy                                        FWIW—for what it’s worth
        ;^)—satire or sarcasm                                  FYI—for your information

                                                               LOL—laugh out loud (it’s a way to

        <g>—grin                                               REQ—for requests

                       VOICE MAIL AND TELEPHONE SYSTEMS
                            Well, if this is the wrong number … why did you answer it?”
                                                                 — James Thurber
Voice mail, fax, and telephone systems are key to staff communication, so we’ll review some of
the common courtesies associated with using this equipment.
VOICE MAIL & ANSWERING MACHINES
Different systems have different features, so check out your manual for all the bells and whistles.
Here are some basic guidelines.
Do ... record the message in your own voice.
Do ... identify yourself and your organization.
Do ... check your system regularly.
Do ... return all messages as quickly as possible.
Don’t ... leave amusing messages on an official system.
If you will be unavailable for an extended period, consider these suggestions:
Identify whom callers can contact in your absence.
Set up your voice mail to answer after the first ring.
A sample message: “This is SSgt_____. If you need some immediate information on ____, call
     555-7084.”
TELEPHONE PROTOCOL
Telephone protocol is something most of us take for granted, but here are a few tips for people
new to the workplace.
If you’re answering the phone…
Do ... answer the phone on the first ring and in the way you would like to be called after
       identifying the organization.
Do ... be pleasant and professional—you are representing your organization, as well as yourself,
       when you answer the phone.
Do ... introduce everyone in the room if you are on a speakerphone—callers may object to the
        lack of privacy.
Do ... put the radio and TV on hold until you’re off.
Do ... speak clearly, keeping your lips about 1 inch from the mouthpiece. Good posture (or
       standing while speaking) will also improve your vocal quality.
Do ... have a pencil, a memo pad, and your directories within easy reach.
Do ... adjust your speaking tempo to match the other person’s to establish instant rapport.
Do ... ask if someone else can help if the person isn’t there.
Do ... take a number and call back instead of putting them on hold if you are finding something.


                                              – 150 –
                                                                             Electronic Communication

Do ... give the caller the phone number before you transfer the call.
Do ... allow the person initiating the call to bring it to a close.
Do ... record important conversations, especially those that result in a decision, in a memo for
       record and place it in a file.
Don’t ... transfer an angry caller. Listen carefully, never interrupt and ask questions that require
          more than a “yes” or “no.” Also, make notes and let the caller know since this shows
          you’re interested and are willing to help.
Don’t ... put the phone over your chest to put someone on hold—your voice goes over the wires
          loud and clear—use the “hold” button.
If you’re making the call…
Do ... have your act together. Organize your thoughts and make notes before you place a call—
       especially if you’re representing your organization, seeking help or information, calling
       long distance or talking to someone more senior in rank.
Do ... call during core hours (0900-1100 and 1300-1500) to reduce phone tag. What’s their time
       zone? When will they return?
Do ... identify yourself and your organization before asking to speak to _____.
Do ... be pleasant and professional.
Do ... ask if the person has time to talk if you plan a lengthy conversation. But you need to keep
       it as brief as possible!
Do ... record important conversations in a memo for record and place it in a file.
Don’t ... put the phone over your chest to put someone on hold—your voice goes over the wires
          loud and clear—use the “hold” button.
REACH OUT & FAX SOMEONE
As e-mail capabilities grow, faxes are becoming less common. If you fax documents regularly,
remember the following:
Do ... make it readable by using pica type (10 characters per inch): Times New Roman,
       Courier New, Century Schoolbook, etc. and number your pages.
Do ... protect your document by ensuring correct receiver information is entered.
Do ... use black and white.
Do ... use a fax when you cannot get someone to return your call, including a short explanation,
       deadline to return call and a “Thanks for your time.”
Do ... use Post-It® stickies to save those trees!
Do ... send a return cover sheet with complete return address to encourage a quick reply.
Don’t ... send a legal-sized document unless you know it can be received or personal,
          confidential, or financial info unless you know it will be protected.
Don’t ... use italic type. It looks ragged and makes it difficult to read.

... A SMALL GLOSSARY OF ELECTRONIC AND COMPUTER TALK
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)—Pronounced “asky.” The
most common international standard for representing alphanumeric text on a computer.
bandwidth—The number of bits that can be passed along a communications channel in a given
period of time. Usually expressed as bits per second (bps). Each military installation has a
limited amount of bandwidth—don’t waste it with frivolous e-mail.
bulletin-board system (BBS)—An electronic system allowing individuals with similar interests
to post and view messages in a public electronic form.
binary file—A digital file format used to store non-text data. The information stored includes
executable programs, sounds, images and videos.
binary digit (bit)—The smallest unit of storage in a digital computer. All programs and data in a
digital computer are composed of bits.
browser—A software program that allows users to interact with World Wide Web sites.
Example includes Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Opera.
client—A computer or program that can download, run or request services from a server.
compact disc (CD, CD-ROM, CD-RW): A disk that stores digital information using a pattern
of microscopic pits and lands to represent ones and zeros. One CD-ROM holds from 650 to 700
megabytes of data or the equivalent of approximately 250,000 pages of text.
data compression—A procedure used to reduce the size of a file to reduce the disk space
required to store the file or the bandwidth required to transmit the file. Many different
compression formats are available and each requires a program to compress and expand the
file—zip format is one of the most common.
digital video disk (DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW)—A disk that stores digital information using a
pattern of pits and lands to represent ones and zeros. A specially formatted DVD is used to store
movies. One DVD-ROM holds approximately 4.7 gigabytes of information or the equivalent of
approximately 1.8 million pages of text.
Electronic mail (E-mail)—A message sent electronically over a computer network, such as a
LAN or the Internet.
emoticon—Facial expressions originally drawn using ASCII characters and more recently drawn
using an extended character set. (See page 149 for examples).
encryption—Changing the contents of a message in a manner to obscure the contents while still
allowing the intended audience to read the message.
executable—A file containing a set of instructions to perform some process on a computer. A
word processor and Internet browser are examples of an executable.
facsimile (fax)—A method of transmitting images of printed matter that predates digital
computer networks. This method traditionally used phone lines but can now be implemented
using computer networks.
flame mail—An e-mail message critical of some person or position taken by a person. Usually
more derogatory than constructive.

of information based on a dynamic index.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)—The native language of the WWW.
Instant Messaging (IM)—A type of communications service that enables you to create a kind
of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the
Internet, analogous to a telephone conversation but using text-based, not voice-based,
communication. Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you whenever somebody on your
private list is online. You can then initiate a chat session with that particular individual.
Internet—The overarching global computer network connecting computers, servers and local
area networks across the globe.
intranet—A network with restricted availability. An intranet may provide web pages, printing
and e-mail services similar to those available using the Internet, but only for a restricted set of

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)—A communications program that allows real-time text-based
conversations along multiple users.
list server—A computer running an electronic mailing list subscribed to by individuals with
some common area of interest. Individuals typically subscribe by sending an e-mail asking to be
placed on the list. Once added to the list, subscribers automatically receive messages sent to the
list by other subscribers and may send their own messages to the list which are then relayed to all
other subscribers.
local area network (LAN)—A system occupying a relatively small geographic area providing
digital communications between automated data processing equipment, such as computers and
printers.
modem—A device allowing a computer to send and receive data over telephone lines.
netiquette—Commonly accepted etiquette used when communicating over a computer
network—network etiquette. Specific forms of communications might include e-mail, list server
or IRC.
newbie—An individual new to using computers or new to a specific group.

                                                                MEETINGS




 This chapter covers:
     •   Meeting planning—how to prepare for success.
     •   Meeting agendas and execution.
     •   Preparing the meeting minutes.
     •   Tips on group dynamics and making meetings fun.


All of us attend meetings. Some of us feel we attend too many of them. Others may be
conducting more business electronically, and attending fewer meetings than in the past. But, in
today’s world of trying to do things “faster and smarter,” technology is not always all it’s
cracked up to be. How many times have you e-mailed someone who works 20 feet or one office
away? Have you ever spent 20 minutes to write an e-mail to four people to discuss a topic that
would take 2 minutes of a meeting? Despite the surge in electronic staffing there is no substitute
for the human element found in meetings; thus it is unlikely they will ever be replaced.
So why does the mere word “meeting” strike a nerve in so many of us? Probably we’ve all
attended so many that were a huge waste of time. But meetings don’t have to be that way; there
are ways to make them better! If they are done right, they can go a long way in helping your
organization run more efficiently. Simply put, they’re used to share information, solve
problems, plan, brainstorm or motivate. Whatever the purpose, it’s good to know some basics
about conducting an effective meeting. That’s what this chapter is all about.

                          RUNNING AN EFFECTIVE MEETING
At some time or another, you may be the one calling the meeting. A meeting doesn’t always
have to be a major production, but there are some key points to consider during planning,
execution and follow-up. Here are some tips on making the most of everyone’s time—including
your own!

PLANNING YOUR MEETING
Success or failure in a meeting can usually be traced to the planning phase. Do your homework,
and you’re well on your way to success. If you don’t do your homework, you’ll pay a heavy
price during the execution and follow-up phases.
Listed below are the key issues associated with planning a meeting. As you step through these
items, remember to check on what is standard operating procedure in your organization.
Meetings come in all flavors—from totally spontaneous to highly structured and ceremonial.
Most are in the middle. If this group has been meeting regularly for a while, try to find out how
they’ve done business in the past.

1. DECIDE IF A MEETING IS APPROPRIATE
In the book How to Make Meetings Work, Michael Doyle and David Strauss identify seven
situations when having meeting might be a good idea:
•   You want information or advice from the group.
•   You want to involve a group in solving a problem or making a decision.
•   An issue needs to be clarified.
•   You want to address concerns with the entire group.
•   The group itself wants a meeting.
•   There is a problem that involves people from different groups.
•   There is a problem, but it’s not clear what it is or who is responsible for dealing with it.
In these situations, face-to-face discussion can help speed up the process. If your goal is just to
pass on information, ask yourself if e-mail is a viable and appropriate substitute for the meeting.
The purpose of many meetings is simply to share information and keep people up to date on a
project. In these cases, try to substitute the meeting with an
e-mail. This saves everyone’s time and still keeps everyone in the loop, and you’re still meeting
the goal for the meeting you just avoided!
Local policy may dictate that some groups meet weekly, monthly, or quarterly, but if you’re not
directed to meet and don’t need to … don’t!

                                                                                             Meeting


2. DEFINE YOUR PURPOSE
Every meeting should have a purpose. If it doesn’t, you shouldn’t meet. When you think about
your purpose, try to define it in terms of a product that you want at the end of the meeting, and
what it will be used for. “Talking about Issue X” is not an ideal purpose statement for the
meeting, because it describes a process, not a product—try these alternatives:
•   To identify why Issue X is a problem. [The product is a clearer understanding of the
    problem.]
•   To brainstorm ways to resolve Issue X. [The product is a list of ideas about potential
    solutions.]
•   To discuss different options for resolving Issue X. [The product is list of pros and cons …
    the decision will happen later.]
•   To decide how the unit will handle Issue X. [The product is discussion of pros and cons and
    a decision. Make sure attendees know who makes the decision. Is it the team, or is it the
    boss?]
Most Air Force professionals want to feel like they’ve accomplished something in a meeting. A
clear purpose for the meeting is the first step towards success.

3. DECIDE WHO SHOULD BE INVITED
Have you gone to a meeting and after 5 or 10 minutes asked yourself, “Why am I here?”
Remember that when you are holding a meeting! Invite only those directly involved in the issues
being discussed. Meetings can be a time waster if too many or too few participants attend. Too
many people equals chaos; too few means decisions have to be put on hold—bad news.
If you’re trying to solve a problem or make a decision on a controversial issue, make sure you
have adequate representation from all groups who have a voice in the decision. If you only
invite people with one point of view, your meeting will run smoothly, but your decision may not
stand up later.

4. DECIDE WHERE AND WHEN THE MEETING SHOULD OCCUR
Check the schedules of any heavy hitters. Often the scheduling of your meetings will be
determined by the schedule of any key personnel that will be attending. If you’re briefing a
three-star, odds are that his secretary will be telling you when the meeting can occur, not the
other way around.
If possible, pick the time of day to meet your purpose. If you’ve got flexibility, you might
select the time of day for your meeting to help you meet your objectives. If you want your
meeting attendees fired up and eager to contribute, you may want to schedule a meeting in the
morning, the time when most people have more energy. If you want them inpatient and anxious
to get done, try just before lunch. If you want them agreeable, try right after lunch. If you want
them asleep, try midafternoon. Finally, you might try the just-before-quitting time tactic. If
you’re lucky, you might have any opposition collapse just so they can catch the car pool.



                                             – 157 –

Try to avoid meetings the first thing Monday morning. Give folks some time to read
e-mail and prioritize the days and week ahead. If your organization is a service organization,
don’t schedule meetings during customer service hours. The “Closed for Training” sign on the
door does not fare well in the customer satisfaction department!
Keep it under an hour, or plan for breaks. Keep in mind that after 20 minutes or so, our
minds tend to get lazy and wander. Try to keep the flow of the meeting going so that no agenda
item goes longer than 20 minutes. Watch the clock (a timekeeper comes in handy). Try to keep
the meeting to 90 minutes or less, and plan for breaks if the meeting goes over an hour.
Reserve the room. Follow established procedures to reserve a conference room that can handle
the attendee list.

5. PLAN FOR CAPTURING MEETING INFORMATION
If this is not a routine meeting with an appointed recorder, take a moment to think about how you
will capture the meeting information, both in the meeting itself and afterwards. Capturing the
information is critical, but how best to do it will depend on the nature of the meeting.
Think about how you’re going to capture information during the meeting. Will you use a white
board? (If so, make sure your conference room has one … or try to borrow a portable
whiteboard that can print out what is written on them.) Will you capture brainstorming efforts
using flip charts and “butcher paper”—oversized paper that can be taped up on a wall and looked
at by a group? Do you have an administrative support person that can act as a recorder? Can
you ask a coworker to take notes?
Meeting minutes capture the process and outcome of the meeting. They “close the loop” on the
meeting, and let the attendees know what was decided. If you have administrative personnel that
can prepare minutes, consider having them attend the meeting to act as the recorder. On the
other hand, drafting the minutes yourself has one clear advantage: you can make sure they
include what they should.




              Explaining the objectives, reviewing the agenda, going over the ground
              rules and making sure everyone knows each other and understands why
              they’re in attendance.

7. REMEMBER: MEETINGS CAN BE CANCELLED
Before you take 5, 10 or 20 people away from productive work time ask yourself these
questions:
•   Is there a real need for this meeting? You might receive feedback from your agenda that
    indicates that the business can be accomplished by other means. Consider sending an e-mail
    or a memo to disseminate information.
•   Will key decisionmakers (if a decision is the goal) and/or the majority of the group be
    present? If key decision makers can’t be there, why bother? If the key decision makers are
    the entire group, make sure the majority can attend. Otherwise you spend precious time
    updating those who missed the meeting before you can come to consensus on the issue. It’s
    better to put the meeting on hold.

UNDERSTAND GROUP DYNAMICS AND LOOK FOR WAYS TO MAKE MEETINGS FUN
If you’re in charge of a group that will be meeting over a period of time, it pays to learn the
basics about group dynamics. Also, if you dare, you might want to try to inject some fun into
your meetings. (As always—know your audience. Some believe meetings should be miserable
… anything else is unnatural!) We’ll talk more about both these topics at the end of the chapter.
FOLLOWING UP: PREPARING MEETING MINUTES
If you did your homework, following up is a snap—it involves sending out meeting minutes and
starting the whole cycle over again. Prepare meeting minutes in the official memo format.
Minutes are a clear summary of the participants’ comments. They document planned or
completed action. Date the minutes the day they are distributed. You may list names of
members present in two columns to save space.
Place information regarding a future meeting in the last paragraph. When a person signs a paper
as a member of a board or committee, the signature element indicates that person’s status on that
board or committee, not any other position the person may hold. Type “Approved as written”
two lines below the recorder’s signature block, followed by the approving authority’s signature
block.
Minutes are typed either single or double-spaced, with additional space between items of
business and paragraphs.
No erasures should appear in the minutes. All typing should be neat and orderly, paying
particular attention to uniformity of margins and text.
All names should be spelled correctly; acceptable grammar should be used; sentences should be
well constructed and correctly punctuated. All verbs should be in past tense.
The order of the minutes usually coincides with the order of the agenda, and the following items
are generally included:
   •   Kind of meeting (regular, special, etc.)
   •   Day, date, time and place of meeting
   •   The word “Minutes” in the heading
   •   Name of the meeting body
   •   Opening paragraph; i.e., The Executive Committee met for _____ meeting on day, date
       and time
   •   Members present
   •   Members absent
   •   Action taken on last meeting’s minutes
   •   Reports
   •   Current business, with complete discussions and conclusions
   •   Old Business, with discussions, and follow-up, as recommended
   •   New Business, with discussions and recommendations
   •   Adjournment

MEETINGS AND GROUP DYNAMICS
All meetings, teams or groups move through predictable stages. You will save yourself a lot of
frustration if you are familiar with these stages. Let’s look at a snapshot of these stages first and
then discuss them in more detail.
FORMING:               a period of uncertainty in which members try to determine their place in
                       the team and the procedures and rules of the team.
STORMING:              conflicts begin to arise as members resist the influence of the team and
                       rebel against accomplishing the task.
NORMING:               the team establishes cohesiveness and commitment, discovering new ways
                       to work together and setting norms for appropriate behavior.
PERFORMING:            the team develops proficiency in achieving its goals and becomes more
                       flexible in its patterns of working together.
Because the forming, storming and norming stages result in minimal output, it is tempting to try
to rush through or short circuit these stages and hope the team can thereby achieve peak
productivity. You may want to stand up and say, “Can’t we just all be friends?” Although
seductive, this idea is dysfunctional. Just as individuals go through predictable stages of growth
(depending on age, experience, maturity and other factors), teams go through predictable stages.
The duration of these stages depends on factors such as individual and team maturity, task
complexity, leadership, organizational climate and external climate. Teams can fixate at various
stages. Some teams (like some people) are never fully functioning. How can you reduce the
nonproductive time commonly spent in the forming and storming stages? Given that these stages
are inevitable, try sharing rumors, concerns and expectations of the team to minimize their
tensions, fears or anxiety. Also, encourage the team members to contact one another so that
there will be no “surprises.” Therefore, an atmosphere of trust will be achieved early on
(norming stage), allowing for interpersonal issues to be put aside in favor of task issues and for
the team to move on to the performing stage.
Read on for more detailed descriptions of these stages from The Team Handbook written by
Peter R. Scholtes.
FORMING. When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable
group behavior. This is a stage of transition from individual to member status, and of testing the
leader’s guidance both formally and informally. Because there is so much going on to distract
the members’ attention in the beginning, the team accomplishes little, if anything, that concerns
its project goals. Don’t despair and flush your project down the toilet! This is perfectly normal!
STORMING. Storming is probably the most difficult stage for the team. You may ask yourself,
“What was I thinking?” The team members begin to realize the task is different and more
difficult than they imagined, becoming testy, blameful, or overzealous. Impatient about the lack
of progress, but still too inexperienced to know much about decision making or the scientific
approach, members argue about just what actions the team should take. They try to rely solely
on their personal and professional experience, resisting any need for collaborating with other
team members. Their behavior means team members have little energy to spend on progressing
towards the team’s goal. Still, they are beginning to understand one another.



                                              – 162 –
                                                                                           Meeting


NORMING. During this stage, members reconcile competing loyalties and responsibilities.
They accept the team, team ground rules (or “norms”), their roles in the team, and the
individuality of fellow members. Emotional conflict is reduced as previously competitive
relationships become more cooperative. As team members begin to work out their differences,
they now have more time and energy to spend on the project. Thus, they are able to at last start
making significant strides.
PERFORMING. By this stage, the team has settled its relationships and expectations. They
can begin performing—diagnosing and solving problems, and choosing and implementing
changes. At last team members have discovered and accepted each other’s strengths and
weaknesses, and learned what their roles are. The team is now an effective, cohesive unit. You
can tell when your team has reached this stage because you start getting a lot of work done—
finally!

MEETINGS: CAN THEY BE FUN?
Have you ever wondered why pagers miraculously go off during meetings or “scheduling
conflicts” come up at the last minute? It’s because many people avoid meetings like the plague.
Let’s face it … they’re boring! Does that mean you should hold meetings like a standup
comedian? No! In fact, you need to really know your audience before you go out on this limb.
But you can interject some fun into meetings to encourage participation and creativity. Here are
just a few ideas to get you going.
   •   Hold your meeting off-site. We military types are creatures of habit. This does not
       change at meetings. Everyone usually sits in the same seat, brings the same coffee mug,
       brings up the same questions and takes breaks at the same time … you get the picture.
       Sometimes a change of scenery is all that is needed to rejuvenate a brain-dead group.
       Bonus: Change the meeting time to coincide with lunch. This gives the group a chance
       to talk about “non-meeting issues” and connect in a more nonthreatening environment
       over a meal.
   •   Have a contest to generate ideas for projects. A little friendly competition can be a boost
       for all and bring great results.
   •   Tone down the conversation dominators with “fees.” Attendees are required to pay each
       time they interject, and they are limited to inputs. Be careful with this one … you don’t
       want to shut folks down either.
   •   Appoint a “Director of Creativity” for each meeting to come up with ideas like these!
       Appoint the next meeting’s director at the conclusion of the current meeting to give them
       time to plan. Have the group vote on the favorite idea at the end of the year and give out
       a humorous award.

SUMMARY
Although many of us don’t really look forward to meetings they are indeed a fact of life in
today’s Air Force and they certainly serve a purpose in our mission and how we get things done
on a daily basis. This chapter gave you the nuts and bolts for holding more successful and
productive meetings. Remember the “Seven Steps for Effective Communication” and the tips
introduced in this chapter as you think about and prepare your next meeting. And as always, pay
attention to the local guidelines for conducting meetings in your organization. Good luck!




              Never invite people who don’t need to be there. Never meet without an
              agenda. Never start late. Don’t get off the subject. Don’t tolerate
              excessive interruptions.

THE QUILL

        This section expands upon the functions and
        formats for written communications with the
        US Air Force as outlined in Air Force Manual
        (AFMAN) 33-326, Preparing Official
        Communications. We’ve included the most
        frequently used formats, which are only a
        fraction of the total used throughout the
        Department of Defense. Although functions
        and formats may differ somewhat among
        major commands, the information that follows
        should be useful at any command or staff
        level.    However, if your organization
        publishes a supplement to AFMAN 33-326,
        an OI (operating instruction), or its own
        administrative style guide, be sure to check
        those sources for command-unique guidance
        on preparing staff work.

WHEN YOU WRITE FOR “THE BOSS”
There may be a time when you will be tasked to prepare a staff instrument for a general officer’s
signature. Is there an added dimension when we write for a general officer? From discussions
with numerous generals and their executive officers, the answer is “yes.” These are facts and
hints to help you through this added dimension!
 First ... see if the boss has preferences! Run to see the general’s secretary! It will ease
   your pain. For instance, when one particular general writes personal letters to higher ranking
   individuals, he uses “Respectfully” as the salutation, and for lower ranking individuals,
   “Sincerely.” Use “Sincerely” on all personal memos. Now having said that … it’s up to
   your commander’s preference. Some generals write “Very Respectfully” above “Sincerely”
   when addressing higher ranking officers.
 Read step one of the seven-step checklist. Learn all you can about the general’s views on
   the subject and the relationship with the addressee. Try to capture the general’s wider
   perspective before you pick up your pen. What peripheral issues facing the general could be
   directly or indirectly affected by your words? What is the desired purpose? What tone
   (pages 23-24), pattern (pages 59-62) and correspondence style (pages 167-169) are most
   appropriate?
 Keep it simple or face frustration. A general’s time is spread over many issues. Get to the
   point, make it, and move on. If the addressee needs only the time, don’t send instructions on
   how to build a clock. Your first draft will probably be twice as long as needed. If you must
   include details, use attachments.
 Go easy on the modifiers. A general doesn’t need to be very interested in something—
   being interested is sufficient. Also, avoid emotionalism.
 Quality check, quality check, quality check! From your logic to your grammar, from your
   facts and figures to your format, triple check your work. You have nothing to lose but your
   credibility! HINT: Ensure you use the current address since military members move around
   so often.
 Go one step further. Look efficient when doing a personal letter and provide the general
   with the “go-by name” of the addressee. Try using a yellow sticky!
 Don’t expect your glistening product to fly the first time. Not even the best staffers are
   clairvoyant.
Why should we write differently for general officers? Why should that added dimension apply
only to the boss? There’s no good reason. We’d become better communicators if we assume all
of our correspondence were “starbound.”

        lines below the date. Font size should be Times New Roman 12 point. The date is placed 10 lines from the
        top of the page on the right side. The salutation is normally in the format “Dear Xxxxx” and complimentary
        close is normally “Sincerely.” Begin the salutation one line space under the receiver’s address. Type the
        complimentary close element “Sincerely” one line space below the text of the letter three spaces to the right of
        page center. Notice that you do not use punctuation after either. The signature element begins five line spaces
        below and aligned with the complimentary close element. Place your list of attachments one line below the
        signature element and flush with the left margin.¶

             Personal letters are really official memos prepared in a personal style. They are appropriate for welcome
        letters, letters of appreciation, letters of condolence, or any other occasion when a situation might be
        better handled in a personal manner. Attachments, if any, are listed the same way as in an official
        memorandum.¶

FORMS OF ADDRESS, SALUTATION, AND CLOSE
In the Office of the Secretary of Defense Manual for Written Material there are some general,
convenient forms of address for both letters and envelopes. We think these are important enough
to include here. Using titles correctly in the salutation of a letter makes a good impression. We
suggest a word of caution … avoid the use of gender distinctive titles. This can be generally
done by rewriting or varying the layout.
To summarize some of the key rules to follow when addressing a letter to an individual by name
or title, we have provided these points:
•   Do not use punctuation with the address element. Do not use punctuation after the last word
    of salutation and complimentary close.
•   Spell out all titles of address (except Dr., Mr. and Mrs.), always using only one title.
    (Dr. James Norrix or James Norrix, MD; not Dr. James Norrix, MD).
•   Address correspondence by professional or organizational title when the name or the gender,
    or both are not known. (Dear Resource Manager, Dear Department Head, etc.).
•   Use Ms. with the surname or first and last name when a woman’s marital status is unknown.
    Using the title “Ms.” is okay as a general rule, unless the person prefers Miss or Mrs. (Ms.
    Shroyer or Maxine Shroyer). In business use a married woman’s first name (Mrs. Lee
    Reising); socially, the custom has been to use her husband’s first name (Mrs. Stephen
    Reising).
•   Respond to a letter written jointly by more than three people by preparing single replies, or
    replying to the person signing and mentioning the others early in the letter.
•   Address all Presidential appointees and federal and state elected officials as “The
    Honorable,” even when addressing social correspondence. As a general rule, do not address
    county and city officials, except mayors, as “The Honorable.”
•   Use “Judge,” “General,” “The Honorable,” etc., if appropriate. People, once entitled, may
    keep the title throughout their lifetime. Some dignitaries holding doctoral degrees may
    prefer the use of “Dr.”
•   Use two lines for a couple with different last names with the man’s name on the bottom.
•   Use Miss, Mrs. or Ms. with a woman’s surname, but Madam with formal or position titles.
    (Dear Mrs. Carolyn Brown, but Dear Madam Justice or Dear Madam Secretary)

MEMORANDUM FOR CATEGORY 1

FROM: AU/CV
      55 LeMay
      Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6335

SUBJECT: Responsible Use of Electronic Communications (S/S Memo, 10 Nov 04)

1. Access to the Internet provides each person at Air University information sources that rival any
library. From the comfort of your desk, in about the time it takes you to pour that second cup of
coffee, your computer can connect you with other computers halfway around the world. You can
view volumes of text and images, all neatly organized for your convenience. If used correctly, the
Internet can be an incredibly powerful tool. However, this new capability must be used responsibly.
The computer and communications lines you use to connect the Internet are government resources.
Similarly, the information you review or transfer while at work becomes property of the Air Force,
and must serve the purpose of helping you to do your job. You would not consider using the phone
on your desk for inappropriate and unofficial calls; that same logic applies to your computer and
accessing Internet. Remember it is an abuse of government resources to use government equipment
or duty time to conduct unofficial business.

2. Electronic mail provides an immediate and convenient means of communication. A single
message can be programmed to send to any number of persons, at any time of the day. Before we hit
that “Send” button, we should consider where our intended messages may end up. The negative
repercussion of unintentional distribution was illustrated recently when a pilot involved in the rescue
of Captain Scott O’Grady in Bosnia sent a full and graphic account of the rescue mission to a
number of his friends. These friends forwarded the message to others, and soon the entire text of the
message—including misclassified information—found its way to an electronic bulletin board,
available for anyone to access. This story shows a lack of discretion on the part of the original
writer, who didn’t consider the sensitive nature of his message or the potential scope of his audience.
We should learn from his mistakes.

3. Another important point with regard to e-mail, especially when you communicate with outside
agencies, is that these messages are official correspondence. They reflect your professionalism and
present an image of Air University. Let’s make certain that image is a positive one.

         consisting of two or three lines: Department of the Air Force, etc., and the organization (Headquarters Air




                                                                                                                               2-inch top margin and 1-inch bottom margin
         Combat Command, Headquarters United States Air Force, etc.), and the location with the ZIP code (optional).
         Printed letterhead stationery for wing level is normally used if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost.
         Any unit without its own letterhead may use its parent unit’s and identify its organization and office symbol
         in the FROM caption. Be sure to include the 9-digit ZIP code with the full address in the FROM caption.¶
         ¶
         2. The style of writing is yours. For some helpful guidelines see pages 17-24. However, when writing for
         someone else’s signature, try to write as though that person were speaking. Be succinct, use active voice and keep
         it short (one page, if possible, see Atch 1). Include extensive background material as an attachment rather than
         within the memorandum itself (see Atch 2).¶
         ¶
         3. Even though most signers want their signatures on a perfect product, minor errors may be neatly corrected in
         ink.¶
         ¶
         4. If you want a response directed to a project officer rather than the signer, include that person’s name and rank
         (if applicable), office symbol, telephone number and e-mail in the body of the memo.¶

      As director of communications, I was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our
      company’s training programs and materials. In the body of the memo, one of the
      sentences I mentioned the “pedagogical approach” used by one of the training
      manuals. The day after I routed the memo to the executive committee, I was called
      into the HR director’s office, and told that the executive vice president wanted me
      out of the building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told that she couldn’t stand
      for “perverts” (pedophilia?) working in her company. Finally, he showed me her
      copy of the memo, with her demand that I be fired, and the word “pedagogical”
      circled in red. The HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word
      up in his dictionary and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he told me
      not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later, a memo to the entire staff
      came out, directing us that no words, which could not be found in the local Sunday
      newspaper, could be used in company memos. A month later, I resigned. In
      accordance with company policy, I created my resignation memo by pasting words
      together from the Sunday paper.

      SUBJECT: IN TURN Memo Format¶
      ¶
      1. The IN TURN memo is an official memo addressed to two or more individuals or offices.
      It’s primarily used when you want the final addressee to see the coordination or action of
      the other addressees as the memo moves along the chain.¶




                                                                                                                         2-inch top margin and 1-inch bottom margin
      ¶
      2. The above address element shows the proper way to address an IN TURN memo within an
      organization. Here’s how to address it to several different organizations.¶

      ¶
      3. When you receive an IN TURN memo strike through your office symbol, put your initials and
      the date next to your office symbol (shown below) and send the memo on to the next addressee.
      When you have comments, write a note next to your office symbol and either attach your
      comments to the package or send a separate letter directly to the final addressee.¶

SUBJECT: Request for The Tongue and Quill

1. I work for the Air Force, slinging ink at paper, pounding a computer, giving
briefings, pushing packages and opening my mouth quite frequently in the conduct of
today’s mission. I need a personal copy of The Tongue and Quill.

2. This copy would help tremendously to improve my communications techniques and
those of the people who work for me. My personal opinion is that everyone who works
in the Air Force, civilian or military, should have a personal copy of The Tongue and
Quill.

Memorandum for Mr. Phillips
Here’s your T&Q~check the
“Communication Basics” section.
I couldn’t agree with you more,
everyone should have their own copy!

       T&Q OPR¶                                 generates an explosive blast of paperwork. (Rather

                                          FOR RECORD




The separate-page memorandum for record (commonly referred to as memo for
record, MR or MFR) is used as an in-house document. It records info that is generally
not recorded in writing (e.g., a phone call or meeting results) and informally passes it to
others. People working together everyday generally pass info back and forth verbally,
but sometimes it needs to be recorded and filed—memo for record is perfect. A “MEMO
FOR RECORD” line can be added to target a specific addressee.
The explanatory memo for record gives you a quick synopsis of the purpose of the
memo, tells who got involved and provides additional background info not included in
the basic memo. By reading both the basic memo and the memo for record, readers
should understand enough about the subject to coordinate or sign the memo without
having to call or ask for more info.
If the basic memo really does say it all, an explanatory memo for record may not be
needed. However, some organizations require you to acknowledge it by including “MR:
Self-explanatory.”

           SUBJECT: Preparing a Separate-Page Memorandum for Record (MR)

           1. Use a separate-page MR to fulfill the functions discussed on the preceding page.

           2. Type or write the MR on a sheet of paper in this format. Use 1-inch margins all
           around and number the paragraphs if there is more than one. A full signature block
           is not necessary, but the MR should be signed.

           MEMO FOR RECORD                                                        2 Jan 04

           Omit the subject when typing the explanatory MR on the record copy. If space
           permits, type the MR and date two lines below the signature block. When there
           isn’t, type “MR ATTACHED” or “MR ON REVERSE” and put the MR on a
           separate sheet or on the back of the record copy if it can be read clearly.
           Number the paragraphs when there is more than one. No signature block is
           required; merely sign your last name after the last word of the MR.




   MR: When you have a very brief MR and not much space on the bottom of your correspondence, use
   this tighter format. Sign your last name and put the date following the last word.

        SUBJECT: The Trip Report Format

        1. PURPOSE: Briefly state the reason for your trip. The report should answer the questions
        who, what, when, where, why, and how much, and then provide recommendations and
        conclusions. Attach meeting minutes or any other background documents that provide
        more detailed information, if needed. The format for the report is not particularly important.
        The official memorandum shown here is a good example; however, if another format better
        suits your needs or your organization has a preferred format, use it.

        2. TRAVELER(S): Include rank, first name or initial, and surname. Provide position titles if
        travelers are from different offices or organizations. You may list names of members present
        in two columns to save space.

        3. ITINERARY: List location(s) visited, inclusive dates, and key personnel contacted.

        4. DISCUSSION: Base the amount of detailed information you include here on the knowledge
        level of your intended readers. Always include the trip objective, problems encountered, findings,
        future commitments made and your contribution to the event.

        5. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Summarize your findings and/or recommended
        actions.

                                                            REPORT




The staff study report is used to analyze a clearly defined problem, identify conclusions and
make recommendations. Not all organizations routinely use it, but it is an accepted format for a
problem-solution report in both Air Force and Joint Staffs. (It’s one of several staff formats
identified in JFSC Pub 1—The Joint Staff Officer’s Guide.)
This section provides information on how to analyze a staff problem (“Actions Before Writing
Your Report”) and guidance on writing a formal staff study (“Writing Your Report”). You may
never write up a problem-solution in the staff study format. However, if you understand and
apply the essential elements of problem analysis, you’ll be better prepared for any staff
communication. The staff study, as a thought process, is far more important than what you call it
or what precise format you use to communicate your problem-solution explanation—letters,
estimates of the situation, operational plans and orders, or the staff study report itself.



              “Since the purpose of a staff is to assist the commander in the exercise
              of command, the work of the staff revolves around the solution of
              problems...
              The staff study is one of the more flexible problem-solving procedures
              available to a staff.”
                                                                     — JFSC Pub 1

ACTIONS BEFORE WRITING YOUR REPORT
Before you can report on a problem, you must mentally solve it. Here’s a logical sequence of
essential elements:
1. ANALYZE THE AUDIENCE. You usually solve problems dropped on you by the hierarchy.
Sometimes you generate your own areas or subjects that call for analysis. In any case, there will
be political and operational constraints that affect your problem-solving process. Do some
reflective thinking about the “environment” in which you’re operating.
2. LIMIT THE PROBLEM. Restrict it to manageable size by fixing the who, what, when, why and
how of the situation. Eliminate unnecessary concerns. Narrow the problem statement to exactly
what you will be discussing—a common error is a fuzzy or inaccurate problem statement. For
example, if the problem is the use of amphetamines and barbiturates among junior airmen, the
problem statement “To reduce the crime rate on base” would be too broad. So would “How to
detect and limit the use of dangerous drugs on base.” More to the point would be “To detect and
end the causes of amphetamine and barbiturate use among the junior Airmen at Wright-
Patterson.”
The problem should eventually be stated in one of three ways:
  As a question:
      What should we do to detect and end the causes of amphetamine and barbiturate use
      among junior airmen on this base?
  As a statement of need or purpose:
      This base needs to develop ways to detect and end the …
  As an infinitive phrase:
      To detect and end the causes …
3. ANALYZE THE WHOLE PROBLEM. Do the parts suggest other problems that need separate
handling? Or do the parts relate so closely to the whole situation you need only one approach?
4. GATHER DATA. Collect all information pertinent to the problem. (Tips on how and where to
conduct staff research can be found on Chapter 4).
5. EVALUATE YOUR INFORMATION. Is the information from reliable witnesses? Is it from
qualified authorities? Does it qualify as solid support?




       “Education should be as gradual as the moonrise, perceptual not in progress but
       in result.”
                                                          — George John Whyte-Melville

                                                                                   Staff Study Report

6. ORGANIZE YOUR INFORMATION. One way to organize information is to place it under
headings titled “Facts,” “Assumptions” and “Criteria.”
•   Facts should be just that, not opinions or assertions. Identify only those facts that directly
    bear on the problem.
•   Assumptions are important because they are always necessary. To reduce a research project
    to manageable size, it is usually necessary to accept certain things as being true, even if you
    are not absolutely sure. The validity of your assumptions usually has a great deal to do with
    the validity of your conclusions. Sometimes desired conclusions can be supported with
    certain unrealistic assumptions. In evaluating research, seek out the assumptions and make
    some judgment as to how reasonable they are. If you feel they are unrealistic, make
    whatever assumptions you feel are correct and try to judge their effect on the conclusions of
    the study. Sometimes a perfectly logical study explodes in your face because your
    assumptions were incredibly weak or simply not supportable.
•   Criteria are those standards, requirements or limitations used to test possible solutions. The
    criteria for a problem-solution are sometimes provided in complete form by your boss when
    you are assigned the problem. Sometimes criteria are inherent in the nature of the obstacle
    causing the problem. The obstacle can only be overcome within certain physical limits, and
    these limits will establish the criteria for the problem-solution. In most cases, however,
    criteria are usually inherent in your own frame of reference and in the goal you are trying to
    attain. This goal and this frame of reference will tolerate only certain problem-solutions, and
    the limits of this tolerance will establish the criteria for the problem-solution.
    Remember this: The criteria will not be very useful if you cannot clearly test the
    possible solutions against them! Since weak or even lousy criteria are often seen in
    problem-solution reports, let’s examine three examples of criteria and assess their value.
    n “The total solution must not cost more than $6,000 annually.”
    o “The solution must result in a 75 percent operationally ready (OR) rate.”
    p “The solution must be consistent with the boss’ philosophy on personnel management.”
    Criterion one is fine; you could easily “bump” your proposed solutions against a specific
    cost. Criterion two looks good on the surface, but OR rates result from numerous and
    complex variables. You probably could not guarantee the decisionmaker your “solution”
    would lead to a 75 percent OR rate. It might improve the OR rate or actually lead to a rate
    higher than 75 percent, but before your boss actually implements your solution, how would
    you know that? If a criterion cannot be used to test solutions before implementation, it is
    not an acceptable criterion. Criterion three isn’t bad, but it’s fuzzy. Perhaps it could be
    written more precisely or left off the formal report altogether. You could still use it
    intuitively to check your solutions, but realize when you use “hidden” criteria, your report
    will be less objective.
7. LIST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. Approach the task of creating solutions with an open mind.
Develop as many solutions as possible. The “brainstorming” technique using several
knowledgeable people is a popular approach to generating possible solutions.




                                              – 201 –
The Tongue and Quill


8. TEST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. Test each solution by using criteria formed while gathering
data. Weigh one solution against another after testing each. Be sensitive to your personal biases
and prejudices. Strive for professional objectivity.
9. SELECT FINAL SOLUTION. Select the best possible solution—or a combination of the best
solutions—to fit the mission. Most Air Force problem-solutions fall into one of the three
patterns listed below. Do not try to force your report into one of these patterns if it doesn’t
appear to fit.
  c Single best possible solution. This one is basic and the most commonly used. You select
    the best solution from several possible ones.
  d Combination of possible solutions. You may need to combine two or more possible
    solutions for your best possibilities.
  e Single possible solution. At times, you may want to report on only one possible solution.
10. ACT. Jot down the actions required for the final solution. Your comments here will
eventually lead to the specific action(s) your boss should take to implement the solution (this
will eventually appear in the “Action Recommended” portion when you write the report). If
there is no implementing document for the decisionmaker to sign, you need to state clearly what
other specific action the boss must take to implement your proposal. No military problem is
complete until action has been planned and executed.




                       NOTE: In actual practice, the steps of problem solving do not
                       always follow a definite and orderly sequence. The steps may
                       overlap, more than one step may be considered at one time, or
                       developments at one step may cause you to reconsider a
                       previous step. For example, the data you collect may force
                       you to redefine your problem. Similarly, while testing
                       solutions, you may think of a new solution or, in the process
                       of selecting a final solution, you may discover you need
                       additional information. The steps just outlined can serve as a
                       checklist to bring order to your mental processes.

       3. Assumptions. Should be realistic and support your study.
       4. Criteria. Give standards, requirements, or limitations you will use to test possible solutions.
       Ensure you can use standards to measure or test solutions.
       5. Definitions. Describe or define terms that may confuse your audience.
       DISCUSSION
       6. This section shows the logic used in solving the problem. Introduce the problem and give some
       background, if necessary. Then explain your solution or possible solution.
       CONCLUSION
       7. State your conclusion as a workable, complete solution to the problem you described previously in
       “Discussion.”
       ACTION RECOMMENDED
       8. Tell the reader the action necessary to implement the solution. This should be worked so the boss
       only needs to sign to make the solution happen.

By now you probably realize the staff study is a problem-solution report that presents data
collected, discusses possible solutions to the problem, and indicates the best solution. It is not a
style to solve a problem. You should mentally solve your problem, and then report the solution
in writing. The format of the staff study report includes a heading, a body, an ending and, when
necessary, the attachments.

1. HEADING.      Leave after MEMORANDUM FOR blank. This allows the report to seek its
own level. After FROM, enter your complete office address (see page 184, paragraph 4). After
SUBJECT, state the report’s subject as briefly and concisely as possible. However, use a few
extra words if this will add meaning to your subject.
2. BODY.    The body of the report contains five parts: (1) Problem, (2) Factors Bearing on
the Problem, (3) Discussion, (4) Conclusion, and (5) Action Recommended. These parts
coincide with the steps of problem solving. That’s why the staff study report is a convenient
way to report your problem-solution.



     Steps of problem solving                          Body of staff study

     1.   Recognize the problem                        1. Problem
     2.   Gather data                                  2. Factors Bearing on the Problem
     3.   List possible solutions                      3. Discussion
     4.   Test possible solutions                      4. Conclusion (a brief restatement
     5.   Select final solution                           of final solution)
     6.   Act                                          5. Action Recommended


Problem. The statement of the problem tells the reader what you are trying to solve. No
discussion is necessary at this point; a simple statement of the problem is sufficient. You have
ample opportunity to discuss all aspects of the problem later in the report.
Factors Bearing on the Problem. This part contains the facts, assumptions, criteria, and
definitions you used to build possible solutions to your problem. Devote separate paragraphs to
facts, assumptions, criteria, and definitions as shown in the sample study report. Obviously, if
you write a report in which you have no assumptions or definitions, omit either or both. Include
only those important factors you used to solve your problem. Briefly state whatever you include.
Put lengthy support material in attachments. Write each sentence completely so you don’t force
the reader to refer to the attachments to understand what you’ve written.
Discussion. This part of the report is crucial because it shows the logic used to solve the
problem. Generally, some background information is necessary to properly introduce your
problem. The introduction may be one paragraph or several paragraphs, depending on the detail
required. Once the intro is complete, use one of the following outlines to discuss your thought
process.

                                                                                Staff Study Report

¾¾¾When using the single best possible solution:

n List all possible solutions you think will interest the decisionmaker.
o Show how you tested each possible solution against the criteria, listing both the
advantages and disadvantages. Use the same criteria to test each possible solution.
p Show how you weighed each possible solution against the others to select the best possible
solution.
q Clearly indicate the best possible solution.

¾¾¾When using a combination of possible solutions:
n List all the possible solutions you think will interest the decisionmaker.
o Show how you tested each possible solution against the criteria, listing both the
advantages and disadvantages. Use the same criteria to test each possible solution.
p Show how you weighed each possible solution against the other possible solutions and
why you retained certain ones as a partial solution to the problem.
q Show how and why you combined the retained possible solutions.

¾¾¾When using the single possible solution:
n List your single solution.
o Test it against the criteria.
p Show how and why this solution will solve the problem.
No matter how you organize your report, these points are important: (1) make it brief, (2)
maintain a sequence of thought throughout, (3) show the reader how you reasoned the problem
through, and (4) use attachments for support, but include enough information in the body of the
report to make sense without referring to the attachments.
Conclusion. After showing how you reasoned the problem through, state your conclusion. The
conclusion must provide a complete, workable solution to the problem. The conclusion is
nothing more than a brief restatement of the best possible solution or solutions. The conclusion
must not continue the discussion. It should completely satisfy the requirements of the problem;
it should never introduce new material.
Word the recommendations so your boss need only sign for action. Do not recommend
alternatives. This does not mean you cannot consider alternative solutions in “Discussion.” It
means you commit yourself to the line of action you judge best.
You must relieve the decisionmaker of the research and study necessary to decide from several
alternatives. Give precise guidance on what you want the decisionmaker to do; i.e., “Sign the
implementing letter at attachment 1.” (Normally, implementing documents should be the first
attachment.) Don’t submit a rubber turkey. Recommendations like “Recommend further study”
or “Either solution A or B should be implemented” indicate the decisionmaker picked the wrong
person to do the study.

3. ENDING.      Follow the format shown on the sample report. The ending contains the name,
rank, and title of the person or persons responsible for the report and a listing of attachments. Do
not use an identification line.
4. ATTACHMENTS.         Since the body of the staff study report must be brief, relegate as much of
the detail as possible to the attachments. Although seldom required, identify material needed to
support an attachment as an appendix to the attachment.
•   Include, as attachments, the directives necessary to support the recommended actions.
•   The body may reference the authority directing the study. An attachment may contain an
    actual copy of the directive.
•   The body may contain an extract or a condensed version of a quotation. An attachment may
    contain a copy of the complete quotation.
•   The body may contain a statement that requires support. An attachment may state the source
    and include the material that verifies that statement.
•   The body may refer to a chart or information in a chart. An attachment may include the
    complete chart. (Design the chart to fit the overall proportions of the report or fold the chart
    to fit these proportions.)
•   If directives or detailed instructions are required to implement the recommended action,
    include the drafts as attachments.
5. TABS.   Number tabs (paper or plastic indicator) to help the reader locate attachments or
appendices. Affix each tab to a blank sheet of paper and insert immediately preceding the
attachment. If it is not practical to extract the supporting material from a long or complex
document used as an attachment, affix the tab to that page within the attachment or appendix
where the supporting material is located.
Position the tab for attachment 1 to the lower right corner of a sheet of paper. Position the tab
for each succeeding attachment slightly higher on a separate sheet so all tabs can be seen.

                                                                                        Staff Study Report

COMPLETED STAFF WORK
A staff study report should represent completed staff work. This means the staff member has
solved a problem and presented a complete solution to the boss. The solution should be
complete enough that the decisionmaker has only to approve or disapprove.
The impulse to ask the chief what to do occurs more often when the problem is difficult. This
impulse often comes to the inexperienced staff member frustrated over a hard job. It’s easy to
ask the chief what to do, and it appears easy for the chief to answer, but you should resist the
urge. Your job is to advise your boss what should be done—provide answers, not questions. Of
course, it’s okay to inquire at any point in the problem-solving procedure if you need to find out
whether you are on the right track. This coordination often saves untold hours.
Some final thoughts on completed staff work and problem-solution reporting:
¹ Completed staff work provides the creative staffer a better chance to get a hearing. Unleash
  your latent creativity!
¹ Schedule time to work the problem. Most problems worthy of analysis require considerable
  study and reflection.
¹ There’s usually no school solution—no “hidden cause” that will jump up and bite your
  kneecap. That’s life. Avoid simplistic solutions; e.g., “Fire the idiots and get on with the
  program.”
¹ Don’t assume that the heavier and fancier the study, the better it is. A smart decisionmaker
  focuses on the relevance and accuracy of your supporting material and the logic of your
  argument.
¹ Don’t work a study in isolation. If you point your finger at someone or some unit, or if the
  solution requires a change in someone’s operation, you’d better get their reaction before you
  drop the bomb. You can look mighty foolish if you find out later they were operating under
  a constraint of which you were unaware.
¹ Remember the final test for completed staff work: If you were the boss, would you be willing
   to stake your professional reputation on this problem-solution report? If the answer is “no,
   go directly to Go. Do not collect $200.” It’s time to start over.

 PURPOSE

The Bullet Background Paper is an excellent tool designed to present concisely written statements
centered around a single idea or to present a collection of accomplishments with their respective impacts.
 DISCUSSION
 - All bullet statements must be accurate, brief and specific (ABS)
 - Types of bullet statements
    -- Single Idea Bullets
          --- Definition: A concise written statement of a single idea or concept
          --- Cannot delineate
          --- Must serve purpose
     -- Accomplishment-Impact Bullets
          --- Definition: A concise written statement of a person’s single accomplishment
                           and its impact on the unit mission, organization, etc.
          --- Must clearly state a single accomplishment
          --- Must have an impact
               ---- Impact can be implied (Specific Achievement) or expressly stated
               ---- Strive to relate impact to the unit mission, organization, etc.
               ---- Make impact clear to those not familiar with career field, unique
                    terminology, jargon, etc.
               ---- Expressly stated impact should strengthen bullet statement
               ---- Expressly stated impact should put accomplishment into perspective
          --- Accomplishment element must always precede impact element
          --- Types of Accomplishment-Impact Bullets
               ---- Action Verb: Accomplishment begins with strong, descriptive action verb
               ---- Modified Verb: Accomplishment begins with modifier (typically adverb)
               ---- Specific Achievement: Impact is implied, not expressly stated
 SUMMARY
 This paper summarizes characteristics of Single Idea and Accomplishment-Impact bullet statements.

    ¶
    ¶
    An increasingly popular version of the background paper is the “bullet” background paper. The bullet

    format provides a concise, chronological evolution of a problem, a complete summary of an attached

   staff package or a more detailed explanation of what appears in an attached talking paper.

    Use the first paragraph to identify the main thrust of the paper.

    Main ideas follow the intro paragraph and may be as long as several sentences or as short as one word

    - Secondary items follow with a single dash and tertiary items follow with multiple indented dashes.
      Secondary and tertiary items can be as short as a word or as long as several sentences.

    - Format varies.

        -- Center title (all capital letters); use 1-inch margins all around; single space the text; double space
           between items—except double space title and triple space to text; use appropriate punctuation in
           paragraphs and complete thoughts.

        -- Headings such as SUBJECT, PROBLEM, BACKGROUND, DISCUSSION,
           CONCLUSION, or RECOMMENDATION are optional.

    Keys to developing a good backgrounder:

    - Write the paper according to the knowledge level of the user; i.e., a person who is very knowledgeable on
      the subject won’t require as much detail as one who knows very little.

    - Emphasize main points.

    - Attach additional support data; refer to it in the backgrounder.

    - Require minimum length to achieve brevity with short transitions.

    - End with concluding remarks or recommendations.

    Include an identification line (author’s rank and name, organization, office symbol, phone number,
    typist’s initials, and date) on the first page 1 inch from the bottom of the page.

TYPES OF BULLET STATEMENTS
1. Single Idea Bullets ~ This type of bullet is typically used for Talking Papers, Point Papers
and Bullet Background Papers. Various examples can be found on the sample BBPs and in
the Display Dot punctuation guidelines on pages 289-290.
2. Accomplishment-Impact Bullets ∼ This type of bullet is typically used in performance
reports (EPR, OPR, etc.), recommendations, and award submissions (Air Force IMT 1206).
These bullets typically describe someone’s work performance (good or bad) and/or
noteworthy off-duty pursuits. For further help on how to develop accomplishment-impact
bullet statements, see pages 226-235.
•   The Accomplishment Element: This portion briefly describes the person’s actions or
    behavior. Keep the following questions in mind as you construct the accomplishment
    element of your bullet statement:
    -    What did the person (or group) do?
    -    What was the success (or, less often, the failure)?
    -    Might some terms be unfamiliar to readers outside this career field?
•   The Impact Element: The impact element describes the results of the accomplishment
    and it may be either expressly stated or implied. The impact element is vital to describing
    the relative importance of the action. Keep the following questions in mind as you
    construct the impact element of your bullet statement:
    -   What is the impact on the mission of the organization or the Air Force?
    -   Is this impact statement accurate in scope and strength?
    -   Does it put things into perspective?
There are three variations of the accomplishment-impact bullet. In most performance related
documents (i.e., performance reports, award submissions, etc.), the Action Verb and Modified
Verb variations are predominantly used, whereas the Specific Achievement variation is used
sparingly.
•   Action Verb: The accomplishment element begins with a strong action verb and ends
    with an expressly stated impact element.
    -   Developed new customer sign-in log reducing customer complaints by 35 percent
    -   Implemented a schedule to pick up customer equipment items; reduced delays by 5 days
    -   Conducted 10 staff assistance visits this year
        -- Ensured all units received an EXCELLENT rating on their IG inspections
        -- Selected two units for Air Force-wide recognition
•   Modified Verb: The accomplishment element begins with a modifier in front of the
    action verb and ends with an expressly stated impact element.
    -   Consistently exceeded all standards of ... [Consistently modifies the verb exceeded]
    -   Solely responsible for production increases in ... [Solely modifies the verb responsible]
•   Specific Achievement: The accomplishment element may begin with a noun, verb or
    modifier; the impact of the accomplishment is implied. Specific Achievement bullets are
    primarily used to describe professional development or personal attainment.

                                        BACKGROUND PAPER
                                                     ON
                 JOINT COMMUNICATIONS PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

1. Joint Communications Planning and Management System (JCPMS) is an open-system, UNIX-
based, automated communications network planning and management tool. It gives all the services
and commanders in chief an automated capability to plan and manage a joint task force
communications network. The requirement for a JCPMS capability comes from a requirement
submitted by the United States Atlantic Command. The Joint Staff and the JCS Publication 6-05
working group validated the requirement and rewrote it into a joint mission needs statement. The
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) evaluated the services’ current and under development
communications management programs to determine suitability for the joint requirement.
DISA selected the Army’s Integrated Systems Control (ISYSCON) as the best candidate to be
developed into a JCPMS.

2. Joint Staff failed to obtain funding from The Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Joint Staff
requested the Air Force, Army and Navy share equally in the cost to develop JCPMS from ISYSCON.
The services attempted to write an input to the Program Object Memorandum for this requirement,
but the initiative fell short within each service.
3. JCPMS will be based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS)
software. This is prudent, cost-effective, timely, and in-line with COTS network management and
control products already planned for other Air Force and DoD programs (e.g., theater deployable
communications equipment, Base Network Control Center System and Defense Message System). A
COTS/GOTS-based implementation of JCPMS will ease compatibility and interoperability issues
likely to arise when the different network management systems are ultimately tied together.
4. The Air Force supports a joint solution that functions as a “manager of managers” to unite both
strategic and deployable individual equipment managers in a seamless fashion. This will ease
compatibility and/or interoperability issues likely to arise when the different network management
systems are ultimately tied together. The Air Force agrees a JCPMS is needed and supports adapting
a COTS-based ISYSCON to meet JCPMS requirements with the understanding the Air Force has no
additional funding to contribute toward this effort.

        ¶

                                                BACKGROUND PAPERS

        ¶
        1. The background paper is a multipurpose staff communications instrument that transmits ideas or
        concepts from one agency or person to another. It is an excellent way to express ideas on specific
        topics and to describe conditions that require a particular staff action. This background paper outlines
        its basic function and format with concluding comments covering the style and length.
        2. The most common function of the background paper is to present the background (chronological,
        problem-solution, etc.) underlying an issue or subject, but it also has other purposes. One command uses
        it to condense and summarize important or complex matters into a single, easily read document limited
        to three pages. Another command uses it to inform and prepare senior officers to talk on a subject. Still
        another command specifies it as a summary of background material to provide a speaker with historical,
        technical, or statistical data.
        3. A good background paper contains a brief introductory paragraph that provides the reader with a clear




                                                                                                                          1-inch top and bottom margins
        statement of purpose and an outline or “road map” for the paper, the basic discussion that comprises the
        bulk of the paper (cohesive, single-idea paragraphs), and leads the reader logically to the conclusion.
        Generally, write in the third person, although writing in first person, active voice will sometimes be more
        appropriate. The concise, telegraphic style of the talking paper is sometimes used and is encouraged. The
        bullet background paper shown next illustrates a tighter format. If it will do the job, use it.
        4. The specific format (including style and length) of the background paper also varies. It may be longer
        than one page; the main point is to make it as short or as long as necessary to cover the topic adequately.
        Some agencies specify no particular format. The bullet format and this one illustrate the formats used in
        most organizations. General guidelines follow:
            a. Begin the header “BACKGROUND PAPER” six lines (1 inch) from the top of the first page and
        three lines above text.
            b. Use a 1-inch margin all around, double space.
            c. Type an identification line (originator’s rank and name, organization, office symbol, phone number,
        typist’s initials, and date) on the first page 1 inch from the bottom of the page.
            d. Number the pages consecutively, starting with page 2. Enter the page number on the left margin
        1 inch from the bottom of the page or at least two lines below the last line of the text.
        5. The key to an effective background paper, like any well-written document, is to get to the point quickly,
        cover all aspects of the issue in sufficient detail to meet your objective, and close the paper with a sense of
        finality.

                                   QUALITY AIR FORCE

1. This paper addresses the importance of embracing and implementing Quality Air
Force (QAF) tools into the Air Force. QAF tools are proven management techniques
that allow better decision analysis and decision-making, but many do not recognize their
usefulness. Several of the tools are based on supported measurement (metrics) and, like
tools in a master carpenter’s toolbox, they work well when properly used.
2. Traditionally, we have been taught to depend on our leader to analyze and solve
problems. Based on the leader’s experience and “analysis,” many of those decisions were
excellent, but not all. Today, we can better analyze problems using a quality tool called
a flow chart. This tool asks people involved in, and thoroughly aware of, a process to
examine and display the process steps so it can be analyzed and improvements can be made.
This allows a logical and more “fact-based” improvement decision. Still, people say the
process takes too long, it is unwieldy, and they aren’t comfortable with it. So all the
“improvement” decisions are made without it.
3. We must use QAF tools better. We have all bent a nail using a hammer, but how many
of us blame the hammer? The same philosophy applies to quality tools. If we apply them
 properly, they work. We can certainly use a wrong tool to solve a problem. (We’ve all
 hammered in a nail with something other than a hammer with mixed results—QAF tools
 are the same.) But consider the master carpenters; they not only know and use tools more
 effectively they also add unique tools of their own. If we can add more “quality” tools to
 our toolkits, we must.
4. Using QAF tools in this time of dramatic, fast-paced change makes a lot of sense. If you
haven’t tried using them, do it. If you have tried once and a tool didn’t work, think of all the
nails you bent with a perfectly good hammer. The tools are proven performers, but we must
use them and use them properly.

         1. When you must evaluate a proposal, raise a new idea for consideration, advocate a

         current situation or proposal, or “take a stand” on an issue, you’ll find the position paper

         format ideally suited for the task. This position paper builds a case for that assertion by

         describing the function and format of the Air Force position paper.

         2. The opening statement or introductory paragraph must contain a “clear statement” of




                                                                                                        1-inch top and bottom margins
         your purpose in presenting the issue and “your position” on that issue. The remainder of

         the paper should consist of integrated paragraphs or statements that logically support or

         defend that position. Adequate, accurate and relevant support material is a must for the

         position paper.

         3. Since a position paper is comparable to an advocacy briefing in written format, the

         concluding paragraph must contain a specific recommendation or a clear restatement of

         your position. This is where you reemphasize your bottom line.

         4. The format for the position paper is the same as for the background paper—number the

          paragraphs and double space the text. For more specifics, refer to the background paper

          on pages 215-216.

Preparing the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS)                                                                                    1 Apr 04
SUMMARY
1. The SSS introduces, summarizes, coordinates, or obtains approval or signature on a staff package. It should be a concise
(preferably one page) summary of the package. It states the purpose, pertinent background information, rationale, and discussion
necessary to justify the action desired. Show the action desired (Coord [Coordination], Appr [Approval], Sig [Signature]). Use
Info (Information), when the SSS is submitted for information only. (NOTE: Usually show only one Appr entry and one Sig
entry.) Use complete address when coordinating with outside organizations.

2. The SSS is attached to the front of the correspondence package. If an additional page is necessary, prepare it on plain bond
paper. Use the same margins you see here. Summarize complicated or lengthy correspondence or document attached, or any
appropriate portion of any document you reference. Do not use in place of a memo; use with a package it summarizes.

3. List attachments to the SSS as tabs. List the documents for action as Tab 1. List incoming letter, directive or other paper—if
any—that prompted you to prepare the SSS as Tab 2. (If you have more than one document for action, list and tab with as many
numbers as needed and list the material you’re responding to as the next number: Tabs 1, 2, and 3 for signature, Tab 4 incoming
document.) List supplemental documents as additional tabs followed by the record or coordination copy and information copies.
If nonconcurrence is involved, list it and the letter or rebuttal as the last tab.

4. VIEW OF OTHER. Explain concerns of others external to the staff (i.e., OSD, Army, Navy, State, etc.) For example: “OSD
may disapprove of the approach.” Use a period or colon after VIEW OF OTHER, OPTION, etc. Either is acceptable; just be
consistent.

5. OPTIONS. If there are significant alternative solutions, explain. For example, “Buying off-the-shelf hardware will reduce the
cost by 25 percent, but will meet only 80 percent of the requirements.”

6. RECOMMENDATION. Use this caption when SSS is routed for action. State the recommendation, including action necessary
to implement it, in such a way the official need only sign an attachment or coordinate, approve, or disapprove the recommended
action. Do not recommend alternatives or use this caption when submitted for info only.

PREPARATION OF AN ELECTRONIC STAFF SUMMARY SHEET (SSS)
Staff Summary Sheets requiring your Group or Wing Commander’s signature should be sent through your
internal channels via e-mail. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) transmits package via e-mail to first
reviewer to coordinate/comment. The first reviewer should forward (never reply) package with comments (if
any) to the next reviewer. This procedure is repeated until last reviewer has coordinated on the package.
The last reviewer forwards the entire package back to the OPR.

                                      RULES FOR WRITERS:
   "   Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.

   "    Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.

   "    And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.

   "    It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.

   "    Avoid clichés like the plague. (They’re old hat.)

   " Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.
   " Be more or less specific.
   "    Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.

   "    Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.

   "    No sentence fragments.

   "   Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.

   "    Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.

   "    One should NEVER generalize.

   "    Comparisons are as bad as clichés.

   "    Don't use no double negatives.

   "    Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.

   "    One-word sentences? Eliminate.

                                                       REPORT




Officer Performance Reports (OPR), Enlisted Performance Reports (EPR), and civilian reports
(appraisals), are used by commanders, managers and supervisors to document an individual’s
performance over a specific period of time, and to identify top performers. As a supervisor, you
play a vital role in your employee’s career. You are the single most important person in a
dynamic process that, through mentoring and effective writing, ensures each individual is
afforded the opportunity for success and increased responsibility.
Performance reports provide a permanent, long-term record of an individual’s performance and
potential based on their performance. Performance reports should follow appropriate
instructions/regulations and command guidance, if required. For more information, consult
writing guides that support your organization’s needs.




                      “My guidelines are simple. Be selective. Be concise, don’t
                      tell someone what you know; tell them what they need to
                      know, what it means, and why it matters.”
                                                          — General David C. Jones

GETTING STARTED
1 GETTING ORGANIZED. Keep records of all employee’s accomplishments, awards and
recommendations.
2 FORMAT. Refer to bullet format on page 213 and 226-235 for writing style. Use the font
specified by your organization—in most cases it’s built into the software used to produce the
report. Limit each statement to three lines in length.
3 EDITING PRACTICES. Use the Mechanics of Writing section for grammatical terms,
punctuation, abbreviations, capitalization, hyphens, and numbers. Avoid misspellings, typos,
badly smudged documents, and misaligned bullet statements, which make a poor impression.
4 WRITE EFFECTIVELY. Get the reader’s attention. Positive words and phrases leave a
lasting impression with readers, so check out the word list on pages 228-229. Neutral or
negative words and phrases give the impression that the person you are writing about is average
or below average. The heart of effective writing in a performance report involves writing
effective accomplishment-impact statements.

     WRITING ACCOMPLISHMENT-IMPACT BULLET STATEMENTS
Like many Air Force writers, you’ve likely stared down the barrel of a loaded bullet statement
tasking and wondered, “How in the world do I even START to write effective bullet
statements?” Perhaps you’re in that situation right now, or perhaps you’re there for the 40th
time! Well, it’s time to stop this endless cycle of pain and torment. Over the next few pages
you’ll learn a tried and true system for building excellent bullet statements—plus it will save you
lots of time and eliminate all of that frustration. Oh, got your attention, huh? Well OK, let’s get

The first leg of this journey begins by tackling the hardest part of bullet statement writing—
getting started! Most distressed bullet statement writers get into trouble early because they fail
to identify all the information needed. It’s a common mistake!
Gather the Information
Collect all of the information you can find that is relevant to the actual accomplishment. When
identifying this information, be sure to capture everything on paper or in a computer. At this
stage, capture information that may seem even remotely related to the accomplishment; you can
cut stuff out later. You are looking for the following types of information:
Isolate one specific action the person performed (don’t generalize).
Try to select the proper “power verb” that best describes this action (i.e., repaired, installed,
designed, etc.).
Look for as much numerical information as possible that is related to this action (number of
items fixed, dollars generated, man-hours saved, people served, pages written, etc.).




                                                – 226 –
                                                                                   Performance Report


Track down information about how this accomplishment impacted the bigger picture, the larger
scope (How did it help the work center? How did it support the unit’s mission? How did it
benefit the entire Air Force?).
Be persistent when collecting your information, and start by talking to the person you’re writing
about. They are in the best position to clarify and give exact details about what they’ve done and
how they went about doing it.
Another place to draw information from is coworkers and other supervisors who may have seen
this person in action. But don’t stop there! You may need to consult Technical Orders,
customers served, letters of appreciation, automated work production documents, or other
sources to get all the information you need.
It’s a great idea to track your subordinate’s accomplishments as they happen. Keep a record of
significant work performance (both good and bad) by jotting them down on a document
somewhere. This habit will help you be prepared when it’s time for a performance report or
feedback.
In most cases, gathering this information should not require a great deal of time. But be prepared
to schedule ample time with various people and jot down things you need to include (or verify).
Keep in mind that if you fail to collect the information needed up front, putting together strong
bullet statements will be nearly impossible. A lack of research is something to avoid … it will
force you to rely less on convincing facts and more upon loose generalizations and incorrect
guesses.
Sort the Information
Once you have the information captured, don’t be surprised if it looks like a host of different
things all thrown together. Your next step is to review each item you’ve gathered and test it to
see if it is truly associated with the single accomplishment you identified earlier or if these facts
are completely unrelated. You can do this by applying the million-dollar question to each item:
                   “Is this bit of information solidly connected to this single
    $$$                                                                                       $$$
                                        accomplishment?”
If the answer is yes, flag the information as a keeper. If the answer is no, line through or flag the
information as a nonkeeper … but never throw it away or delete it! Although it may not be a
good fit for the current bullet statement, it may be just what you need for another bullet you will
soon be framing.
Continue applying this question to all of the items you’ve collected for this bullet statement.
Once you’re done with this process of sorting, you should have a neat little stack of information
that pertains precisely to the target bullet statement. You’ve just eliminated any doubt
concerning what should be included in this bullet, and what should not be included.
STEP 2: BUILD THE STRUCTURE
The next leg of our journey involves taking the information from Step 1 and organizing it into
the proper structure of an accomplishment-impact bullet. There are essentially two major
components: the accomplishment element and the impact element.

The Accomplishment Element
The accomplishment element should always begin with an action. Most of the time, this action
takes the form of a strong action verb. Below you’ll find a short list of action verbs that can be
used to start bullet statements. It’s nice to keep a list of verbs like this handy in preparation for
writing that next EPR, OPR, or quarterly/annual award submission package.

                                                                                 Performance Report


In some cases, action verbs alone just cannot fully stress the strength or depth of someone’s
accomplishment. If you need to give action verbs an added boost, use an adverb to modify the
verb. Most adverbs are real easy to pick out … they end with the last two letters “ly.” Try
connecting some of the adverbs listed below to the verbs listed above to get a feel for how the
adverb/verb combination can intensify the accomplishment element.

                                        Sample Adverbs
Actively                   Creatively                 Forcefully                 Quickly
Aggressively               Decisively                 Frantically                Relentlessly
Anxiously                  Eagerly                    Impulsively                Restlessly
Ardently                   Energetically              Incisively                 Spiritedly
Articulately               Enterprisingly             Innovatively               Spontaneously
Assertively                Enthusiastically           Intensely                  Swiftly
Avidly                     Expeditiously              Powerfully                 Tenaciously
Boldly                     Exuberantly                Promptly                   Vigorously
Competitively              Feverishly                 Prosperously               Vigilant
Compulsively               Fiercely                   Provocatively

Now that you get the general idea about how to begin the accomplishment element, let’s look at
the rest of this critical part of the bullet statement. Broadly speaking, the accomplishment
element contains all the words that describe a single action performed by a person. Yes, I know
that sounds pretty simple, but you’d be surprised at how many writers violate this basic rule. If
two or more actions are combined together in the same bullet, each of the actions is forced to
share the strength of that entire statement. So rather than combining two or more actions to
strengthen a single bullet, bullet statement writers must ensure bullets focus on only one single
accomplishment. Two examples of an accomplishment element are listed below; one uses
simply an action verb while the other uses a modifier (adverb) for added emphasis:
    -    Processed over 300 records with no errors as part of the 42 ABW Mobility Exercise
    -    Tenaciously processed over 300 records with no errors as part of the 42 ABW Mobility
         Exercise
Quick review: the accomplishment element begins with some form of action (action verb only or
modifier plus action verb) and contains a description of one single action or accomplishment.
With that established, let’s look at the second portion of the bullet statement: the impact element.
The Impact Element
This part of the bullet statement explains how the person’s actions have had an effect on the
organization. The impact element can show varying levels of influence. That is, the person’s
actions may be connected to significant improvements to a work center’s mission, an entire unit
mission, or as broad as the entire Air Force. One thing to keep in mind about the scope of the
impact is that it should be consistent with the person’s accomplishment. For example, if the
accomplishment explains how a person processed a large number of records during a base
exercise, the impact should not be stretched or exaggerated to show how the Air Force will save
millions of dollars. We’ll chat more about “accuracy” later. For the time being, be extremely
careful not to stretch the truth when rendering full credit for someone’s accomplishment. Check
out the suggested impact element below:
        …all wing personnel met their scheduled clock times


                                              – 229 –
The Tongue and Quill


Connecting the Elements Together
Connecting the accomplishment and impact elements together can be accomplished several
ways. One of these ways is to use the “ing” form of words. See how the word “ensuring”
connects our two elements in the example below:
   -   Processed over 300 records with no errors as part of the 42 ABW Mobility Exercise
       ensuring all wing personnel met their scheduled clock times
Another way to connect these two elements together is to use conjunctive (just a fancy word
meaning “joining things together”) punctuation. The most common form of conjunctive
punctuation in bullet statements is the semicolon. Let’s set off our previous example with a
semicolon to see this approach in action:
   -   Processed over 300 records with no errors as part of the 42 ABW Mobility Exercise; all
       wing personnel met their scheduled clock times
You may have noticed that in the two examples above, each bullet statement is set off with a
single dash (-). If you have a situation where a person’s single accomplishment has more than
one significant impact, you may be better off showing each impact element separately. To do
this properly, cut the impact completely off the main bullet and make each impact element a
separate subbullet (subordinate to the main bullet) with double-dashes (--). When making an
impact serve as a subordinate bullet, try to start each one with an action verb. It’s much easier to
comprehend this option by seeing it in action rather than by reading about it. So check out the
example below:
   -   Processed over 300 records with no errors as part of the 42 ABW Mobility Exercise
       --      Ensured all wing personnel met their scheduled clock times
       --      Helped the wing garner an overall “OUTSTANDING” rating from the IG
               team
There is just one more thing concerning structure we want to nail down before moving on to our
third and final step. All Air Force bullet statement writers need to adhere to several rules that
standardize the appearance and format of bullets on various documents. Take a few moments to
get familiar with these rules.

                                                                                   Performance Report


BULLET STATEMENT MECHANICS
   -   Start main bullets with a single dash ( - )
   -   Indent bullets so that the first character of the second (and subsequent) line(s) aligns
       directly under the first character (not dash) of the line above
   -   Start subordinate bullets with additional dashes ( -- for secondary, --- for tertiary)
   -   Indent subordinate bullets so that the first dash of the secondary (and tertiary) bullet(s)
       aligns directly under the first character (not dash) of the bullet above
       -- Secondary bullet is subordinate to main bullet
          --- Tertiary bullet is subordinate to secondary bullet
   -   Never use ending punctuation in accomplishment-impact bullet statements
   -   Always start an accomplishment-impact bullet statement with some form of action (action
       verb or modified verb)
   -   Never start an accomplishment-impact bullet with a proper noun or pronoun
   -   Minimize the use of the individual’s name in bullet statement when it is printed elsewhere
       on the document
   -   Avoid using personal pronouns (he, she, his, her, etc.) in accomplishment-impact bullet
       statements; these devices typically serve to form complete sentences
STEP 3: STREAMLINE THE FINAL PRODUCT
Time for another quick review. After first extracting mounds of data to be used in drafting the
bullets, we used a process to separate our extracted information into two different components:
the accomplishment element and the impact element. Finally, we connected the two elements
together and applied a handful of standardized rules to make the bullets appear strong and
healthy looking.
So where do we go from here? Now we need to Streamline the Final Product and make the
bullet statement. It is here that we’ll refine the bullet statement by making it Accurate, Brief, and
Specific (ABS). Did you catch that acronym? Similar to doing “crunches” in the gym to shape
our abdominal muscles, we’re going to crunch our bullet statements to give them some strong,
healthy looking ABS. We’ll start this section by first defining each of these attributes in A-B-S
order.
Accuracy
For anything to be “accurate” it must be “correct.” People who have the most trouble with
accuracy are those who try to stretch the truth. You may remember that we touched on this
briefly in our description of the impact element earlier. Mild exaggeration or embellishment of
the facts is poison and is only a half-step away from outright lying and falsifying the facts.
Don’t ever let this happen to you. Let honesty, integrity, and accuracy be your watchwords.

Brevity
In editing for brevity you are actually accomplishing two separate activities. First, you should
select words (replacing as necessary) that are shortest, clearest, yet most descriptive to the
readers. That means that long, confusing words or phrases get swapped out with shorter, clearer,
more common terms. Second, you need to reduce the number of unnecessary words. Some of
the words that all bullet writers should be looking to eliminate (or at least sharply reduce) are:
   -   Articles: a, an, the
   -   Helping verbs: can, could, may, might, must, ought, shall, should, will, would
       -- Also forms of be: be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being
       -- Also forms of have: have, has, had, having
       -- Also forms of do: do, does, did
   -   Linking verbs: forms of verbs associated with five senses: look, sound, smell, feel, taste
   -   Name of the person when their name is printed elsewhere on the document
   -   Personal pronouns
   -   Prepositions (use them sparingly): over, under, in, during, within, etc.
Specificity
Specific bullet statements contain detailed facts. To write them, you’ll need to be familiar with
the people and systems involved. Fight the urge to estimate or generalize. Don’t be satisfied
with 10-20 of this, or about $1000 of that … you need to make sure of the exact numbers …
right down to the penny if possible!
Knowing the meaning of ABS (also known as “the critical attributes of bullet statements”)
should help you make some “sweeping” changes to all the bullet statements you write. When
you properly apply these attributes to your bullet statements, you will clean them up, trim them
down, and give them the all-around scrubbing they need before they become a permanent part
of someone’s official record.
Sculpting Your ABS
Working these attributes into your bullet statements is like climbing into the ring for a few
rounds of boxing. Oh yes, it may be a tough fight, but you’re going to pulverize that challenger!
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ladies and gentlemen, in that corner over there, the challenger. Weighing
in at “less than intimidating” and wearing the sagging trunks: the half-baked bullet statement!
In this corner right here, sporting an impressive set of ABS, the reigning bullet statement editor,
and undisputed champion: the Air Force supervisor!

All right, come to the center of the ring and take a closer look at your opponent. You’re going to
put your ABS into action against the bullet statement below. No contest!
       - Repaired 17 seriously corroded broken or missing Log Periodic (LP) antenna
         elements in the Atlantic Gateway Antenna System within 3 days by using elements
         from decommissioned antenna parts saving an estimated $3500 in procurement
         cost and 4 weeks of expected delivery time
Back to your corner for a moment to formulate a strategy. In an effort to save time, we’ll
combine two of the attributes together during our first round of editing. Accuracy and specificity
are going in first, while brevity will wait patiently at ringside for round two.
ACCURACY and SPECIFICITY
Ding! Round One. To make the bullet statement ACCURATE, you need to ensure the facts
are correct. In a real-world setting we would verify the facts by simply asking a few questions.
To simulate a realistic question and answer process that might occur in this situation, we’ll pose
a few obvious questions and also list some answers that would be reasonably collected.
   -   Were there truly 17 antenna elements repaired? Well, actually no ... not exactly.
       Seventeen elements were actually replaced, but an additional 23 were either sanded and
       painted or simply rescued.
   -   Four weeks of delivery time seems like a long time … why so much time to receive
       some antenna parts? The antenna elements come from only one vendor and the
       estimated delivery time is based on the relatively low priority of the work order.
In order to make the facts in the bullet statement as SPECIFIC as possible, follow the same
question and answer method we used to guarantee accuracy … that’s why we combined these
two steps together!! Let’s see what kind of information a few questions can scrape up.
   -   Exactly how many antennas (end items) in the system were fixed? The 40 antenna
       elements that were repaired or replaced were distributed among all 6 LP antennas in the
       system.
   -   Can we be more specific than $3500 about the estimated cost savings? Yes, the exact
       cost charged to the unit for purchasing the 17 replacement antenna elements would have
       been $3479.
   -   What would the $3500 be spent on (item names, quantity, etc.)? The estimated cost of
       $3500 was limited to varying sizes of antenna elements for an AN/GRA-4(V)4 Log
       Periodic Antenna System.
   -   Who does the Atlantic Gateway Antenna System service? The Atlantic Gateway
       connects Air Force and other DOD users from the eastern seaboard of the US to military
       personnel in Western Europe.
   -   How has the repair of the antennas improved service to their customers? Transmit
       and receive signal strength was improved; static and cross-talk was reduced.

Before we move on to the next round of editing, let’s work in some of the answers to our
questions into the bullet statement. You’ll notice that not every tidbit of information we found
could be added, but the items we did integrate contribute significantly to the message being sent.
Items added or altered are represented in bold print.
-   Restored 40 seriously corroded, broken, or missing elements on 6 AN/GRA-4 Log Periodic
    Antenna Systems in the Atlantic Gateway Antenna System within 3 days by using elements
    from decommissioned antenna parts
    -- Saved an estimated $3479 in procurement cost and 4 weeks of expected delivery time
    -- Sharply improved clarity of voice signal for operators in US and Europe
Ding! Ding! Ding! End of Round One. The added information enabled us to build an
additional impact element and sharpen the exacting details of the preexisting bullet. You may
have noticed that the bullet has grown in length again. Don’t sweat it! Because we are rested
and ready to get back in the ring and wear down that lengthy bullet! Time to employ the secret
weapon: brevity!
BREVITY
Ding! Round Two. Let’s apply what we know about brevity to knock this bullet out! Keep in
mind that keeping your editing for shorter words separate from your editing for a reduction of
words may be difficult. Therefore, give each bullet statement the old “one-two” and do both at
the same time! Changes made to improve one aspect often promote the other.
Since we cannot boldface words or sections that have been removed or reduced, we need another
way to indicate deletions, reductions, and occurrences of rephrasing. Carefully contrast the two
versions of the bullet statements to see how certain terms and sections were reduced and
consolidated.
BEFORE Editing for Brevity

Ding! Ding! Ding! End of Round Two and the Match. The winner and still undisputed
champion by KNOCK OUT! Yep, that’s you … way to go champ!
Well, I guess congratulations are in order! You’ve just successfully completed the process of
drafting effective accomplishment-impact bullet statements. Not as difficult as you made it out
to be, is it? With a little more practice, you can Extract the Facts, Build the Structure, and
Streamline the Final Product with less and less effort. Writing accomplishment-impact bullets
will become almost second nature to you. And the next time you’re hit with a bullet statement
tasking (who knows … maybe tomorrow), you’ll be prepared, fully armed and eager to climb
back into that ring. Good luck!

AWARD PACKAGE CHECKLIST
DÉCOR 6 CHECKLIST: The DÉCOR 6 is the computer form used to recommend a
decoration. Check to ensure it’s filled out completely (preferably typed, but can be neatly
handwritten).
_______Section 1A (NAME OF DECORATION), 1B (CLUSTER) and 1C (INCLUSIVE
DATES)
_______Section 1D and 1E—use a typewriter to X out the items not needed or line through with
a black pen.
_______SECTION 1F (PRESENTATION DATE DESIRED): Include date award is to be
presented or N/A if no date is needed. Dates are mandatory for retirements and separations.
_______1H (NEXT DUTY ASSIGNMENT OR FUTURE ADDRESS): This must be filled in if
the person is separating or retiring. Personnel will send it back if an address is not included.
_______SECTION 5. Make sure the duty title matches the title used in the citation. The date on
the citation cannot be before the DATE ARRIVED STATION. Must be one day or more after.
(See AFI 36-2803 for information about including more than one assignment in an
award/citation.)
_______SECTION 6 DECORATION HISTORY. This is the section where you will see the
different decorations a person has received. When a person receives their first AFAM, this will
be considered a basic award. When they receive a second AFAM, this will become their first
oak leaf cluster.
NOTE: If there is another decoration within the inclusive dates, ensure that a copy of the
certificate is provided with the package; this helps to ensure two awards are not given for the
same achievement.
_______BLOCK 8. Make sure the supervisor has marked through either the “I
RECOMMEND/DO NOT RECOMMEND” statement, as appropriate. Also be sure the
supervisor and the commander have signed the printout.

CITATION CHECKLIST: The citation is read at the ceremony and summarizes the
achievement or service for which the award is given.
Check the body of the citation
_______       Use 10- or 12-point font; borders should be top 1 to 1 1/2 inch, side 1 to 2 inch
and bottom 3 inches.
_______        Opening and closing statements should be in accordance with AFI 36-2803.
_______        Length of citation should not exceed guidelines in AFI 36-2803.
                       -- MSM and AFCM citations: 14 lines maximum
                       -- AFAM citations: 11 or 12 lines maximum
_______        Make sure the following information is not on separate lines:
                       -- Rank and name
                       -- Unit and organization
                       -- Date and month
_______        Do not include inclusive dates in the text portion of the citation
_______        Numbers 10 and above should be expressed in figures, and with exceptions,
numbers “zero” through “nine” should be expressed in words. If both categories of numbers are
used in the same related series, use figures for all. “Million” and “billion” should be spelled out
($20 million). Use numbers for organizations; they would not detract from the readability or the
professionalism of a decoration citation/certificate. The use of the dollar ($) and percent (%)
signs are authorized for use in decoration citations/certificates.
_______        No acronyms/symbols in body of citation. Rank should be spelled out the first
time and shortened thereafter (e.g., Technical Sergeant Brian S. Bowers will be used in the first
sentence. When referred to again, it should be “Sergeant Bowers.”)
Check to make sure these items on the citation match the Décor 6:
_______        Dates of accomplishment.
_______        Oak leaf clusters (OLC). Use parentheses around the OLC on the citation.
_______        Duty Title.
Is the signature block correct? Different medals are signed at different levels of command.
Senior commanders sign the higher level medals.
JUSTIFICATION/APPROVAL CHECKLIST:
______         Attach all OPR/EPRs that cover the inclusive dates.
______        For awards for specific achievement, if the period is too short to supply a report, a
letter or memorandum must be provided with descriptive justification.
______        Check with your organization to see if additional forms are required to staff an
award through the chain of command. (For example, Air Education and Training Command uses
AETC Form 114; check your unit for any specific requirements.)

                                     WIN WITH WORDSMANSHIP

  After years of hacking through etymological thickets at the US Public Health Service, Philip
  Broughton, a 69-year old official, created a surefire method to convert frustration into fulfillment
  (jargonwise). Euphemistically called the Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector, Broughton’s system
  employs a lexicon of 30 carefully chosen “buzzwords”:
          COLUMN 1                          COLUMN 2                         COLUMN 3
          0.   integrated                   0.   management                  0.   options
          1.   total                        1.   organizational              1.   flexibility
          2.   systematized                 2.   monitored                   2.   capability
          3.   parallel                     3.   reciprocal                  3.   mobility
          4.   functional                   4.   digital                     4.   programming
          5.   responsive                   5.   logistical                  5.   concept
          6.   optional                     6.   transitional                6.   time-phase
          7.   synchronized                 7.   incremental                 7.   projection
          8.   compatible                   8.   third-generation            8.   hardware
          9.   balanced                     9.   policy                      9.   contingency

  The procedure is simple. Think of any three-digit number, then select the corresponding
  buzzword from each column. For instance, numbers 2, 5, and 7 produce “systematized logistical
  projection,” a phrase that can be dropped into virtually any report with that ring of decisive,
  knowledgeable authority. “No one will have the remotest idea of what you’re talking about,”
  says Broughton, “but the important thing is they’re not about to admit it.”




                                            This is definitely a
                                             four eighty-five.

                                                  PUBLICATIONS




This section expands on the functions and formats for Air Force publications—doctrine
documents, policy directives, instructions, manuals, supplements, pamphlets, indexes,
directories, handbooks, catalogs, joint publications, and changes (page and message) to those
publications—as in the Air Force Instruction 33-360, Volume 1, Air Force Content Management
Program—Publications. There may be a time in your military career when you will put on your
action officer hat and write or develop an Air Force publication, form or Information
Management Tool (IMT), regardless of your command level.
Publications serve a vital purpose—they direct and explain the policies and procedures
governing Air Force functions. You, the action officer who writes these publications, are the
expert in the various functions; you are the specialist in the different kinds of work done in the
Air Force. When you write a publication, your role is to explain what work must be done and
how it must be done by the people who must do it. The action officer’s role is a demanding one.
Preparing a publication is, by itself, a complex process. Additionally, you have two important
responsibilities to meet.
•   To provide clear, accurate guidance that others understand and follow.
•   To get your guidance out quickly to those who need it.
These responsibilities are equally important, but at times will seem to conflict. A well-prepared
publication takes less time to publish and reach its users than a poorly prepared one. Always
take the time to prepare a well-written publication. To do this, you ...
• Plan carefully and become familiar with AFI 33-360, Volume 1, procedures to prepare, to
submit and to coordinate a publication.
Follow the Seven Steps to Effective Communication and concentrate on organizing material
logically, drafting a comprehensive outline, and writing clear and concise sentences.

GETTING STARTED...
1 GETTING ORGANIZED. For more information, go to page 56 without collecting $200
or contact your local publishing office for local procedures and guidance.
2 WRITING EFFECTIVELY. Use plain English with active voice; plain, concrete words;
correct verb tenses (see pages 98-99) and simple sentences in a formal tone and style.

3 EDITING PRACTICES.
   Avoid contractions (flip to page 310), and except and other qualifiers detailed on page 77.
   Use the Mechanics of Writing section for punctuation, abbreviation, capitalization and
    numbers.
   Use functional address symbols sparingly. If needed, spell out symbols with the
    abbreviation and include a complete mailing address. [Visual Information/Publishing

    the overall subject of all the sections
    within that chapter.                                    Use abbreviations and acronyms. If

                                                   BIOGRAPHY




A current biography can be a helpful personal and management tool. You may want to send
your biography to organizations you may be visiting or groups you may be speaking before. It
may be helpful to your organization for key personnel to maintain biographies so newcomers can
have a better understanding of the backgrounds of unit leadership. Your public affairs office
may use your biography to assist in preparation of articles for publication.
A biography gives the reader some insight into who you are, where you’ve been assigned and the
jobs you have handled. It should also include your education, awards, and if rated, flying hours
and the type of aircraft experience. Ideally, it would also include an official Air Force
photograph.
The Air Force electronically publishes official biographies for active-duty general officers,
senior-level civilian executives and the chief master sergeant of the Air Force. Air Force public
affairs prepare these biographies following the instructions found in AFI 35-101, Public Affairs
Policies and Procedures. See http://www.af.mil/lib/bio/index.html for examples.
Applying the procedures from the Air Force instruction, on pages 244-245 is an outline of the
parts of an Air Force biography. It is important to follow the recommended format so that there
is consistency of presentation, style, and length of information. A “corporate look” needs to be
maintained so readers are not confused going from one biography to another. Also, it makes for
ease of distribution whether the biography is printed, posted on a web site, or sent by e-mail.
(NOTE: Air Force general officers and the Senior Executive Service must follow the outline in
AFI 35-101 and the Associated Press style of news writing.)

No, the résumé is not an official Air Force communication, but it is included for two reasons: (1)
to help you when you are considered for a “special” assignment and need to give “someone” a
summary of your experience and qualifications, and (2) to help you when you start job searching
after your military or civil service career.
Getting interviewed for positions in which you are interested isn’t always easy, but a good
résumé can help. In many cases, your résumé is the first impression a potential employer has of
you. The way it is written and how it looks are a direct reflection of you and your
communication and organization ability. Your résumé must arouse the interest of a potential
employer enough to make him want to meet you from a stack of hundreds of applicant résumés
for a single job. Since no one is likely to interview a large number of applicants, “someone” will
scan the résumés (for about 20 seconds each), choose those that will be read further, and trash
the remainder. Therefore, your résumé has to make an impression quickly to make it pass the
hiring official.

FUNCTION AND FORMAT
In some cases, the format you use will depend upon why you need a résumé. Is it a “feeler” to
send to multiple companies? A response to a particular announcement? A specific request from
a person or company? Generally speaking, a format that works best for you is the right one.
      Chronological Résumé. An outline of your work experience and periods of employment
(in reverse chronological order—most recent information first) that shows steady employment.
Titles and organizations are emphasized as are duties and accomplishments. This format is used
most often by those with steady employment and/or who want to remain in a current career field.
It’s also excellent for those who have shown advancement within a specific career field. Detail a
10-year period and summarize earlier experience that is relevant to the position you are seeking.
     Functional Résumé. Emphasizes your qualifications (skills, knowledge, abilities,
achievements) as opposed to specific dates and places of employment, and allows you to group
them into functional areas such as training, sales, procurement, and accounting. List the
functional areas in the order of importance as related to the job objective and stress your
accomplishments within these functional areas. This format is used most often by people who
are reentering the work force or those who are seeking a career change.
     Combination Résumé. Combines the best of the chronological and functional résumés
because you can group relevant skills and abilities into functional areas and then provide your
work history, dates and places of employment, and education. This format allows you to cover a
wider variety of subjects and qualifications, thereby showing skills that are transferable from one
career to another. It works well for those “special” assignment requirements, for military retirees
(those who have frequently switched career fields), and is ideal for people whose career paths
have been somewhat erratic.
      Targeted Résumé. As the name implies, this format focuses on your skills, knowledge,
abilities, achievements, experience, and education that relate to the targeted position. It features
a series of bullet statements regarding your capabilities and achievements related to the targeted
job. Experience is listed to support statements, but it does not need to be emphasized. Education
is listed after achievements. This format is probably the easiest to write, but keep in mind it must
be completely reaccomplished for each position you are seeking.
      Federal Résumé. An outline for the Federal Government and private industry to apply for
Federal job searches. This résumé is commonly five pages by the time all your information is
included so it does not follow the “keep it to two pages max” rule. Once you submit your
résumé, there may be further forms to complete. When in doubt as to what to include, read your
announcement carefully. Still in doubt? Call and ask questions. Generally include this: Job
info: announcement number, title and grade of job for which you’re applying; personal info:
full name, address, day and evening phone numbers, social security account number, country or
citizenship, reinstatement eligibility, veteran’s preference, highest Federal civilian grade held;
education: high school and college name and address, type and year of degree, major; work
experience: job title, duties and accomplishments, employer’s address, supervisor’s name and
phone number, starting and ending dates, hours per week, salary; job related info: training (with
title, date), skills, certificates, honors, awards, accomplishments.

     Military Résumé. If you are applying for a competitive assignment, a résumé may be a
useful tool to summarize your qualifications for the position. You can use whatever format you
think showcases your abilities, but make sure you include the following:
   Security clearance and date of investigation. This is critical for some jobs—and in some
   cases, you’ll need a higher level clearance just to get in the building!
   Date of rank. This helps potential supervisors know how your seniority relates to the
   incumbents in the office … and helps them know when you’ll be up for promotion.
   Professional Military Education. Make sure you identify any schools completed while in
   residence and any distinguished graduate (DG) recognition.
   Service Status. Air Force Reserve or National Guard personnel should identify their service
   status.
   Availability. When will you be eligible for reassignment? Include this in the “Job
   Objective” section.
   Special Qualifications. As appropriate, identify any special workplace qualifications such
   as foreign language skills, Acquisition Profession Development Program (APDP)
   Certification or Joint Officer credentials.
   Flying Data. Even if the position is not a “flying job,” rated officers may want to include
   rated information.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER
Let’s march through the six-step checklist again to write your résumé.

1 ANALYZE PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE.           Your purpose … get a meeting with a potential
employer.
2 CONDUCT THE RESEARCH.         Know yourself: your needs and wants (type and level of the
position), what you can offer and what you can do for them. Now take time to list your skills
and accomplishments. And research the prospective company to learn about the job as well as to
“speak their language.”
3 SUPPORT YOUR IDEAS. Your “ideas” … the qualifications for the job. The “support” …
your knowledge, skills, abilities, experience and education that support those qualifications.
4 GET ORGANIZED.       Gather your documents: job descriptions, certificates, licenses,
transcripts. If you worked for DOD, “civilianize” those job titles and descriptions to those used
in the private sector … consult a Dictionary of Occupational Titles, published by the US
Department of Labor. Learning the company’s terminology could mean the difference between a
20-second scan and a “meeting.”
5 DRAFT AND EDIT.      Type your draft and edit, edit, edit for typos, extraneous information,
action words (see page 228), plain language (businesses typically write on an 8th grade level),
neatness, accuracy, and consistency in format. It must be long enough to cover relevant
information but brief enough not to bore a potential employer (two pages max). Use only key
phrases and words appropriate to the job you’re seeking. To help you develop your
accomplishment statements, review the advice on writing “accomplishment-impact” bullets on
pages 226-235.
6 FIGHT FOR FEEDBACK.        Have someone you trust read the résumé and suggest changes and
recommendations. Are all the t’s crossed and i’s dotted? Does it look professional? Visually
appealing? Is it easy to read with the strongest points quickly apparent? Is there good use of
spacing, margins, indentions, capitalization and underlining?

TO INCLUDE OR NOT TO INCLUDE
As a minimum, include the following on all résumés:
   Name, address, and phone number (including the area code) centered at the top of the first
   page.
   Job objective and/or summary statement.
   Qualifications and work experience relevant to the job you are seeking.
   Education and training (anything acquired during military service or through workshops,
   seminars, and continuing education classes relevant to the position you’re seeking).
The following are other topic areas to include but choose only those pertinent to the job you’re
seeking. CAUTION: More is not necessarily better. Keep your résumé to one page, if
possible, or two pages max.
   Special skills or capabilities                        Professional experience and
                                                         memberships
   Career accomplishments
                                                         Leadership activities
   Languages studied
                                                         Credentials, licenses
   Honors and awards
                                                         Papers, presentations, published works
   Military service
                                                         Security clearance
   E-mail address
The following information can sometimes be detrimental and takes up valuable space on a
résumé, so we recommend you don’t include it unless a potential employer specifically asks for
it.
   Personal data (age, marital status,                   Religious affiliation
   number and ages of children)                          Irrelevant information
   Photograph                                            Hobbies or personal interests
   Salary history or requirement                         References
   Reason for leaving a job and names of                 Months, days—use “years” only
   bosses
                                                         Specific security information

COVER MEMO
A cover letter is a personal communication written to a specific person in an organization. But
your same résumé can be sent to many potential employers. Write your cover memo so that the
person reading it will want to read the résumé you’ve attached. To help out here’s a checklist:

    Address the letter, if possible, to a person (use a title) with whom you wish to meet. Avoid
    Dear Sir, Gentlemen—clearly these are not gender-neutral terms.
    Use a positive tone and stress how your association with them will benefit you both. To
    sound genuine, research the organization and the position to learn all you can. Make it
    sound natural, relaxed, and not self-conscious. The letter needs action verbs, personal
    pronouns, life, conviction, humor, assurance, and confidence, ensuring you exclude
    irrelevant and negative information. Try saying “changing careers” or “looking for new
    challenges” instead of retired; and “single” instead of divorced.
    Limit it, to hold interest, to one page with about three paragraphs.
    Develop a strong first sentence to grab the reader’s attention and, when possible, use a name
    of a mutual contact.
    Devote the next paragraph to brief facts by highlighting your relevant experience, skills, and
    accomplishments that make you unique for the job. It needs to entice the reader to call you.
    Consider using “bullets” to create eye appeal. And place the most relevant information in
    the first (or top) position.
    Close with a bid for a brief meeting (don’t use interview) and write as though you expect it
    to occur. Indicate you will follow up with a call to arrange a time.
    Make it look professional—use the computer to make a good first impression! And edit,
    edit, edit!
    Use 8½- by 11-inch high-quality paper that is white or off-white.
    Maintain electronic file copies and borrow from past letters to save your brain power when
    submitting future letters!




               “Writing is an adventure. To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement. Then
               it becomes a mistress, then it becomes a master, then it becomes a
               tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to
               your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public.”

the job.

  Ms. Rena Mitchell
  Government Contracts Advisor
  Bowe and Burke International Corporation
  1472 South 303d Street
  Seattle, Washington 98003-1472

  Dear Ms. Mitchell,

  I recently read about Bowe and Burke in the Seattle Tribune. I talked to Nancy Herron today and she mentioned
  you need an additional staff person for your government contract work.

  I am interested in this position and believe you will find these particular aspects of my background relevant
  to this position:

  ● As project manager for a statewide fund-raising campaign, I recruited and supervised personnel, administered the
    budget, and oversaw the development of promotional materials.

  ● As manager of 300 volunteers for an organization, I handled diverse management functions—scheduled work,
    evaluated personnel, organized supply and equipment resources, and controlled cash receipts and other assets.

  ● I have extensive knowledge of your company’s computer software and have developed personnel and accounting
    programs to expedite management functions.

  ● My bachelor’s degree in business administration includes course work in personnel administration and accounting.

  Since I am difficult to reach, I will telephone you on Wednesday, July 17, to arrange for a meeting where I can learn
  more about your requirements and tell you more about my background as it relates to you. Thank you for your
  consideration and I look forward to being in touch.

                                                                               Sincerely,
                                                                               Mary Middleton
                                                                               MARY MIDDLETON

        Using a standard envelope format helps the Postal Service identify the correct delivery address
        the first time that the mail piece is processed on postal equipment. Optical character readers
        (OCR) can read a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters in addresses but prefers all
        uppercase characters. Even though OCR enhancements now allow effective reading of
        punctuation in addresses, it is still suggested that punctuation be omitted, when possible. For
        faster, more accurate processing, include in the delivery address the street designators (for
        example, BLVD, DR); directional designators (for example, NE, SW); the apartment, suite, or
        room number; and a ZIP+4 code. Do not use bold, italic, script, artistic, or other unusual
        typefaces. Handwritten or rubber stamps should not be used.

ADDRESSING THE ENVELOPE
When preparing communications for dispatch, remember to use the appropriate size envelope for
all correspondence. Use a rectangular envelope only slightly larger than the correspondence.
Envelopes should be no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches.
When using window envelopes, be sure to adjust the MEMORANDUM FOR element to align
the address with the envelope window. For consolidated mailing, the largest item that cannot be
folded determines the envelope size. Do not use envelopes with clasps, staples, string buttons, or
similar securing devices. Limit the thickness of any envelope to one-fourth inch or less when
sealed. Write “nonmachineable” above the address on any envelope if it is more than one-fourth
inch thick. There should be no printed or stamped markings of slogans or designs. This applies
to labels, post cards and self-mailers.
    Envelope Format. Use Courier New font 12 point (or similar simple sans serif font). Be
sure characters are not too close together and do not touch or overlap. Leave margins at least
0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope and at least 0.625-inch from the bottom of
the envelope. The last line of the address should be no lower than 0.625-inch and no higher than
2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope.
     Return Address Format. Place the return address in the upper left corner of the envelope.
Do not include names in return addresses. Type in uppercase with no punctuation except the
hyphen in the zip code. Use the complete mailing address. Type “OFFICIAL BUSINESS” at
least two line spaces below the return address. Rubber stamps may not be used in the return
address portion of the envelope.
    Delivery Address Format. Use block style with a left margin, parallel to the long edge of
the envelope. Single-space the address block and type the entire address in uppercase. Use one
or two spaces between words. Do not use punctuation in the last two lines of the address block
except for the dash in the ZIP+4 code. Address area limited to five lines.
      Optional Address Data Line. Use this line for any nonaddress data such as account
numbers, presort codes, or mail stop codes.
        Optional Attention (ATTN) Line. Use this line to direct mail to a specific person. It is
the first line of the address. If the letter is sensitive information or for recipient eyes only, type
“PERSONAL FOR MS JANE DOE” on this line.
       Organization Abbreviation/Office Symbol Line. Use the organization abbreviation
and office symbol separated by a virgule (/).
        Delivery Address Line. Used for the street or post office (PO) box number, and the
room or suite number. Use standard address abbreviations on page 313. Do not use punctuation
on this line. You can spell out or abbreviate portions of the street address, e.g., AVE or
AVENUE, STE or SUITE; both are acceptable. When addressing mail, do not use both the post
office box and the street address—pick one.
        City or Base, State, ZIP+4 Code Line. Use one or two spaces between words. Use the
two-letter state abbreviations. Do not use punctuation except for the dash in the ZIP+4 code.
With overseas addresses, do not use the APO or FPO number and geographical location together;
this will cause the mail to enter the international mail channels. Do not type below the last line

of the delivery address. Addresses are limited to five lines. Most printers today have the ability
to print barcodes. This added function can help route your letter.
POUCH MAIL
Used to consolidate mail going to the same location. Contact your local official mail manager or
base information transfer center for local pouch listing.
HOLEY JOE (STANDARD FORM 65-C)
Used to send mail within an organization or base. Address to the organizational designation and
office symbol. If more than one person falls under the office symbol, consider using an ATTN
line.
PARCELS
Labels should be placed on the top of the box or package. Any container used should be only
slightly larger than the mail being sent. Seal boxes and package with paper tape.

  This appendix covers:
      •   A glossary of common grammatical terms.
      •   An alphabetical list of punctuation guidelines.
      •   Rules on capitalization of words and symbols.
      •   Guidelines on using abbreviations and writing numbers in text.


This is not an all-inclusive style manual. It’s an Air Force quick-reference desktop guide to cure
your most common trouble spots and to encourage standardization and consistency within the
Air Force—especially during your professional military education. There are many style manuals
and writers’ guides available today and no two are exactly alike. Other commonly used style
guides are The Chicago Manual of Style, The Gregg Reference Manual, Air University Style
Guide for Writers and Editors, US Government Printing Office Style Manual, Writer’s Guide
and Index to English—not necessarily listed in order of preference. If your organization or
command has a “preferred” style of using capitals, abbreviations, numerals and compound
words, use it. If not, this guide is designed to serve that purpose.

                             AND WRITING TERMS




Grammar terminology is useful when we describe and correct problems with writing. Though
we’ve tried to de-emphasize terminology and teach through examples throughout this book,
sometimes you need a definition. We’ve tried to emphasize areas that are both commonly used
and commonly misunderstood, such as the use of modal auxiliaries like can, could, shall, should,
etc. Punctuation marks are not included in this list; they have a separate section in this
Appendix.




           “People who are experts in grammar don’t always write well, and many people
           who write well no longer think consciously about grammar … but when
           something goes wrong in a sentence, a knowledge of grammar helps in
           recognizing the problem and provides a language for discussing it.”
                                                              — H. Ramsey Fowler

a/an                   Use a before consonant sounds and an before vowel sounds <a
                       historical event, an emergency.>
Active Voice           Shows the subject as the actor. <The girl sang a song> (pages 73-74).
Adjective              Describes or limits a noun or pronoun. It answers “Which one? What
                       kind? or How many?” <blue box, short coat, gregarious man, four
                       stools>
Adverbs                Modifies or limits a verb, adjective or another adverb and answers
                       “When? Where? Why? How much? How far? To what degree?”
                       <quickly run, very dull, very loudly>
                       Conjunctive or Connective Adverb—transition words that often
                       appears to connect clauses. <however, therefore, etc.>
Antecedent             Noun, phrase or clause to which a pronoun refers or replaces. (pages 99-
                       100)
Appositive             Word, phrase or clause preceding or renaming a noun. <My dog
                       Maggie.>
Article                Small set of words used with nouns to limit or give definiteness to the
                       application. <a, an, the>
Bibliography           A list of books, articles and other works used in preparing a manuscript
                       or other written product. (See “The Mechanics of Research,” pages 345-
                       347.)
Bullets                Any punctuation symbol used to emphasize specific items. (See
                       “Display Dot” Punctuation Guidelines, pages 289-290.)
Case                   Forms that nouns and pronouns take when they fit into different
                       functions of the sentence. There are three:
                       Nominative—for subjects, predicate nominatives and appositives. <I>
                       Objective—for objects and their appositives. <me>
                       Possessive—to show ownership, hence adjectival, functions. <my>
Clause                 A group of related words containing a subject and a verb.
Conjunctions           Connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences (and, or, but, nor).
Consonants             All letters of the alphabet except the vowels a, e, i, o, and u. In some
                       words (synergy), the letter y acts as a vowel.
Glossary               An alphabetical list of unfamiliar terms and their definitions.
Interjection           Words used to express emotion or surprise (ah, alas, great, hooray, help,
                       etc.) Strong interjections are punctuated with an exclamation point.
                       (Wow! That’s profound.) Milder interjections are often set off by
                       commas, usually at the beginning of a sentence. <Oh, I guess it wasn’t.
                       Ouch, that hurts.>

                                           Glossary of Common Grammatical and Writing Terms


Modifier           Words or groups of words that limit or describe other words.
                   If improperly placed, modifiers can confuse the reader or suggest an
                   illogical relationship (see dangling and ambiguous modifiers, page 97).
Modal Auxiliary    Verbs that are used with a principal verb that are characteristically used
                   with a verb of predication and that in English differs formally from other
                   verbs in lacking -s or -ing forms.
      can          Primarily expresses ability; cannot is used to deny permission.
      could        Sometimes the past tense of can. <We could see the Big Dipper
                   last night.> Otherwise, could expresses possibility, doubt or something
                   dependent on unreal conditions. <We could see the Big Dipper if it
                   weren’t overcast.>
      may         Originally meant “have the power” (compare the noun might).
                  Now it means “permission.” Also, may is used to indicate possibility.
                  <You may leave if you are finished with your work.>
                  May is also used in wishes. <May you recover soon.>
      might       Sometimes functions as simple past tense of may. <He said he might
                  have time to talk to us.> Often it is used to express a more doubtful
                  possibility than may does. <He might returned before then.> Might is
                  also used after contrary-to-fact conditions. <If I were off today, I might
                  go fishing.>
      shall/      Shall expresses futurity in the first person;
      should      should does also, but it adds a slight coloring of doubt that the
                  action will take place. Notice the difference in meaning in these
                  sentences. <I shall be happy to call the VA Medical Center for you. I
                  should be happy to call the VA Medical Center for you.> In indirect
                  discourse should replaces the shall of direct discourse. <I shall call at
                  once. I said that I should call at once.> Many speakers who use shall in
                  the first person use would in preference to should. <I said I would call at
                  once.> Should is used to express likelihood. <Sue Sizemore should be
                  able to finish on time.> Should expresses obligation. <We should file
                  these orders more carefully.>

      will/       Will is the common future auxiliary used in the
      would       second and third persons. In addition it is used with special emphasis to
                  express determination. <You will finish by 4 p.m.> Would still indicates
                  past time in expressing determination. <You thought you would finish by
                  4 p.m.> Would expresses customary action in past time. <Our last
                  supervisor would bring us doughnuts every Friday morning.> Would
                  points to future time, but adding doubt or uncertainty. Notice the
                  difference in meaning. <I will if I can. I would if I could.> Would
                  replaces will in indirect discourse. <He said that he would call.>
      must        Expresses necessity or obligation. It is somewhat stronger than should.
                  <You must call the director’s office immediately.> Must also expresses
                  likelihood. <It must have rained last night.>

        ought          Originally the past tense of owe, but now it points to a present or future
                        time. Ought expresses necessity or obligation, but with less force. See
                        the difference. <We must go. We ought to go.> Ought is nearly the
                        equivalent of should.
        dare            Originally a modal only, it is now used primarily in negatives or
                        questions. <He dare not submit the report in that form. Dare we submit
                        the report like this?>
        need            Not originally a modal auxiliary, need is now used to mean have to.
                        <He need only fill out the top form. He need not get upset about the
                        delay.> In the meaning “lack,” need is always a regular verb. <He needs
                        a little help with this project.>

Equivalents of modals:
      be able to       Used instead of can or could to indicate the ability as a fact rather than a
                       mere potentiality. It is used also to avoid the ambiguity that may result
                       from using can to express permission. <He is able to support his
                       mother.>
        be to           Indicates future events but hints at uncertainty. <He is to have that
                        report to us tomorrow.>
        have to         Commonly substitutes for must. It is a stronger expression of necessity.
                        <You have to have that done.>
Other modals are used in speech, but they are inappropriate in writing.
                        had rather instead of would rather
                        had better instead of should or ought
                        (In speech, had better is emphatic in threats.)
                        have got to instead of have to
Modals are used with the infinitive of the perfect or progressive.
                        Can be going. Could have gone. Ought to be going.
                        Ought to have gone.
Nouns                   Names a person, place, thing, action or abstract idea. <woman, office,
                        pencil, game, Ohio, Maxwell AFB, democracy, freedom>
                        Abstract Noun—nouns that name qualities rather than material things.
                        <love, danger>
                        Collective Noun—nouns that are singular in form but plural in meaning;
                        names a group of persons or things. <audience, army, company, flock,
                        committee, trio>
                        Concrete Noun—nouns that can be seen or touched. <table, book>
                        Proper Noun—nouns that are capitalized and name specific persons,
                        places, or things. <Major Palmisano, Ohio, Air War College>
Number                  Shows the singular or plural of nouns, pronouns, or verbs.

                                          Glossary of Common Grammatical and Writing Terms


Object            Noun or pronoun that is affected by the verb. <The man read the
                  book.>

Parts of Speech   The basic building blocks of language: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs,
                  adjectives, prepositions, interjections, and conjunctions
Passive Voice     Shows the subject as receiver of the action. <A song was sung by her.>
Person            Pronouns that denote the speaker (first person; I, we), the person spoken
                  to (second person, you), or the person spoken of (third person; she, they).
Phrases           Groups of words without a subject or predicate that function as a unit
                  (adjective, adverbial, gerund, or infinitive phases).
Plagiarism        Using someone else’s writing as if it were your own. This serious
                  offense can lead to severe professional and legal consequences. If using
                  another person’s material, identify the borrowed passage and credit the
                  author. (See “The Mechanics of Research” page 342.)
Predicate         Tells what the subject does or what is done to the subject, or the state of
                  being the subject is in.
Preposition       Shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun to another word in
                  the sentence. <by, at, up, down, between, among, through>
Pronouns          Substitutes for a noun. Here are three:
                  Definite—includes I, you, he, she, it, we, they, and all of their forms.
                  Indefinite—includes words like someone, no one, each, anyone, and
                  anybody.
                  Relative—includes words like who, whom, which, that.
Sentence          Expresses one complete thought with one subject and one verb; either or
                  both may be compound.
                  Complex Sentence—contains one main clause and at least one
                  subordinate clause. <When it rains, it pours.>
                  Compound Sentence—contains two or more main clauses and no
                  subordinate clauses. <It rains, and it pours.>
Subject           Tells what the sentence is about; the person, place or thing that performs
                  the action or that has the state of being indicated by the verb.
Tense             Shows the time of the action, condition or state of being expressed. The
                  three tenses—past, present, future—can be expressed in the simple,
                  perfect, or progressive.
Verbals           Past and present participle forms of the verbs that act as nouns or
                  adjectives. There are three:
                  Gerund—ends in -ing and functions as a noun. <talking, singing>
                  Infinitive—simple verb form used as a noun, adjective, or adverb and
                  usually preceded by to. <to go, to type>

The Tongue and Quill


                       Participle—used as an adjective and acts as a modifier in present (-ing),
                       past (-ed, lost), and perfect (having lost) forms.
Verbs                  Expresses action or state of being of the sentence. There are six:
                       Transitive—transfers action from the subject to the object.
                       Intransitive—transfers no action and is followed by an adverb or
                       nothing.
                       Linking—acts as an equal sign connecting the subject and the
                       complement.
                       Auxiliary or Helping Verb—verb used with another verb to form voice
                       or perfect and progressive tenses. <We have eaten there before.>
                       Principal Verb—last verb in a verb phrase.
                       Irregular Verb—verbs (see below) that form past tense and past
                       participle differently:

                                                                          PAST
                       PRESENT                     PAST                   PARTICIPLE

Say what?! It’s a jumbled mess, but with some effort you could grasp the writer’s meaning. But
look how easy it is when the proper punctuation is used.
       Punctuation marks are a writer’s road signs. They signal stops, starts, and pauses.
       Capitalization also helps writers communicate their meaning to their readers.
Punctuation marks are aids writers use to clearly communicate with others. Improper
punctuation can confuse the reader or alter the meaning of a sentence. Excessive use of
punctuation can decrease reading speed and make your meaning difficult to determine.

OPEN AND CLOSED PUNCTUATION
Open and closed punctuation: general philosophy.
Though many grammar rules are relatively clear-cut, there are some gray areas where the experts
disagree. One area of debate is the issue of “open punctuation” versus “closed punctuation.”
Open punctuation advocates believe that writers should use only what’s necessary to prevent
misreading, while closed punctuation advocates are more apt to include punctuation whenever
the grammatical structure of the material justifies it.
The following sentence illustrates how different writers might punctuate a particular sentence.
       If used incorrectly they may alter an intended meaning, and if used excessively
       they can decrease reading speed and make your meaning difficult to determine.
       [Open punctuation—the meaning is clear without using all the punctuation
       that’s needed by the grammatical structure.]
       If used incorrectly, they may alter an intended meaning, and, if used excessively,
       they can decrease reading speed and make your meaning difficult to determine.
       [Closed punctuation—using all required punctuation does not make meaning
       clearer and may slow reading speed.]
In the Air Force, the general trend is to lean towards open punctuation in these types of cases. If
you’re confused about where to put commas, sometimes the best solution is to restructure the
sentence to make the meaning clearer and eliminate the need for extra punctuation:
       If used incorrectly, they may alter an intended meaning; if used excessively, they
       can decrease reading speed and cause confusion. [A slight change in sentence
       structure—fewer words to read and meaning is clear.]
Open and closed punctuation: punctuating terms in a series.
So far, so good—much of this sounds reasonable to most people. Unfortunately, there IS one
area where Air Force writers get conflicting guidance: the use of commas to separate three or
more parallel words, phrases, or clauses in a series. Here’s the rule and its two variants:
Use a comma to separate three or more parallel words, phrases, or clauses in a series.
           In closed punctuation, include the comma before the final and, or or nor.
                  Will you go by car, train, or plane?
                  You will not talk, nor do homework, nor sleep in my class.
           In open punctuation, exclude the comma before the final and, or, or nor.
                  Will you go by car, train or plane?
                  You will not talk, nor do homework nor sleep in my class.

                                                         Punctuation Guidelines: An Alphabetical Listing


Previous editions of The Tongue and Quill made a general recommendation to favor open
punctuation. This recommendation is unchanged, but we’d like to acknowledge three reasons
why closed punctuation guidelines might be used when punctuating three or more items in a
series:
1. Closed punctuation of series is specified in most commercial grammar guides.
2. Closed punctuation of series is specified in some other Air Force references, including
the Air University Style Guide.
3. The additional comma specified in closed punctuation may help clarify your meaning,
especially when the items in the series are longer phrases and clauses.
Check to see which approach is preferred for the writing product you’re working on.
Award packages, performance appraisals, military evaluations, and other space-
constrained formats typically use open punctuation. Research papers, academic
publications, and books use closed punctuation. Technically speaking, either approach is
acceptable, so consider your purpose and audience when deciding how to proceed.
Always remember that punctuation use is governed by its function: to help communicate
the writer’s meaning. Use the guidelines in the following section in the manner that best
allows you to communicate your message to your readers.

                               APOSTROPHE
USE AN APOSTROPHE…
                - to create possessive forms of certain words
                - to form contractions or to stand in for missing letters
                - to form plurals for certain letters and abbreviations
                - to mark a quote within a quote
                - in technical writing to indicate units of measurement
1. Use an apostrophe to create possessive forms of nouns and abbreviations used as nouns.
   a. Add ’s to singular or plural nouns that do not end with an s.
       officer’s rank                                  the oxen’s tails
       ROTC’s building                                 the children’s room
   b. Add ’s to singular nouns that end with an s.
       A business’s contract                           Mr. Jones’s family tree
       My boss’s schedule                              Marine Corps’s Ball
                                                       United States’s policy
NOTE: This rule applies to most singular proper nouns, including names that end with an s:
Burn’s poems, Marx’s theories, Jefferson Davis’s home, etc. This rule does not apply to ancient
proper names that end with an s, which take only an apostrophe: Jesus’ teaching, Moses’ law,
Isis’ temple, Aristophanes’ play, etc.
    c. Add only the apostrophe to plural nouns that end in s or with an s sound, or to
singular nouns ending with an s where adding an ’s would cause difficulty in
pronunciation.
       The two businesses’ contracts                   for righteousness’ sake
       Our bosses’ schedule                            Officers’ Wives Club; Officers’ Club
   d. Add ’s to the final word of compound nouns to show possession.
       secretary-treasurer’s report                    mother-in-law’s car; mothers-in-law’s cars
       attorney general’s book                         eyewitness’ comment

   e. To show possession for indefinite pronouns (someone, no one, each, anyone,
anybody, etc.), add ’s to last component of the pronoun.
       someone’s car                                   somebody else’s book




                                               – 276 –
                                                                                                           Punctuation


   f. To show joint possession for two or more nouns, add the apostrophe or ’s to the last
noun. Add only the apostrophe to plural nouns ending in s and ’s to singular nouns.
        girls and boys’ club                                     Diane and Wayne’s daughters LaDonna,
        aunt and uncle’s house                                      Leah, Lynn, and Lori are ...
   g. To show separate possession, place the possession indicators on each noun or
pronoun identifying a possessor.
        soldiers’ and sailors’ uniforms                          Mrs. Williams’s and Mr. Smith’s classes
        king’s and queen’s jewels                                son’s and daughter’s toys
NOTE: Do not use an apostrophe when forming possessive pronouns (ours, theirs, its, his, hers,
yours). One common mistake is using it’s instead of its. Only use it’s as a contraction of it is.
        Its paw was caught in the trap.                          It’s a bloody wound.
        Your savings account requires a minimum balance.         The reward was ours to keep.
NOTE: Don’t confuse a possessive form with a descriptive form.
        The Jones survey [a descriptive form: tells what survey you’re talking about]
        Jones’ survey [a possessive form: shows to whom the survey belongs]
2. Use an apostrophe to mark omissions or form contractions.
can’t (can not)                           the Roaring ’20s                        jack-o’-lantern
mustn’t (must not)                        I’ve (I have)                           you’ll (you will)
don’t (do not)                            won’t (will not)                        let’s (let us)
o’clock                                   it’s (it is)                            ne’er-do-well
I’m (I am)                                wouldn’t (would not)                    rock ’n’ roll

3. To form plurals of certain letters and abbreviations. Make all individual lowercase letters
plural by adding ’s and make individual capital letters plural by adding s alone unless confusion
would result. (For example, apostrophes are used with the plurals of A, I, and U because adding
an s forms the words As, Is, and Us.) To plural most abbreviations (upper and lowercase), add a
lowercase s. If the singular form contains an apostrophe, add s to form plural.
dotting the i’s               S’s, A’s, I’s, U’s             the three Rs                   ain’ts
OPRs, EPRs, TRs               bldgs (buildings)              B-52s                          ma’ams
1960s                         Bs, 1s                         six the’s                      mustn’ts
4. Use apostrophes as single quotation marks for a quote within a quote.
        “Let’s adopt this slogan: ‘Quality first.’”
5. Use an apostrophe in technical writing to indicate a unit of measurement (use the
accent mark if the symbol is available).
    a. As a length measure, use to specify the measurement of feet.
       The room measures 16’ by 29’.
    b. As an angle measure, use to specify the measure of minutes (60 minutes = 1 degree).
NOTE: Angles identifying geographical latitude and longitude are specified in minutes and
seconds (sixty seconds = 1 minute). When using the apostrophe or accent mark so specify
minutes, use the quotation ( ” ) or double accent mark specify the measure of seconds.
        The rendezvous coordinates are 35o 40’ 30” N x 60o 20’ 30” W.

                          ASTERISK
USE ASTERISKS …
1. To refer a reader to footnotes placed at the bottom of a page.* Two asterisks identify a
second footnote,** and three asterisks*** identify a third footnote. Number the footnotes if you
have more than three, unless in a literary document number if more than one.

2. To replace words that are considered unprintable.
        If the camera was present when Smith called Schultz a *****, tonight’s newscast
            would have had the longest bleep in TV history.

SPACING WHEN USING AN ASTERISK …
• No space before following a word or punctuation mark within sentence or at the end of
  a sentence—unless replacing unprintable words, then one space before.
• One space after following a word or punctuation mark within a sentence.
• Two spaces after following a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence—unless
  manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.
• No space after in a footnote.

NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.




  *Asterisk: A mark of punctuation to indicate a footnote. See “spacing.”
 **Use the asterisk with other punctuation as shown here.
***Number the footnotes if you have more than three—unless a literary document (see “spacing”).

                         BRACKETS
USE BRACKETS …
1. To clarify or correct material written by others.
       He arrived on the 1st [2d] of June.
       The statue [sic] was added to the book of statutes.
NOTE: The italicized word sic in brackets tells the reader something is wrong with the word
immediately in front of the first bracket but the word is reproduced exactly as it appeared in the
original.
2. To insert explanatory words, editorial remarks, or phrases independent of the sentence
or quoted material.
       “Tell them [the students] to report to Wood Auditorium now.”
       The tank-versus-tank battles of Villers-Brettoneux is the last significant event for the
          tank in World War I. [Other accounts of this battle give different versions.]
3. To indicate you’ve added special emphasis (underline, bold type, all capitals, italics) to
quoted material when the emphasis was not in the original work. The bracketed material
may be placed immediately following the emphasized word(s) or at the end of the quotation.
       “She [emphasis added] seemed willing to compromise, but his obstinate attitude prevailed.”
       “Tell them NOW to report to Wood Auditorium. [Emphasis added.]”
4. To enclose a parenthetical phrase that falls within a parenthetical phrase.
       (I believe everyone [including the men] will wear costumes.)
       I believe everyone (including the men) will wear costumes.
SPACING WHEN USING BRACKETS …
—opening
One space before when parenthetic matter is within a sentence.
Two spaces before when parenthetic matter follows a sentence (when parenthetic matter starts
with a capital and closes with its own sentence punctuation)—unless manuscript format and
using right justified, then one space before.
No space after.
—closing
No space before.
One space after when parenthetic matter is within a sentence.
Two spaces after when parenthetic matter is itself a complete sentence and another sentence
follows—unless manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.
No space after if another punctuation mark immediately follows.
NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

                         COLON
USE A COLON …
1. To separate an introductory statement from explanatory or summarizing material that
follows when there is no coordinating conjunction or transitional expression. (Capitalize the
first word of the expression that follows the colon if it is the dominant element and is a complete
sentence. For additional details, see the “Capitalization” section.)
       Living in base housing has many advantages: People can walk to work, shopping is convenient,
          and there are organized activities for the children.
       The board consists of three officials: a director, an executive director, and a recording secretary.
2. When a sentence contains an expression such as following or as follows or is followed by
a list or enumerated items. [Notice the capitalization and punctuation.]
       The new directive achieved the following results: better morale and improved relations.
       Results were as follows: better morale, less work, and more pay.

         1. You won’t have to be somewhere at 0800 every day.
         2. You can get more involved in community activities.
         3. You can pursue hobbies you haven’t had time for in the last year.
3. To indicate a full stop before an enumerated or explanatory list.
       There are several possibilities: (1) the position could remain vacant, (2) it could be converted to a
          military position, or (3) another civilian within the organization could be temporarily detailed
          to the position.
4. With a quotation when the word say or a substitute for say has been omitted, when the
introductory expression is an independent clause, and when the quotation is typed in
indented form on separate lines from the introductory clause.
       The general turned [and said]: “Who gave that order?”
       The judge restated her ruling [independent clause]: “The defendant will remain in the custody of
          the sheriff until the trial begins.”
       The speaker had this to say: “Please understand what I say here today represents my opinion
          alone. I am not here as a representative of the company for which I work.”
       The speaker said:
          The words you will hear from this stage today are the words and opinions of one
          man—me. I do not come as a representative of my company. I will not answer
          any question that is in any way related to the company for which I work.
5. To express periods of clock time in figures and to represent the word to in proportions.
Do not use a colon when expressing time on a 24-hour clock.

6. When expressing library references to separate title and subtitle, volume and page
number, city of publication and name of publisher in footnotes, and bibliographies.

DO NOT USE A COLON …
1. When the enumerated items complete the sentence that introduces them. [Notice
punctuation.]
       Liaison officers must
          a. become familiar with the situation,
          b. know the mission and

       people.
       [Not: Our goals are to:]
4. When the anticipatory expression is followed by
another sentence.
       The editorial assistants will bring the following items to eat.
       These food items will be heated and served at noon.
             Taco Bake

SPACING WHEN USING COLONS …
• No space before.
• Two spaces after within a sentence—unless manuscript
  format and using right justified, then one space after.
• No space before or after in expressions of time (8:20
  p.m.) or proportions (2:1).
NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the
end of a sentence. Rather to use one space or two is left up
to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

                          COMMA
USE A COMMA …
1. With the coordinating conjunctions and, but, or, or nor when joining two or more
independent clauses.
       Right:      The art of war is constantly developing, but twentieth-century technology has so
                   speeded up the change the military strategist now must run to keep pace.
       Wrong:      The rapid expansion of the Air Force ensures a continuing need for qualified college
                   graduates to fill existing vacancies, and also ensures ample opportunities for
                   advancement. [This example contains only one independent clause with a compound
                   verb; therefore, no comma is necessary.]
NOTE: No comma is needed if the sentence has one subject with a compound predicate
connected with a coordinating conjunction because the second half of the sentence is not an
independent clause.
       Martha Long received her master’s degree December 2003 and is now pursuing her career.
       I am not only willing to go but also ready to stay a week.
2. To separate three or more parallel words, phrases, or clauses in a series.
    In open punctuation, exclude the comma before the final and, or or nor.
       Will you go by car, train or plane? [open punctuation]
    In closed punctuation, include the comma before the final and, or, or nor.
       You will not talk, nor do homework, nor sleep in my class. [closed punctuation]
NOTE: For longer phrases and clauses in a series, the additional comma specified in
closed punctuation may help readability.
       Patients are classified as suitable for treatment at the installation, as requiring evacuation to the
          regional hospital, or as fit for duty.
NOTE: The use of etc. is discouraged in running text, but when used, it must be set off with
commas. Do not use etc. when using e.g., for example or such as. These terms indicate you are
only giving some examples; therefore, there is no need to imply there could be more.
       We will bake cookies, bread, cupcakes, etc., for the party.
3. With parallel adjectives that modify the same noun. If the adjectives are independent of
each other, if the order can be reversed or if and can stand between the words, the adjectives are
parallel and should be separated by a comma. However, if the first adjective modifies the idea
expressed by the combination of the second adjective and the noun, do not use a comma.
       a hard, cold winter; a long, hot summer [the summer was long and hot]
       a heavy winter overcoat [winter modifies overcoat; heavy modifies winter overcoat]
       a traditional political institution [political modifies institution; traditional modifies political institution]

4. To separate two or more complementary phrases that refer to a single word that follows.
       The coldest, if not the most severe, winter Ohio has had was in 1996.
5. To set off nonessential or ‘interrupting’ words and phrases.
    a. To set off nonessential words, clauses, or phrases not necessary for the meaning or
the structural completeness of the sentence. You can tell whether an expression is
nonessential or essential by trying to omit the expression. If you can omit the expression without
affecting the meaning or the structural completeness of the sentence, the expression is
nonessential and should be set off by commas. (For more examples, see page 284.)
       They want to hire Yuna Braswell, who has 10 years of experience, to run the new center. [The
          phrase “who has 10 years of experience” is nonessential information.]
       They want to hire someone who has at least 10 years of experience to run the center. [The phrase
          “who has at least 10 years of experience” is essential information.]
       There is, no doubt, a reasonable explanation. [This sentence would be complete without “no
          doubt.”]
       There is no doubt about her integrity. [This sentence would be incomplete without “no doubt.”]
NOTE: This rule includes interrupting words, phrases, or clauses that break the flow of the
sentence.
       The faculty and staff, military, and civilian, are invited.
       She is a lieutenant colonel, not a major, and will be our new executive officer.
       The major, a recent promotee, is an experienced pilot.
    b. With transitional words and phrases, such as however, that is (i.e.), namely,
therefore, for example (e.g.), moreover, consequently, and on the other hand, when
interrupting the flow of the sentence. A comma is normally used after these
expressions, but the punctuation preceding is dictated by the magnitude of the break in
continuity. However, when these words or phrases are used to emphasize meaning, do
not set off with punctuation.
       It is important, therefore, we leave immediately.
       It is therefore vitally important we don’t postpone the trip.
       A. Eaves is highly qualified for the job; i.e., he has 16 years of experience!
       Rebecca and Julie say they will attend—that is, if Robert and Lisa are attending.
       Planes from a number of bases (e.g., Andrews, Lackland, Tyndall) will participate in the flyover.
     c. To set off a phrase introduced by accompanied by, along with, and not, as well as,
besides, except, in addition to, including, plus, not even, rather than, such as, together with, or
a similar expression when it falls between the subject and the verb.
       The faculty and staff, as well as the students, should be prepared to testify before the panel.
       The fifth and sixth graders, plus their parents, will be transported by bus.
NOTE: When the phrase occurs elsewhere in the sentence, commas may be omitted if the
phrase is clearly related to the preceding words.
       We agree, Miss Johnson, our policy was badly processed as well as lost in the mail.

    d. With the adverb too (meaning also) when it falls between the subject and verb. Omit
the comma before too if it occurs at the end of a sentence or clause.
       You, too, can save money by shopping selectively.
       You should try to improve your typing too.
       If you want to bring the children too, we’ll have room.
    e. To set off nonessential appositives. An appositive is a word or phrase appearing next
to a noun that identifies it and is equivalent to it. If the appositive is nonessential, set it off
by commas. If essential or restrictive in nature, do not set it off by commas.
       Our cost analyst, Mrs. Sherri Thomas, will handle the details. [In this hypothetical example, we
          have only one cost analyst, so Mrs. Thomas is “nonessential.” If we eliminate her name, the
          meaning of the sentence would not change.]
       The battleship Pennsylvania was taken out of mothballs today. [Pennsylvania is “essential” to the
          sentence because there is more than one battleship in mothballs.]
       Their daughter Julie won the contest. The other daughters were really annoyed. [Since they have
          more than one daughter her name is essential to the sentence.]
       Edward shares a house with his wife Esther in Prattville, Alabama. [Strictly speaking, Esther
          should be set off by commas because he can have only one wife and giving her name is
          nonessential information; however, because the words wife and Esther are so closely related
          and usually spoken as a unit, commas may be omitted.]
   f. To set off the title, position, or organization after a person’s name or name
equivalent. (Some cases under this rule are appositives; other cases are not.)
       Lieutenant General Don Lamontagne, Commander of Air University, will speak at ACSC
           this Thursday.
       The Commander, 42d Air Base Wing, is responsible for ...

    g. To set off long phrases denoting a residence or business connection immediately
following a name.
       Lieutenant Colonel Fernando Ordoñez, of the Peruvian air force in Lima, Peru, will be here
          tomorrow.
       Lt Col Ordoñez of Lima, Peru, will be here tomorrow. [The comma is omitted before of to avoid
          too many breaks in a short phrase.]
6. To set off introductory elements.
    a. With introductory elements that begin a sentence and come before the subject and
verb of the main clause. The comma may be omitted if the introductory phrase is five words or
less except when numbers occur together. If you choose to use a comma following a short
introductory phrase, do so consistently throughout the document.
       In 1923, 834 cases of measles were reported in that city.
       In 1913 the concept of total war was unknown.
       Of all the desserts I love, my favorite is the fruit trifle.
       Since the school year had already begun, we delayed the curriculum change.
   b. After introductory words such as yes, no, or oh.
       Yes, I’ll do it.
       Oh, I see your point.
7. To set off explanatory dates, addresses and place names.
       The change of command, 1 October 1996, was the turning point.
       The British prime minister lives at 10 Downing Street, London, England.

NOTE: Use two commas to set off the name of a state, county, or country when it directly
follows the name of a city except when using a ZIP code. When including the ZIP code
following the name of the state, drop the comma between the two (see Envelope section), but use
one after the ZIP code number if there is additional text.
       We shipped it to 2221 Edgewood Road, Millbrook AL 36054-3644, but it hasn’t been
          received yet.
8. To set off statements such as he said, she replied, they answered, and she announced.
       She said, “Welcome to the Chamber of Commerce. May I help you?”
       She replied, “I have an appointment with Lt Col Rick Jenkins at 10 a.m.”
NOTE: If a quotation functions as an integral part of a sentence, commas are unnecessary.
       They even considered “No guts, no glory!” as their slogan.
9. To set off names and titles used in direct address.
       No, sir, I didn’t see her.
       Linda McBeth, you’re not changing jobs, are you?
       And that, dear friends, is why you’re all here.
10. With afterthoughts (words, phrases or clauses added to the end of a sentence).
       It isn’t too late to get tickets, is it? Send them as soon as possible, please.
NOTE: The word too does not require a comma if located at the end of a sentence—see Rule 5d.
11. In the following miscellaneous constructions:
    a. To indicate omission of words in repeating a construction.
       We had a tactical reserve; now, nothing. [The comma replaces we have.]
    b. Before for used as a conjunction.
       She didn’t go to the party, for she cannot stand smoke-filled rooms.
    c. To separate repeated words.
       That was a long, long time ago.
       Well, well, look who’s here.
    d. With titles following personal names. (Jr. and Sr. are set off by commas; 2d, 3d, II,
    and III are not.)
       Lee B. Walker, Sr.
       Henry Ford II
       William Price, Esq
       James Stokes 3d

commas.
       Certain subjects—American government, calculus and chemistry—are required courses.
8. Instead of parentheses when a nonessential item requires strong emphasis (dashes

10. With quotation marks. Place the dash outside the closing quotation mark when the
sentence breaks off after the quotation and inside the closing quotation mark to indicate the
speaker’s words have broken off abruptly.
       If I hear one more person say, “See what I’m saying!?”—

SPACING WHEN USING DASHES …
• No space before or after an em dash (—) or en dash (–) within a sentence.
• Two spaces after the em dash at the end of a sentence that breaks off abruptly (rule 10)—
  unless manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.

USE A DISPLAY DOT OR BULLET*…
To emphasize specific items in either complete or incomplete sentences that are parallel in
grammatical structure.
1. Use display dots when one item is not more important than the others, and the items do
not show a sequence. (If the items show a sequence, a numbered list is recommended.)
2. Capitalize the first word of each item in the list when a complete sentence
introduces them. (The complete sentence may end with either a period or a colon.)
    The prospect for growing drug abuse worldwide can be correlated with the prevalence
        of the following ingredients:

     After listening intently to the defense attorney’s closing remarks, the jury was convinced of
     three things:
         • Witnesses lied.
         • False evidence had been presented.
         • The defendant deserved a new trial.

     Two questions continually present themselves to commanders:
       • What is actually happening?
       • What (if anything) can I or should I do about it?




__________________________
*A “bullet” is a generic term for any graphical symbol used to emphasize different items in a list. Display dots,
squares, dashes, and arrows are the most common symbols used for this purpose, but today’s software makes any
number of designs possible. Regardless of your choice of bullet graphic, the above guidelines will help readability.

4. When the list completes a sentence begun in the introductory element, omit the final
period unless the items are separated by other punctuation.
   There is a tendency to speak of the commander, but there are, in fact, many interrelated
       commanders, and each commander uses a separate command and control process to
           • make information decisions about the situation,
           • make operational decisions about actions to be taken, and
           • cause them to be executed within a structure established by prior organizational
                 decisions.
5. A colon can be used to indicate a full stop before a list. A colon is often used with
expressions such as the following items or as follows.
       Consider the following advantages when making your decision:
         1. You won’t have to be somewhere at 0800 every day.
         2. You can get more involved in community activities.
         3. You can pursue hobbies you haven’t had time for in the last year.
6. Do not use a colon when the listed items complete the sentence that introduces them.
       Liaison officers must
          • become familiar with the situation,
          • know the mission, and
          • arrange for communications.                      [Not: Liaison officers must:]

SPACING WHEN USING DISPLAY DOTS AND BULLETS …
• No space before.
• Two spaces after—unless manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.
• Hang indent all remaining lines.

NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

                          ELLIPSIS
USE AN ELLIPSIS …
1. To indicate a pause or faltering speech within a quoted sentence or at the end of a
sentence that is deliberately incomplete.
        “I … I don’t know … I mean I don’t know if I can go.”
        Can you tell me what famous document begins with “Four score and seven …”?
2. To indicate an omission of a portion of quoted material.
        “Four score and … our … brought forth.…”
   a. Use four periods (ending period plus ellipsis) to indicate an omission at the end of a
sentence.
        Work measurement is the volume of work.…
NOTE: If quotation is intended to trail off, omit ending punctuation.
        He could have easily saved the situation by … But why talk about it.
    b. When a sentence ends with a question mark or exclamation point, use an ellipsis
(three periods) and the ending punctuation mark.
        What work measurement tool was used to determine…?
   c. To indicate one or more sentences or paragraphs are omitted between other
sentences, use the ellipsis immediately after the terminal punctuation of the preceding
sentence.
        In the last few years, we have witnessed a big change in the age groups of America’s violence.… How far
            and wide these changes extend, we are afraid to say.
    d. When a fragment of a sentence is quoted within another sentence, it isn’t necessary to
signify the omission of words before or after the fragment.
        Technicians tell us it “requires a steady stream of accurate and reliable reports” to keep the system
           operating at peak performance.

SPACING WITH PUNCTUATION MARKS …
•   No space between the three periods within the ellipsis itself.
•   One space before and after within a sentence.
•   No space before when an opening quotation mark precedes the ellipsis.
•   Two spaces after ellipsis with a period, question mark or exclamation point at the end of a
    sentence—unless manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.

NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

          Acquisition’ without checking with her first!”

SPACING WITH PUNCTUATION MARKS …

7. To form compound words and phrases. Some compound words are written as two words
(post office, air brake, Mother Nature, fellow traveler), some as one (manpower, masterpiece,
aircraft), some as a combination of words and joined by hyphens (father-in-law, great-uncle,
secretary-treasurer, governor-general, men-of-war, grant-in-aid, mother-of-pearl), and some
multiple-word compounds that include a preposition and a description (jack-of-all-trades, but
flash in a pan and master of none). There’s a growing trend to spell compound words as one
word once widely accepted and used. However, sometimes the way you use a compound word
or phrase will dictate how you write it—as one word, with a hyphen, or as two separate words.
When in doubt, consult an up-to-date dictionary or treat as two words if the guidelines on the
next pages don’t fit.
   a. Use a hyphen with words and phrases that are combined to form a unit modifier
immediately preceding the word modified (except with an adverb ending in ly). Do not
hyphenate these phrases when they follow the noun.
       an up-to-date report; this report is up to date; a $500-a-week salary; a salary of $500 a week
       decision-making process; the process of decision making; red-faced man; the man with the red face
       X-rated movies; movies that are X rated; the X-ray equipment; the X-ray showed
       a well-known author; the author is well known
       a first-come, first-served basis; on the basis of first come, first served
       a highly organized group; a completely balanced meal
  b. Use a hyphen when two or more proper names are combined to form a one-thought
modifier and when two adjectives are joined by the word and or or.
       Montgomery-Atlanta-Washington flight                 life-and-death situation
       black-and-white terms                                cause-and-effect hypothesis
       yes-or-no answer                                     go-no-go decision
   c. Use a hyphen when spelling the word solid creates a homonym.
       re-cover [cover again]; recover [to regain]         re-creation [create again]; recreation [play]
       re-count [count again]; recount [to detail]         pre-position [position again]; preposition
       re-create [create again]; recreate [refresh]           [word that forms a phrase]
       un-ionized [substance]; unionized [to organize]     re-mark [mark again]; remark [say]
       re-sign [sign again]; resign [quit]                 multi-ply [as in fabric]; multiply [arithmetic function]
       re-start [start again]; restart [to start anew]     co-op [cooperative]; coop [to confine]
       re-treat [treat again]; retreat [withdraw]
   d. Use a hyphen to avoid doubling a vowel when the last letter of the prefix “anti,”
“multi,” and “semi” is the same as the first letter of the word. Also, use a hyphen when the
second element is a capitalized word or a number.
       anti-inflammatory; anti-Nazi; antiaircraft           semi-icing; semi-Americanized; semiofficial
       multi-industry; multielement; multimillion           pre-1914, post-World War II; ultra-German
   e. Use a hyphen to join duplicate prefixes.
       re-redirect      sub-subcommittee            super-superlative

   k. In a unit modifier enclosed in quotation mark unless it is normally a hyphenated
term. Quotation marks are not to be used in lieu of a hyphen.

The Tongue and Quill




                        ITALICS
USE ITALICS …
1. In printed material to distinguish the titles of whole published works: books,
pamphlets, bulletins, periodicals, newspapers, plays, movies, symphonies, poems, operas,
essays, lectures, sermons, legal cases, and reports.
       The Chicago Manual of Style                                        The Phantom of the Opera
       AFM 33-326, Preparing Official Communications                      Star Trek
       The Montgomery Advertiser                                          United States Government v. Bill Gates


NOTE: When you use these titles in the plural, set the plural ending in Roman type.
       There were five Journals and two Times on the shelf.
2. In place of the underscore to distinguish or givbe greater prominence to certain words,
phrases, or sentences. Both the underscore and italics are acceptable, but not in the same
document. Use sparingly.
       Air Force doctrine has been the subject of much debate.
       Air Force doctrine has been the subject of much debate.
3. In printed material to distinguish the names of ships, submarines, aircraft, and spacecraft.
Italicize the name only, not initials or numbers preceding or following the name. (In typed
material, the underscore is generally used for this purpose.) Do not italicize the class or make of
ships, aircraft and spacecraft; and names of space programs.
       USS America               Nautilus                     B-1B Lancer                  Friendship 7
       frigate                   U-boat                       Concorde                     Columbia
       Spruance                  KILO                         Boeing 707                   Gemini II
4. In typed material to distinguish foreign words not part of the English language. Once an
expression has become part of the English language (in the dictionary), italics is unnecessary.
       blitzkrieg                Luftwaffe                    vis-à-vis                    com d´étet

5. When punctuation (except parentheses and brackets) marks immediately follow the
italicized word, letter character, or symbol.
       What is meant by random selection?                     Point: one-twelfth of a pica

                         PARENTHESES
USE PARENTHESES …
1. To enclose explanatory material (a single word, a phrase or an entire sentence) that is
independent of the main thought of the sentence.
       The ACSC students (542 of them) will begin classes the second week of June.
       The results (see figure 3) were surprising.
2. To set off nonessential elements when commas would be inappropriate or confusing and
dashes would be too emphatic.
       Mr. Henry Anderson, Jr., is the general manager of the Montgomery (Alabama) branch.
           [Parentheses are clearer than commas when a city-state expression is used as an adjective.]
       All the classes will meet three days a week (Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays). [Parentheses are
           used in place of commas because the nonessential element contains commas.]
       I suggest you contact Edward Clinton (a true professional) for his recommendation. [Parentheses
           used in place of dashes to de-emphasize the nonessential element.]
       Contact Ms. Louise Robinson—the manager of the house in Tuscaloosa—and ask her if a room is
           still available. [Dashes are used in place of parentheses for emphasis.]
3. To enclose enumerating letters or numerals within a sentence.
       Our goals are to (1) reduce the number of curriculum hours, (2) eliminate the 90-minute lunch period, and
          (3) reduce the number of personnel needed to accomplish the mission.
       Also, include the following when you file your medical costs: (a) hotel charges, (b) meal costs (including
          gratuities), and (c) transportation costs.
4. To enclose numbers or letters identifying certain sections of an outline. In outlining, if
you have a paragraph numbered 1, you must have a paragraph numbered 2; if you have a
subparagraph a, you must have a b subparagraph.
       1. xxxxx
          a. xxxxx
             (1) xxxxx
                 (a) xxxxx

5. To enclose a nickname or a descriptive expression when it falls between a person’s first
and last names. However, when it precedes or replaces a person’s first name, simply capitalize
it.
       George Herman (Babe) Ruth                            Stonewall Jackson
       Major William F. (Clark) Kent                        the Iron Duke

Punctuation



ALONG WITH OTHER PUNCTUATION …
6. If an item in parentheses falls within a sentence, place comma, semicolon, colon, or dash
outside (never before) the closing parenthesis.
       I’ll see you later (probably Friday), but remember to collect your money.
       I’ll attend the meeting (as I said I would); however, you’ll have to go to the next one as I have
            another commitment.
       She’s passionate about two important issues (and strives to support them): homeless children and
            a clean environment.
7. Use a period before a closing parenthesis only when the parenthetical sentence stands on
its own or when the closing parenthesis is preceded by an abbreviation containing
punctuation.
       The results were surprising. (See the analysis at atch 2.)
       Many heights of flowers (e.g., 6 in., 12 in., 36 in.) will be featured in the show.
8. Put a question mark or quotation mark before a closing parenthesis only when it applies
to the parenthetical item and the sentence ends in a different punctuation.
       The Pentagon (you’ve been there, haven’t you?) is a fascinating office building.
       Doris Williams said she would go. (In fact, her exact words were, “Go golfing? You bet! Every
          chance I get!”)
9. When using an exclamation mark or question mark to emphasize or draw attention to a
particular word within a sentence.
       You call this fresh(!) food.
       They said they will buy us four(?) machines.

SPACING WHEN USING PARENTHESES …
—opening
• One space before when parenthetic matter is within a sentence.
• No space before when using exclamation or question marks to emphasize or draw attention to
  a particular word within a sentence.
• Two spaces before when parenthetic matter follows a sentence (when parenthetic matter starts
  with a capital and closes with its own sentence punctuation)—unless manuscript format and
  using right justified, then one space before.
• No space after.
—closing
• No space before.
• One space after when parenthetic matter is within a sentence.
• Two spaces after when parenthetic matter is itself a complete sentence and another sentence
  follows—unless manuscript format and using right justified, then one space after.
• No space after if another punctuation mark immediately follows.

NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

4. To form ellipses (three periods that indicate a pause or faltering speech within a
sentence, or an omission of a portion of quoted material). (See Ellipsis on page 291.)
5. In vertical lists and outlines.
   a. Use a period after each item in a vertical list when at least one of the items is a
complete sentence. When the list completes a sentence begun in the introductory element,
omit the final period unless the items are separated by other punctuation.
       After listening intently to the defense attorney’s closing remarks, the jury was convinced of three things:

          parentheses because sentences require a period at the end.]
       Are tickets still available (and can I get two), or is it too late? [Question mark is omitted within
          parentheses because sentence ends with a question mark.]
6. A question mark is placed inside the closing quotation mark only when it applies to the
quoted material or when the same punctuation is required for both the quotation and the
sentence as a whole.
       She asked, “Did you enjoy the trip?” [Question mark belongs with quoted material.]
       Why did he ask, “When does it start?” [Question mark is same as ending punctuation.]
       Did you say, “I’ll help out”? [Quoted material is not a question; therefore, question mark applies
          to the sentence as a whole.]
7. When a question within a sentence is set off by dashes, place the question mark before
the closing dash.

                         QUOTATION MARKS
USE QUOTATION MARKS …
1. To enclose the exact words of a speaker or writer. With few exceptions, a quotation must
be copied exactly as it appears in the original. If the quotation is woven into the flow of the
sentence, do not use punctuation preceding the opening quotation mark. When words interrupt a
quotation, close and reopen the quotation.

       “A pint of sweat” says General George S. Patton, “will save a gallon of blood.”
NOTE: Do not set off indirect quotations.
       Why does she insist on saying that it just won’t work?
2. To enclose slogans or mottoes, but not signs or notices.
       He had a “do or die” attitude.                        He has a No Smoking sign in his car.
       “All’s well that ends well” is a popular slogan.      There is a Gone Fishing notice on his door.


3. To enclose words or phrases used to indicate humor, slang, irony, or poor grammar.
       They serve “fresh” seafood all right—fresh from the freezer!
       For whatever reason, she just “ain’t talkin’.”
NOTE: When using quotation marks with other punctuation, the comma and period are always
placed inside the closing quotation marks; the semicolon is always placed outside the closing
quotation marks; the dash, exclamation mark, and question mark are placed according to the
structure of the sentence (see guidelines on pages 288, 292, and 303).
4. With words and phrases that are introduced by such expressions as cited as, classified,
designated, entitled, labeled, marked, named, signed, the term, the word when the exact
message is quoted. Capitalize the first word when it begins a sentence, when it was capitalized
in the original, when it represents a complete sentence, or when it is a proper noun.

       The article was entitled “How to Write English That is Alive.”

       Our organization received an “Outstanding” Quality Air Force Assessment (QAFA) rating.
NOTE: Do not enclose these expressions: called, known as, so-called, etc.

SPACING WHEN USING QUOTATION MARKS…
—opening
• Two spaces before when quoted matter starts a new sentence or follows a colon—unless
  manuscript format and using right justified, then one space before.
• No space before when a dash or an opening parenthesis precedes.
• One space before in all other cases.
• No space after.
—closing
• No space before.
• Two spaces after when quoted matter ends the sentence—unless manuscript format and using
  right justified, then one space after (see page 302, spacing).
• No space after when another punctuation mark immediately follows (semicolon, colon).
• One space after in all other cases.

NOTE: The Tongue and Quill favors two spaces after the end of a sentence. Rather to use one
space or two is left up to the individual or organization. Either way is acceptable.

                         SEMICOLON
USE A SEMICOLON …
1. To separate independent clauses not connected by a coordinating conjunction (and, but,
for, or, nor, and so), and in statements too closely related in meaning to be written as
separate sentences.
       The students were ready; it was time to go.
       It’s true in peace; it’s true in war.
       War is destructive; peace, constructive.
2. Before transitional words and phrases (accordingly, as a result, besides, consequently, for
example, furthermore, hence, however, moreover, namely, nevertheless, on the contrary,
otherwise, that is, then, therefore, thus, and yet) when connecting two complete but related
thoughts and a coordinating conjunction is not used. Follow these words and phrases with a
comma. Do not use a comma after hence, then, thus, so and yet unless a pause is needed.
       Our expenses have increased; however, we haven’t raised our prices.
       Our expenses have increased, however, and we haven’t raised our prices.
       The decision has been made; therefore, there’s no point in discussing it further.
       The decision has been made so there’s no point in discussing it.
       The general had heard the briefing before; thus, he chose not to attend.
       Let’s wait until next month; then we can get better result figures.
3. To separate items in a series that contain commas (when confusion would otherwise
result).
       If you want your writing to be worthwhile, organize it; if you want it to be easy to read, use simple
           words and phrases; and, if you want it to be interesting, vary your sentence and paragraph
           lengths.
       Those who attended the meeting were Colonels Jim Forsyth, Dean of Education; Michael Harris,
          Dean of Distance Learning; Mark Zimmerman, Chairman of Leadership and Communications
          Studies; and Phil Tripper, Chairman of Joint Warfare Studies.
4. To precede words or abbreviations that introduce a summary or explanation of what
has gone before in the sentence.
       We visited several countries on that trip; i.e., England, Ireland, France, Germany, and Finland.
       There are many things you must arrange before leaving on vacation; for example, mail pickup, pet

                                                          ABCs




 ə-,bre-ve-’a-shən
A shortened form of a written word or phrase used in
place of the whole.
                     — Webster’s Tenth New
                       Collegiate Dictionary




What’s the appropriate abbreviation? Can I abbreviate in this document? How do I write it—all
capital letters, all lowercase letters, or caps and lowercase letters? Can I use just the abbreviation
or must I spell it out? How do I make it plural—add an s, or an ’s? Where do I go for answers?
Though these questions are insignificant when compared with some Air Force problems,
thousands of people confront these issues on a daily basis. To clear the smoke surrounding the
use of abbreviations, we’ve listed some types of abbreviations used in Air Force writing and
some general guidelines regarding their proper use.

ACRONYMS:         Pronounceable words formed by combining initial letter(s) of the words that
make up the complete form. Most acronyms are written in all caps without punctuation, but
some are so commonly used they are now considered words in their own right.
        AAFES (Army and Air Force Exchange Service)
        NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
        POW (prisoner of war)
        laser (light amplification by simulated emission of radiation)
        Modem (modular/demodulator)
        SALT (strategic arms limitation talks)
        scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus)
        ZIP code (Zone Improvement Plan code)

BREVITY CODES:             Combinations of letters—pronounced letter by letter—designed to
shorten a phrase, sentence or group of sentences.

        DOD (Department of Defense)
        PCS (permanent change of station)
        TDY (temporary duty)
        CNN (Cable Network News)
NOTE: When brevity codes begin with b, c, d, g, j, k, p, q, t, u, v, w, y, or z, the indefinite article
a is used. With a, e, f, h, i, l, m, n, o, r, s, or x, use an.


CONTRACTIONS:               Shortened forms of words in which an apostrophe indicates the
deletion of letters.

        don’t (do not)                                         mustn’t (must not)
        I’ll (I will)                                          they’re (they are)
        I’m (I am)                                             we’re (we are)

        it’s (it is)                                           you’ve (you have)

ABBREVIATIONS IN GENERAL:
•   Use in informal documents, manuals, reference books, business and legal documents,
    scholarly footnotes, etc., when needed to save space. Avoid using in formal documents when
    style, elegance and formality are important.
•   In formal writing “United States” is a noun (The United States and Canada were founding
    …); “US” is an adjective (US policy regarding …).
•   Use sparingly, correctly and consistently.
•   Spell out the word (or words) the first time used and enough times within the document to
    remind readers of its meaning.
•   Use a figure to express the quantity in a unit of measure (without a hyphen in a unit modifier)
    when using an abbreviation. [3 mi, 55 mph, 50 lb, 33 mm film]
•   Write abbreviations “first,” “second,” “third,” “fourth,” etc., as 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, etc.
•   Use when there’s a choice between using an abbreviation and a contraction. [gov vs gov’t]
•   Use the shortest form that doesn’t jeopardize clarity when there’s more than one way to
    abbreviate a word or phrase. [con, cont, contd]
•   Avoid beginning a sentence with an abbreviation (except Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr.), acronyms and
    brevity codes.
•   Avoid using in main headings.
•   Avoid using words that are offensive, profane or repulsive when assigning acronyms, brevity
    codes and contractions.
•   Write without punctuation unless confusion would result. [The abbreviation for inch (in.)
    might be confused with the word in, the abbreviation for number (no.) might be confused
    with the word no, etc.]
•   Write abbreviations for single words in lowercase letters. [hospital - hosp;
    letter - ltr]
•   Use the same abbreviation for singular and plural forms after spelling it out. [area of
    responsibility (AOR) - areas of responsibility (AOR)]
•   When ambiguity could result, form the plural with a lowercase s and never use an apostrophe
    to form the plural. [letters - ltrs; travel requests - TRs; area of operations - AO; areas of
    operations - AOs]
•   Do not cap the words just because the acronym or brevity code is capped. Check a source
    book, the library or the office of responsibility for the correct form. [OJT - on the job
    training; OPSEC - operations security; JIPC - joint imagery production complex; JCS - Joint
    Chiefs of Staff]
•   Contact the office of primary responsibility for its proper use when writing articles, manuals,
    handouts, instructions, performance reports, award citations and narratives, and unit histories.
•   Find out if your organization has a preference and use it. Otherwise, consult the latest
    dictionary or use the Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military
    and Associated Terms, for terms and definitions.
•   Use the “/” (slash) when punctuating some abbreviations. [with – w/ or without – w/o;
    input/output – I/O]
•   SPELL IT OUT if there’s still doubt!

                                           CAPITALIZATION
                                               GUIDELINES




Air Force writers and reviewers spend an excessive amount of time trying to determine the
appropriate use of capital letters (and abbreviations and numbers, as well). Everybody seems to
want it a different way. Authoritative sources don’t even agree! Put a half dozen style manuals
in front of you and compare the rules—two out of the six might agree in some cases.
The reason for using capital letters is to give distinction or add importance to certain words
or phrases. “But,” you might say, “I thought it was important and should be capitalized, but the
Command Section kicked it back to be changed to lowercase letters.” It’s unfortunate, but, if
someone else is signing the document, that person has the last word. The best advice we can
give you is to find out what style your organization prefers and use it consistently.
Although we can’t possibly cover every situation, what follows is designed to provide some
measure of consistency within the Air Force. You must ensure consistency within everything
you write or type. A word of caution: When you’re preparing Air Force publications,
performance reports, forms/IMTs, awards, or other unique packages, consult the appropriate
manuals or the office of primary responsibility to determine their unique requirements; e.g., Joint
Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms.

     There are several drawbacks to this: First, it ties up our capital for three years. Second, the likelihood
     of a great return on our investment is questionable.

     I must countersign all cash advances, with one exception: when the amount is less than $50.

It is impossible to establish an entirely consistent set of rules governing the use of numbers—
we’ve tried! When expressing numbers, keep in mind the significant difference in the
appearance of numbers. Figures will grab your attention immediately because they stand out
more clearly from the surrounding words, while numbers expressed in words are unemphatic and
look like the rest of the words in the sentence. Figures emphasize; words de-emphasize.
The following guidelines cover the preferred Air Force style of expressing numbers. Remember,
however, that personal and organizational preference, and appearance may override these
guidelines. If your organization has a preferred style—use it. If not, read on.…
•   In general, numbers 10 and above should be expressed in figures, and numbers one through
    nine should be expressed in words.
•   In scientific and statistical material, all numbers are expressed in figures.
•   In high-level executive correspondence and nontechnical, formal, or literary
    manuscripts, citation, decoration, memo to the general, textbook, and articles, spell out
    all numbers through one hundred and all round numbers that can be expressed in two words
    (one hundred, five thousand, forty-five hundred). All other numbers are written in figures
    (514). Turn to the next few pages and research the ones with checks (√) to know which to
    spell out in this style. It is appropriate, though, to use numbers in tables, charts, and
    statistical material.

2. When a sentence contains numbers used in a related series and any number in the series
is 10 or more, express all numbers in the series in figures (except the first word of the
sentence if it is a number). √ When a number is always a figure, it doesn’t change the other
numbers to figures in the same sentence.

NOTE: Refer to AFMAN 33-326 for proper address elements, and keep in mind when you
abbreviate the organizational name (CSG, TFW, AD, AF, etc.) do not use st, d, or th with the
number.
  b. Army units. Use figures to designate all army units except corps and numbered armies.
Use Roman numerals for corps and spell out numbered armies.
       2d Army Group                                        First Army

       temperature in the 80s                               two F-16s at the base
NOTE: To plural a number that is used as part of a noun, place the s on the noun and not the
number: DD Forms 282; but “file the 282s.”

correspondence.
       I need nine copies of this article.
       At the conference, we got over 11 comments to start a new ...
6. Spell out numbers that introduce sentences. A spelled out number should not be repeated

7. Related numbers appearing at the beginning of a sentence, separated by no more than
three words, are treated alike.

       We mailed 50 invitations and only received 5 RSVPs.
8. Spell out numbers in formal writing and numbers used in proper names and titles along

       a woman in her fifties                                approximately six thousand soldiers
12. For typographic appearance and easy grasp of large numbers beginning with million,
use words to indicate the amount rather than 0s (unless used with a related number).

       $2.7 trillion                                         $300,000 (not $300 thousand)
13. Form the plurals of spelled-out numbers as you would the plurals of other nouns—by
adding s, es or changing the y to i and adding es.
       ones                                                  twenties

STRIKE A BLOW FOR FREEDOM!!
Are all these rules making you numb? Why don’t we put some sense in this silly nonsense and
take it upon ourselves as rational men and women to make our own rule that will let us win at
this numbers game. How about …


           “Always express numbers as figures unless the number starts the sentence,
           or unless the use of figures would confuse the reader … or would look weird.”

The simplicity of it is downright ingenious. Think how many pages out of the inconsistent
grammar books we could eliminate. Save a forest! Be a leader!

ROMAN NUMERALS
Roman numerals are used most frequently to identify the major sections of an outline. They’re
also used (in lowercase form and in italics—i, ii, iii) to number pages in the front sections of
books. The following table shows Roman numerals for some Arabic figures.
A dash above a letter tells you to multiply by 1,000.

Other combinations of Roman numerals are derived by prefixing or annexing letters. Prefixing a
letter is equivalent to subtracting the value of that letter, while annexing is equivalent to adding
the value.

      64 is L plus X plus IV: LXIV

       •    Getting started: planning your research schedule
       •    Defining the research problem and stating the research question.
       •    Reviewing the related literature.
       •    Research citations, quotations, and paraphrases
       •    Research methodology: qualitative and quantitative methods



Research is a structured and systematic way to create knowledge. Research searches for facts
with a purpose in mind. Kuhn said research is like solving a puzzle: you have to follow specific
rules, and the challenge of putting the puzzle together to get a complete picture is what usually
motivates the researcher.1 This appendix provides a summary of research issues Air Force
members may encounter either during their assignments or during their professional military
education. It also provides samples of citation formats used in research papers, including
endnotes, footnotes, and textnotes.

GETTING STARTED: PLANNING YOUR RESEARCH SCHEDULE
                  “Don’t put off for tomorrow what you can do today, because if you
                  enjoy it today you can do it again tomorrow.”
                                                            – James A. Michener
At first research may seem like a tedious and complex process. Actually though, some
researchers find that once they begin to pursue a research question they are interested in, they
really begin to enjoy the process. Do not let the idea of writing a huge paper keep you from
getting started. As Henry Ford said “Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small
jobs.”
Here are some tips on getting yourself going:
•  Don’t wait to get started until you can set aside two or three entire days to do your research.
This is one task you want to do in a few sittings and not all at once. If you keep waiting for the
“perfect” time to get started, you may never get anything done at all.
•  Create an overall plan for what you want to accomplish and when you want to have each step
done. For example, here is a proposed research process broken down into manageable chunks:
                        Task                           Desired Date               Actual Date
    Topic selected
    Research question written
    Methodology selected
    Sources and data gathered
    Sources read and data analyzed
    Outline created
    Expand outline to draft all topic sentences
    First draft written
    Second draft written
    Final draft written to include front matter
    (abstract, preface) and back matter
    (endnotes, bibliography)
    Seek publication if appropriate

Back up your milestones from whatever due dates you are given to allow for a little “slop” time
and then reward yourself for any deadlines you meet. (Bribery does work—even if you are
bribing yourself.)
•   Not all tasks associated with research need to be done in the quiet of a library with an 8-hour
stretch of time. Break your research-related tasks down into chunks and work them in when and
where you can. For example, you don’t necessarily need to devote an entire day to reading
articles. Instead you can carry a few with you to read when you get stuck waiting somewhere.

•   If your research involves a survey or an experiment that requires the collection of data
involving people, be sure that you get proper approval before you get started. This can take up a
bit of time, so the earlier you do this the better.

SELECTING A RESEARCHABLE PROBLEM
Research starts with the selection of the problem. This can be harder than it sounds because not
every problem may be researchable. For some problems it can be impossible to collect the data
to support it. On the other hand, it’s easy to become lost in data that is easy to collect and lose
sight of the original question. Carr listed three laws to help define researchable problems:
1. The problem should be clearly formulated in a single
                                                               What is NOT an appropriate
sentence of 25 words or less. (Otherwise you could find
                                                               research question?

irrelevant tangents.)                                          1. A ruse for achieving self-

2. You should be able to collect useful empirical data
with observable and accessible criteria. Wherever              2. Problems where the sole purpose

3. You should be able to directly, or indirectly, observe      between two sets of data merely to
the events you plan to collect data about.2                    show a relationship between them.

discussed how your subject should, “when clearly
presented in a prescribed amount of space, leave no
questions unanswered within the presentation, even though many questions could be asked
outside it.”3 Though this can be difficult, following these rules will prevent serious problems
later on in the research process. Ideally, the problem you select to research will be one that you
are interested in. The longer the research paper you will be writing, the more important this is.
If you are writing a 5-page paper you can usually slog through almost any topic, but if this is
your doctorate dissertation it better be something you feel passionate enough about to attack
daily for a year or more.

STATING THE RESEARCH QUESTION
Once the problem has been decided, the next step is to articulate it concisely and clearly in a
research question.
1. Name your topic: I am studying …
2. Imply your question: Because I want to find out/show you who/how/why …




                                              – 339 –

3. State the rationale for the question and the project: In order to understand/explain
how/why/what …
Once you have your focus narrowed, and you know just what you want to study, it is time to
begin the hunt for what others have written on the same, or similar, subjects.
REVIEWING AND CITING THE RELATED LITERATURE
“Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.”

                            Once you have your research question solidified, start your literature

       Endnote              research. Also, check the date of their study. If it was quite some

       •   It can inform you about other researchers whom you may wish to contact….
       •   It can show you how others have handled methodological and design issues….
       •   It can reveal sources of data….
       •   It can introduce you to measurement tools other researchers have developed….
       •   It can reveal methods of dealing with problem situations….
       •   It can help you interpret and make sense of your findings….4
One major way to save time is to record all your source data properly from the start. There
are several ways to gather your data as you review the related literature. You can use old-
fashioned pen, ink, and note cards. You could take a laptop along and type your notes right in.
Or you can purchase or photocopy everything. Note cards are convenient in that you can arrange
your thoughts in order as you get ready to write. You can also do the same thing with computer
notes by printing out your notes, cutting them into strips and then arranging them as you see fit.
Just make sure that each line, or paragraph, has a source and page number before you start to cut
up your notes pages. One big benefit of typing your notes on a computer is that you can copy
and paste quotes right from your notes to your paper. If you can afford it, purchasing or
photocopying your sources can be useful. This is especially true if you plan to do further
research on the same topic. Being able to refer back to the original source for more information
can be very helpful.

CITATIONS
In the staff environment, we frequently reuse previously prepared data to save time and avoid
“reinventing the wheel,” but we rarely need to cite the source of such data. In the academic
world, however, reusing another’s work without giving that person credit and deliberately trying
to pass it off as your own, is plagiarism and can get you into a heap of trouble.
When and where do you document sources? The rule is simple: If the ideas and information
in what you’ve written are not “common knowledge” or do not represent your own work,
you must document where and from whom the “borrowed” ideas and information came.
As a writer, when you quote an authority word for word, paraphrase someone’s thoughts or use
someone’s ideas, model, diagram, research results, etc., you need to do so at that point in the
text. This is referred to as citation. Citation refers to one of several types of systems writers use
to document their sources. The signals for citation may be footnotes, in-line notes or endnotes.
Whatever the system, the purpose is to flag material for which the writer is indebted and to
identify the source. The sum of all citations in a paper, together with the bibliography, is the
documentation system of the paper. Citation, if done properly, fulfills a writer’s responsibility
for maintaining academic integrity. So, to keep yourself out of a literary (and perhaps legal)
jam—give credit where credit is due and cite those sources!
Each community has its own standards for citations. This section relies very heavily on the Air
University Style Guide for Writers and Editors, which can be accessed at

QUOTATIONS
A quotation (also called a direct quotation) occurs when a writer is indebted to a source not only
for the source’s ideas or facts but also for the wording of those ideas. When you are using a
portion of a source word-for-word you must indicate so by using either quotation marks or a
block quote. For shorter quotations, keep them in the text and simply enclose the words you are
using from another source in double quotation
marks (see the example below). Different style-               Plagiarism—HOW TO AVOID IT

quotation.) If you are using quite a bit from a copyrighted work, you need to get written
permission from the copyright holder. The Air University Style Guide also offers the following
advice on direct quotations: (note that the quote below is an example of the block quote format)
       1. You may change single quotation marks to double quotation marks and vice
       versa, if necessary.
       2. You may change the initial letter to a capital or lowercase letter.
       3. You may omit the final period or change it to a comma, and you may omit
       punctuation marks where you insert ellipsis points.
       4. You should usually omit original note-reference marks in a short quotation
       from a scholarly work. You may insert note references of your own within
       quotations.
       5. You may correct an obvious typographical error in a passage quoted from a
       modern source, but you should usually preserve idiosyncratic spellings in a
       passage from an older work or manuscript source unless doing so would impair
       clarity. You should inform the reader of any such alterations, usually in a note.7
It is good to set the stage for every quote you use and then provide closure after each quote by
showing how it relates back to the main point of your paper. Quotes just hanging there, without
any stage setting or closure, can make your paper sound choppy and disjointed. What you want
is a product that flows seamlessly between what the experts say (quotes) and the conclusions and
creative recommendations you can draw from what they say.

                                                                          The Mechanics of Research


PARAPHRASE
Paraphrase is a restatement of a text, passage, or work, giving the meaning in another form. It is
not simply changing a couple of words or putting them in a different order. A paraphrase falls
into a gray area between summary and quotation. Where a summary uses only the source’s
content, but not its words, a paraphrase uses the source’s content stated in words and sentence
structure that are similar to—but not exactly like—the source’s. If you do paraphrase, always
cite the source (and the appropriate page numbers).
There is no simple answer to the problem of deciding how many words you may use from a
source before you are required to show you are quoting. A complete sentence taken from the
source would certainly have to be treated as a quotation. But even a single word might have to
be quoted, especially if it is a new technical word introduced or developed by the source. The
Air University Style Guide says, “Ideally, you should introduce your paraphrase so that the reader
has no question at all about where your own commentary ends and where your paraphrase
begins.”8
All in all, you need to make sure your research report consists of much more than just a string of
quotes and paraphrases from other sources. It would be very inappropriate for example to put a
citation mark next to a chapter heading to indicate that everything in an entire chapter of your
research paper came from another source. (Yes, someone has tried to do that!) If you have that
much from a single source, and if it really is key to understanding your research, then you can
put it word-for-word in an appendix and cite the source there. Remember that research is not just
a compilation and regurgitation of others’ thoughts—your own thoughts need to be evident too.
COPYRIGHTS!
What is a copyright? A copyright is the exclusive
                                                            Research papers, or any other written

or display certain types of works publicly.
What are your rights and limitations? Ownership of the copyright is distinct from
ownership of the material object (book, periodical, photograph, record, video or audio recording,
music, etc.) in which the work is included. The owner is the boss—the head honcho who allows
(or not) the work to be performed or displayed publicly. Be careful to not trespass on someone
else’s property or step on anyone’s toes. However, there are exceptions that allow the use of the
owner’s work without requesting permission or obtaining a license. Find your organization’s

Can you make changes? You will not get your hand slapped for making minor style
changes. But the changes, individually or cumulatively, should not significantly change the
context or its meaning. Minor changes are only allowed to let you fit the work smoothly into the
syntax and typography style of the product.
HOW TO CITE YOUR SOURCES
Footnotes, textnotes and endnotes are three common citation methods used to indicate where you
got your information. For more extensive coverage of these and other methods, consult the style
manuals such as The Air University Style Guide, The Chicago Manual of Style, or The American
Psychological Association Style Guide. There are certainly plenty of style guides to choose
from, but the Air University Style Guide for Writers and Editors is not only free from Air
University Press, it is also available on-line.1 Whatever style you choose within a particular
document, be consistent.
1 FOOTNOTES
With today’s computers, using footnotes is much easier than it used to be with a typewriter. If
you are using footnotes, each footnote should appear on the same page you refer to it.
Sometimes you might want to include more than just source data in the footnote. Keep in mind
that a page containing more footnote material than text not only is unpleasant to the eye, but also
may discourage all but the most determined reader.
Most computer programs have an option where you can choose to insert a footnote and it takes
care of all the formatting for you, to include keeping the numbering straight—even if you move
text around while editing. In Word, you can jump back and forth between the text and the
citation by double-clicking on the footnote number. You simply can’t beat having the computer
do all the work for you, but if you do have to put footnotes in manually, they should be
underneath a flush left, five-eighth inch line, that has at least one space above. Also, use an 8-
point font size. Single-space within each footnote and also between each footnote. Footnotes
look just like endnotes (described next), except they are at the bottom of each page—just like the
one below.
2 ENDNOTES
For an example of endnotes, check out the end of this chapter. The Air University Style Guide
for Writers and Editors has other examples for a wide variety of sources.
Endnotes can be placed at the end of each chapter, or at the very end of the manuscript. Endnote
numbers may run consecutively from beginning to end of the manuscript, or they may begin
again with each new chapter. The typed format for endnotes included at the very end of the
manuscript differs slightly in that chapter numbers could be included too.
The computer can set up your endnote formatting in the same way it does footnotes. In Word,
when you select “Insert” and “Footnote,” a menu pops up where you can choose between
footnotes and endnotes. You can also specify where you want the endnotes to go, at the end of
the section or the entire document. If your endnotes aren’t going where you want them to go,

you may need to insert (or remove) a section break. For example, sometimes they will appear
after your bibliography, which is incorrect. In this case, put a section break before the
bibliography. If you are creating endnotes manually, start on the page where you want your
endnotes to appear and center the word “Notes” 1 inch from the top of the page or double-spaced
below any text on the same page. Triple-space between the heading and the first text entry.
Number each entry and arrange in numbered sequence as superscript numbers in text. Single-
space within each entry as well as between entries. Indent each numbered entry one-half inch
from left margin with subsequent lines flush left. When including chapter numbers, center
“Chapter #” on the third line below “Notes” and begin the list two line spaces underneath.
3 TEXTNOTES
Textnoting is a means of identifying a source parenthetically at the appropriate point within the
text. This method can be accomplished two ways. One way is to show the source within the
text. For example:
           Samuel Huntington, in his book The Soldier and the State, observed, “The outstanding aspect of civil-
           military relations in the decade after World War II was the heightened and persistent peacetime tension
           between military imperatives and American liberal society.”
Another way is to provide only the source name and page number in the text and prepare a
bibliography page containing the complete source identification. When the bibliography
contains more than one entry by the same author, include the date in your textnote to ensure the
reader refers to the proper source.
           The definition of analysis (Motes: 23-31) used is …
           The definition of analysis (Motes, 1997: 23-31) …

Remember your audience when you are deciding which citation format to use. If you are writing
for a school assignment, your school probably has a specific way they want you to cite your
sources. If you are writing to seek publication, check with your target publications for their
preferred style and format before you get started. If you are really serious about publishing
widely, there are computer programs available which will convert your document from one style
guide to another which may be worth the investment.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
A bibliography is an accurate list of all sources used to prepare your research manuscript. This
means there could be sources in your bibliography that do not appear in your endnotes,
footnotes, or textnotes. On the other hand, everything you have cited in your notes should
definitely be in the bibliography. One way to prepare your bibliography is to copy all your
endnotes and/or footnotes into the bibliography section once you are done writing your paper,
and then put them in alphabetical order. However, you still aren’t done. Take a close look at the
differences in some style guides between the endnote and/or footnote format and the
bibliography format. For example, these are the differences for citing the same source according
to the AU Style Guide:

That is just enough difference to drive you crazy, huh? One time-saver is to cite your sources in
the correct format from the very start of your literature review. The last thing you want to do
after spending lots of time on the text of your paper, is to have to go back to hunt down
information that would have been really easy to collect the first time you looked at the data.
This means you shouldn’t just photocopy articles and stash them away hoping all of the
information you want will be on the photocopied page. Make sure the volume number, journal
title, page numbers, author, etc., are all captured somehow. Usually you need to look at the very
front of some journals to find the volume number. This can be very easy to overlook, so if you
have a comprehensive and structured process to capture all the pertinent details on each and
every source you use, you will save yourself lots of trouble as you tie up the loose ends of your
research.

your entire research report off of a research paper template that lays everything out for you. In
the event you are building all of this manually, here are some ideas to get you started.
♦ Use bond paper and center “Bibliography” 1 inch from top edge.
♦ Triple space between the heading and your first entry; single-space within each entry and
    double space between entries.
♦   Begin each entry at the left margin and indent subsequent lines five spaces.
♦   Arrange entries alphabetically, listing author’s name in reverse order (last name, first name,
    middle initial). When no author is named and a title is used, omit initial articles—a, an and
    the—use the first major word of the title to alphabetize. If the title begins with a number,
    alphabetize as though the number is spelled out (76 Trombones would be alphabetized by the
    letter s).
♦   When you list two or more works by the same author, do not repeat the author’s name. Use a
    line three dashes long for all entries after the first. List the works for the same author
    alphabetically by title.
♦   Items that involve a coauthor follow the works written by the first author alone.
♦   Set off titles of magazine articles in quotes and italicize the name of the periodical in which
    the article appeared. Follow with a volume number (may be the month and year) and date of
    issue in parentheses with page(s).
♦   Italicize a published report title just as a book title. Also, if there is no author, show the
    agency responsible for the report. Continue as you would for a book. If an organization is
    the author, alphabetize by organization name.
♦   While the AU Style Guide says it is not necessary to include interviews in a bibliography,9 it
    can add to the credibility of your paper. You should make sure you have the interviewee’s
    signed consent and they have checked over their parts of your text. List an interview with the
    names of the interviewee and the interviewer (“author” is used for the name of the author of

   possible, where it is stored.
♦ Even e-mails can and should be cited appropriately.

WRITING STYLE
For some reason some people think that research papers must be written at a level that is above
the complexity of day-to-day writing. This is not so. Here is an example of an abstract with
clear writing:
           “We had some fun with a stacking rings toy and learned
           something about how the perceptions of adults are different from
           those of babies.”11
Compare that abstract with this one, which has been a bit
“beefed-up.”
           “The stacking properties of toroids that reflect radiation in the
           1.8 to 2.8 eV energy range is investigated. Preliminary results
           indicate that in the optimal configuration the toroids are oriented
           vertically with those reflecting lower energy photons having
           larger gravitational potential energies for toroids of equal mass. The ambiguousness of this solution is
           tested by experiments performed by a relatively inexperienced researcher
           (t= 0.9167 yr). These experiments indicate that alternate solutions can be found.”12
They both say the same thing; one just says it much more clearly than the other. Please don’t
think of your research report as an opportunity to throw together as many multisyllabic words as
you can possibly think of. Remember, you will have to read this over a few times yourself.

FORMATTING ISSUES
One way to help your paper appear organized is through effective use of headings. In order to
make sure you are consistent with your main points, the size and style of your headings and
should follow what the introduction says the paper is going to cover and clearly indicate which
of the issues are the most important. One of the ways to do this is to match up your outline with
the appropriate heading levels.
                         Level One – Centered, bold, 16-font
                             Level Two – Centered, bold, 14-font
Level Three – Flush Left, Bold, 12-font
Level Four - Flush Left, Bold, 12-font. Followed immediately by text.
If possible, do not “stack headings” with one immediately following another, instead make sure
some text separates your headings.13

Now that you know how to capture your sources, ideas, and thoughts—one last consideration is
what methodology you use to collect, process and analyze your data.

INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
What is methodology? One good way to start is by describing what methodology is not.
Methodology is not a running dialogue of how you did your research!! Methodology simply
provides a structured way of gathering and analyzing your data.
                                          There are as many different ways to group the research
                                          methods together as there are research methods
                                          themselves, but most of them fall into two main
                                          categories: qualitative and quantitative. Some research
               Methods                    will even use a mix of the two so don’t confine yourself

THE HISTORICAL METHOD
The historical method is one of the most commonly used research methods, and it is the only one
available for studying the past. It “aims to assess the meaning and to read the message of the
happenings in which men and women, the events of their lives, and the life of the world around
them relate meaningfully to each other.”15 Historical research is much much more than listing
events in chronological order, or restating historical data in a new and different format. This
concept can be lost on students who mistakenly view research as nothing more than a beefed-up
book report. The key element in the historical method’s search for meaning requires the
researcher to interpret what may have appeared to be simply chance. This method pulls together
both things that are commonly known by the well educated, and also any special information that
may be relevant to the historical question being studied. In order to help provide stronger
conclusions, primary sources should be used as much as possible to increase the validity of the
data. Unfortunately, in the historical research design the researcher has absolutely no control
over the collection of the data, the subjects, or even anything that happened at the time the events
took place. This can make it hard to be sure all of the needed data has been found, if the data on
hand is accurate, and if or how much of the data has been distorted or destroyed.



                                             – 348 –
                                                                         The Mechanics of Research


The researcher using the historical method does not need to look at history only from a time
dimension, but can also look at it from the dimension of where things happened.16 By arranging
historical data in different ways, such as on timelines, charts, or a map, new insights can be
found to help find new meaning in the data.
Also, historical research does not restrict itself to just the study of events and people from the
past. This methodology is also useful for exploring the origin, development and influence of
ideas and concepts.17 This is where the power of the historical research methodology lies. The
ideas and concepts explored through this methodology could have as strong an influence on their
ages as the rise or fall of a nation or civilization and would be powerful lessons to pull from
history to help carry us into the future.18
GENERAL QUALITATIVE METHODS
In addition to the historical method, there are several other qualitative methods.
CASE STUDY
Case studies seek to understand a person or a situation in depth.19 For example, someone could
study in great detail the transition of a unit from one aircraft to another. You could do this by
focusing on just one case, or make an even stronger analysis by looking at multiple cases and
making comparisons between them. This is a good method to use if little is known about a
situation or if you want to look at how things change over time.20 Unfortunately, this method is
not strong when it comes to being able to generalize the results.
ETHNOGRAPHY
Ethnographies are broader than case studies since they study entire groups in depth, particularly
groups that share a common culture.21 For example, instead of looking at one unit transitioning
from one aircraft to another, a researcher could use this method to study the entire fighter pilot
community. In this method, the researcher studies the group in their natural setting over a period
of months, possibly even years, “with an intent to identify cultural norms, beliefs, social
structures, and other cultural patterns.”22 This method was first used in cultural anthropology,
but is just as applicable in today’s organizational cultures.
PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY
A phenomenological study attempts to “understand people’s perceptions, perspectives, and
understandings of a particular situation” by looking at several different views of the same
situation to make generalizations about what that situation is like.23 This research method
depends heavily on interviews. For example, the individuals who transitioned from one aircraft
to another could be interviewed to see what the change meant for them.
GROUNDED THEORY STUDY
This method is interesting in that it is the reverse of most research methods, which normally
begin with a theory and test it with data. A grounded theory study begins with the data and uses
the data to develop a theory, and is “typically used to examine people’s actions and
interactions.”24

CONTENT ANALYSIS
Content analysis takes the contents of a body of material such as books, films, transcripts, and
searches for themes and patterns.25 This method could be used to determine how much violence
appears on TV in any given day, and describe what type of violent acts appear most frequently.
This challenging task of sorting through mounds of data is now easier with computer programs
that can help do this quickly. This method is being used more and more and in combination with
other methods.

QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS
In quantitative research, numbers, and statistical analysis play a larger role, and the ability to
generalize results is somewhat stronger than most qualitative methods. Quantitative research
methods can be divided into two major categories: nonexperimental and experimental.
NONEXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH METHODS
In nonexperimental research methods, the researcher only controls the measurement of the item
under study. Both the descriptive and analytical survey methods are examples of this kind of
research.
THE DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY METHOD
                        The descriptive survey method uses data obtained through observation.
 “Survey” is used       While historical data is used to explore events of the past, survey research

There are three basic forms of surveys:

mainly due to time and cost constraints.

interviews, and the differential sliding scale checklist or inventory.

The biggest difference between the nonexperimental and experimental methods of research is
survey research does not include the same highly controlled aspects of experimental research.

THE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
There are many different subsets of the experimental method, but a common characteristic is the
level of control the researcher has over both the event and the ability to collect data on the event.
An experiment is a contrived event where the effect of a deliberate act is observed. One of the
main purposes of experimental research is to determine cause-and-effect relationships.
Unfortunately, some study results can be weakened because the artificial nature of their
experiments makes the results too different from what might turn out in a natural setting.
One of the most important aspects of the experimental method is effectively planning the design
of the experiment—not just how the data will be interpreted, but the entire experimental design.27
One key concept involves independent and dependent variables. “A variable that the researcher
manipulates is called an independent variable. A variable that is potentially influenced by the
independent variable is called a dependent variable, because it is influenced by, and thus to
some extent depends on, the independent variable.”28 If we were testing a new medication to
reduce headaches for example, the drug itself would be the independent variable and the
headaches, which hopefully will be reduced or eliminated by the drug, would be the dependent
variable—the headaches would depend on the medication.
METHODOLOGIES IN A NUTSHELL
When trying to choose between quantitative and qualitative methods, it is important to take
several things into consideration—to include your interests. Table 1 gives some good guidelines
of what to take into consideration.

SUMMARY
The most important concept to take away from this appendix is that research must consist of
more than just gathering information and spewing it back out again in a slightly different format.
Research begins with the formulation of an appropriate research question. The research question,
the data, and your interests influence the research methodology. In shorter research papers you
may not be required to specifically state the methodology you used. However, it should be
apparent from reading your paper that you aren’t just presenting information, but are also
drawing some new meaning from the information and actually contributing to the body of
knowledge.
     The real fun in life comes from total creative absorption in a task and not the external rewards
                                                for doing it.

                        Let's face it—English is a crazy language

     There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in
     pineapple.
     Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.
     We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that
     quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is
     neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.
     And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce
     and hammers don't ham?
     If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth?
     One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?
     Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend?
     If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them,
     what do you call it?
     If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught?
     If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?
     Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an
     asylum for the verbally insane.
     In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?
     Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?
     Have noses that run and feet that smell?
     How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and
     a wise guy are opposites?
     You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house
     can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and
     in which an alarm goes off by going on.
     English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the
     creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all).
     That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights
     are out, they are invisible.
     Enuff? Gud!

                                       STRATEGIES



 This appendix covers:
     •   Barriers to effective reading.
     •   Reading for study or research.
     •   Memory aids.


Why would we want to improve our reading skills? If we’re reading for pleasure, we may enjoy
reading slowly and savoring every word. However, if we need to read or review lengthy
materials in the course of our jobs, our time is valuable. Improving reading speed and
comprehension will help pinpoint the information we need in the limited time we have available.
On a day-to-day basis, we must stay current with world events and read or review Air Force
Instructions, operating instructions, plans, technical orders, and promotion study guides. Since
we don’t have time to spend our days reading, we have to learn to use our reading time more
effectively.
This appendix provides some basic strategies for improving reading skills. First, we’ll discuss
some barriers to effective reading and techniques to overcome these barriers. Next, we outline a
study and research a reading method to help you get the most from your time. Finally, we offer
some memory improvement tips.




                         “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.”
                                                            — Joseph Addison

WHAT ARE SOME BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE READING?
Some of us continue to use the habits we adopted when we first learned how to read. Most of us
don’t even realize we’re still practicing them. These habits are keeping us from reading
efficiently and effectively.
c Reading at a fixed speed. One habit we tend to overlook is reading different types of
material at the same speed. Not all materials are equally difficult to read. In the same way, not
all sections of a particular written work are of equal complexity.
To read efficiently, adjust your speed according to the difficulty of the text you’re reading and
your purpose for reading it. If you’re reading for main ideas only, skim the material quickly.
Shift speeds as needed for additional information. Slow down on the complex parts, and speed
up on the easy ones. If you are somewhat familiar with the material, read faster. Read faster
over broad overviews and unneeded details. Generally, you’ll need to slow down while reading
detailed technical material and material with unfamiliar concepts. If you are reading for study
purposes, your overall rate will be slower.
d Vocalizing, or subvocalizing, words. Another common habit we typically don’t think
about is vocalization, or subvocalization. This occurs when we say the words we’re reading
aloud, or to ourselves. If we pronounce each word, we can’t read any faster than we can speak.
To overcome this habit, learn to read faster than you can speak. One way to do this is to shift
your focus from a small area of print to a larger one. We’ll cover a couple of techniques under
the next section.
Another way to help cut your dependence on saying the words is to think about the key words,
ideas or images—picture what is happening. You have to go over the print fast enough to give
your brain all the information quickly. Keep your mind clear so the picture or thought can enter
it. Then, accept it without question. Try not to let other thoughts intrude.
e Reading words one at a time. Reading individual words is very inefficient. To read faster,
your eyes must move faster over the printed material. We can’t continue reading one word at a
time. However, just willing your eyes to move faster isn’t enough. Many of us have been
practicing this habit of slow eye movements for so long that it’s too hard to give it up that easily.
One way to break this habit is to use your hand, or another object, as a pacing aid. Since your
eyes tend to follow moving objects, your eye will follow your hand as it moves across the page.
One method is to make one continuous movement with your hand across each line of text. For
example:




                                              – 356 –
                                                                           Effective Reading Strategies




              The first operations conducted by airmen
           were designed to gain information                                Use your hand
           superiority.       Subsequently, air-to-air                      as a pacing aid
           combat evolved as a means to deny
           information superiority to an adversary.
           Information operations from air and space
           and, today, in cyberspace, remain key
           elements of what our Service brings to the
           Nation, the joint force commander, and
           component and coalition forces.
                              AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, 1 Sep 97




As your hand moves across the text, your eyes will follow it. You can change the speed as
needed for the difficulty of the material you’re reading.
Another method is to let your peripheral vision do some of the work. To use this technique,
break up the page into groups of words, or columns. Instead of focusing your eyes on every
word, begin by focusing on every second or third word. Practice moving your eyes smoothly
from one group to the next, and let your peripheral vision pick up the words on each side of the
break. For example, you could break up this sentence into groups of words like this:
       For example, you / could break up / this sentence into / groups of words / like this.
To break the text up into columns, use the following pattern as an example for your eyes to
follow. As you read each line of text, focus your eyes on the first dotted line. (This line
represents the center of the first column of text.) Then jump to the second line and finally the
third line. Let your peripheral vision pick up the words on either side of the line as you go along.

          Thunderstorms contain the most severe weather                              Use your
          hazards to flight. Many are accompanied by                             peripheral vision
          strong winds. severe icing and turbulence,
          frequent lightning, heavy rain, and hazardous
          windshear. If all of these are not enough, -
          consider the possibility of large hail, microbursts
          and even tornadoes. Thunderstorms are quite
          powerful.


                             AFH 11-203, Vol 1, Weather for Aircrews, 1 Mar 97




Practice is the key! You can increase your reading speed by spending a few minutes a day
reading at a faster rate than normal.
f Rereading passages. Another barrier to effective reading is rereading passages. This habit
can slow your reading speed to a snail’s pace. We can all probably relate to this one. Once
we’ve read a sentence or passage, we realize we have no idea what we’ve just read. Why? Our
thoughts have a tendency to wander.
To prevent reading passages over again, you need to increase your concentration. Try to isolate
yourself from any outside distractions. Find a place away from phones, TVs and engaging
conversations.
A simple way to keep from rereading is to cover up the material you’ve already read with an
index card. You can also use one of the pacing tools discussed under the last section.
g Stumbling over unknown words or large numbers. Don’t let unfamiliar words or large
numbers slow you down.
Even readers who have a large vocabulary will come across unfamiliar words. You can usually
gain the meaning of a word by its use in the text. Keep in mind that your ability to read faster
depends upon your ability to recognize words quickly. The more you read, the more your
vocabulary will grow. Additionally, improving your vocabulary will improve your
comprehension.
As for numbers, unless you need to remember specific data, just substitute “few” or “many” for
the actual digits.

                                                                        Effective Reading Strategies



WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY COMPREHENSION?
When you first start practicing reading faster, you may understand very little of what you read.
Be patient. Your eyes will get used to seeing the print at a rapid pace, and you’ll understand
more. Begin by reading faster for only 5-10 minutes at one time, and gradually increase your
time. In the end, your comprehension and retention should be at least as good as it is now.
Research shows a proportional relationship between reading speed and comprehension. In most
cases, an increase in comprehension follows an increase in reading speed. Comprehension
decreases when speed decreases. Reading slowly, word-by-word, seems to inhibit
understanding. (Virginia Tech and the University of Maryland.) Eliminating the barriers to
effective reading can help.


                                   Practice is the key!



HOW SHOULD I APPROACH READING FOR STUDY AND RESEARCH PURPOSES?
SQR3 is one research reading method you can use. It stands for survey, question, read, recall,
and review. F.P. Robinson coined the SQR3 acronym in a book entitled Effective Study (1946).
University researchers continue to recommend this method to help you get the most from your
reading time. It will help you separate the important information from the chaff.
c Survey. The first step is to survey the material to get the big picture. This quick preview
allows you to focus your attention on the main ideas and identify the sections you want to read in
detail. The purpose is to determine which portions of the text are most applicable to your task.
Read the table of contents, any introductions, section headings,
subheading, summaries and the bibliography. Skim the text in-               Skim for gist
between. Be sure to look at any figures, diagrams, charts, and
highlighted areas.
d Question. Once you’ve gained a feel for the substance of the material, compose questions
about the subject you want answered. First, ask yourself what you already know about the topic.
Next, compose your questions. You can also turn section headings and subheadings into
questions. For example:




                                             – 359 –
The Tongue and Quill


•   “How do I create or change a program element?”
•   “What is the technical order change process?
For some materials, you’ll want to use your critical thinking skills to interrogate the writer. The
more you know about the author and his/her organization, the better you’ll be able to evaluate
what you read. Try to answer questions like these:
•   What is the author’s experience and credentials?
•   What is the author’s target audience?
•   What is the author’s purpose?
•   What are the author’s assumptions?
•   What are the author’s arguments?
•   What evidence does the author use to support his/her arguments?
•   What are the author’s conclusions?
•   What factors shaped the author’s perspective?
e Read. Now go back and read those sections you identified during
your survey. Search for answers to your questions. Look for the ideas         Read for details
behind the words.
f Recall. To help you retain the material, make a point to summarize the information you’ve
read at appropriate intervals (end of paragraphs, sections, and chapters.) Your goal is not to
remember everything you’ve read, just the important points. Recite these points silently or
aloud. This will help improve your concentration. You can also jot down any important or
useful points. Finally, determine what information you still need to obtain.
g Review. This last step involves reviewing the information you’ve
read. Skim a section or chapter immediately after you finish reading            Review for
it. You can do this by skimming back over the material and by looking          understanding
at any notes you made. Go back over all the questions you posed and
see if you can answer them.




                                             – 360 –
                                                                         Effective Reading Strategies


HOW CAN I REMEMBER MORE OF WHAT I READ?
If you need to improve your ability to remember information you’ve read, the following tips may
help.
c Improve your concentration. Improving your reading environment can help. Minimize
distractions. Choose a place away from visual and auditory distractions. Ensure your chair,
desk, and lighting are favorable for reading. Establish a realistic goal for how much you intend
to read in one sitting. Stop occasionally for short breaks.
d Organize the information. Arrange data or ideas in small groups that make sense to you.
These groups will be easier to remember by association with the group.
e Make the information relevant. Connect the new information with information you
already know. Try to associate what you are reading with your job or your interests. Recalling
the information you already know about a subject will make it easier to recall the new stuff.
f Learn Actively. Researchers report “people remember 90 percent of what they do, 75
percent of what they see, and 20 percent of what they hear.” (Dave Ellis, Becoming A Master
Student, 8th ed., 1997.) Use all of your senses. Don’t just speak aloud when recalling
information you’ve read, get your entire body into the act. Get up and move around, as if you
are practicing for a speech. Use visualization and picture the information you’re reading. Write
down the main points. These methods will help you to retain the material. Don’t forget to relax.
When we’re relaxed, we think more clearly.
g Use your long-term memory. Your short-term memory space is limited, so take advantage
of your unlimited long-term memory. To commit information to your long-term memory,
review the material several times. Change the order of the information you recite during your
reviews. This takes advantage of your ability to remember best what you read last.
h Maintain a positive attitude. If you think the information is going to help you in your job
or personal life, it will be easier to remember. However, if you believe the information you’re
reading is too difficult to retain, it will be. Think positive!
i Use Mnemonics. You probably remember this memory aid from your childhood.
Remember “My Very Energetic Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas?” This catch phrase helped
us remember the order of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto. You probably also know this catch phrase to help remember General
Officer rank order: “Be My Little General” (Brigadier General, Major General, Lieutenant
General, and General.) You could use a catchword to remember the Principles of War.
“MOSSMOUSE” = Maneuver, Objective, Security, Simplicity, Mass, Offensive, Unity of
command, Surprise and Economy of force.


         “I divide all readers into two classes: Those who read to remember and those
         who read to forget.”
                                                                — William Phelps
