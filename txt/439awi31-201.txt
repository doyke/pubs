     4.1.3. If only one aircrew member is available and all paperwork has been accomplished,
     the armorer issues the ammunition to the individual. The armorer then prepares each
     weapon for issue (with the slide locked to the rear and on safe) and then places all three
     pistols in an ammunition can. The armorer then exits and secures the armory and
     proceeds to the clearing barrel. The armorer supervises the loading of the weapons by the
     individual. The loaded weapons, with the decocking/safety lever in the safe position (red
     dot not showing), are placed in another ammunition can for transport to the aircraft.

        time received from the operation center.
        4.2.1.2. Provides the armorer with one copy of orders for aircrew members to be
        armed. The armorer checks the aircrew against the listing of personnel not authorized

        granted access to weapons or ammunition during the mission.
        4.2.1.3. Presents the armorer with military identification credentials, US Armed
        Forces Identification Card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms.

        and, in turn, verifies the other two crew members' qualification with the current list in
        the armory.
        4.2.2.3. All weapons, ammunition, and magazines are signed for and the
        responsibility of the lone crew member. They ensure only the designated and properly
        identified crew members receive the additional weapons.
        4.2.2.4. Weapons are loaded and or cleared, one at a time, at the clearing barrel
        located outside the armory. A Clearing Barrel Supervisor (CBS) must be present
        during the procedure.

        individual. The armorer then prepares each weapon for issue (with the slide locked to
        the rear and on safe) and then places all three pistols in an ammunition can. The
        armorer then exits and secures the armory and proceeds to the clearing barrel. The
        armorer supervises the loading of the weapons by the individual. The loaded
        weapons, with the decocking/safety lever in the safe position (red dot not showing),
        are placed in another ammunition can for transport to the aircraft.

        4.3.1. Complete two copies of AF Form 1297. The armorer keeps the original and the
        duplicate goes with the aircrew member. The duplicate is used to retrieve the weapon and
        ammunition prior to departure. Only the individual who turned in the weapon may be
        reissued that weapon, except upon authorization from the aircraft commander.
        4.3.2. Present the armorer with a copy of aircrew orders, military credential CaC Card,
        and AF Form 523.
        4.3.3. Receive all weapons and ammunition listed on AF Form 1297, once identified by
        the armorer. Both copies of the AF Form 1297 are destroyed. Only one individual is
        authorized at the window at a time, and only one weapon is authorized per individual.
5. CBS.
     5.1. The CBS must be knowledgeable of the procedures prescribed for the loading and
     unloading of the weapon being cleared.
     5.2. Prior to issue or clearing of a weapon for turn-in the CBS will be present at the
     appropriate area to clear weapons.
     5.3. Once the weapon has been received from the armorer the individual will proceed
     directly to the clearing area. In addition, once a weapon is cleared for turn-in the individual
     will proceed directly to the armory window.

     5.8. The Security Forces armorer will not accept any weapon or ammunition if the weapon is
     not properly cleared.
439AWI31-201 14 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      5



6. Issue/Turn-in Procedures.
   6.1. Issue of Firearms. The armorer will clear weapons using the following procedures:
      6.1.1. M9 Handgun. The weapon muzzle will be placed in the armory clearing barrel.
      Ensure the weapon decocking/safety lever is in the safe (down) position (red dot not
      showing), lock the slide to the rear. The armorer will visually inspect the chamber, barrel
      and magazine well thoroughly to ensure there are no rounds or obstructions. The weapon
      will then be handed through the issuing window butt first, muzzle elevated, and the
      chamber open. Fingers will not be inserted into the trigger guard. The person being armed
      will then proceed directly to the clearing barrel carrying the weapon in the "raised pistol
      position."
      6.1.2. Clearing Barrel Procedures. The CBS will be knowledgeable of the clearing
      procedures for each weapon. Only the CBS and the individual clearing the weapon will
      be present at the clearing barrel at any given time. The individual will point the muzzle of
      the pistol into the clearing barrel. Do not put fingers into the trigger guard. Visually
      inspect the pistol to ensure that the decocking/ safety lever is safe (down) position (red
      dot not showing). Insert a magazine into the pistol, lock the magazine into place, depress
      the slide stop, sending the slide forward to load the weapon. The decocking/safety lever is
      placed on fire (up) position (red dot showing) and the pistol is immediately holstered and
      secured with the holster flap/strap. The weapon will not be removed from the holster,
      except in the line of duty or when it is to be cleared for turn-in.
   6.2. Weapons Clearing Procedures for Turn-In of M9 Handgun.
      6.2.1. The individual will not remove the weapon from the holster until the person is at
      the clearing barrel and is instructed to do so by the CBS. Unfasten the holster strap/flap,
      unholster the pistol and place the muzzle into the clearing barrel. Do not place your
      fingers into the trigger guard. Holding the pistol in the right hand, place the
      decocking/safety lever in the safe position (red dot not showing). The CBS must verify
      the pistol is on safe. Press the magazine release button, remove the magazine from the
      pistol, give the magazine to the CBS. Grasp the slide with your left hand, cupping the
      palm of the hand over the ejection port, and rotating the pistol 90 degrees to the right,
      push the slide to the rear, catching the ejected round of ammunition. Push the slide stop
      up with the thumb of the right hand to lock the slide to the rear (open) and give the
      ejected round to the CBS. Visually inspect the pistol to ensure the chamber and receiver
      area are clear (no ammunition present) and decocking/safety lever is in the safe position
      (red dot not showing). After the CBS verifies that the pistol is "safe" and clear for turn-in,
      proceed to the armory window at raised pistol position.
      6.2.2. Hand the pistol to the armorer butt first (chamber facing armorer) muzzle elevated.
      The armorer will visually inspect the weapon to ensure it contains no ammunition. He
      will then depress the slide stop and allow the slide to move forward to the closed
      position. Ensure the decocking/safety lever is in the "safe" position (red dot not showing)
      and the hammer is all the way forward, and store the weapon in the appropriate rack.
6                                                     439AWI31-201 14 OCTOBER 2010


    6.2.3. The armorer will accept only those weapons in which the safety/decocking lever is
    in the safe position (red dot not showing) with the slide locked to the rear.
