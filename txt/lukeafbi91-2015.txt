          3.1.2.3. For HC/D 1.2 (explosion and fragments), minimum distance is 2,500 feet.
          3.1.2.4. For HC/D 1.1 (mass detonation) quantities less than 500 pounds net
          explosive weight (NEW), other than bombs and explosives greater than 5-inch
          caliber, minimum distance is 2,500 feet.
          3.1.2.5. For HC/D 1.1 (mass detonation) quantities greater than 500 pounds NEW, all
