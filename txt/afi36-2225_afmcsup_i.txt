                                            Chapter 1

         CORE COMPETENCIES AND MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS (METS)

1.1. Security Forces (SF) Mission. Secure, protect and defend Air Force weapons systems, air
base assets, personnel and resources.
1.2. SF Vision. Protect, defend and fight to enable Air Force global vigilance, reach and power.
1.3. SF Core Competencies. In the current security environment with limited resources, the SF
mission competencies must be capabilities-based and combat-ready focused. These core
competencies consist of Security Operations and Air Provost Services. SF must be able to apply
these core competencies anytime (while performing in-garrison or expeditionary duties) and
anywhere (CONUS and OCONUS locations).
1.4. SF METs. The SF career field is responsible for bringing three major competencies to
enable the US Air Force to accomplish its missions. The SF METs are strategic in nature and
derived from the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) CJCSM 3500.04D and the Air Force Unified
Task List (AFUTL). The three SF METs are Tactical Command, Control, Communication and
Computer Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Threat Intercept; and Force
Application. These three large-scale tasks are best understood as essential; due to their nature, if
the SF career field neglects or fails to bring these three capabilities to the US Air Force, the Air
Force may not be able to meet its missions.
   1.4.1. C4ISR. SF must plan, direct forces, collect and fuse information and maintain
   situational awareness. This involves operations planning, directing forces, investigating and
   collecting, collating, assessing, analyzing, fusing and disseminating tactical information, in
   order to detect security threats and support air operations.
   1.4.2. Threat Intercept. SF must deploy and maneuver forces and equipment to isolate and
   contain security threats. This involves individual and team tactical maneuver and
   information and terrain domination in order to achieve a position of advantage to intercept,
   control and exploit security threats.
   1.4.3. Force Application. SF employ tactics and appropriate force to prevent, disrupt, and
   neutralize security threats. This includes conducting public order, search and seizure,
   precision engagement, incident resolution and recovery operations across the spectrum of
   conflict in order to ensure unimpeded mission operations.
1.5. Mission Essential Task List (METL). The METL is a collection of 35 tasks (at
publication date) that have been identified as tasks an SF Element can complete, which support
the three SF METs. The METL can be found on the AFSFC (secured) website. Squadron-sized
elements select their METL tasks based on operational wartime plans, enduring combat
capabilities, operational environment, directed missions and external guidance. Squadron
Commanders will select 6-10 METL tasks to use as their organizations primary focus for training
and resources. METL tasks should be tasks that will receive the highest priority for training and
resources, and are those tasks, that if not accomplished, will result in severe mission
accomplishment degradation. Each MAJCOM/A7s may direct additional METL(s) based on
their specific missions.
6                                            AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


    1.5.1. Types of Tasks. Tasks are divided into two categories, supporting tasks and enabling
    tasks. Unlike METLs, which are comprised of task sets, supporting and enabling tasks are
    single tasks.
       1.5.1.1. Supporting Tasks. A supporting task is a specific activity that directly
       contributes to the accomplishment of a unit’s MET. Each MET is supported by several
       tasks that provide the synergy required for its successful accomplishment. For example,
       Secure Major Accident, Disaster and Incident Scenes would contribute to the unit MET
       of Conduct Crisis and Incident Intervention. While supporting tasks are “essential” to the
       accomplishment of the MET, they are not descriptors of the MET of a unit.
       1.5.1.2. Enabling Tasks. Enabling tasks indirectly contribute to the accomplishment of a
       unit’s MET. The enabling task concept shows the relationship of the tasks as a “house of
       cards.” Failure to accomplish many of the enabling tasks will result in the failure of one
       or more of the METs. For example, failure to Qualify with Assigned Weapon would
       prevent the acceptable accomplishment of the Conduct Law and Order Operations MET.
       1.5.1.3. SF Combat Readiness (CR) Tasks. SF CR tasks are enabling tasks. They
       provide every SF member with the capability to shoot, move and communicate. SF CR
       tasks provide the basis upon which every SF member’s mission preparation should begin.
       SF CR tasks directly contribute to combat readiness and are prescribed by the Director of
       Security Forces. SF Airmen will train on the SF CR tasks annually. SF CR tasks are
       found in Attachment 1, Table A1, Security Forces Combat Readiness Tasks.

                                           Chapter 2

                                 SF TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. SF Training Program Objective. The objective of the SF Training program is to build
and sustain a capabilities-based, combat-ready security force. This will ensure SF remain agile,
lethal and able to perform the SF core competencies across the full spectrum of operations.
   2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The SF Training program should prepare the unit as an effects-
   based sustainable combat-ready force.
2.2. SF Training Program Description. The SF Training program encompasses all SF training
and exercises conducted by SF units. It is comprised of individual and collective skills training.
Training exercises and battle drill rehearsals reinforce and sustain proficiency in individual and
collective skills. Additionally, exercises provide training on collective tasks and integrate all
elements of a SF unit’s capabilities.
   2.2.1. Individual Skills Training. Training that sustains existing knowledge and skills and
   teaches tasks for specific duty positions.
   2.2.2. Collective Skills Training. Training that builds on individual skills in a team effort,
   such as a fire team, flight, emergency services team, response force element or unit type code
   teams.
   2.2.3. Battle Drills. Battle drills are collective actions rapidly executed without applying a
   deliberate decision-making process.         Battle drills are limited to actions requiring
   instantaneous response. Characteristics of battle drills are listed below.
       2.2.3.1. Require minimal orders from the leader to accomplish and are standard
       throughout SF.
       2.2.3.2. They normally apply to flights or smaller units. While SF normally act as flights
       or smaller units, battle drills may involve multiple teams (such as fire teams) acting
       independently to achieve a common objective. Therefore, SF must regularly train
       collectively in order to understand and apply battle drills.
       2.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) The list of battle drills is in the SF CR tasks (Attachment 2).
2.3. Responsibilities. SF leaders at every level have an inherent responsibility to ensure
personnel under their command/supervision are adequately trained to fulfill their assigned duties.
Additionally, specific duties include:
   2.3.1. Director of Security Forces:
       2.3.1.1. Approves policy for SF training and appoints the enlisted, officer and civilian
       Career Field Managers (CFMs) for SF.
       2.3.1.2. Chairs the Board of Visitors to provide oversight and guidance to AETC SF
       formal training courses.
   2.3.2. Enlisted, Officer and Civilian CFMs:

     2.3.5.11. (Added-AFMC) Will designate all flight and staff duty positions that require
     an AF Form 797.
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                          11


     2.3.5.12. (Added-AFMC) Will develop an Active Shooter Crisis Response (ASCR)
     training program that will be incorporated into the master training plan (MTP). This
     training program is intended specifically for use by military Security Forces personnel
     and Department of the Air Force civilian police officers/guards only. This guidance is
     not intended for use by contract police officers or contract security guards.
        2.3.5.12.1. (Added-AFMC) The ASCR training program should be a robust
        program that includes all first responders as well as civilian law enforcement
        agencies. The integration of civilian agencies will be jurisdiction dependent as to
        who will be required to respond and who will have command and control. This is a
        plan to be implemented to protect the installation and as such should be written in
        conjunction with the installation’s Plans office and Exercise, Evaluation and Training
        office. There are an infinite number of actions that can be considered, but as a
        minimum, the following topics and related subjects must be incorporated into the
        program and trained on annually:
            2.3.5.12.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Preparation Actions:
               2.3.5.12.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Education of the base populace will be in
               the form of briefings developed and presented by either unit commanders or
               the Installation commander.
               2.3.5.12.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The Integrated Defense Plan should
               incorporate an operational response capability to an active shooter incident.
               This plan may be included in an existing plan such as the Installation Defense
               plan, Anti-terrorism plan and Emergency Management Plan.
               2.3.5.12.1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Large venue/gathering areas should be
               surveyed in coordination with the facility managers/owners. Both internal and
               external situational awareness will aid directly with the pre-planning stage.
               2.3.5.12.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Installation wide exercises will be
               conducted on annually. Integration of off-base response agencies is crucial to
               build continuity and cohesion between military and civilian responders. Due
               to jurisdiction responsibilities the rehearsal of who has command and control
               is situational dependent. The continuous use of base wide exercises will
               reduce both response times and increase efficiency of forces.
               2.3.5.12.1.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Establish MAAs/MOUs/MOAs as necessary
               with civilian counterpart agencies to provide appropriate response capabilities.
               During development of the agreements, guidance and review by the Staff
               Judge Advocate is essential. The respective OPRs will keep the originals with
               copies maintained at the Emergency Operations Center and installation Plans
               office.
            2.3.5.12.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Immediate Response/Officer Tactics/Procedures:
               2.3.5.12.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The varied and fluid nature of Active
               Shooter scenarios precludes the ability to plan for every situation. Therefore
               the responding officers move swiftly and decisively to minimize the damage
               or loss of life. Team tactics are valuable assets, but neutralizing the suspect is
12                                    AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


           the main objective. Officers should be trained IAW 31-207 and use the force
           necessary to end the assault.
           2.3.5.12.1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Security Forces members will be trained in a
           varied of entry team tactics. Keeping in mind the threat has to be neutralized
           expediently, officer & public safety are considered. Hesitation and indecision
           may cause unnecessary loss of life. Train the responders to use the chaos and
           noise to conceal their movements and obtain advantage over the suspect.
           Once the shooter is neutralized, responding officers will provide any needed
           emergency medical care and secure all weapons and evidence at the scene.
           2.3.5.12.1.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Multiple teams are required, if the threat
           cannot be immediately neutralized. These teams have different configurations
           and missions.
             2.3.5.12.1.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Entry teams have no set numbers
             required. Responding officers need to be able to adjust according to the
             situation.
             2.3.5.12.1.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Contact teams are used to limit the
             suspect’s movement, prevent escape, communicate status to the Incident
             Commander, provide preliminary assessments, give victim locations, offer
             descriptions and locations of suspects, describe shooter’s weapons and
             apprehend the suspect if capable.
             2.3.5.12.1.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) The Rescue teams are used to recover
             casualties by entering or approaching danger areas to locate/extract victims
             to a safe area and relay information to the Incident Commander and medical
             personnel. These teams must be able to control their surrounding area to
             ensure they do not become part of the fight.
        2.3.5.12.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Implementation of the Installation Incident
        Management System is necessary for an Active Shooter scenario. There will be
        several layers of command and control as well as support agencies involved. The
        initial incident command will be the senior Security Forces member on-scene
        until the Fire Emergency Service Incident Commander arrives. Then the ranking
        Security Forces member will assume role as the Operations Section Chief and
        direct tactical operations.
        2.3.5.12.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Additional areas of discussion are, jurisdiction,
        media, families, and crime scene preservation.
     2.3.5.12.2. (Added-AFMC) Training will be conducted using the approved HQ
     AFSFC lesson plans. Contact HQ AFSFC/SFOT for up dated lesson plans.
     2.3.5.12.3. (Added-AFMC) ASCR questions will be incorporated into the
     standardization and evaluation written and verbal tests.
     2.3.5.12.4. (Added-AFMC) Use of dye-marking cartridges is highly encouraged. If
     using dye-marking cartridges, units must comply with the HQ AFSFC dye-marking
     cartridge training.
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                           13


         2.3.5.12.5. (Added-AFMC) Training must be annotated on the AF Form 623A, On-
         the-Job Training Record – Continuation Sheet, in AFTR. (AF IMT 623A is
         prescribed by AFI 36-2201, Volume 3.)
         2.3.5.12.6. (Added-AFMC) This guidance will be superseded by publication of the

     2.3.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Work centers prepare a master Job Qualification Standard
     (JQS) using AFI 36-2235, Volume II, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems,
     Application to Unit Training, and AFI 36-2201 Volume 3, Air Force Training Program
     on the Job Training Administration, for both standard and unique duty positions (flight or
     staff). Indicate on the JQS how tasks are evaluated. You may use written examinations
     (W), oral responses to verbally spoken questions (O), or performance evaluation (P), as
     codes to indicate evaluation needs. Coordinate the JQS within the unit (operations,
     training, Stan-Eval, flight, etc.) to ensure all personnel have the same standards
     established. JQS is developed for those positions that required duty position evaluation
     (DPE) as indicated by unit commanders.
     2.3.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Work centers develop an AF Form 797, Job Qualification
     Standard Continuation/Command JQS, or locally developed JQS with certification letter
     for tasks/positions not covered by the Specialty Training Standard (STS) or Career Field
     Education and training Plan (CFETP) such as flight armorer, flight sergeant, etc. Include
     additional duties and wartime or special mission tasks. Use action verbs describing the
     task. Identify the technical reference for the task.
  2.3.8. Unit Training Manager (UTM). The UTM will carry out the duties and responsibilities
  outlined in AFI 36-2201 V3 Air Force Training Program On The Job Training
  Administration.
     2.3.8.1. (Added-AFMC) The UTM, including additional duty UTMs, will operate from
     the unit training section, but still works and reports directly to the unit commander. The
     UTM will conduct quarterly records inspections of at least 10 percent of individuals for
     each work center/flight. Each quarter will include different records than the previous
     quarter. The UTM will prepare a report of all discrepancies and track corrections until
     complete. Report the results of these inspections to the respective work center and the
     unit Commander. The UTM will maintain a copy of inspection results for a minimum of
     24 months.

     2.3.8.2. (Added-AFMC) Units may substitute names NLT 20 days before class start
     date for L3 apprentice level courses and NLT 30 days before class start date for L5
     advance skills courses. Any exception to this policy will require a memorandum from
     the SF Commander to HQ AFMC/A7SOT justifying the substitute.
     2.3.8.3. (Added-AFMC) Units are not authorized to work directly with course directors,
     other MAJCOMs, or sister services to schedule formal training. Units are required to
     coordinate all formal training matters through HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
     2.3.8.4. (Added-AFMC) The UTM will conduct and document AFTR training with all

   Program On The Job Training Administration, Atch 8.
   2.5.3. Assist unit commander in selecting appropriate unit METL(s) to support the current
   unit mission.
   2.5.4. Ensure work center supervisors, assisted by the UTM, develop a MTP for each work
   center to ensure 100 percent task coverage. Additionally, identify duty position, home
   station and skill level upgrade training requirements for the work center. Guidance for
   developing a MTP is found in AFI 36-2201V3, Attachment 8. Note: For SF training
   program documentation purposes, the following are designated as the lowest level work
   centers for traditional SF squadrons: SF, SFM, S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4 and S-5. Subordinate
   elements will not be considered work centers and all duty positions within each subordinate
   element will be listed under each work center. For example, Patrolman and Training
   Instructor would be duty positions under S-3 and Pass and ID Clerk would be a duty position
   under S-5. AFRC, ANG and non-traditional SF units not using the organizational S-
   structure, will use the three-letter branch designator (SFA, SFT, SFO) as the lowest level
   work center. All duty positions within subordinate elements will be listed as duty positions
   under these work centers. For example, Patrolman would be a duty position under SFO,
   Training Instructor would be a duty position under SFT, and Pass and ID Clerk would be a
   position under SFA.

requirements set forth in this instruction and in the CFETP, MWD personnel will also meet
training requirements in AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program.
2.9. Career Enhancement/Professional Certification. American Society for Industrial
Security Certification provides military members an understanding, cooperation and synergy
among uniform and civilian personnel. Currently there are three professional certifications.
Although these certifications are not mandatory, obtaining any of the designations is highly
encouraged.
   2.9.1. Certified Protection Professional (CPP). Designates individuals have demonstrated
   competency in all areas constituting security management.
   2.9.2. Professional Certified Investigator (PCI). Designates individuals have demonstrated
   education and/or experience in the fields of case management, evidence collection and case
   presentation.
   2.9.3. Physical Security Professional (PSP). Designates individuals who have demonstrated
   competency in all areas constituting security management.
   Note: Military members may use Veteran’s Administration benefits for certification
   funding.
2.10. Prior Service Personnel. Prior sister service members entering the SF career field who
are graduates of a Military Police Academy or equivalent course may arrive for direct duty
without attending the SF apprentice course. They will be awarded a 3 skill-level and entered into
5 skill-level UGT training. Former SF personnel, re-entering the SF career field will assume the
last skill level awarded. All prior service personnel will undergo Phase I and Phase II Training
as prescribed. Coordinate training arrangements with supervisors to identify individual training
needs.
2.11. Regional Training Center (RTC) Training. Training at RTCs will build on the SF CR
tasks. It is designed to supplement and not replace training on basic skills. Training received at
an RTC is additional team-oriented, mission-specific training and is not the same as the CR
individual skills training performed at home station.
2.11. (AFMC)Regional Training Center (RTC) Training. Training at RTCs will build on the
SF CR tasks. It is designed to supplement and not replace training on basic skills. Training
received at an RTC is additional team-oriented, mission-specific training and is not the same as
the CR individual skills training performed at home station. All personnel reporting for RTC
training must be current on those home station CR tasks before RTC attendance. Note: Units are
not permitted to forgo training to allow the RTC to satisfy requirements for them. RTCs will
also provide go/no go documentation on all individually trained tasks as a source document for
transcribing training items at home station.
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                          21


  2.11.1. Pre-deployment Training at a SF RTC or Other Training Site. Every SF member
  identified for deployment will attend a RTC or other pre-deployment training site to receive
  training tailored to that specific deployment. Other training sites may include, but are not
  limited to MAJCOM training sites or Army Power Projection Platforms (PPPs). Note: Unit
  requests for waivers/exceptions to RTC/other training site training requirements will be
  submitted to the parent MAJCOM/A7S for approval or disapproval. MAJCOM/A7S will
  inform HQ AFSFC/CC, by memorandum, on any approved waivers/exceptions to RTC/PPP
  training.
  2.11.2. Sustainment training at a RTC. During steady-state operations, SF members who
  have not deployed to a combat zone and have not attended training at a RTC within the last
  three years must attend a RTC to receive training on the standardized tasks. When SF
  members attend RTC training, it does not negate the annual home station requirement for
  individual and CR training. Note: Attendance of a Joint RTC or Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
  exercise satisfies this requirement. AFRC and ANG units completing Air Expeditionary
  Forces Sustainment Training (AEFST) are also exempt from this requirement. ANG AEFST
  must comply with NGB/A7S criteria. Training will be recorded in members’ training
  records.
  2.11.2. (AFMC) Sustainment training at a RTC. During steady-state operations, SF
  members who have not deployed to a combat zone and have not attended training at a RTC
  within the last three years must attend a RTC to receive training on the standardized tasks.
  When SF members attend RTC training, it does not negate the annual home station
  requirement for individual and CR training. Note: Attendance of a Joint RTC or Joint Chiefs
  of Staff (JCS) exercise satisfies this requirement. AFRC and ANG units completing Air
  Expeditionary Forces Sustainment Training (AEFST) are also exempt from this requirement.
  ANG AEFST must comply with NGB/A7S criteria. Training will be recorded in members’
  training records in AFTR.
  2.11.3. Members scheduled to attend a RTC or other training site will be current (trained
  within 12 months) in the CR tasks listed in Table A1. Combat Readiness Tasks, prior to
  arrival at the RTC or other training site. When mission allows, schedule and conduct this
  training as close to the deployment date as possible. CSF/Commanders will validate training
  of the CR tasks for personnel selected for deployment.
     2.11.3.1. Validation may be documented/recorded through a memorandum or a class
     roster endorsed by the Commander. The document will include, as a minimum, the
     names of personnel trained, the tasks trained and the date(s) training was conducted.
     2.11.3.2. Members will report to the RTC or other training site with endorsed
     documents. The senior team member will present the document(s) to the RTC staff NLT
     first training day. For other training sites, the senior team member will collect the
     documentation and make it available to the AF training liaison or the site’s training staff.

         STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATION (STAN/EVAL) PROGRAM

4.1. Stan/Eval Program Concept. The Stan/Eval program allows CSFs/commanders to
monitor all unit functions by providing them feedback on the status of unit operations, mission
performance, personnel functions and programs. The Stan/Eval program requires annual
inspections of all unit functional areas, as well as initial and subsequent evaluations of personnel
in each duty position. Note: For AFRC the Security Forces Commander oversees the
Standardization Evaluation Program.
4.2. Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. HQ USAF/A7S develops policy for the Stan/Eval program.
   4.2.2. HQ AFSFC guides MAJCOMs on Stan/Eval program requirements.
   4.2.3. MAJCOM/A7S provide guidance to subordinate units.
   4.2.4. Installation CSF/SF Unit Commander
   4.2.4. (AFMC) Installation CSF/SF Unit Commander/Defense Force Commander (DFC):
       4.2.4.1. Establishes a Stan/Eval section as outlined by this instruction.
       4.2.4.2. Monitors and evaluates the overall effectiveness of SF functions and personnel
       using inspections and evaluations.
       4.2.4.3. Coordinates and staffs inspection items identified by outside agencies.
   4.2.5. SFM:
       4.2.5.1. Oversees the Stan-Eval section.
       4.2.5.2. Provides feedback to the CSF/commander.
4.3. Stan/Eval Section. The Stan/Eval section is a separate work center and reports directly to
the SFM. ANG units without Stan/Eval manpower authorizations may consolidate training and
Stan/Eval functions under S3T. The Stan/Eval Section’s main objective is to provide feedback
to the CSF/SF Commander through the SFM on the status of unit programs and to measure the
effectiveness of the unit’s training program.
   4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Feedback to sections, teams, and individuals being evaluated is
   extremely important. Evaluator feedback is immediate and is done with supervisors or
   trainers present.
4.4. Qualifications for Stan/Eval Section Personnel. Personnel selected for Stan/Eval should
possess excellent communicative skills and be knowledgeable of the unit’s functions. They must
be of the highest caliber and should have demonstrated a high sense of self-motivation in
previous duty positions.
   4.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Stan-Eval sections will develop a comprehensive training plan for
   evaluator certification. This training process will be outlined in their work center MTL.
4.5. Stan/Eval Functions.
28                                         AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


  4.5.1. Functional Area Inspections.
     4.5.1.1. The Stan/Eval section will coordinate with the SFM and appropriate unit
     leadership to develop inspection criteria and performance standards.
     4.5.1.2. The Stan/Eval section will inspect each unit functional area or work center every
     12 months. This inspection will occur within a three-month window starting at the
     eleventh month and ending at the thirteenth month. AFRC and ANG tenant and associate
     units will conduct functional area inspections at least every two years.
     4.5.1.3. The Stan/Eval section should organize an inspection team, or use subject matter
     experts (SMEs) when inspecting specialized functions such as Plans and Programs,
     MWD and Combat Arms, to ensure technical compliance with governing directives.
     4.5.1.4. Use MAJCOM provided checklists for each activity to be inspected. Locally
     developed checklists may be used to supplement MAJCOM checklists for inspection
     purposes. Schedule inspections for times when key personnel are present.
     4.5.1.4. (AFMC) Use MAJCOM provided checklists for each activity to be inspected.
     Locally developed checklists may be used to supplement MAJCOM checklists for
     inspection purposes. These checklists, in addition to any AF or MAJCOM checklists,
     will be used to evaluate the functional area or work center. Schedule inspections for
     times when key personnel are present. All write-ups that cannot be closed within 6
     months, must be coordinated with HQ AFMC/A7SO. Commanders will send corrective
     action plans to HQ AFMC/A7S Workflow (Attn: Chief, Operations Branch) who will
     review and approve the plans.
     4.5.1.5. Units may substitute a higher headquarters Inspector General or functional
     inspection for annual inspections. Units may also substitute a higher headquarters staff
     assistance visit (SAV) when the visit encompasses the required scope to effectively
     evaluate the functional area or work center.
  4.5.2. Stan/Eval Inspection Report Preparation and Processing.
     4.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval Inspection Team Chief signs inspection reports and provides a
     copy of the report to the SFM for review within three duty days of the inspection. The
     Stan/Eval section will maintain a copy of the two most recent inspection reports for each
     activity inspected.
         4.5.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) As a minimum, inspection reports should include how
         the inspections were conducted; what was found; recurring or previously identified
         problems, if they still exist; projected close-out dates; recommended corrective
         actions; trends noted; and the resulting actions. Inspection reports must be available
         for review during higher headquarters reviews and staff assistance visits.
     4.5.2.2. SFM will review, validate and endorse inspection reports. The SFM will
     forward the report to the CSF for his/her review. After the CSF review the SFM will
     provide the report to the inspected activity to correct any deficient areas discovered
     during the inspection.
     4.5.2.3. In cases where discrepancies cannot be corrected immediately, the inspected
     activity will provide monthly updates to the Stan/Eval section until the discrepancy is
     permanently fixed.
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                           29


  4.5.3. Duty Position Evaluation (DPE). A DPE measures an individual’s qualification to
  perform duties within a given position and validates the trainer’s/supervisor’s certification of
  training completion for specific duty positions. A DPE consists of the evaluations listed
  below.
     4.5.3.1. Weapons Knowledge Test. The Weapons Knowledge test will consist of 25
     multiple-choice questions developed to measure a member’s knowledge of the SF’s
     primary weapons. The tests will be developed from a test bank of questions provided by
     HQ AFSFC/SFXW. MAJCOMs and units may supplement the basic test(s) with
     additional weapons testing based on operational needs, duty position(s), or qualification
     on other weapons. Questions should focus on weapons safety, operation of the weapons,
     operator maintenance of weapons, and the capabilities of weapons.
         4.5.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) If an individual is qualified on both the M4 and M9, the
         test will consist of questions concerning both weapons. Individuals not qualified on
         both weapons will receive a test concerning their current weapon qualification (M4 or
         M9).
     4.5.3.2. Written Evaluation. The written evaluation will consist of multiple-choice
     questions and will measure the knowledge required for the specific duty position under
     consideration. This examination may be computer generated. Each unit will establish
     local procedures to secure all forms of testing media used for the written, weapons
     knowledge and verbal tests.
         4.5.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Tests for critical duty positions will be at least 50
         questions. Tests for non-critical duty positions will be at least 25 questions.
     4.5.3.3. Verbal Evaluation. The verbal evaluation will consist of a question-and-answer
     period. It should cover critical aspects of the position under consideration. Avoid
     developing questions that elicit a one-word response. The test will be at least 25-
     questions.
     4.5.3.4. Performance Evaluation. Performance evaluations will be conducted during the
     individual's normal duty schedule. Team positions will be evaluated while member is
     performing duties as part of the team. Use the TTP guide Task Performance Checklists
     to administer performance evaluations where one is available for the task. Note: Inert
     firearms/weapons must be approved by CSF prior to their use and strictly controlled by
     the Stan-Eval section. As a minimum, control measures will include assigning a serial
     number to each inert weapon and signing in/out procedures. Inert weapons will be of a
     color that is immediately distinguishable from a real weapon. Weapons will never be
     brandished/used in a threatening manner when used in exercises involving personnel
     armed with live ammunition!
         4.5.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Inert weapons that can be easily distinguished by color
         and approved by the CSF, may be used in any exercise scenario where the weapon
         will be used in a threatening manner or brandished (IE: Active Shooter exercises).
  4.5.4. Duty Position Categories. Security Forces duty positions are categorized as either
  critical or non-critical.
30                                            AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


     4.5.4.1. Critical Position. A critical position is one that requires precise accomplishment
     of assigned duties crucial to mission accomplishment. Individuals cannot work critical
     positions directly supporting nuclear resources without direct supervision until
     successfully completing the DPE for that position. As a minimum the duty positions
     listed below will be considered critical.
        4.5.4.1.1. Positions in direct support of nuclear resources. These include, but are not
        limited to the following duty positions:
            4.5.4.1.1.1. Convoy Commanders.
            4.5.4.1.1.2. Area Supervisors.
            4.5.4.1.1.3. Close-in/Boundary Sentries.
            4.5.4.1.1.4. Master Surveillance Control Facility Operators.
            4.5.4.1.1.5. Entry Controllers.
            4.5.4.1.1.6. Alarm monitors when working in a facility designated as the alternate
            Central Security Control (CSC).
            4.5.4.1.1.7. Security Controller, Desk Sergeant or Control Center Operator.
        4.5.4.1.2. Flight Chief.
        4.5.4.1.3. Corrections positions.
        4.5.4.1.4. Other duty positions as designated by MAJCOMs and CSF.
     4.5.4.2. Non-critical positions. Non-critical positions are those positions whose exacting
     accomplishment of assigned duties is not crucial to the accomplishment of the mission.
     The CSF will identify non-critical positions requiring a DPE.
        4.5.4.2.1. Trainees may work non-critical positions independently prior to
        completing their DPE when Phase II Training is completed.
            4.5.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The DFC must identify the minimum tasks
            associated with these duty positions to be trained and “signed off” (by trainee and
            trainer) in the trainee’s AFTR prior to the individual working the position alone.
            Once these identified tasks are trained and signed off in AFTR, the trainee may
            work that particular non-critical position independently.
        4.5.4.2.2. Duty positions requiring teams of two or more personnel must have at least
        one certified person per team.
     4.5.4.3. DPE Cycle. Conduct an initial DPE within 30 duty days of completion of Phase
     II training for critical and non-critical positions on personnel assigned to active duty units
     (includes AFRC and ANG personnel when mobilized or on extended orders of 180 or
     more days). Conduct an initial DPE for IMAs within three Inactive Duty Training (IDT)
     periods of completion of Phase II training. Subsequent evaluations are accomplished as
     described in the following paragraphs. Note: AFRC and ANG will determine DPE
     cycles for their tenant and associate units.
        4.5.4.3.1. Critical positions are evaluated 12 months after previous evaluation date.
        MAJCOMS and CSF may direct additional no-notice evaluations. Deployed
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                      31


       members whose DPE expires during deployment will be re-evaluated within 30 duty
       days of returning to duty after deployment if returning to a critical position.
          4.5.4.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Subsequent certifications must be completed by the
          last day of the anniversary month. For example, if an individual is certified on 5
          Jan 10, the subsequent DPE must be completed by 31 Jan 11. If a recertification
          is not completed by the end of the anniversary month or a certification expires
          while deployed, refer to Para 4.5.4.1. Units should make every effort to recertify
          expiring critical duty certifications before deployments. MAJCOMs and DFCs
          may direct additional no-notice evaluations.
       4.5.4.3.2. Non-critical positions are evaluated 18 months after previous evaluation
       date. The individual’s deployment cycle must be taken into account when scheduling
       subsequent DPEs. Evaluate deploying members prior to departure if their DPE will
       expire during the deployment period. If a short notice deployment prevents this,
       annotate the individual’s OJT Records and re-evaluate at home station within 30 duty
       days of their return from deployment. MAJCOMS and CSF may direct additional no-
       notice evaluations.
          4.5.4.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Subsequent certifications must be completed by the
          last day of the anniversary month. For example, an individual is certified on 5 Jan
          10, the subsequent DPE must be completed by 31 July 11. If unable to recertify a
          non-critical certification by the end of the 18th month, or a certification expires
          while deployed, refer to Para 4.5.4.2.1. MAJCOMs and DFCs may direct
          additional no-notice evaluations.
       4.5.4.3.3. Supervisors will document any delay in the DPE cycle and the cause of the
       delay in the individual's training records. They will notify the commander and
       Stan/Eval section of the delay and its cause.
       4.5.4.3.3. (AFMC) Supervisors will document any delay in the DPE cycle and it’s
       cause in the individual's AFTR training records. They will notify the commander and
       Stan/Eval section of this information.
       4.5.4.3.4. Contracted Personnel. Evaluate contracted guards as identified in the
       statement of work or PWS. Note: Evaluation results should be made available to
       Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE).
       4.5.4.3.5. Civilian Police/Guard Employees.          Evaluate Civilian Police/Guard
       Employees as identified in the civilian position description.
       4.5.4.3.6. Support Personnel. Personnel assigned to support duties within the unit are
       not exempt from the DPE Cycle and will maintain certification in the last S-3
       Operations Flight duty position held.
       4.5.4.3.7. (Added-AFMC) Following the original DPE, no-notice DPEs will be
       conducted for each certified individual at a minimum of once anytime during the
       certified period.
       4.5.4.3.8. (Added-AFMC) Units will conduct no-notice duty position evaluations.
       The goal of these no- notice evaluations is to evaluate sustained individual
       proficiency in both critical and non-critical duty positions. Units will evaluate
 32                                          AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010


          between 10 and 20 percent of all certified personnel each year with at least one no-
          notice evaluation on each critical and non-critical duty position.
      4.5.4.4. Use SMEs to help conduct DPEs for special duties such as MWD Handlers,
      Combat Arms and alarm monitors.
      4.5.4.5. If an individual requires evaluation for multiple duty positions with similar tasks,
      they may be evaluated all at once during one DPE (e.g., Internal Security Response Team
      [ISRT]/External Security Response Team [ESRT] members). NCOIC Stan/Eval must
      ensure combined evaluations adequately encompass the duties of each duty position.
      4.5.4.6. After the individual passes the initial DPE, establish a date for subsequent
      evaluations according to paragraph 4.5.3. above. The supervisor will document any
      delays and the reasons for delays in performing the DPE in both the individual's training
      records and Stan/Eval section files.
      4.5.4.7. Monitor the dates on which individuals require DPE. Establish procedures with
      the unit scheduler to notify the Stan/Eval section of all newly assigned personnel and
      moves within the unit.
      4.5.4.8. Persons having fewer than 90 days remaining until discharge, retirement,
      retraining or are within 90 days of permanent change of station do not require an
      evaluation. ANG personnel with less than four UTAs remaining do not require an
      evaluation.
   4.5.5. Documenting DPEs.
      4.5.5.1. Use AF Form 689, Task Performance Checklist, or similar computer generated
      product approved by the parent MAJCOM, to conduct and document the DPE
      performance. MAJCOM specific and local requirements may be added to the AF Form
      689.
      4.5.5.2. Include evaluator notes on the AF Form 689. The annotated AF Form 689 will
      be maintained in the individual's file (hard or electronic) in the Stan/Eval section.
      4.5.5.3. When an individual fails a DPE, the S-3/Operations Officer and S-3/Operations
      Superintendent will determine remedial training requirements based on the
      recommendations from the individual’s immediate chain of command. The CSF will be
      briefed on the failure and the recommended courses of action.
4.6. Evaluation and Rating System.
   4.6.1. Determine and assign point values in advance to questions on the written and verbal
   tests using a scale of 1 to 100. The passing score for written and verbal tests of critical
   positions is 80 percent and 70 percent for non-critical positions. Individuals must also earn a
   “Go” on their practical performance. “Go” means the individual can perform the task
   without assistance and meets established standards. Average the three numeric scores to
   obtain an individual’s overall score.
      4.6.1.1. (Added-AFMC) All critical and non-critical duty positions within AFMC will
      use an overall evaluation score of 80 percent as their minimum standard. This standard
      will be effective from publish date of the AFMC supplement. All evaluations conducted
      after that date will be subject to the 80 percent standard.
AFI36-2225_AFMCSUP_I 1 DECEMBER 2010                                                       33


      4.6.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The passing score for the weapons knowledge test is 70
      percent. Individuals scoring below 70 percent may receive on-the-spot training and
      answer the missed questions correctly. The score can then be corrected to the minimum
      70 percent required to pass.

   4.6.2. DPE failures.
      4.6.2.1. If any portion of the evaluation is failed, (verbal, written, weapons knowledge
      test or practical) the evaluation should continue unless the evaluator determines the
      individual is not adequately prepared. The trainee will be re-evaluated on the failed
      portion of the evaluation after no more than 15 calendar days of supervisor-administered
      review training. ANG personnel have up to two UTAs to complete review training.
      4.6.2.2. The individual's supervisor ensures the OJT records are properly documented
      and notifies the Stan/Eval section when review training is completed. The Stan/Eval
      section will schedule the individual for a reevaluation no later than 15 duty days after
      review training is completed. ANG personnel should schedule the individual for re-
      evaluation no later than two UTAs after completing review training.
      4.6.2.3. The CSF and SFM, in coordination with the S-3 Operations Officer and
      Superintendent, will approve remedial supervisor-administered training requirements for
      subsequent DPE failures.
      4.6.2.4. Critical Position DPE Failure. Members will not be allowed to work in that
      position without direct supervision until completing a successful re-evaluation.
      4.6.2.4. (AFMC) Critical Position DPE Failure. Members will not be allowed to work
      in that position without direct supervision until completing a successful re-evaluation.
      Refer to Para 4.5.4.1.
      4.6.2.5. Non-Critical Positions DPE Failure. The CSF may authorize members to work
      in that position after they complete review training and supervisor certification while
      awaiting their re-evaluation by Stan/Eval.

       4.6.2.6. (Added-AFMC) The decertification process is reserved for those instances of
       critical deficiencies that occurred during times other than evaluations. The DFC or
       designee is the decertification authority. Stan-Eval may only recommend decertification.
4.7. DPE Records Disposition.
   4.7.1. Keep complete records of all DPEs and review the results with each individual
   evaluated. Distribute copies of DPE documents to the individual’s supervisor, S-
   3/Operations Superintendent, S-3/Training, SFM, CSF and the member evaluated. Note:
   This requirement may be accomplished using electronic records.

   individual evaluated. Distribute copies of DPE documents to the individual’s supervisor, S-
   3/Operations Superintendent, S-3/Training, SFM, CSF and the member evaluated. These
   results will be documented in the trainee’s AFTRs within 7 duty days of the evaluation by the
   supervisor. Note: This requirement may be accomplished using electronic records.
   4.7.2. The Stan/Eval section maintains the original evaluation documents (Identified in
   paragraph 4.5.5. above) until the next DPE. Files of individuals who have moved to
   positions not requiring an evaluation should be maintained in an inactive file for contingency
   purposes. Do not keep files for individuals who have transferred out of the unit, refer to the
   Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Air Force Records Information Management
   System (AFRIMS) for disposition guidance.
4.8. Trend Analysis Report. The Stan/Eval section will present a quarterly trend analysis
report to the CSF, and provide a copy to S3/Training. The trend analysis will be based on the
previous quarter’s DPE results. This analysis is designed to provide the commander feedback on
the status of the unit’s training program and the validity and reliability of the DPE program.
Once the root cause of the trend is discovered, adjustments will be made in the appropriate area
to correct any deficiencies. Trends may be favorable or unfavorable.

                        SECURITY FORCES TRAINING CYCLE

A3.1. Training And Time Management.
   A3.1.1. Time management is critical to the SF training program. The purpose of time
   management in training is to achieve and sustain technical and tactical competence and
   maintain training proficiency. Time management systems identify, focus, and protect prime
   time training periods and the resources to support the training so organizations are able to
   concentrate on mission essential training. Figure A3.1. describes the SF training cycle and
   depicts the cycle in relation to the AEF cycle. It consists of a White-Yellow-Blue time
   management system. As depicted, the training cycle lists some of the training and support
   concepts that generally characterize each of the three periods. Specific activities will vary
   between installations according to the local situation and requirements.
      A3.1.1.1. White Phase. The training focus of units in the White phase is on maximizing
      self-development opportunities to improve leader and individual task proficiency.
      Training on home station METLs should also be maximized. Units in White periods
      execute details and other administrative requirements and allow the maximum number of
      airmen to take leave. Commanders maintain unit integrity when executing administrative
      and support requirements. This exercises the chain of command and provides individual
      training opportunities for first-line leaders.
      A3.1.1.2. Yellow Phase. The focus of units in the Yellow phase is on training
      proficiency at the flight, squad, and crew level. Training on home station METLs
      continues, but begins to shift to deployment METLs. Individual self-development is
      maximized through the use of installation education centers and through distributed
      learning. Training on the CR tasks is maximized. Organizations in Yellow periods are
      assigned support taskings beyond the capability of those units in the White period, but
      commanders strive for minimal disruption to Yellow organizations' training programs.
      A3.1.1.3. Blue Phase. The training focus of units in the Blue phase is multi-echelon,
      collective training that leads to METL proficiency. Training on deployment METLs is
      maximized in the Blue phase. This period should coincide with the availability of major
      training resources and key training facilities and devices, such as RTCs. Organizations in
      Blue periods conduct planned training without distraction and external taskings.

MISSION: (Provide a brief description of the mission; i.e., Convoy Operations.)
TASK(S): (List the task(s) to be evaluated.)
CONDITION: (The condition associated with the evaluated task.)
STANDARD: (The standard associated with the evaluated task.)
Evaluator/Unit: (Self-explanatory)
Date: (Self-Explanatory)
1. GENERAL CONDITIONS: (Provide a brief description of the scenario.)
2. PRIMARY EXERCISE TRAINING AND EVALUATION STANDARDS: (Provide an
explanation of the standards to be met in order to achieve a passing grade/rating and how the
standards are to be measured. TEEO developers may also provide an explanation of intangible
items that may contribute to successful accomplishment of the task or tasks, ie., command and
control, communication, tactics, etc.)
3. TRAINING EXERCISE AND EVALUATION RESULTS: (Provide instructions for
trainers/evaluators/controllers on how to document evaluation results, i.e., Check "G" [Go] or
"N" [No-Go] in the space provided on the following pages of this outline to indicate the unit's
performance on each task. Trainers/evaluators/exercise controllers should record other important
information on the back of the outline.)
4. SUGGESTED SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:
a. Administration. (Outline instructions for trainers/evaluators/controllers on any administrative
functions needed to carry out the exercise/evaluation. Some things to consider are safety and
coordination with affected units [such as providing exercise start cards and copies of TEEO to
the Law Enforcement Desk/Operations Center/Central Security Control].)
b. Minimum evaluators. (Provide a description of the composition of the exercise/evaluation
team. The size, makeup and positioning of the team should be adequate to cover all aspects of
the exercise/evaluation.)
c. Opposing forces. (Provide the details for opposing forces. Among things to consider are
team composition, equipment, position, and tactics, techniques and procedures to be used.)
d. Support personnel. (List any support personnel needed and the duties they will perform.)
e. Exercise area. (Provide a description of the area to be used. The area should be of sufficient
size to allow the unit to carry out the task(s) and should also resemble the environment where the
team will be performing its mission(s) as much as possible.)
f. Firing area. None.
g. Training aids, devices, and special equipment. (List any items needed to support the

exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below.)
(1) If available, use MILES for both the RF and opposing forces.
(2) If available, use light attenuating devices for training in limited visibility situations.
(3) In actual night exercises, both RF and opposing forces personnel should wear night vision
devices, if available.
(4) Ammunition. Issue the following to both forces:
(a) 5.56mm, blank, 60 rounds per M16 series weapon(M16A2, GAU, M4).
(b) 7.62mm, blank, 200 rounds per M60 or M240B machine gun.
(5) Smoke canister (if appropriate).
(6) If you use MILES, follow the rules in the AFHs or in the MILES exercise booklet.
(7) Marking cartridges.
(8) Key references. AFHs, AFI 31-101 The Air Force Installation Security Program, and
Marking Cartridge CONOPS.
5. CONSIDERATIONS: (List any considerations that will contribute to a safe but successful
exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below.)
a. If MILES is not available, one trainer or evaluator should be with the opposing forces to allow
the trainer or evaluator to see how well the RF uses available cover and concealment, as well as
proper fire and maneuver techniques.
b. The use of marking cartridges is authorized but is not required. Marking cartridges can add a
high degree of realism, but create a significant safety risk. If used, strict compliance with the
guidance and safety procedures in the CONOPS provided on the HQ AFSFC website will be
followed. Safety is critical and must be considered and built into every phase of training.
Scenarios will be stopped immediately if any safety violation occurs.
c. Trainers, evaluators and exercise directors must not interfere with the exercise or, by their
position, alert either side of the regarding opponent's movements.
d. In training, players will serve as controllers or evaluators. Being a player in one exercise and
an evaluator in another reinforces tactical training principles.
e. You must brief all persons on safety procedures before the exercise starts. The briefing must
include:
(1) Weapons safety.
(a) Never play or perform any gestures with your weapon.
(b) The safe use of blanks, if used. (Briefing should include safe engagement distance, proper
use/installation of blank firing adapters.)
(c) The safe use of marking cartridges when used. (Briefing should include safe engagement
distances, any prohibited engagement areas, the use of protective equipment and dos and don’ts
of using marking cartridges.)
(2) Use of Force.

(3) Vehicle safety.
(a) Speed limits.
(b) Local driving hazards.
(c) Vehicle limitations and handling characteristics.
(d) Driving in/around the flightline and aircraft parking areas.
(4) Ground Safety.
(5) Any locally unique hazards, state or host nation restrictions.
(6) Evaluators and controllers must be able to immediately stop exercises in progress for
safety violations.
