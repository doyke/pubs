     821 SFS/CC or designated representative. Augmentees will not be used to offset manning

THULEABI10-243 18 AUGUST 2014                                                                  3


   2.2. Augmentees will not be utilized for solo Security Forces patrols. When posted as a
   patrol member, they will be accompanied by fully trained and qualified Security Forces
   personnel.
      2.2.1. When posted on Traffic Control Points or Entry Control Points, they will be fully
      briefed as to their duties and responsibilities for that post. Operations flight and senior
      SFS leadership will periodically check on the augmentees to ensure their safety, well-
      being, and compliance with security standards.
   2.3. When activated, an augmentee will fall under the operational chain of command for the
   Security Forces, until released from duty. They will report for duty at prescribed times for
   Security Forces Guardmount with all required and issued equipment.
   2.4. Augmentees are responsible for all equipment and materials issued to them for the
   performance of their duties. When recalled, augmentees will report to the designated staging
   area and will be issued all pertinent duty equipment. During exercises or contingencies,
   when SF personnel are placed on a stand-by/alert status, augmentees will also respond and
   abide to SF restrictions (i.e. no alcohol consumption, six-ring stand-by, etc.)
3. Identifying Augmentees.
   3.1. 821 ABG/CD, as Chairman of the ARB, will work with the 821 SFS/CC to determine
   the required number of augmentees at TAB. All eligible USAF personnel assigned to TAB
   in the rank of E6 and below will be trained to perform duties to accommodate for leaves,
   TDY, etc. During activation, the 821 ABG/CD, by recommendation of the 821 SFS/CC, will
   determine the number of personnel needed for posting rotations and how many augmentees
   each unit/section will provide to meet this requirement.
   3.2. Unit commanders, with the concurrence of the 821 ABG/CC or 821 ABG/CD, may
   remove an individual from the Augmentation Duty Program by submitting an Augmentee
   Appointment/Replacement Memorandum. Commanders should not remove someone merely
   for the sake of convenience to the member. Augmentation is a responsibility affecting the
   safety and security of the installation, resources and assigned personnel. Removal should be
   seriously considered based on unit, not individual, needs or desires. Generally, the unit
   removing a person from augmentation duty is responsible for identifying and appointing a
   replacement.
   3.3. Personnel unable to bear firearms and those whose security clearance eligibility has
   been suspended or permanently revoked will not be used as augmentees.
