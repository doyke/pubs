SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes were made to the OPR from 439 SFS to 439AW/ATO; RAM input log website changed
from        https://wwwmil.439aw.afrc.af.mil/msg/sfs/ramloginput.htm  to    Y:\1    -
WARB\AW\ATO\RAM.
1. General. The implementation of RAM changes the security atmosphere surrounding an
installation. A comprehensive and well-developed RAM program will alter the external
appearance and security footprint of the installation to terrorists, their supporters who may be
providing surveillance assistance, and criminal elements. RAM programs confront a terrorist or
criminal group with an ambiguous and unpredictable situation that will complicate their planning

processes for attacks. RAM also tests elements of the security system to include Force Protection
Condition (FPCON) actions. As such, they provide training to installation personnel, allow us to
evaluate their security effectiveness and determine logistical requirements for FPCON and
various security and contingency actions. RAM execution shall be broad based and involve a
variety of career fields and personnel. The RAM program is included in the wing OPLAN 31-
101, Installation Security Plan, and applicable annexes and tie directly with all FPCONs
(including FPCON NORMAL), as listed in DoDD 2000.12 and DoDO-2000.12-H which will
ensure continuity and standardization among the Air Force should threats required United States
Air Force-wide implementation.
2. Concept of Operations. During every FPCON, to include FPCON NORMAL, RAM will be
selected from higher FPCON actions. Generally speaking, RAM will be derived from the next
two higher FPCONs for implementation in the current FPCON. For example, in FPCON
ALPHA, RAM will generally be selected from FPCONs BRAVO and CHARLIE. Additional
RAM that is not FPCON measures may be developed locally and added to the listing of RAM.
    2.1. RAM will be implemented at any time regardless of the current threat posture.
    2.2. RAM can be used in conjunction with FPCON changes, Crisis Action Checklists and
    other contingency actions.
    2.3. Additional antiterrorism (AT) measures will be incorporated in plans for functions such
    as change of commands, open houses, and organized off-base activities and will be
    coordinated through the chain of command from the Antiterrorism Officer (439AW/ATO)
    through the Installation Commander (439 AW/CC).
    2.4. This program also incorporates RAM specific to aviation installation FPCON
    procedures as a part of the installation antiterrorism measures in accordance with AFI 10-
    245.
3. Procedures.
    3.1. RAM will be implemented in a random manner during every FPCON to include
    FPCON NORMAL so that times for implementation, location, and duration will be regularly
    changed to avoid predictability. Key to the installation’s RAM program is the support of
    individual work centers tasked to perform RAM.
    3.2. A listing of RAM will be continuously reviewed and/or developed by 439 AW/ATO.
    The RAM listing will be revalidated by the Installation Security Council at least semi-
    annually.
    3.3. No later than the 20th of each quarter the installation ATO will develop a RAM
    schedule for the following quarter using the approved RAM listing. This listing will be
    forwarded to unit commanders to be distributed to their unit representative who will be
    conducting the RAM. The ATO will be the program manager for the RAM program. The
    RAM schedule will include for each RAM at a minimum:
       3.3.1. A description of the RAM to be completed.
       3.3.2. The date the RAM is to be completed.
       3.3.3. The work center(s) tasked to perform the RAM.
       3.3.4. The frequency of the RAM if it is to be conducted more than once.
439AWI31-205 15 OCTOBER 2009                                                                3


     3.3.5. The duration of the RAM, if required. The RAM schedule may direct the time the
     RAM is to be conducted or just specify the date, depending on the nature of the RAM.
     3.3.6. Once the RAM          is   completed   it   will   be   reported   via   Y:\1   -
     WARB\AW\ATO\RAM.
  3.4. Tasked organizations and work centers will perform their RAM as directed by the
  installation ATO and reported as required by paragraph 3.3.6.
  3.5. If the RAM cannot be performed, the tasked organization will contact the installation
  ATO at 557-3807 and notify that office why they could not complete the RAM. At the
  discretion of the installation ATO, the missed RAM may be rescheduled. The installation
  ATO will be notified in writing of the reason the RAM was not conducted. This notification
  must be made within five working days of the scheduled date of the RAM. Notification
  memorandums outlining a RAM that could not be, or were not, conducted will be maintained
  by the antiterrorism office (439 AW/ATO) for at least one year.
  3.6. The installation ATO may conduct random visits to organizations tasked to perform
  RAM to provide guidance and assistance in conducting their RAM and to evaluate the
  effectiveness of the RAM.
  3.7. The installation ATO will monitor, track and analyze RAM implementation efforts and
  provide the appropriate feedback through the chain of command to the 439 AW/CC.
  3.8. Commanders and chiefs of staff agencies are encouraged to and may ask to perform a
  RAM above those tasked by the installation ATO. The 439 AW/ATO will offer assistance to
  these organizations and ensure they are recorded and do not cause alarm or interfere with
  base operations.
