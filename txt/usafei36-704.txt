                                           Chapter 1

   ORGANIZATION FOR CIVILIAN PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION IN THE UK

Section 1A—-USAFE--Ministry of Defence (MOD) Arrangement

1.1. Background. UK civilian employees filling US Forces-appropriated fund indirect hire
positions in the UK are employed, administered, and utilized under the terms of the Arrangement
between the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD)
of the UK of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the employment of MOD civil
servants on US installations (other than locations for which separate arrangements exist) in the
UK (the Arrangement). A copy of the Arrangement can be found at Annex 4. Under the
Arrangement, the MOD is the legal employer and the US Force the utilizer. Supervisors of
MOD civil servants should bear this in mind when referring to this instruction. Close
coordination with officials of the MOD on all matters relating to the administration of these
employees is important in the interest of the best possible relations with both the work force and
the host government.
1.2. Responsibilities. Under the Arrangement the responsibilities of both parties are set out in
Sections 1, 2 and 3 and briefly are as follows:
   1.2.1. The MOD:
       1.2.1.1. Recruit employ administer and pay UK civilian employees requested by the US
       Force in appropriated fund activities in the UK.
       1.2.1.2. Maintains official personnel records, processes personnel actions, conducts
       employee and supervisory orientation and training activities.
       1.2.1.3. Provides advisory services to US Force supervisors on all matters pertaining to
       the daily operation of the indirect hire program, and handles other administrative
       functions.
   1.2.2. The US Forces:
       1.2.2.1. Determine the number, type, and duties of positions required.
       1.2.2.2. Participate in the selection of applicants for employment with the US Force as
       specified in Section 2 of this Instruction.
       1.2.2.3. Make recommendations on personnel and disciplinary actions. Assist in the case
       work.
       1.2.2.4. Provide an incentive awards program.
       1.2.2.5. Determine training needs and conduct all on-the-job training and certain off-the-
       job-training.
       1.2.2.6. Exercise normal management and supervisory prerogatives and responsibilities .

Section 1B—-Organization for Civilian Personnel Administration

1.4. Organization Concept. The organizational structure established to administer MOD
civilian employees utilized by the US Force stems primarily from the status of UK indirect hire
employees as employees of the MOD and members of the British Civil Service. The US Force
retain most of their managerial prerogatives while being relieved of the burden of administering
civilian employees in a foreign country. The British government is assured that British citizens
are accorded equitable treatment and payment under local practices; and the employees enjoy the
status and benefits of civil servants of their own country.
1.5. MOD Responsibilities. The MOD retains ultimate responsibility for implementing the
terms of the Arrangement, but has designated the Commander-in-Chief, RAF HQ Air Command,
as the officer responsible for the implementation of the Arrangement. Within RAF HQ Air
Command, the Command Secretary is responsible for the administration of the entire civilian
work force, including those employees utilized by the US Forces. In order to assist in
performing this function for the US Force, a MODLO has been formed, and MODPOs located at
major US installations, responsible to RAF HQ Air Command.
     1.5.1. MODLO. The MODLO is located at RAF Mildenhall. It is responsible, within
     delegation limits, for some aspects of the administration of the indirect hire work force, job
     classification, supervisor training, statistical reporting, and the computation and claiming of
     financial reimbursement from the US Forces. The MODLO acts as advisor to the
     Commander and staff, Third Air Force, and other US Forces commanders and staffs in the
     UK on matters relating to the utilization of MOD civil servants according to the above cited
     arrangement.
     1.5.2. MODPO. These offices are located at bases where significant numbers of MOD
     civilians are employed. They have certain delegated personnel management responsibilities
     for the MOD workforce, including initial recruitment and placement, employee orientation,
     and control of time and attendance reporting. They furnish advice and guidance to
     employees, supervisors, and managers relating to personnel management and administration
     and utilization of MOD employees, and act as a point of contact between the supervisor or
     manager and the RAF Commander, MODLO, or RAF HQ Air Command and the Trade
     Unions.
     1.5.3. RAF Commander. The RAF Commander is the senior RAF representative at RAF
     stations occupied by the US Force under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
     Duties include advising the US Forces commander on the overall administration and
     discipline of all MOD civilians at the installation employed by the MOD under the
     Arrangement.
1.6. Civilian Personnel Office (CPO). This organization is located at RAF Mildenhall. The
CPO provides personnel administration for all serviced US citizen employees and direct hire
non-US citizen employees located in their servicing areas. In the administration of the indirect
hire employment system the CPO‘s responsibilities are:
     1.6.1. Identifying and scheduling supervisors who require training in the management of
     MOD employees.
     1.6.2. Processing training requests and coordinating applicable training requirements.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 9


  1.6.3. The training of supervisors in the managerial aspects of their civilian management
  responsibilities.
  1.6.4. Monitoring the overall administration of the indirect hire program insofar as it affects
  serviced organizations. Maintaining liaison with the MODLO and the MODPO is to ensure
  that timely and adequate service is provided, particularly with regard to filling positions.
  1.6.5. The validation and certification of positions (see paragraph 2.2).
  1.6.6. The maintenance of position data and agreed employee data in the Defense Civilian
  Personnel System (DCPDS) from which AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, is
  produced.

                                           Chapter 2

                       ESTABLISHING AND FILLING POSITIONS

Section 2A—-Position Control

2.1. Introduction. The classification of positions and the processing of personnel actions are
the responsibilities of the MODLO. Responsibilities are exercised through the local MODPOs,
working in conjunction with the USAF supervisors and management officials. The Standard
Form 52, Request for Personnel Action, serves as the official request to the CPO for the MODLO
to take the necessary action. This chapter provides specific guidance relating to the use of this
form, together with information on the responsibility for position control, procedures for
classifying positions, and the recruitment and selection processes. Local procedures may be
established for the flow of the SF 52 from supervisor to the CPO, however, it must be
remembered that no personnel action is taken until the SF 52 is processed by the CPO in
accordance with this chapter.
2.2. Position Control. Position control is a responsibility of the United States Air Force. The
CPO validates and certifies position or personnel actions against a Unit Manpower Document
(UMD).
   2.2.1. The CPO is responsible for providing the MODPOs and the MODLO with a copy of
   the civilian personnel position control register.
   2.2.2. The local Manpower Office (MO) certifies to the utilization of manpower
   authorizations and ensures the proper organizational placement of the position, and that the
   duties described in position descriptions are consistent with the intent and requirements of
   the Air Force specialty code (AFSC). If there is doubt as to the validity of the action, the
   request is returned to the supervisor for additional clarification/coordination with the
   servicing MO.
   2.2.3. Operating officials are responsible for ensuring that all indirect hire positions are
   established and filled, unless there is a valid reason for not doing so, such as lack of funds or
   pending abolishment of the position.

Section 2B—-Requesting Personnel Actions

2.3. Procedures. Requests for personnel action are made by using the SF 52. Supervisors are
required to submit all RPA through their organizational points of contact to the CPO. The RPA
process flow prescribed at Attachment 3 will be used to ensure coordination between the MO,
Financial Management and the CPO is completed before any commitment is made that leads to
allocating resources. The CPO forwards the SF 52 to the servicing MODPO via MODLO and
upon return establishes the necessary record for the DCPDS. No reassignment or any change in
position status of an employee is made before receipt of SF 52 by the MODPO and completion
of actions required by MOD regulations. Combined requests, for example, to establish and fill a
position, are made using the SF 52. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Guide to
Processing Personnel Actions contains detailed instructions for completing the necessary items
on the SF 52.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                    11


Section 2C—-Classifying Positions

2.4. Classification System in UK. The classification of UK civilian positions is based on
appropriate standards of the British Civil Service. Although the factors used in classifying and
grading positions under the UK systems are essentially the same as in the US Civil Service
classification system (that is, type of work, qualifications required, difficulty and responsibility,
supervision received, and supervision exercised), the grading system itself is different. The
system provides for two main categories of employees: industrial and non-industrial. These two
categories are comparable to the Wage Grade (blue collar) and General Schedule (white collar)
categories, respectively, used for US Civil Service employees. Each of these two categories is
subdivided into different classes, each having a series of grades or levels of pay. For example,
the non-industrial staff category is divided up into four broad-banded groups from group B to
group E. Industrial employees are graded according to skill level ranging from unskilled through
semiskilled up to the skilled or craft grades. It is important for all US military and civilian
supervisors to keep in mind that MOD employees working with the US military organizations
are graded according to the British Civil Service system, and that the MODPO has the
responsibility for furnishing notification of position grading to operating officials concerned.
Supervisors must also realize that under UK promotion or advancement regulations,
reclassification upward of a filled position will not ensure promotion or advancement of the
incumbent (see Chapter 5, Section 5E).
2.5. Establishing and Classifying Positions:
   2.5.1. Position Descriptions. Position descriptions for MOD positions are prepared using
   AF Form 1378, Civilian Personnel Position Description (PD) or AF Form 1003, Air Force
   Core Personnel Document (CD). The AF Form 1378 (PD) and the AF Form 1003 (CD)
   should state in clear terms the principle duties, responsibilities, and supervisory relationship
   to provide information necessary for its proper classification; it may include a general
   requirement such as other duties appropriate to the MOD grade. To complete position title,
   insert the US title from the OPM occupational standards or clear alternative role title. In no
   circumstances is the British grade to be used as a position title. The position classifier
   completes the information for Grade, classified by, and date classified. PDs for positions
   identified as emergency-essential will so indicate and specify the need to wear protective
   equipment and the requirements for availability and participation in exercises, evaluations,
   training, and crisis situations, including wartime and performance of duties in either normally
   assigned or augmentee positions. The position requires the wearing of Chemical Warfare
   Defense Ensemble (CWDE) during exercises, training, crisis situations, transition to war, and
   war (see 2.10.3 for medical requirements).
   2.5.2. Procedure. In case a new position must be established or the classification of an
   existing one requires review, the supervisor prepares an individual PD or CD as required
   according to paragraph 2.5.1 for attachment to the SF 52. In either case of establishing a
   new position or reviewing a position, submit the PD and organizational chart with a SF 52 to
   the servicing CPO with proper MO coordination.
       2.5.2.1. The supervisor must ensure that a valid manpower authorization exists prior to
       submitting the request to the CPO. No classification review request is processed by
       MODLO until the CPO validates the request.
 12                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


       2.5.2.2. Positions coded "DMCU" on the UMD represent unfunded Indirect Hire
       requirements; upon verification of available funding by FM and with CPO approval, MO
       will submit an ACR to change grade from "DMCU" (unfunded) to "DMC" (funded).
   2.5.3. Any actions not complying with the above will be returned by the CPO to the
   supervisor. Upon completion of the classification, MODLO distributes one copy to the
   supervisor and one copy to CPO.
2.6. Maintenance of Classification:
   2.6.1. Supervisors maintain current copies of individual PDs for all non-US citizen positions
   they supervise.
   2.6.2. The supervisor must initiate a request for review of classification when changes occur
   in the duties and responsibilities of a position to the extent that the present PD or CD no
   longer reflects the position requirements appropriately. In all cases, the procedure in
   paragraph 2.5.2 must be observed. Classification reviews may also be initiated by MOD to
   include when a position has not been reviewed for a period of 5 years.

Section 2D—-Recruitment and Selection Procedures

2.7. Recruitment. The RAF HQ Air Command Civilian Personnel Management Branch and
the local MODPO are responsible for accomplishing all recruitment actions.
   2.7.1. Priority placement considerations will apply for suitably qualified personnel who are
   surplus to requirements (redundant) at base level, or have strong compassionate grounds. In
   the event that no such personnel are available, consideration is given to filling the position by
   lateral move, promotion, or advancement of an on-base employee. Consideration is also
   given to the transfer-in of an MOD employee from another base (which may attract
   relocation costs) or if these are not possible, external recruitment action will be effected. The
   only applicants who can be accepted are those who satisfy the UK Civil Service
   Commission‘s criteria for appointment to permanent pension-able positions in the UK Civil
   Service.
   2.7.2. In the non-industrial field, minimum educational, technical qualifications, and
   competencies are prescribed. Each applicant is personally interviewed and references from
   previous employers obtained. Pre-employment inquiries are accomplished and, when
   appropriate, medical examinations are made (see paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10). The applicant
   must meet all special qualifications of the job, including those established by the US Air
   Force activity. Supervisors will include any special qualifications as a remark on the
   requesting SF 52. The MODPO advises supervisors if difficulties arise in recruitment.
   Supervisors monitor the filling of positions and are to consider appropriate alternative
   courses of action should delay in filling the positions are experienced.
2.8. Selection. Whenever possible the supervisor is allowed to select from among eligible
applicants available to fill the position, subject to the overriding requirement to place redundant
employees (see paragraph 2.7).
   2.8.1. For industrial grade positions, the supervisor, assisted by the MODPO, is able to
   conduct face-to-face interviews with eligible applicants.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 13


   2.8.2. For non-industrial grade positions, applicants who are permanent UK civil servants,
   already assigned to positions with the MOD or other UK Government organizations, will be
   made available for face-to-face referral interviews.
   2.8.3. Non-industrial grade employees who are assigned to US Forces indirect hire positions
   and have passed a promotion or advancement review will be placed in the next suitable
   vacant position. For non-mobile grades, this can only be in the local area in which they are
   serving. In these circumstances, the supervisor is allowed a choice if more than one such
   candidate is available.
   2.8.4. When external recruitment is necessary to fill non-industrial grade positions, the US
   Forces is represented on the selection board. Usually, the representative is from the CPO for
   bulk schemes and from line management for specific posts, but in any case there will be a
   representative of senior noncommissioned officer, commissioned officer, or equivalent
   civilian status. This representative advises on the requirements of the US Forces and actively
   participates in the selection process. For the bulk schemes, appropriate documents are
   subsequently made available to supervisors to assist them in making a selection from among
   the successful candidates; however, although supervisors may be able to select from among
   successful candidates, they are be able to reject all candidates and request another board be
   held.
   2.8.5. Where supervisors are able to interview applicants, they will notify the MODPO of
   the results of the interview by completing DD Form 359, Referral for Consideration. The
   DD Form 359 is then returned to the MODPO under sealed cover. The supervisor is not to
   inform the applicant of the outcome of the interview. In the event of non-selection, the
   supervisor provides the reasons to the MODPO and records the reasons in detail on DD Form
   359. Reasons for non-selection must not contravene equal opportunity legislation.
2.9. Pre-Employment Inquiries. Applicants are not appointed to positions with the US Forces
until such time as the MODPO or RAF HQ Air Command gives authority for appointment. The
MODPO initiates pre-employment inquiries when applicants are considered qualified for
position vacancies. These inquiries may not have been completed on the day of selection or
delays may also be caused by a requirement to undergo pre-employment medical examination.
Security clearance requirements, particularly for non-industrial staff, may also add to the delay.
2.10. Medical Examinations. MOD regulations do not require pre-employment medical
examination of all applicants; this may be necessary, however, for some positions, and also in
those cases where a medical history is disclosed during pre-employment processing. Only in
rare instances is a post-employment examination conducted. If an MOD civilian is considered
medically or physically unfit to perform the job, or if an applicant refuses to undergo a medical
examination required by USAF directives, the facts are to be reported immediately to the
MODPO.
   2.10.1. The MODPO ensures that the appropriate MOD regulations are observed before the
   engagement of an UK civilian and, where required by MOD regulations, that any subsequent
   special medical examinations are carried out.
   2.10.2. Pre- and post-employment medical examinations are required to comply with MOD
   and USAF directives (for example, in the case of firefighters). These medical examinations
   are arranged and conducted at Air Force expense according to AFI 41-115, Authorized
 14                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


   Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health Services System (MHSS), and
   performed by the USAF medical authorities or other local sources. During the selection
   process, the applicants must consent to undergo initial and periodic examinations where this
   is required.
   2.10.3. MOD civilian personnel assigned to positions with a CWDE requirement are given a
   medical examination to determine their ability to perform assigned duties wearing such
   protective clothing. The US Air Force provides such medical examinations.
2.11. Designation of Emergency-Essential Positions. Commanders determine which positions
are designated as emergency-essential. Such designation and the authority will be included in a
statement on the official description for each position so designated. DD Form 2365, DoD
Civilian Employee Overseas, Emergency-Essential Position Agreement, is completed, and an
entry is also made on the pertinent AF Form 971, indicating the incumbent has been advised the
position has been so designated and that appropriate orientation has been given. The supervisors
of the positions advise the MODPO of positions so designated. Should a national emergency be
proclaimed in the UK, employees may be subject to call or recall to the British Forces. The
MOD has advised that it will cooperate to the fullest extent possible in attempting to defer the
―call-up‖ of employees considered essential to the US Forces mission and will request a waiver
of call-up when necessary.
2.12. Designation of Sensitive Positions:
   2.12.1. Unless specifically exempted, non-US citizens will not be hired or assigned to
   positions involving access to classified information or unescorted entry into restricted areas.
   Procedures for, and prohibitions against, the assignment of non-US citizens to sensitive
   duties are outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program.
   2.12.2. Procedures for completion of AF Form 1378 are noted in the above-mentioned
   regulation. An approved current AF Form 1378 for each sensitive position is retained with
   the supervisor‘s file of AF Forms 971. When a change in sensitivity occurs or when action is
   requested to establish, change, or fill a sensitive position, the following information must be
   included on the SF 52:
       2.12.2.1. Subparagraph of DOD 5200.2-R under which designation is made. (Insert
       under Item 3 of SF 52.)
       2.12.2.2. Name and title of designation official and the date of designation. (Insert under
       Item I of SF 52.)
       2.12.2.3. If applicable, the degree of classified material or description of restricted areas
       to which access is required. (Insert under Item I of SF 52.)
2.13. Release of Employees for Reassignment between US Forces Positions. An employee
who is properly referred and selected for another US Forces position is not prevented from
taking that position. Supervisors are to release an employee promptly to the other position;
normally within 30 working days for grade-managed positions and 8 weeks for job opportunity
bulletin advertised positions after receiving notice of the employee‘s selection.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 15

                                  WORKING CONDITIONS

Section 3A—-Work Hours

3.1. Introduction. Supervisors of UK employees, in the interest of getting their work
accomplished in an effective and prompt manner, should be vitally concerned with the work
conditions of their employees. This interest takes on increased importance in an overseas area
where conditions of employment may differ from those applicable in the US. Information on
certain aspects of work conditions for UK employees, including employee benefits and services,
is provided in this chapter.
3.2. Tours of Duty.
   3.2.1. Standard Tours of Duty. Installation commanders will make local arrangements in
   coordination with the MODPO and the Whitley Committees (see Section 3C), where in
   existence, to establish installation weekly tours of duty. These tours of duty will prescribe
   daily starting and closing times for UK employees to comply with mandatory number of
   hours in the workweek, as defined by category in paragraph 3.3 Tours of duty, which
   involves regularly scheduled overtime, requires prior approval of the organization
   commander.
   3.2.2. Nonstandard Tours of Duty. Exceptions to standard tours exist for personnel filling
   positions requiring shift work, weekend, or holiday work on a regularly recurring basis and
   those positions designated as emergency-essential.
3.3. Standard Workweek Hours. The following standard hours in a workweek are prescribed
for UK civilian employees:
   3.3.1. Non-Industrial Staff. Staff working outside the London Area have a workweek of 42
   hours gross, Monday through Friday, which includes 1 hour for a midday meal. Those staff
   individuals working within the London area normally have a workweek of 41 hours gross,
   Monday through Friday.
   3.3.2. Industrial Employees. Most industrial (blue collar employees) have a normal
   workweek of 39 hours net spread over 5 days, Monday through Friday, which does not
   include a meal break, but on an annual basis work 37 hours net. Details of this shorter
   working week agreement are at Attachment 2 of this instruction.
3.4. Nonstandard Workweek Hours. For personnel filling positions identified in paragraph
3.2.2, the nonstandard weekly hours will be established prior to filling the positions. Total
weekly hours exceeding the conditioned hours are compensated according to normal procedures
as outlined in Chapter 4, Section 4C. Employees filling emergency-essential positions are
subject to a normal workweek, which may be standard or nonstandard, and an additional
nonstandard workweek for purposes of training, evaluation, exercises, etc.
3.5. Meal Breaks. Non-industrial personnel whose conditioned hours are expressed as gross are
entitled to a midday meal break of 1 hour in duration, which is included in their conditioned
hours totals. Industrial employees are entitled to a lunch break of normally not less than 30
minutes, which is not included in their conditioned hours. It is also customary for non-industrial
 16                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


staff to take morning and afternoon tea at their places of work. A tea break may also be granted
only when personnel are required to work overtime. For industrials, one paid tea break per day
is authorized and is normally taken during the morning period or the first period on a swing or
night shift. In exceptional circumstances, management may authorize a second break, e.g.,
where a safety factor is involved. Personnel working extended daily hours or on additional days
in the workweek or recalled to duty, may be eligible for paid or unpaid time off for the purpose
of taking meals or refreshments. The circumstances should be discussed with the MODPO and
entitlements established.
3.6. Flexibility of Work Hours. Subject to the need for proper execution of the work and
control of hours worked, the daily work hours of non-industrial staff and industrial employees
may be varied either collectively or individually to suit the needs of both management and staff.
The length of the workweek may similarly be varied provided the normal number of conditioned
hours within a period acceptable to management is worked. Prior to introduction of flexible
work hours, on other than an individual basis, the agreement of the local Whitley Committee
must be obtained. If a Whitley Committee does not exist at the installation, the approval of the
US Air Force Commander and RAF Commander is necessary.
3.7. MODPO Responsibilities. MODPO representatives advise supervisors of the conditioned
weekly hours of personnel assigned. This includes actual duty hours for both the normal tour for
that position and, where necessary, the special tour for emergency-essential positions, to include
guidance on authorized meal breaks and rest periods for both normal tours and periods of
extended work hours.

Section 3B—-Uniforms and Protective Clothing

3.8. Coverage. Certain categories of UK civilian employees are entitled under MOD regulation
to free issue of specified items of clothing depending upon their occupations. For example,
firefighters and constabulary are entitled to uniforms; other employees may be entitled to
protective clothing such as gloves, boots, raincoats, aprons, and the like. A listing of eligible
categories of positions and specific items of clothing, however, is too voluminous to be included
in this instruction. Detailed information on the approved categories, items if issue, etc., can be
obtained from the MODPO representative.
3.9. Rules. The MOD has full responsibility for the procurement, issue, and accountability of
all clothing issued under MOD regulations to UK civilians on behalf of the US Air Force. The
US Air Force reimburses the MOD for all clothing furnished to UK employees or any cash
allowance paid instead of furnished clothing, and for MOD furnished clothing maintenance
services. Uniforms or items of clothing provided by the US Air Force to comply with US
requirements are excluded from these rules.

Section 3C—-Pecuniary Liability

3.10. Financial Responsibility. As a result of disciplinary investigation, UK civilian
employees may be found to be financially responsible for loss, damage, or destruction of US
Government property or cash entrusted to them. The specific acts of commission or omission by
the employee resulting in the loss, damage, or destruction of US Government property or cash
must be shown through investigation by USAF officials and substantiated by the MOD
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                      17


investigation officer. The MOD determines the appropriate payroll deduction or disciplinary
action according to its rules and criteria.
3.11. Damage to Government-Owned Vehicles (GOV). Special rules apply to drivers of
GOVs and consult with the servicing MODPO in all instances for guidance on what action may
be required.
3.12. Procedures for Establishing Claim against Employee:
   3.12.1. In all cases which involve UK civilian employees in the loss, damage, or destruction
   of US Government property or cash, a written report of the incident, including a brief
   statement of the circumstances involved, must be sent by the supervisor to the servicing
   MODPO within 7 days of the occurrence. The report contains a statement that a copy of the
   investigation and convening authorities‘ determination for a finding of pecuniary liability
   will be furnished upon completion of the Air Force investigation. Failure to forward the
   preliminary report within the 7-day period following the incident may prejudice any
   recoupment or disciplinary action, which may be taken against the employee.
   3.12.2. All incidents will be investigated and reports accomplished and processed according
   to applicable Air Force directives and DODR 7000-14, Department of Defense Financial
   Management Regulations (FMRs), Volume 4, Accounting Policy and Procedures). In
   addition the following applies:
       3.12.2.1. If an approved report of investigation (report of survey or other) relieves a UK
       employee of pecuniary liability, the MODPO will be notified accordingly.
       3.12.2.2. If such a report holds a UK employee pecuniary liable, a copy of it will be sent
       to the RAF Commander with a request that appropriate action be taken to effect
       collection. The RAF Commander will initiate an investigation and furnish the base (or
       intermediate command) a report of the investigation, including a statement of collection
       action or disciplinary action taken under applicable MOD directives. If such report states
       that complete or partial recoupment of the loss will not be accomplished, the base (or
       intermediate command) will forward the RAF 3.12.2.3. Commander‘s report, together
       with its own finalized report, through command channels to the Air Force Accounting
       and Finance Center for final action.

Section 3D—-Employee Service and Benefits

3.13. Need for Employee Services. Under the agreement, the US Air Force provides the UK
civilian personnel certain services, facilities, and benefits, several of which are directly related to
the conditions under which they work. These services contribute to effective performance, help
in attracting and retaining the best employees available, and have a real bearing on employee and
management relations and morale. Employee services should be developed in relation to the
needs of employees considering the availability of community facilities and the location of the
installation.
3.14. Types of Services:
   3.14.1. Facilities for a hot midday meal must be provided. Where available, the use of
   USAF dining halls may be authorized for use by MOD employees.
18                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


  3.14.2. First Aid. First aid type treatment for all injuries or illnesses occurring on the job is
  normally provided through the USAFE base medical facilities, at no cost to the employee, or
  by employees using emergency first aid kits located in workshops and offices.
  Responsibility for providing these kits rests with the US Forces.
  3.14.3. Transportation. Each employee is required to make private arrangements to travel
  from his or her home to work. Exceptionally, personnel required to make extra journeys to
  and from work may qualify for payment of travel allowances based on use of public transport
  or reimbursement of taxicab fares.
  3.14.4. Rest Periods. Information on meal breaks is included in paragraph 3.5
  3.14.5. Employee Welfare. MOD Welfare Officers officials make periodic visits to bases
  to counsel employees, assist them in resolving personal problems, and check on work
  conditions. Employees are entitled to see a Welfare Officer at any time and must be
  permitted to do so.
  3.14.6. Sanitary Facilities. Installations will provide adequate sanitary facilities for their
  employees.
  3.14.7. Information Services. Bulletin boards, located at strategic points, should be
  provided for the posting of official and other material for the information and instruction of
  employees. Information is available by a variety of means such as publications and
  electronic media. Supervisors should urge their employees to read this material periodically
  to keep informed. MOD publications containing news items and other information of
  concern or interest to employees, and which may from time to time call for action on the part
  of employees, are prepared and issued by the local MODPO and RAF Commander. Copies
  are made available to employees through their organization of assignment. Supervisors are
  to ensure that such publications are brought to the notice of all employees upon receipt. In
  addition, items of general interest may be found in base bulletins. Information directed to
  supervisors of MOD employees may be originated by the CPO and inserted in the base
  bulletin or issued direct to such supervisors.
  3.14.8. Health and Safety. US Forces are responsible for meeting the provisions of UK
  Health and Safety at Work Act. Safety issues should be addressed by Supervisors, Unit
  Safety representatives and Wing Safety in sequence.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 19


                                           Chapter 4

                          LEAVE AND PAY ADMINISTRATION

Section 4A—-Leave

4.1. Introduction. Supervisors are urged to study the material in this chapter carefully to assure
compliance with British Civil Service rules governing leave and pay matters. Since coverage of
this material cannot be all-inclusive, supervisors may obtain answers to specific questions from
their MODPO representative.
4.2. Annual Leave:
   4.2.1. Leave Year. The leave year for all MOD employees is 1 May to 30 April.
   4.2.2. Leave Entitlement. Paid leave entitlements for a full year depends upon the
   employee‘s category and status as shown below:
       4.2.2.1. Industrial employees (excluding industrial technicians and firefighters) receive
       25-30 workdays per year depending on the length of service. One week paid leave is to
       be taken in an unbroken period. The servicing MODPO should be consulted for details
       of fire grades and industrial technicians.
       4.2.2.2. Non-industrial staff receive a variable amount from 5 weeks (25 workdays) to 6
       weeks (30 workdays), depending upon length of service. For information supervisors
       should contact the MODPO.
   4.2.3. Accrual of Annual Leave. Annual leave accrues from date of appointment; advice
   may be obtained about an individual‘s leave entitlement from the MODPO representative.
   Personnel may be allowed to take their leave, in whole or in part, at any time during the leave
   year. In certain circumstances industrial employees and non-industrial staff who are
   discharged, or otherwise separated before the end of the leave year, may be required to
   reimburse pay issued in respect of leave taken in excess of accrued entitlement.
       4.2.3.1. Leave Records. Arrangements for maintaining leave records are set locally by
       the MODPO.
   4.2.4. Granting of Annual Leave. Supervisors prepare annual leave schedules for their
   employees early in the leave year. Early scheduling of leave gives employees the
   opportunity to use all annual leave which they would otherwise forfeit at the end of the leave
   year and to prevent absence of a majority of employees at any one time. Employees
   generally must make bookings for their summer holiday arrangements well in advance.
   Whenever possible, supervisors should allow employees a measure of selection for the
   periods preferred within the limits of operational requirements, giving due consideration to
   the fact that vacation seasons in the UK are usually observed during the months of July and
   August. Payment instead of leave or for unused leave is not normally permitted. An
   individual may carry over up to 10 days annual leave. Employees submit an application for
   special approval to carry over more than 10 days to the MODPO through the supervisor. In
   the final month of a leave year, up to 5 days can be anticipated from the forthcoming leave
   year. Applications to anticipate leave should be made by the employee through the
   supervisor to the MODPO.
 20                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


   4.2.5. Minimum periods of Annual Leave. Minimum periods of annual leave taken will be
   as follow:
       4.2.5.1. Industrial Employees--One-Half Day. NOTE: Some employees have reserved
       rights to take leave by the hour.
       4.2.5.2. Non-industrial Staff--One-Half Day. There is no provision for granting annual
       leave for less than half a day.
   4.2.6. Procedure for Obtaining Leave. Employees requesting annual leave are required to
   make application to the supervisor, on MOD Form E-7, Application for Leave. The
   application must be submitted a few days in advance when only a small amount of leave is
   being requested; longer vacation periods must be requested sufficiently in advance and must
   be scheduled by mutual agreement between the employee and supervisor. The immediate
   supervisor who is responsible for monitoring leave and recording on attendance records must
   approve an employee‘s application.
   4.2.7. Cancellation. The cancellation of requested and approved annual leave in advance
   may involve financial compensation to personnel in circumstances where they cannot avoid
   cancellation charges for travel or holiday arrangements.
4.3. Special Leave. Employees may be granted limited special leave with or without pay
(depending upon circumstances) in addition to regular annual leave for paternity, bereavement,
domestic hardship, and a variety of other situations noted in pertinent MOD regulations.
Employees are required to make application for special leave, supported by complete
documentary evidence, through their supervisors to the servicing MODPO for approval, and for
transmission to RAF HQ Air Command, if necessary. The supervisors endorse all applications
for special leave to the effect that they are or are not recommended.
4.4. Sick Leave and Maternity Leave:
   4.4.1. Entitlement. The amount of sick leave or maternity leave to which an employee is
   entitled depends upon the regulations governing his or her employment. Details of
   entitlement may be obtained from the MODPO office on an individual basis.
   4.4.2. Procedures Concerning Sick Leave and Maternity Leave:
       4.4.2.1. For periods in excess of 7 days, sick leave is supported by medical evidence of
       incapacity certified by a qualified practitioner (that is a medical certificate). These
       certificates, which are required to show the nature of the incapacity, are furnished to the
       MODPO office. If a certificate is sent in error to an individual‘s supervisor, the
       supervisor forwards it immediately to the MODPO officer.
       4.4.2.2. Medical practitioners are not required to issue medical certificates for an absence
       of 7 calendar days or less. Employees must, therefore, complete a self-certificate giving
       detail of the duration and nature of incapacity. This certificate must be furnished to the
       MODPO.
       4.4.2.3. MODPO will keep supervisors informed of the status of any individual who is
       on prolonged absence because of sickness or injury. Supervisors should discuss cases of
       excessive sick leave or known or suspected abuse of the sick leave privilege with the
       MODPO representative, and also discuss the desirability of obtaining a report of medical
       fitness for continued employment or of taking other appropriate action.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              21


       4.4.2.4. Excessive Sick Leave--more than 14 calendar days in any 12 month period will
       be dealt with in accordance with the restore and efficiency procedures. The local
       MODPO can provide full details.
       4.4.2.5. Medical, Optical, and Dental Examinations and Treatment. Whenever possible,
       personnel are expected to make arrangements for medical, optical, or dental examinations
       or treatment in their own time (outside scheduled work hours). Where this is
       impracticable, the MODPO representative, the RAF Commander, or RAF HQ Air
       Command, depending upon the circumstances, may grant sick leave or time off. All
       requests for these concessions are to be referred to the MODPO office in order to obtain
       the necessary approval.
       4.4.2.6. Maternity Leave. In all instances, supervisors must contact MODPO for details.

Section 4B—-Holidays

4.5. UK Public and Privilege Holidays: The following holidays are authorized for MOD
employees located in England:
   4.5.1. Public Holidays:

Table 4.1. UK Public Holidays.
New Year‘s Day         May Day
Good Friday            Late Summer Bank Holiday
Easter Monday          Christmas Day
Spring Bank Holiday    Boxing Day
   4.5.2. Privilege Holidays:

Table 4.2. UK Privilege Holidays.
Maundy Thursday Afternoon       One Other Day
Sovereign‘s Birthday
4.6. Substitution of Holidays. No change can be made in the observance of those UK holidays,
which are designated to occur on a specific date. The two holidays, the Sovereign‘s Birthday
and the additional privilege holiday, do not, however, have specifically fixed dates and may be
scheduled by administrative action according to MOD directives. It is important that the
selection of the day to be observed as a holiday should take into account the requirements of
management, efficiency of the base, and wishes of the employees. Installation commanders are
authorized to seek agreement under the Whitley procedure of the observance of these two
holidays on two of the regular US legal holidays. The RAF Commander or MODPO provides
commanders with information on the appropriate procedures to follow. The collective wishes of
the industrial and non-industrial employees are normally met. Where general agreement cannot
be reached, the Sovereign‘s Birthday is to be observed on the Friday before the Spring holiday,
and the additional privilege holiday is to be taken on a date to be decided by the RAF
Commander after consultation with the installation commander and according to MOD
directives. Similar consideration applies to those days observed instead of Christmas and New
Year‘s Days should British and American practices differ, for example, when these holidays fall
on Saturday.
 22                                                   USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


4.7. Status on US Legal Holidays. Except for industrial employees taking compensatory days,
employees are required to work on those US holidays that do not coincide with a British holiday
or are not covered by a substitution arrangement as discussed above. Activities schedule
workloads to ensure effective utilization of UK employees on those days. Supervisors may
excuse employees from duty only when compelling circumstances, not personal to employees,
preclude assignment of duties on those days. Supervisors submit listing of excused employees,
with explanation, to the MODPO, with a copy to the CPO, within 5 working days following the
holiday. CPOs publish reminder in local daily bulletins at least 10 days prior to the holiday.

Section 4C—-Overtime and Holiday Work

4.8. Work on UK Public and Privilege Holiday or Sundays:
   4.8.1. Non-Industrial Staff. Non-industrial staff in overtime grades that work on public
   holidays or Sundays have the option of receiving payment at the appropriate rate. For work
   performed on UK privilege holidays, staff in overtime grades are normally granted time off
   instead, with no additional payment. If time off instead cannot be granted, no additional
   payment is given unless the individual exceeds the conditioned work hours. Staff in non-
   overtime grades will not be given additional payment in any of these circumstances, but
   should be granted time off instead whenever possible.
   4.8.2. Industrial Employees. Industrial employees who work on Easter Monday, Spring
   holiday, Late Summer holiday, Boxing Day, and New Year‘s Day, will normally receive a
   full days‘ pay plus time and a half for all hours worked. Employees who work on Christmas
   Day or Good Friday will normally be paid double time for all hours worked, plus a full day‘s
   pay. For work on all other UK holidays, employees will normally receive a full day‘s pay
   plus the standard rate for all hours worked. As an exception to the above, employees may
   request and be granted compensatory time off, in which case they will receive only the full
   day‘s pay for the holiday. Approval for time off instead must always be obtained from
   MODPO before the holiday in order to prevent payment to the employee at enhanced rates
   for the time worked. These provisions do not apply to industrial grade fire service employees
   for whom a special flat rate of pay is authorized.
4.9. Overtime Rates of Pay. Since overtime rates vary considerably according to employee‘s
category, only a minimum amount of information of a general nature is provided. Answers to
specific questions should be obtained from the MODPO office.
   4.9.1. Non-Industrial Staff. Overtime performed by most grades during the normal tour of
   duty (Monday through Friday) is paid only for hours beyond the established work week (41-
   42 hours gross), at one and a half basic rate up to and including band D, plain time above
   band D. Overtime rates are payable for all work performed during the weekend, Saturday at
   time and a half, Sunday at double time.
   4.9.2. Industrial Employees. The normal weekly hours for most industrial grades schedule
   cover 39 hours (net from Monday through Friday). Hours in excess of normal daily hours
   are paid at one and a half basic rate. All hours worked between Friday midnight and
   Saturday midnight are paid at one and a half basic rate, and all hours on Sunday are paid at
   double basic rate, even for shift workers. These provisions do not apply to industrial grade
   fire service employees.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  23


4.10. Procedures. MOD employees submit requests for overtime or holiday work to the
designated approving officials according to locally established procedures, which may vary by
base and command. Installation commanders are required to establish with the CPO. CPOs
publish these procedures as supplements to this instruction according to AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management. Use AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday,
Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, for obtaining prior approval for overtime or holiday
work that will performed by employees. The MOD cannot make payment for overtime without
approved AF Form 428. Request must be submitted sufficiently in advance to ensure that
approval is obtained before such work, except in bona fide emergency situations. Regularly
scheduled overtime or Holiday work is subject to the prior approval of the organization
commander, the availability of appropriate funds, and full written justification by the operating
official concerned.

Section 4D—-Time and Attendance Reporting

4.11. Attendance Requirements. UK civilian employees are required to comply with
established tours of duty. Those who habitually fail to report for work punctually are liable to
disciplinary action. Residence in a locality remote from their place of work will not be accepted
as an excuse for irregularity in attendance or tardiness. Employees who are prevented by illness
or other cause from reporting for work are required to notify their supervisor immediately of the
reason. MOD Forms 426, Record of Attendance, for Non-Industrial Personnel and MOD Form
217, Attendance Card, for industrial employees (both forms are obtainable from MODPO) are
maintained as required by the MODPO. These records are the basis for the payment of salaries
and wages and it is essential that they are accurate and current at all times. Non-industrial staff
are not required to conform to sign-on, sign-off procedures, but instead, activity supervisors will
submit weekly occurrence reports (obtainable from MODPO) to the local MODPO
representative, to certify that the attendance of the staff has been regular except as shown on the
form.
4.12. Responsibilities:
   4.12.1. MODPO representatives are responsible for:
       4.12.1.1. Providing and distributing appropriate time cards and attendance sheets.
       4.12.1.2. Advising supervisors of the completion of these records and the procedure for
       notification of absences.
       4.12.1.3. Monitoring the timely submission of completed section records, resolving
       apparent discrepancies, and subsequent completion and submission of such data as the
       Pay Office (PPA [Bath] or Cheadle Hulme) may require for the computation of pay.
   4.12.2. Supervisors of Industrial Employees:
       4.12.2.1. Ensure that the register or cards are removed from the normal place of signing
       following the authorized time for commencing work and are not replaced until the normal
       closing time.
       4.12.2.2. Require employees who arrive late or leave early to record in red ink under
       personal observation their actual time of arrival or departure.

        4.12.2.3. Confirm the accuracy of times reported by employees and initial the registers or
        cards daily.
        4.12.2.4. Ensure that AF Forms 428 are completed and submitted to the MODPO in a
        timely manner.
        4.12.2.5. Ensure leave records are kept up-to-date.
     4.12.3. Supervisors of Non-Industrial Staff:
        4.12.3.1. Ensure AF Forms 428 are completed and submitted to the MODPO in a timely
        manner.
        4.12.3.2. Ensure leave records are kept up-to-date.
        4.12.3.3. Identification, on the weekly attendance report, of all deviations from
        conditioned hours of work each day by use of the following codes:

                                              from a qualified medical practitioner (see paragraph
                                              4.4.2.2.).
SC               Self-Certified Sick Leave    SC is used to cover periods of absence up to 7
                                              calendar days due to illness not supported by a
                                              medical certificate from a qualified medical
                                              practitioner.
AE               Administrative Excuse        AE issued to cover authorized periods of paid absence
                                              on US legal holidays not coinciding with a UK public
                                              or privilege holiday (see paragraph 4.7.).
OT               Casual Overtime              OT is used to report not regularly scheduled overtime.
A                Absent                       Reason unknown.
     4.12.4. If an absence is for the minimum annual leave period of a half-day only a.m. or p.m.,
     as appropriate, is to be inserted. For casual overtime the exact overtime worked, for
     example, 1700 to 1930 is to be inserted. An attendance report must be completed and
     submitted even if there are no absences or casual overtime to be reported. All casual
     overtime reported must be accompanied by a copy of approved AF Form 428. The
     attendance report is not to include any person performing regular overtime or shift work or
     claiming long hours of attendance on a separate and detailed record of attendance.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  25


4.13. Submission of Attendance Records to MODPO. Supervisors responsible for
maintaining time and attendance records will forward attendance records and time cards to the
servicing MODPO or other designated individual to assure arrival by Monday morning following
the end of the workweek, or otherwise as notified according to local arrangements.
4.14. Late Arrival of Industrial Employees. Industrial (blue collar) employees who arrive at
their place of duty within 1 hour of the normal time for beginning work will be allowed to begin
work. If they arrive more than 1 hour late, they may only be permitted to start work on that day
at the discretion of their supervisor unless the late arrival was caused by circumstances outside
their control (for example, breakdown of transportation, inclement weather, etc.).

Section 4E—-Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel

4.15. Conditions Governing TDY. TDY travel must be approved in advance and US Air Force
travel authorization must be issued authorizing the travel. These employees perform duty travel
under MOD conditions of service, and their entitlement to pay and travel allowances is governed
by regulations of that Ministry.
   4.15.1. The MOD makes payment directly to the traveler for all authorized travel expenses
   incurred. The only payment incident to travel performed by indirect hire employees who
   may be made direct from US Air Force funds is the cost of transportation when procured by a
   US government transportation request. No payment may be made from US Air Force funds
   directly to the traveler.
   4.15.2. As indicated in paragraph 1.3, the USAF reimburses the MOD for all authorized
   travel expenses incurred by indirect hire employees. The MOD issues claims for
   reimbursement of these travel expenses monthly to the appropriate USAF organization
   responsible for funding the TDY travel costs incurred. Local travel funds must therefore be
   obligated at the time the travel authorization is issued. The obligations so recorded are
   liquidated when the USAF pays the MOD claim for reimbursements for travel expenses
   incurred.
   4.15.3. The USAF official authorizing temporary duty travel is required to observe the
   normal precautions of ensuring the genuine necessity for such travel and the use of the most
   economic means of transportation, taking all the circumstances into account.
4.16. Travel Within the UK:
   4.16.1. The organization to which the individual is assigned is responsible for the
   preparation and distribution of DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of
   DOD Personnel, with the back of order overprinted as shown in USAFE Form 197,
   Temporary Duty Back for Non-US Citizens (UK). Identify the appropriate items on the back
   of order in Block 16, Remarks, of DD Form 1610. Requesting organizations must comply
   with the provision of AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders.
   4.16.2. The central base administration completes and reproduces DD Form 1610 in
   sufficient copies to provide normal distribution to the traveler, three copies to the Accounting
   and Finance Officer, two copies to the requesting organization, and two copies to the
   MODPO.
 26                                                    USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


4.17. Special Conditions Governing Travel Outside the UK:
   4.17.1. All travel to areas outside the UK requires prior notification be given to the MODPO.
   This action is necessary in order to allow sufficient time to provide advance of pay and
   allowance, to brief the employee concerned, and if travel is to the US, to provide letters of
   identification. Failure to provide adequate notification may result in a cash advance to the
   employee being restricted or not available. In the case of travel to the United States,
   approval may be withheld, and advance notification is to be given to the MODPO by
   supervisors at least 4 weeks before the desired departure date for travel to the US and 3
   weeks for travel to other areas. The MODPO will be responsible for forwarding the request
   to the MODLO.
   4.17.2. The MODLO accountant will ensure that cash advances required by the traveler are
   provided, within entitlement, for the period of TDY.
   4.17.3. The traveler will be responsible for the possession of a valid passport and any
   necessary visas and immunization records in connection with the period of TDY.
   4.17.4. If travel is to the US, the traveler is to be in possession of an MOD letter of
   identification to prevent any possible difficulties in regard to payment of medical expenses
   should urgent medical treatment be required. The letter will be issued in duplicate through
   the MODPO at the time authority to travel is given. The original copy is to be retained by
   the traveler and on completion of the TDY returned to the MODPO for cancellation. The
   traveler should be instructed not to carry the letter of identification in his passport.
4.18. Processing Requests for Travel Outside the UK. In addition to the procedures for
requesting, justifying, and authorizing travel outlined in paragraph 4.14, the following
procedures apply:
   4.18.1. The CPO serves as the control point for employees outside the UK. Following
   notification of the requirement, the CPO coordinates with the MODPO and MODLO as
   necessary, requests the port call, obtains the air movement designator, reporting points and
   times, and briefs the employee on the travel arrangements.
   4.18.2. Since the DD Form 1610 completed for travel contains a statement that travel outside
   the UK has been authorized, it is most important that notification is completed and approval
   obtained, where appropriate, before the orders are issued to the employee.
4.19. Supervisor’s Counter-Signature on Employee’s Travel Claim. Upon completion of
TDY travel, the employee submits the travel claim on MOD Form 305, Travel and Subsistence
Claim (Civilians), (obtainable from MODPO or MODLO), prepared according to MOD
directives. Following review by the US Air Force-designated supervisor that the travel was
performed according to the travel authorization and that the claim is in order, the form is ready
for verification. A travel claim verification sheet, obtainable from MODPO, should be signed by
GS-11, step 3, or above and be attached to the MOD Form 305. Obtain guidance on MOD travel
and subsistence from the MODLO.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   27


                                            Chapter 5

                        EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

Section 5A—-Discipline

5.1. Introduction. The various facets of the supervisor‘s job, which affect relationships with
employees, have been included in this chapter. These encompass the rules, which govern the
handling of discipline and complaints, evaluation of performance, promotions, and recognition.
5.2. Purpose of Discipline. The purpose of disciplinary procedures is to encourage good
behavior and correct offenders. Discipline is a complex area and subject to UK employment
laws. All cases must be dealt with by the MODPOs.

Section 5B—-Complaint Procedures

5.3. Basic Policy. USAF philosophy and practices on maintaining good employee-management
relations are just as applicable in handling complaints of UK employees as they are in resolving
dissatisfactions of our US citizen personnel. Under this policy UK employees will be free from
restraint, discrimination, or reprisals in making complaints or filing grievances.
5.4. Procedures. Employees should be encouraged to iron out job-related complaints through
frank discussion with their supervisor since most problems can be resolved at the worker and
supervisor level. However, the progressively more formal steps described below may be taken if
any dissatisfaction still remains:
   5.4.1. If employees are dissatisfied with the solution reached after initially presenting an oral
   complaint to their immediate supervisor, they may present the complaint either orally or in
   writing to the official in charge of the section.
   5.4.2. If still dissatisfied, employees may forward their complaints in writing to the RAF
   Commander through their supervisor.
   5.4.3. Should RAF Commanders not be able to resolve a complaint to the employee‘s
   satisfaction, the commanders will submit a full report on the complaint to RAF HQ Air
   Command. If the complaint involves a US supervisor or employee, the complaint or
   grievance will be resolved in accordance with the MOD/U.S. Forces Joint Grievance Policy
   found at Attachment 5.
5.5. Time Limits. Complaints capable of resolution at local level are investigated and a
decision given the employee within 10 workdays after submission to each supervisory or higher
level of appeal. RAF HQ Air Command will give a decision on complaints, which cannot be
resolved at a local level, as soon as practicable. If the complaint is made in writing, the decision
is given in writing with information on further appeal channels if the decision is not acceptable to
the employee.

Section 5C—-Whitley Committees

5.6. Background. The Whitley Committee in the British Civil Service was originated in 1919
as the end product of a Parliamentary study, chaired by the Rt. Hon. J. H. Whitley, M. P., (thus,
 28                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


its name) to improve management and labor relationships in the UK through consultative
methods. Since then, Whitley Committees have been established on the local, departmental, and
nationwide levels, the latter known as the Civil Service National Whitley Council.
5.7. Objectives. Whitley Committees provide a recognized formal means for management and
employees to consult on various aspects of employment. Through such consultation, our UK
employees are given a wide interest in, and greater responsibility for, the conditions under which
their work is performed. The committee provides a means to assure that regulations contained in
collective agreements made on behalf of employees are placed into effect. Further, the meetings
of the Whitley Committees, which are generally held once every 3 months or more often, if the
occasion demands, permit discussions between management officials and employees to reduce
friction and misunderstanding between the two groups. Thus, the results of the Whitley
Committees are considerable in assuring better employee management relations in the UK.
5.8. Composition. Whitley Committees are composed of representatives from both
management and the UK employee work force:
   5.8.1. The official (management) side consists of representatives from the MODPO, the
   RAF Commander of the installation (who normally acts as chair), and a senior staff
   representative of the US Air Force in observer status only..
   5.8.2. The Trade Union (employee) side consists of elected employee representatives, each
   of whom must be a member of a staff association or a trade union. The employee side
   appoints a vice chair.
5.9. US Force Recognition. The official attitude of US Force management officials as well as
the day-to-day working cooperation and interest of supervisors of UK employees are important
factors involved in Whitley Committee functions and the relationship with employee
representation groups.
   5.9.1. At bases where the Whitley Committees are established, US Force commanders give
   their fullest cooperation in providing a suitable meeting place and participating in the
   operation of the committee through designation of a senior staff official as US Force observer
   on the management side of the committee.
   5.9.2. The right of all UK civilian employees to belong to staff associations or trade unions
   will be recognized, and in so belonging to be free from any direct or implied coercion,
   discrimination, or reprisal.
   5.9.3. There is a legal obligation for MOD to consult with TUs on any matters effecting
   employment. It is imperative that supervisors keep the MODPO informed of all potential
   changes.
   5.9.4. The MOD conducts all oral or written negotiations with staff associations and trade
   unions on any matters pertaining to MOD civilians.

Section 5D—-Performance Evaluation

5.10. Value of Performance Evaluation. A continuous evaluation of work performance is an
important supervisory responsibility since this is an essential step in assuring an efficient work
force. Performance evaluation is of real interest to employees because the overall assessment
mark determines the pay level for the following year. This evaluation is a major factor in
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  29


determining whether they will be retained in their jobs. It also becomes a permanent part of their
official records and could reflect on their possibilities for promotion or advancement and future
careers in the MOD.
5.11. Performance Requirements. Employees who know what work they are to do and how
well they are to do it will usually be more successful in accomplishing it in a highly satisfactory
manner. Therefore, employees must understand and, hopefully, agree to their objectives on their
Performance Appraisal Review (PAR) at the beginning of the reporting year. It is also important
to give feedback on how they are performing by frequent discussions about their work and how it
compares with what is expected from them on the PAR. Objective comments and constructive
criticism will greatly help employees to do their jobs in a satisfactory manner.
5.12. Probationary (Trial) Period. Employees who are working for the British Civil Service
must serve a probationary period of 12 months. This period may be extended if the supervisor
decides that an employee has the potential to do the job satisfactorily but deserves more time to
demonstrate ability. Conversely, if the supervisor considers that a new employee is totally
unsuited to the job after completion of on-the-job training and the normal process of
encouragement and warnings proved useless, the supervisor forwards a recommendation in
writing to the MODPO. Failure to initiate action to extend the probationary period or
recommend removal action well in advance of the completion of the probationary period may
result in the employee‘s appointment being confirmed, when such action becomes considerably
more complex.
5.13. Unsatisfactory Performance. Unsatisfactory performance and unsatisfactory attendance
(restoring efficiency) should never be condoned, and action should always be initiated to secure
an improvement in an individual‘s performance or attendance so that it reaches a satisfactory
level. Action should not be delayed unduly and should never be delayed until the annual staff
report is due. In all instances guidance should be sought from the MODPO. Unsatisfactory
performance and attendance are dealt with under the MOD restoring efficiency program
5.14. Performance and Development Report (PDR). Supervisors of non-industrial employees
are requested to submit their evaluation using the MOD Form 1720, Performance and
Development Report (PDR). This report is for the use of MOD and is retained in the employee‘s
file. The PDR form and guidance notes are obtainable from the MODPO or the MODPO
Bulletin Boards. Each employee is notified of the suspense date for the submission. It is
important that the instructions are followed carefully in preparing of the report. Supervisors will
be given detailed training on PDR completion. PDRs should at all times be fair and factual, and
should never hesitate to draw attention to any significant weaknesses in performance of duties
that have been previously discussed with the individual. When completed, these reports must be
shown to and discussed with the employee being rated after discussion with the countersigning
officer. The report is returned to the employee after the countersigning officer‘s assessment is
made. Further information and advice can be obtained from the MODPO office.

Section 5E—-Promotion or Advancement Policies and Procedures

5.15. Basic Principles. The MOD promotion or advancement system varies considerably from
the promotion or advancement processes that govern advancement of our US citizen employees.
It is important to recognize and consider several major differences discussed below between this
system and that applicable to US citizen employees, to prevent misunderstandings and fruitless
 30                                                    USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


attempts to seek promotion or advancement for UK civilian employees based on US Civil
Service and US Air Force principles and practices.
   5.15.1. MOD grades and pay bands are personal to the individual (comparable to rank in the
   military). In the US Civil Service, civilian grades are attached to the job held and are never
   personal to the individuals themselves.
   5.15.2. In the MOD, a non-industrial employee is promoted or advanced only after receiving
   the necessary marks on the PARs and achieving the necessary competencies for the grade. In
   the US program, an individual generally remains in one field or one line of work and receives
   promotion or advancements in that specialty.
   5.15.3. Individuals are seldom, if ever, promoted in MOD solely because of increase of
   responsibilities in current job assignment, as is frequently the case in the US Civil Service.
   This facet of the British system must be kept in mind by US supervisors of UK employees
   since this is one of the most frequently misunderstood provisions in that system.
   5.15.4. Promotion or advancement in the MOD is always by open and fair competition at a
   promotion or advancement board. This can either be a centralized review held by a major
   budget area, e.g., RAF HQ Air Command or for an individual post.
5.16. Procedures on Promotion or Advancement Actions. The following provisions are
applicable when filling a UK civilian position vacancy by promotion or advancement or when a
filled position is upgraded.
   5.16.1. The MOD promotion or advancement system policies and procedures will apply.
   Supervisors should consult MODPO representative on a case-by-case basis.
   5.16.2. In the event of a position being upgraded, the incumbent is not necessarily promoted
   to the higher-grade level. The MOD, through RAF HQ Air Command and the local MODPO
   office, endeavor to fill vacant or upgraded positions by reassignment of surplus employees.
   The supervisor is given the opportunity of conducting an interview to fill the post. In the
   short term, the most suitable local employee may be recommended for temporary and
   geographical promotion or advancement.
   5.16.3. Supervisors of MOD employees are not to attempt to obtain a promotion or
   advancement for an employee through internal negotiation with other supervisors or by
   requesting an upgrading of a UK position solely for this purpose. In view of the special
   procedures on promotion or advancement in the MOD described above, considerable
   employee dissatisfaction can result in instances where promotion or advancements promised
   by supervisors cannot be affected.

Section 5F—-Employee Recognition

5.17. Recognition Methods. Employees are eligible for cash awards for adopted suggestions
and are encouraged to submit suggestions that will benefit US Force operations. They are also
eligible for certain types of recognition discussed below. These are positive ways of recognizing
and rewarding the accomplishments of UK employees and stimulating their interest in
management problems. The effectiveness of these methods depends to a large extend on a fair,
consistent approach on the part of supervisors in recognizing their good work.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              31


5.18. The Innovative Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program
(Suggestion Program). A suggestion is any idea designed to speed up production; improve
operations, work conditions, administrative procedures, and methods of equipment; save
materials, promote health or morale, or increase safety. In short, any ideas to get the US Air
Force job done better, faster, and cheaper (see AFI 38-401, The Air Force Innovative
Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program).. The major facets of this
important program are discussed below:
   5.18.1. Submission and Promotion or Advancement. Suggestions are normally submitted
   on AF Form 1000, IDEA Application. Use of this form is recommended because of easier
   processing, but suggestions submitted by other means will be accepted. Suggestions are sent
   to the base suggestion monitor at the installation where assigned. All suggestions are given
   fair and prompt evaluation by the office having primary interest and processed through an
   incentive awards committee. Normally, a cash award is paid for every suggestion adopted
   and put into effect. If a suggestion is not adopted, the suggestor is told exactly why. A
   suggestor‘s name is not disclosed if so desired.
   5.18.2. Cash Awards. The amount of the cash award is based on the tangible dollar savings
   or intangible benefits derived from the suggestion. Awards are paid to UK personnel in
   sterling, through the MODLO, and are not normally subject to income tax.
   5.18.3. Participation. The US Air Force consistently maintains an outstanding record of
   employee participation. Each employee is encouraged to participate actively in the
   suggestion program by submitting ideas on how to improve methods, procedures, work
   conditions, etc. Supervisors have an important added role--that of continuously working with
   their employees to make them aware of the program and its benefits to them and the US Air
   Force.
5.19. MOD Suggestion Scheme (GEMS). The purpose of this scheme is to foster cooperation
of civilian personnel in the drive for efficiency and economy within the MOD organization, and
MOD employees are encouraged by monetary awards to submit suggestions. Details of the
scheme are contained in MOD Personnel Manuals, which are available in the MODPO, and
publicity is given through the media of RAF HQ Air Command or local MODPO
announcements.
5.20. Types of Awards:
   5.20.1. Honorary Awards. See AFI 36-1004, The Air Force Civilian Recognition
   Program; and USAFEI 36-731, The USAFE Non-US Recognition Program. This award is
   granted to recognize exceptionally meritorious service of major significance to the US Force
   in the performance of duties in a manner clearly exceptional to others.
   5.20.2. Air Force Valor Award. This award recognizes an act of heroism, with voluntary
   risk of personal safety in the face of danger either on or off the job.
   5.20.3. Outstanding Civilian Service Award. This is honorary recognition, for outstanding
   career service meriting recognition at time of retirement.
   5.20.4. Meritorious Civilian Service Award. This award is granted on a highly selective
   basis for outstanding contribution in an exemplary manner and of major significance to the
   Air Force. It is not appropriate for employees about to retire.
 32                                                    USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


   5.20.5. Air Force Command Valor Award. This award recognizes unusual courage or
   competence in an emergency, either on or off the job, unrelated to performance of official
   duties.
   5.20.6. Exemplary Civilian Service Award. This award is granted to recognize an
   individual or group for clearly outstanding service in the support of the command mission or
   goals.
   5.20.7. USAFE Medal of Merit. This decoration is given in recognition of outstanding
   service, achievements, or support of the mission of the United States Air Forces in Europe.
   5.20.8. USAFE Medal of Distinction. This decoration is granted in recognition of
   extraordinary service, special achievements, or significant support to the accomplishments of
   the United States Air Forces in Europe.
5.21. Letters of Commendation and Appreciation. Care should be exercised in the text of
letters of commendation and appreciation due to their relationship to Annual Staff Reports (see
Chapter 5.14, Section 5D), and contradiction between them avoided. Copies of these letters
should always be forwarded to the MODPO for inclusion in the employee‘s personnel file.
Supervisors are urged to contact their MODPO representative when one of their MOD
employees appears to deserve such recognition (see AFI 36-1004).
5.22. Service Recognition:
   5.22.1. Service with US Forces is recognized by the award of certificates of service and
   service emblems upon completion of the first 10 years of service and subsequently upon the
   completion of each 5-year period of service, or upon separation under reduction-in-force
   procedures regardless of length of service.
   5.22.2. Retirement certificates are given to employees when they retire under the retirement
   provisions of the host country.
   5.22.3. Preparation of certificates and arrangements for presentation is made by the CPO
   following notification by RAF HQ Air Command of completion of the qualifying periods of
   service.
5.23. MOD Special Bonus Scheme. This scheme is solely for the purpose of recognizing
outstanding performance either by individuals or teams of a special project, task, exercise, or
particular demanding situation. All staff is eligible to receive special bonus awards. The scheme
is not intended for rewarding sustained outstanding performance. Full details of the scheme are
announced quarterly and nominations are to be made on MOD Form 944, Special Bonus Award,
available from the local MODPO.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 33


                                           Chapter 6

                                        SEPARATIONS

Section 6A—-Resignations

6.1. Notice Requirements. Employees are expected to furnish written advance notice of
resignation. This notice normally consists of 1 month in the case of all employees.
Exceptionally a shorter period of notice may be accepted depending upon the circumstances, but
in all cases supervisors are to advise whether or not a waiver of notice is recommended. The
waiver will be taken into consideration by the MODPO in reaching a decision.
6.2. Procedures. An employee may give oral notice of intent to resign, but such notice should
be confirmed in writing and passed by the supervisor, to the MODPO. The supervisor should
endeavor to ascertain the employee‘s exact reason for resigning, especially if it appears to
concern job-related conditions

Section 6B—-Involuntary Separation

6.3. Separation for Cause. Employees may be separated for cause (dismissed) for serious
misconduct, which makes them unsuitable for continued employment with the MOD, or for
continuing behavior demonstrating that the desired improvement is improbable. Some of the
reasons for initiating such action are repeated absences without leave, notorious misconduct, acts
that result in criminal proceedings against the employee, and repeated instances of
insubordination.
   6.3.1. Procedures. The procedures to be applied when a supervisor considers that an
   employee should be separated for cause are similar to those for disciplinary action contained
   in Chapter 5, Section 5A. The final decision, in all cases, as to whether the circumstances are
   such that dismissal is appropriate, will be made by the MOD.
6.4. Reduction-in-Force (RIF). RIF or redundancy procedures of the MOD are applicable
when a reduction of civilian authorizations affects MOD civilian employees. Supervisors who
have some acquaintance with US RIF procedures will appreciate similarities of the British
system to our system; especially regarding the job protection afforded a career employee over the
non-career employee. It should be noted, however, that the impact of RIF involving mobile
grade employees is not necessarily confined to one installation since such employees may be
able to displace more junior employees at another installation. The net result of a RIF may be
that the incumbent of an US Air Force position that is abolished displaces an employee at a
MOD installation, and the latter employee is the one to be separated.
   6.4.1. RIF Categories. In a RIF, there are two categories of MOD employees:
       6.4.1.1. Established Civil Servants. These individuals would be considered career or
       permanent employees in the US system. An established civil servant may be surplus or
       redundant in a US Air Force organization but an employee is rarely surplus in the British
       Civil Service. If a suitable vacancy is not available, such a vacancy will normally be
       created by separation of an unestablished (temporary) employee.
34                                                     USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


     6.4.1.2. Casual and Fixed Term Civil Servants. These are employees who in the US
     system should be called non-status employees. They do not have the permanent tenure
     granted to established personnel. RIF of casual and fixed term civil servants normally
     operates by grades on an installation. Employees with the shortest length of service in
     the grade are the first to become surplus in that grade. In other words, the elimination of
     a position in a particular section does not necessarily involve the discard of the
     incumbent. If the surplus employee is senior by length of service, the employee is
     generally transferred to another section to displace an individual in the same grade who
     has less service.
  6.4.2. Official Notice of RIF. RIF, no matter how necessary, has an impact not only on the
  employees adversely affected but also on the entire work force and the local community,
  especially if the number of spaces involved is considerable. For this reason, it is essential
  that appropriate authorities received the maximum possible notice of impending reduction.
  Maximum is defined as the employee notice period plus a maximum of 90 days lead time for
  the preparation of the RIF.
     6.4.2.1. The civilian personnel officer, on behalf of the serviced commander, notifies
     RAF HQ Air Command directly in writing, of any planned reduction which impact on
     MOD civilian strength. This will be done at the time that approval to conduct a RIF is
     sought (see paragraph 6.4.2.3), and again when such approval is granted, RAF HQ Air
     Command, in turn, notifies trade unions, staff associations, and the work force.
     Disclosure to the news media or the work force is not to be made by US Forces
     commanders, operating officials, or supervisors.
     6.4.2.2. When it is proposed to conduct a major RIF involving 25 or more MOD
     employees at one location, it is essential that the earliest possible notification be given as
     described in paragraph 6.4.2, including information in the phase-out dates of the
     positions involved. A copy of this notification must be given to the CPO at RAF
     Mildenhall. Following notification of the approval of the RIF, RAF HQ Air Command
     advises the MOD, trade unions, and staff association, before making any release to the
     news media or an announcement to the work force. RAF HQ Air Command makes the
     announcement as authorized by MOD. Action to implement the RIF cannot commence
     until this announcement is made.
     6.4.2.3. Approval to conduct a RIF involving MOD employees will be sought from HQ
     USAFE/DPC by the CPO. HQ USAFE/DPC coordinated with other services components
     according to European Command Directive 30-6, Administration of Civilian Employees
     in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR), Appendix D
     prior to approving the RIF.
  6.4.3. Accomplishing the RIF:
     6.4.3.1. When a decrease in UK civilian authorization occurs, the US Air Force
     commander concerned identifies those spaces and incumbents of positions that will be
     eliminated. Such determinations are always the responsibilities of the US Air Force as
     the utilizer of UK personnel.
     6.4.3.2. The MODPO is notified of specific positions declared surplus through
     submission of SF 52, or in cases of base draw downs involving large reductions, a copy
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              35


     of the draw down plan. The earliest practicable notice is important due to the notice
     period to which MOD employees are entitled when retention at the present grade is not
     possible. Pay instead of notice is mandatory if the following minimum periods of notice
     are not observed:
        6.4.3.2.1. Industrial Employees:
            6.4.3.2.1.1. Established employees 60 years of age or under--6 months.
            6.4.3.2.1.2. Established employees over 60 but under 65, with less than 10 years
            service--1 year.
            6.4.3.2.1.3. Established employees over 60 but under 65 with 10 or more, but less
            than 25 years service--9 months.
            6.4.3.2.1.4. Unestablished employees who have completed 2 years service and
            who have accepted a liability to transfer--3 months. Unestablished employees
            who have completed less than 2 years service - 2 weeks.
        6.4.3.2.2. Non-Industrial Staff:
            6.4.3.2.2.1. All established staff under 60 years of age--6 months.
            6.4.3.2.2.2. Notice to established staff age 60 and over will be extended by 6
            months for those with less than 10 years service, to a total of 12 months, and by 3
            months for those with 10 to 25 years service, to a total of 9 months. These
            extensions will not run beyond the 65th birthday.
            6.4.3.2.2.3. Unestablished staff with 2 years, but less than 5 years service--3
            months.
            6.4.3.2.2.4. Unestablished staff (monthly paid) with 4 weeks but less than 2 years
            service--5 weeks.
            6.4.3.2.2.5. Unestablished staff (weekly paid) with 4 weeks but less than 2 years
            service--2 weeks.
     6.4.3.3. The RIF will be accomplished according to applicable MOD regulations. The
     MODPO or RAF HQ Air Command identifies the specific employees affected by the
     RIF, prepare and deliver required notices, and effect separation or reassignment actions
     as necessary. Supervisors of affected employees and positions are informed by the
     MODPO of the impact of RIF actions affecting their area. It is important that all US Air
     Force commanders, supervisors, and other personnel cooperate fully with representatives
     of the MODPO and RAF HQ Air Command in implementing a RIF.

                                            Chapter 7

                                           TRAINING

7.1. Introduction. In general, training UK civilian employees to meet requirements of their
positions is governed by the same principles, objectives, and procedures as applied for training of
US civilian and military personnel. Consequently, training for UK civilians will be given on the
basis of needs and afforded the same attention as the training of US personnel. The primary
responsibility rests with the supervisor who is in the best position to determine needs of
employees, type of training required, and, in most cases, to provide the necessary training at the
worksite. For non-industrial staff 2-day core competence training is required, as is Equal
Opportunity training for industrial supervisors. Assistance in all aspects of training throughout
this chapter may be obtained from the CPO or MODPO for MOD training. The CPO can also
furnish special assistance in determining the appropriate training source. AFI 36-401, Employee
Training and Development, contains guidance on the training and employee development in
addition to the information in this chapter. The CPO has issued, and will continue to issue,
supplementary information as an additional means of assisting supervisors and operating
officials in meeting training responsibilities.
7.2. Determining and Documenting Training Needs. Some training needs are obvious or
automatically generated from assignment of new employees, statutory requirements, and new
types of equipment, or changes in procedures. Other training requirements are determined
through observation or an analysis of skills required versus an employee‘s capabilities. The
supervisor, in daily contact with employees, will encounter indicators of possible training needs
such as backlogs, inability to meet deadlines, frequent errors, poor workmanship, accidents, and
damage to equipment. The CPO conducts an Annual Training Survey (ATS) to assist
supervisors in identifying training needs. Supervisors should advise the CPO of existing and
anticipated training requirements that cannot be satisfied at the worksite.
7.3. Meeting Training Needs. Supervisors should select a training source, which provides the
required development of an employee‘s skills and knowledge in the most effective and
economical manner. Special attention should be given to meeting the needs through on-the-job
training, Career Development Centers (CDC), US Air Force resources, other US government
agencies, or MOD. Non-US or UK government courses will be used only if justified by reason
of effectiveness and economy. Supervisors are reminded that the MOD offers a significant range
of core competence and specialist training courses. Supervisors should note that staff is
encouraged to attain professional qualifications.
   7.3.1. Job Induction. Supervisors will provide initial orientation of the new employee to
   the job, fellow workers, tools and equipment, available facilities, special rules and
   regulations of the section, and continue through on-the-job training.
   7.3.2. On-the-Job Training (OJT). Planned OJT is the primary means for supervisors to
   develop skills and knowledge of newly appointed as well as other employees to increase the
   level of proficiency, attain and maintain safe workmanship, cross train employees into new
   jobs, and meet requirements resulting from changes in methods or procedures. If it is
   necessary for the supervisor to select an instructor to conduct OJT or assist in it, the
   instructor must be familiar with teaching techniques and should preferably have completed
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                37


  instruction training. The supervisor should prepare an outline for all OJT requiring more
  than 40 hours of instruction. The use of self-development opportunities and supplementary
  off-the-job courses should be considered in the preparation of these plans and incorporated,
  wherever possible. The training plan, (part of the employee‘s PAR (see paragraph 5.14)
  once prepared, should also facilitate preparation for, and conduct of, training required in the
  future. The outline or lesson plan should be submitted to the Training Liaison Officer
  (MODPO) before starting the training. This should provide for an exchange of training
  materials to facilitate preparation of plans for OJT and to prevent duplication of work. If the
  required training cannot be effectively provided at the worksite or must be supplemented by a
  special course, the supervisor should promptly request the CPO for assistance in locating
  training sources. This notification is especially important when UK employees are required
  to attend courses in the US, at other US Air Force or Department of Defense (DoD) facilities,
  or at non-US or non-UK government agencies. Attention is drawn to Chapter 4, Section 4E,
  and the need to notify MODPO well in advance of any requirement for an employee to
  proceed on TDY outside the UK.
  7.3.3. On-Base Classroom Training. Requirements for the development of managerial
  skills and of capabilities in areas such as, information technology (IT) skills, military
  correspondence, and office procedures normally will be met at courses centrally conducted or
  arranged by the CPO. Representatives of the CPO will arrange for scheduling courses and
  employees, as required. The US Air Force civilian supervisors‘ course is mandatory for all
  first- and second-level supervisors who have not had an equivalent course and for all newly
  appointed supervisors within the first 6 months after their assignment. Other courses in
  management training will be provided as required.
  7.3.4. Off-Base Training. External training opportunities should be considered as
  supplementary rather than the sole training opportunity. They will be used primarily to meet
  requirements that cannot be satisfied locally and to create or improve a training capability at
  the base. Supervisors should give priority consideration to the selection of employees
  qualified to absorb the instruction and to teach other personnel upon return from training.
  Supervisors should coordinate with the CPO in the selection and scheduling of employees for
  training at off base training facilities to ensure that the request is compatible with the base
  program and meets the regulatory requirements associated with processing and funding such
  training. DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and
  Reimbursement, will be used to schedule off-base training.
  7.3.5. Self-Development. Meeting established needs as well as the desire of employees to
  acquire broader professional experience, knowledge, and skills can be better satisfied if
  supervisors motivate and guide their employees toward use of available materials or facilities
  for self-study. Supervisors should contact the CPO to supplement their own knowledge of
  technical materials and correspondence courses available in their functional areas, such as
  Extension Course Institute (ECI) courses, and for information concerning opportunities for
  self-development existing is the local area. Periodically the CPO will publish a list of
  educational and training organizations that provide opportunities and should incorporate
  these activities in the overall training plan for employees. Upon completion of extensive
  study to gain a professional qualification MOD employees can be nominated for a Special
  Bonus Scheme Award. Where possible, supervisors should incorporate self-development
  activities of employees within the overall training plan for their employees. The CPO can be
 38                                                      USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


   of special assistance to supervisors and employees in making arrangements for enrollment of
   students.
   7.3.6. British Ministry of Defence Management Training Center (DMT). These regional
   centers provide training on the competence for the grade, general background, supervisory,
   and other courses for MOD civilian personnel. At the beginning of the reporting year
   personnel identified courses that are designed to assist not only in the general conduct of day-
   to-day business but also in the furtherance of their careers in the MOD. Supervisors are to
   cooperate by releasing personnel selected for courses at the DMT. If, however, the course is
   scheduled at a particularly inconvenient time and the supervisor notifies the MODPO without
   delay, arrangements can usually be made for the individual to attend the course at a later
   date.
   7.3.7. Juveniles. MOD regulations require staff less than 18 years of age to continue their
   general education where the necessary facilities exist or can be provided by the local
   education authority. Normally, they will be required to attend day classes for 1 day each
   week (or alternatively, 2 half days each week) during working hours. If this is not
   practicable because of local conditions, young people are encouraged to attend suitable
   evening classes, and are allowed time off during the day equivalent to the time spent at such
   classes plus the necessary traveling time.
   7.3.8. Supervisors of occupational jobs, e.g. firefighters, that require the completion of
   CDCs, must organize the workload to enable the employees to undertake the course during
   normal work schedules.
7.4. Evaluating Training. No training activity can be truly effective unless it has been
determined that it accomplished the objective for which designed. Supervisors should follow up
to assure that training is applied on the job; objectives are met and evaluate the benefits obtained.
An evaluation must be made for training of more than 40 hours and for all off-base training,
regardless of length. The evaluation will be issued by the Employee Development Assistant for
completion and return to CPO.
7.5. Recording and Reporting Training. Training records are tools designed to promote an
effective training process and facilitate preparation for, and conduct of, present as well as future
training. They also form a basis for assessing the value of training at the installation and
ensuring that employees receive official credit. Some of these tools have been discussed above,
for example, AF Form 1320, Training Chart, and DD Form 1556. Supervisors will use AF Form
971 to record training completions and knowledge and skills acquired through self-development.
AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, may be prepared, issued, or processed as appropriate.

         SAMPLE FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT--SHORTER WORKING WEEK

A2.1. The underpinning principle to this document is that ―work gets done when it needs to be
done‖, and all parties agree to operate within the spirit of this principle.
A2.2. The following framework will be applied uniformly at all 3AF Units in the UK. The local
RAF Commander, in conjunction with local US Management and Industrial Trade Unions will
be responsible for monitoring the Scheme and resolving any unforeseen operating problems.
A2.3. All parties agree to the following 4 principles:
   A2.3.1. Staff will continue to be conditioned to 39 hours per week and work their current
   agreed work schedules. On the basis of notional attendance each full time employee will be
   credited with 2 hours compensatory time per week.
   A2.3.2. Notional attendance will be 45 weeks per year and compensatory time off will be
   expressed in whole days, i.e. 45 x 2 hours = 90 hours which rounded down gives 11 days
   compensatory time per year.
   A2.3.3. Whenever mission requirements permit, the compensatory days will be taken on the
   7 US Holidays that do not coincide with the UK Public Holidays. The other 4 days will be
   taken on other ―down‖, ―goal‖ and ―family days‖. Whenever any of these days are not
   appropriate, alternative time off will be determined by mutual agreement and taken within 3
   months. However, the compensatory time off must not disadvantage the individual.
   A2.3.4. A separate record for compensatory time will be created by the local MOD
   Personnel Office. These records will be held by the Line Manager who will be responsible
   for maintaining the records and also recording the compensatory days on the attendance
   cards. At the end of each year the record sheets will be returned to the local MOD Personnel
   Office for scrutiny and audit purposes.
A2.4. The Framework Document will operate from the beginning of the first month following
the completion of the signature blocks.

                                              GENERAL
1.1. This arrangement describes responsibilities, conditions and relationships between MOD and the US
Forces for the employment of MOD Civil Servants to provide services to the US Forces in the United
Kingdom. This arrangement is undertaken by USAFE on behalf of all US Forces located in the UK. It
does not apply to the employment of MOD Civil Servants at US locations for which separate specific
arrangements exist.
1.2. The term ―local civilian personnel‖ means all MOD Civil Servants who are assigned for duty under
the functional control of the US Forces in appropriated fund activities.
1.3. MOD will recruit, employ, administer and pay all local UK Civilian Personnel requested by US
Forces‘ appropriated fund activities in the UK. US non-appropriated fund activities such as clubs and base
exchanges will directly hire, employ and administer local national personnel.
1.4. No binding obligation should be concluded in any negotiation between the MOD and Trade Unions
on matters exclusively relating to the provision of this arrangement without concurrence of the US Forces.

1.5. The US Forces will pay for these services by reimbursing MOD their costs arising from providing the
services. Such costs include those incurred by employing local civilian personnel for utilization by the US
Forces and by MOD employing additional personnel to provide the administrative services covered by
this arrangement.
1.6. Conditions of Service. Local civilian personnel assigned by the MOD for duties with the US Forces
will enjoy the same conditions of service, rates of pay, rights and privileges and have the same obligations
as their counterparts employed elsewhere by the MOD. This includes such features as the provisions of
canteen facilities and facilities for Trade Union representatives.
1.7 Suggestion Program. Local civilian personnel assigned by the MOD for duties with the US Forces are
authorized to participate in the USAF Innovation Development through Employee Awareness Program
(IDEA) as described in AFI 38-401. Comparable US Navy and US Army directives will apply to MOD
employees at Navy and Army installations.

                      MOD/U.S. FORCES JOINT GRIEVANCE POLICY


                       MOD/U.S. FORCES JOINT GRIEVANCE

                                               POLICY
                                          1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. The following guidance is applicable to MoD personnel working for the U.S. forces in the United
Kingdom. It has been authored by the U.S. forces who remain the owners of the policy and it is adopted
by the U.S. forces and the MOD UK as a binding policy. Any subsequent changes will be subject to
consultation.

1.2. Complaints and grievances submitted by MoD Personnel, assigned to perform duty at U.S forces
establishments in the UK, shall be handled in accordance with the MoD People Portal Grievance
Processes (the Statement) save to the extent that the Statement is varied by these policies. Where an
employee considers him or herself to be the subject of harassment, the employee can exercise his/her
rights under AFI 36-704 and/or the agreed US and MOD Harassment Policy.

1.3. Where, complaints and grievances are about U.S. civilian or military personnel and local national
direct hire employees, this local MOD/U.S. forces Grievance policy shall apply. This policy shall also
apply when a complaint is against a MOD employee embedded in the US chain of Command where the
complaint is in relation to the application or implementation of US policy or process. This policy applies
to all US Force agents and agencies to which MOD personnel are assigned. As the lead organization, the
U.S. Air Force policy outlined below shall apply.

1.4. USAF philosophy and practice on maintaining good employee-management relations are just as
applicable in handling complaints of MoD personnel, as they are in resolving dissatisfactions of our U.S.
personnel or other agencies. Under this policy MoD personnel will be free from restraint, discrimination,
or reprisals in making complaints or filing grievances.

1.5. Time limit for submitting a complaint is not later than three months following the date of the
situation arising or of the employee becoming aware. Complaints relating to occurrences more than three
months old from the date of the situation will be accepted when they represent a continuing course of
conduct at the date of the complaint or where information has come to light that could not have previously
been known. More formal steps may be taken if any dissatisfaction still remains.

1.6. Definition and analysis of a complaint. There are many situations that can be brought to a
supervisor‘s attention that when analyzed do not meet the definition of a complaint. The essence of a
complaint is normally about service at work. An employee has a valid complaint if it is clear that an
employee is complaining about an act or omission on the part of the employer. To avoid any confusion,
the employee must indicate clearly whether the complaint should be considered under the MOD‘s
grievance procedures. If an employee does not make this clear, the line manager should approach the
employee to seek clarity and confirmation. In addition, complaints can be reports of observations of
another‘s behaviour not necessarily in detriment to the individual making the complaint. It is therefore
important that complaints are carefully analyzed prior to being accepted.
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                          53


                                             2. PROCEDURES

At all stages of the procedures the individual raising a grievance is entitled to be represented or
accompanied by a Trade Union representative or workers companion.

2.1. Role of the Workers Companion or Trade Union representative

2.1.1. Employees have a statutory right, by making a reasonable request, to be accompanied by a workers
companion where the informal grievance meeting may result in a Formal grievance and or an Appeal.

Workers companions are there to accompany the employee and to give advice if necessary. Only a single
workers companion can be requested. Under the statutory rules the workers companion must be either
‗another of the employer‘s workers‘ or be an official of a trade union who is either a union employee or
certified by the union as having experience of, or training in, the role of acting as a worker‘s companion
at disciplinary or grievance hearings. If he is a fellow worker, the employer must give the representative
reasonable time off work to attend the hearing. It may not be reasonable for an employee to request a
workers companion from a remote geographical location if someone suitable and willing is available
locally.

It is very important to remember that the MOD employment program does have recognized Trades
Unions. The MOD has to negotiate or consult on any issues with Trade Unions (TU). The MOD extends
the statutory right of individuals to be members of TUs if they so wish. There are TU officials on base
that work for the MOD and represent MOD employees. If an employee chooses to be accompanied by a
TU official, that person is there as a workers companion and a consultant to the employee. This must be
made clear at the opening of the meeting by the management official conducting the meeting. The
workers companion can ask questions but does not have the right to answer questions on the employee‘s
behalf, unless agreed at the start of a meeting by the employee and the supervisor.
Consultation/discussion between the employee and their workers companion can take place and the
meeting can be adjourned for this purpose for a reasonable period of time.

Although legislation indicates that the employer MUST permit the worker‘s companion to:

        a.   Address the hearing in order to do any of the following:

                 1. Put the employee‘s case forward

                 2. Sum up the case

                 3. Respond on the employee‘s behalf to any view expressed at the meeting

        b.   Confer with the employee during the hearing

The employer is NOT required to permit the workers companion to address the hearing if the employee
indicates he does not wish his/her companion to do so. Should the workers companion address the
hearing it must be in a manner that does not prevent the employer from explaining his/her case or prevent
any other person at the hearing from making his/her contribution to it.

The workers companion may address the hearing only if the employee indicates that to be his/her wishes.
Supervisors should understand and make clear at the outset as to the role of the workers companion and to
advise them that they are not there as a recognized TU official.

                                  Grievance/Appeal Procedural Stages

2.2. Informal Stage:

Immediate Supervisor: MoD personnel should be encouraged to resolve job-related complaints through
frank discussion with their supervisor, since most problems can be settled at the worker and supervisor
level.

2.2.1. The supervisor will investigate the complaint (either verbal or in writing). If the complaint is in
writing, the complaint will become part of a personnel case file which will include the supervisor‘s
response.

2.2.2. Oral complaints and supervisor‘s oral responses will be recorded by entry in the supervisor‘s record
of employee. Any personal information held by a supervisor will be kept to a minimum, only retained
when appropriate, and will be properly safeguarded and disposed of in accordance with UK Data
Protection Act Requirements.

2.2.3. In all cases a supervisor will respond to the employee within 15 workdays of receipt of the
complaint. If additional time is needed for the collection of information, the supervisor will advise the
employee of the extension of the proposed completion date. No more than two extensions for 15 days can
be granted in any situation. All cases should be resolved not later than 45 days after the date of the
complaint.

2.2.4. In cases where the complaint is about the 1st line supervisor the 2nd level supervisor is charged with
the above responsibilities.

2.2.5. All information pertaining to the informal grievance must be maintained 1 year past the date of
conclusion.

More formal steps described below may be taken if any dissatisfaction still remains.

2.3. Formal Stage: RAF/CC:

2.3.1. If MoD personnel are dissatisfied with the solution reached after initially presenting an informal
complaint to their immediate supervisor, they may present the complaint in the form of a grievance in
writing via the BST office to the RAF Commander (RAF/CC) as Head of Establishment at their
Installation. The grievance must include the remedy sought and details of the outcome at the informal
stage. The employee must clearly outline the act or omission on the part of the employer and what
remedies/corrective action is sought.

2.3.2. The BST will conduct a review the employee‘s grievance to determine if enough information is
present to continue with the formal grievance. Every effort must be made to analyze the grievance,
collect the information, and substantiate the claim. Once accepted the BST office will prepare a
personnel case file, obtain informal stage documentation from the immediate supervisor.

2.3.3. The receiving BST office shall notify the Civilian Personnel Officer of any verbal or written
complaint directed against the U.S. Force, agents or agencies and provide a copy of the grievance or
complete summary of the verbal grievance within three working days. This requirement applies to all US
installations in the United Kingdom
USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                              55


2.3.4. The CPO will advise the applicable Installation Commander that a grievance has been submitted.
The CPO will provide a copy of the grievance to the Installation Commander and the appropriate legal
office. The CPO will provide management advisory service for the Commander, on the process to act at
the request of the RAF/CC to compile all relevant information and facts pertaining to the grievance. The
CPO will notify the RAF/CC of the grievance and provide a courtesy copy.

2.3.5. The Installation Commander will commence with the investigation or designate an investigator in
writing. Investigators will be higher in rank than the employees involved in the grievance. Installation
Commanders will have 15 days to investigate the grievance. If more time is needed, extensions may be
granted by the CPO. No more than two extensions for any one grievance can be extended. Maximum
time for investigations is 45 calendar days. Extensions will be coordinated with the BST office and
employees will be notified in writing of the request for extensions and a projected completion date.

2.3.6. Normally, the RAF/CC will give written response to the employee within 60 workdays (start to
finish) of receipt of the grievance provided the facts and supporting documentation can be compiled and
analyzed during this period by both parties. If extensions are needed during the investigative process
and/or the grievance is returned for further investigation, then a letter of notification must be provided to
the employee by the RAF/CC.

2.3.7. If the circumstances warrant, i.e. a U.S. civilian grieves against a MOD employee the RAF/CC will
be the principle entity and the process will be reversed. In all cases the investigating official will be of
higher grade/rank than the individuals involved in the grievance.

2.3.8. The Installation Commander will discuss the report of the investigation with the RAF/CC and
where possible a joint decision between the RAF/CC and the Installation Commander will be made.

2.3.9. Under no circumstances will either the MOD or the U.S. Forces make any findings of fact or law
against the other party which may support the bringing of legal proceedings by the grievant without full
notification to the party against whom such findings are proposed and that party having a full and proper
opportunity to comment and or respond. U.S. Forces coordination will be through the CPO; MoD
through the BST.

2.3.10. In the case of a U.S. Force agents or agencies who grieve against an MOD employee, the
complaint process would be reversed.

2.3.11. Once the proper coordination (see Addendum 1) and a finding has been determined in regards to
the grievance, the formal response will be given by the RAF/CC to the MOD employee

2.4. Appeal: Senior RAF Liaison Officer (SRAFLO), HQ 3AF-UK

2.4.1. If still dissatisfied, employees may appeal the decision to the SRAFLO, (the line manager of the
RAF/CCs) within 10 workdays of their receipt of the formal stage decision.

2.4.2. The appeal will be submitted in writing and submitted through the BST for forwarding to the
SRAFLO.

2.4.3. The SRAFLO will coordinate with the Business Partner and the RAF/CC to determine if the appeal
is valid.

2.4.4. If the appeal is directed against the U.S. Forces, agents or agencies and relates directly to the
previous grievance the BST shall immediately notify the Civilian Personnel Officer (CPO), RAF
 56                                                           USAFEI36-704 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


Mildenhall and provide them with a copy of the appeal. This requirement applies to all US installations
in the United Kingdom.

2.4.5. The CPO will advise Installation Commander that an appeal has been submitted and give
management advisory service as to the process for appeals under the joint grievance policy. The CPO
will provide a copy of the appeal to the Installation Commander, and the Installation Legal Office.

2.4.6. The RAF/CC will give a final written response to the employee within 45 workdays, if no
extensions have been granted, of receipt of the appeal. For this purpose receipt is defined as date the
Appeal was received from the BST.

2.4.7. In cases where the appeal cannot be resolved between the U.S. Force and Ministry of Defence the
case will be referred to the Civilian Personnel Committee co-chairs for resolution/decision.

2.5. SUPPORT: The U.S. Forces shall to the extent possible support and assist in the investigation of any
grievance by the MOD. In the event that any investigation and/or disposal of any grievance shall take
longer than any of the time limits specified in the Statement, the MOD shall notify the appropriate U.S.
forces authorities of the reason for such delay and provide a proposed revised timetable for the conclusion
of the investigation/disposal of the grievance.

2.6. DISCLOSURE: Disclosure of all materials relevant to the case is permissible under the MOD
policy referred to in paragraph 1.2 above. Copies of investigation reports will be made available to the
grievant if requested.

2.7. FINAL MAINTENANCE OF DOCUMENTATION: Copies of all documentation raised in
relation to the processing of a grievance through this procedure should be retained at the BST/CPO office
for 2 years past the date of conclusion.
