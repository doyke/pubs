                   INTRODUCTION TO INTEGRATED DEFENSE (ID)

1.1. A7S Vision. Mission-ready, resilient and air-minded Security Forces (SF) organized,
trained and equipped to deliver enduring ID against threats to the United States Air Force
(USAF), Joint and Coalition missions; recognized and respected for our air-centric expertise.
1.2. Introduction to ID Policy and Guidance Structure. USAF air and space assets are most
vulnerable when they are on the ground. Our adversaries’ mission is to exploit this vulnerability
and it is the duty of every Airman to understand and mitigate these risks through the integration
of installation defensive capabilities. Per AFPD 31-1, integrated defense is the integration of
multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive and defensive capabilities, employed to mitigate
potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force operations. Integrated defense is planned
and executed based upon the estimated threat (or combination of threats), and operating
environment; it is approved by the installation commander. This handbook is a tool for SF
leadership to plan for integrated defense operations in expeditionary environments. It is not an
instruction but a guide to help leaders. Finally, it should be understood that this document is not
all inclusive, and the references mentioned throughout should be utilized in conjunction with this
handbook.
1.3. Key Guidance Structure:
   1.3.1. AFPD 31-1 establishes the framework for how the Air Force formulates and applies
   ID and establishes SF as the enterprise leader for ID operations. Although SF is the enterprise
   lead, ID is an installation commander’s program per AFI 31-101.
   1.3.2. AFI 31-101 describes the concept, planning and execution of ID. Capabilities-based
   ID is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, and requires active participation by all
   to ensure its success.
   1.3.3. This publication provides one element of a continually evolving process to provide
   users with a practical “how-to” reference, complete with links to additional reference
   material for all ID Forces. Additionally, reference material can be found on the Security
   Forces SMARTNet at the following link: https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/. Subjects that are
   specific to SF are addressed as such. Subjects that apply to all Airmen use terms such as “ID
   Forces” or “Defenders.” Security of assets that defend our nation, people and resources is an
   inherent responsibility of command and requires the effort of every Airman regardless of Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC), rank or position. Therefore, tactical terms formerly applied
   specifically to SF such as Fire Team (FT), Squad, etc, are now applicable to all forces when
   organized for ID.
1.4. Background. In 1985, Joint Security Agreement (JSA) 8 committed the U.S. Army to
provide units under the operational control (OPCON) of the appropriate air component
commander to perform air base ground defense outside the base perimeter. In 1992, joint
doctrine transferred this responsibility to installation commanders. In 2005, the Chief of Staff of
the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force formally rescinded JSA 8 saying that "Joint
Doctrine and the decisions of Joint Force Commanders will be used in place of this document."
JP 3-10, Joint Security Operations in Theater, assigns base defense as an installation commander
responsibility. This required the Air Force to re-look at how it defends its "nests and eggs on the
 6                                                                       AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


ground." This doctrinal shift has required SF to push beyond the base perimeter to conduct Area
Security Operations (ASO) to secure the Base Security Zone (BSZ), and has required non-SF
personnel to assume an increased role in the installation commander’s ID program.
1.5. ID as a Fundamental Battle Competency. As previously stated, ID is a fundamental
battle competency for all Airmen. AF members are charged to be active participants in the
defense of installations, resources, activities and missions. Essentially, the teaming of ID
contributors creates a united, seamless defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individual
contributors or units. This mutual effort ensures all Airmen are trained to defend themselves and
integrate into the defensive scheme to support the ID effort.
     1.5.1. AFH 31-305, Security Forces Deployment Planning, should be used in conjunction
     with this handbook as general reference and operational planning guidance. Soldier Training
     Publication (STP) 21-1, Soldier’s Manual of Common Tasks Warrior Skills Level 1, covers
     individual combat skills.
1.6. Threat. As outlined in AFI 31-101, ID forces must be capable of defeating Level I threats
and be capable of deterring and defeating Level II threats. Level III threats necessitate a decision
to commit a tactical combat force or other significant available forces to counter the threat.
1.7. Operational Environments. ID forces may be called upon to perform a variety of tasks in
diverse environments, under joint or combined command, with or without host nation (HN)
support, and under adverse or uncertain conditions. ID operations may occur in sustained
environments, with in-place and forward deployed ID forces operating out of Forward Operating
Bases (FOBs). FOBs typically have in-place base support structures and are self-sustaining. ID
operations may also occur in bare base environments without an existing base support structure.
1.8. Threat Level Examples:
     1.8.1. The threat spectrum is divided into three levels, as outlined in Figure 1.1 (below).
     These threat levels identify the type of group and the threat they pose against military
     activities. Moreover, the required responses by ID elements are also annotated below.

Figure 1.1. Threat Spectrum
  LEVEL                          THREATS                                      RESPONSE
    I             Agents, sympathizers, partisans and terrorists.      Unit, base and base cluster
                                                                         self-defense measures.
      II           Small tactical units, unconventional warfare        Self-defense measures and
                               forces and guerrillas.                     response forces with
                                                                             supporting fire.
      III           Large tactical force operations, including          Timely commitment of
                  airborne, heliborne and major air operations.          tactical combat forces.
     1.8.2. Level I - This threat level is considered a peacetime threat that increases in frequency
     and transitions to a wartime threat before the beginning of open hostilities and with a rise in
     hostilities. The best way to defeat these threats is to disrupt the planning process through the
     application of countermeasures that create the desired ID effects before an attack occurs.
     1.8.3. Level II - These activities include long-range reconnaissance, intelligence gathering,
     diversions and sabotage operations by Special Forces, such as guerrilla forces,
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                            7


   unconventional forces or small tactical units. Most major threat forces maintain special
   operations forces that are organized and highly trained to operate in the enemy’s rear areas.
   1.8.4. Level III - This threat level may require timely commitment of tactical combat forces.
   These forces (conventional airborne forces) can insert enemy forces (up to division size) up
   to 300 kilometers (km) beyond the front lines into friendly rear areas. In addition, their
   doctrine stresses the use of battalion size (500-2,000 personnel) units conducting helicopter
   insertions at a depth of 50 km. Targets for helicopter insertions include nuclear weapon
   storage sites and launch systems, early warning systems and command and control
   headquarters.
1.9. ID Force Organization. The composition of ID forces includes small teams less than FT
configuration, FT, squad, flight, squadron (i.e., the Defense Force Commander [DFC] and the
DFC’s staff), and also other commanders and staffs of non-SF units that comprise the ID force.
   1.9.1. Small teams, less than a FT configuration in ID: a two-person team is merely an
   “umbrella term” used to group small 2-3 person teams of various types, missions and
   configurations. Examples of such teams include: patrol teams, internal security response
   teams (ISRT), external security response teams (ESRT), entry controllers, teams posted in
   towers or defensive fighting positions (DFP), etc.
   1.9.2. FTs in ID: The FT is typically the basic element in ID; however, Mission, Enemy,
   Terrain and weather, Time, Troops available and Civil considerations (METT-TC) will
   dictate the team’s configuration.
       1.9.2.1. FT Composition: There are two basic FT configurations used by SF: Light and
       Heavy. The baseline for a Light FT should consist of a Fire Team Leader (FTL) armed
       with an M-4 and an M-9. The FT should have a light machine gunner with an M-249 and
       an M-9; a rifleman with an M-4 and an M-9; and a rifleman/grenadier with an M-4/M-
       203 and an M-9. The Heavy FT configuration consists of an FTL armed with an M-4 and
       an M-9; a heavy machine gunner with an M-240B, M-4 and M-9; an assistant gunner
       with an M-4 and M-9; and a rifleman/grenadier with an M-4/M-203 and an M-9.
   1.9.3. Squads in ID: A squad consists of 13 personnel: one Squad Leader (SL) and three
   FTs (two Light and one Heavy) designated Alpha, Bravo and Charlie. In the Air Force, the
   Alpha and Charlie FTs are configured with the M-249 and the Bravo FT is configured as the
   Heavy with an M-240B. Additionally, the Charlie FTL is normally designated assistant SL.
   The squad may accept attachments based upon task/purpose/mission such as the attachment
   of an interpreter, medic, guide, technology operator, Military Working Dog (MWD) team,
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team, Civil Engineering (CE) personnel, etc.
       1.9.3.1. To maximize flexibility, the squad should be trained to operate in a mounted or
       dismounted role, autonomously or as part of a larger unit. Per AFI 31-101, SLs are
       responsible for all that their squad does or does not do during the course of duty. SLs
       supervise and are responsible for conducting collective training of the squad and
       individual training.
   1.9.4. Flight Leadership (FL) in ID: The Flight Commander and Flight Chief, while
   individual and distinct duty positions, compose the command element for the flight. As the
   command element, the Flight Commander and Flight Chief are the senior tactical leaders for
   the flight. The Flight Commander is responsible for leading and directing all flight activities
8                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


    and relaying the DFC’s orders. The Flight Chief is the Flight's second in command and the
    tactical level subject matter expert (SME). The Flight Chief is responsible to the Flight
    Commander for the integration of all flight level activities and provides senior enlisted
    leadership, discipline, training, welfare and resource allocation and distribution to include
    manpower of the flight. They exercise command through their assigned SLs.
       1.9.4.1. A standard flight consists of 44 personnel: The Flight Commander, Flight Chief
       and three squads with a Squad Leader (each squad is composed of 13 personnel and a
       three person radio/telephone operator element). This is the basic flight structure within
       the AF. However, not all flights will have 44 personnel assigned; some flights may have
       more or less.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                            9

                 INTEGRATED DEFENSE COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. Effective ID requires sound command, control, communications and intelligence
(C3I). An effective interrelationship between the DFC, his/her S-Staff and ID forces is the key
element to the C3I process. This chapter addresses basic C3I considerations for ID.
2.2. The DFC and the S-Staff. The DFC and the S-Staff plan, direct, coordinate and integrate
the efforts of all ID assets under their control. The DFC is also the primary coordinator with
other elements, including U.S., HN or allied forces. These assets may be placed under the tactical
control (TACON) of the DFC. The base defense operations center (BDOC) is the Command
Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
center for all ID operations. Normally, the entire S-Staff operates in the BDOC when space is
available. However, the DFC may locate certain S-Staff functions (such as the S-1 and S-4
branches) outside the BDOC. Should the Air Force not be the Base Operation Support Integrator
(BOSI), the BDOC serves as a sector command post passing information upward and downward
to the Joint Defense Operation Center (JDOC). A JDOC is typically used in a deployed
environment when multiple agencies are embedded in the command and control center for the
installation. These agencies might include: Counter Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM)
personnel, Fire Department personnel, Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) camera
personnel, Joint Forces, etc.
   2.2.1. The DFC. The DFC is responsible for the total execution of the ID mission. This
   includes tactical employment, training, administration, personnel management and
   sustainment of ID forces. The DFC must know the capabilities of his/her forces and support
   weapons. The DFC exercises authority through his/her chain of command and, when
   necessary, requests support from higher headquarters (HHQ) to accomplish the ID mission.
   The DFC may delegate authority to their S-Staff to issue plans, orders and other actions
   without their prior approval. See Figure 3.8, “Operations Order” for specific information on
   preparing orders. The S-Staff keeps the DFC informed of actions affecting their TACON.
   2.2.2. The S-1. The S-1 branch is responsible to the DFC for all plans, estimates, reports and
   requests as they relate to personnel and administrative matters. Attachment 2 provides the
   key tasks of the S-1.
   2.2.3. The S-2. The S-2 branch provides current information to the DFC on threats affecting
   installation ID operations through force protection intelligence (FPI) liaison and
   investigations. The Intelligence Fusion Cell (IFC) is an action group whereby the S-2
   function coordinates with SMEs from the Intelligence and Air Force Office of Special
   Investigation (AFOSI) communities to collaborate and conduct Intelligence Preparation of
   the Battlefield (IPB). The goal is to leverage force protection information to support the
   timely identification of indicators and warnings of emerging localized threats. The IFC and
   its products directly support the DFC in making immediate, proactive decisions for ID
   planning. However, the DFC should use other sources to obtain threat information such as
   the Antiterrorism Working Group (ATWG), Threat Working Group (TWG) and Integrated
   Defense Working Group (IDWG). Investigations duties are outlined in AFI 31-206, Security
10                                                                  AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


  Forces Investigations Program. FPI liaison duties include, but are not limited to, the
  following:
     2.2.3.1. The S-2 should coordinate with Intelligence and AFOSI personnel to ensure
     identification of areas of interest, and to minimize duplication of effort.
     2.2.3.2. The S-2 liaises with AFOSI to obtain local counter intelligence (CI) threat
     information, analysis of HN or foreign intelligence threats, information regarding
     criminal activity, local police force capabilities and other information gathered from the
     local Department of State Regional Security Officer and Station Chief.
     2.2.3.3. The S-2 is responsible for all plans, estimates, reports and requests concerning
     FPI, and supports the SF S-3 and Installation Antiterrorism Officer, as well as the
     following working groups: Threat Working Group (TWG), Antiterrorism Working Group
     (ATWG), and Integrated Defense Working Group (IDWG).
     2.2.3.4. The S-2 may also complete paragraph 1, Situation, of the squadron operation
     order (OPORD). Moreover, paragraph 1 will include intelligence information obtained
     from AFOSI and Intelligence personnel. Attachment 3 provides the key tasks of the S-2.
     2.2.3.5. The S-2 is also the DFC’s Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for
     developing Priority Intelligence Request (PIRs) and Commander Critical Information
     Requirements (CCIRs).
  2.2.4. The S-3. The S-3 branch (BDOC Current and Future Operations Cell) is responsible to
  the DFC for day-to-day operational ID matters, to include all plans, movements, training and
  communications. The future operations cell takes the IFC’s analysis and devises a strategy to
  counter enemy activities for 24 hours and beyond.
     2.2.4.1. The operations function is typically the largest branch and the S-3 is normally
     the second in command to the DFC. The S-3 branch will typically assist the DFC in the
     preparation of paragraph 3, Execution, and paragraph 5, Command and Signal, of the
     squadron OPORD. Attachment 4 outlines key duties of the S-3 branch and its
     interrelationship with other members of the S-Staff.
  2.2.5. The S-4. The S-4 branch is responsible for all logistical matters affecting SF and may
  also assist other ID forces’ logistics functions with expertise and guidance to ensure
  compatibility throughout the ID force.
     2.2.5.1. The S-4 maintains logistics detail (LOGDETs) paperwork and preparation,
     mission essential equipment support requirements, unit combat arms program, vehicle
     maintenance and Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) functions. Attachment 5 provides
     the key tasks of the S-4.
  2.2.6. The S-5. The S-5 branch performs Strategy and Combat Plans for ID at the tactical
  level. Functions include pass and ID, reports and analysis, plans administration, installation
  security, resource protection, physical security, crime prevention, police services planning,
  Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) and contractor oversight. As a
  base becomes fully operational, the S-5 is also responsible for drafting and coordinating the
  Integrated Defense Plan (IDP). Thus, the S-5 section has a rather large role in the overall ID
  concept. Attachment 6 provides the key tasks of the S-5.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                              11


   2.2.7. The S-6. If employed, the S-6 branch provides program management, equipment
   sustainment and force training to ensure the integration and optimal exploitation of ID and
   FP technologies. The S-6 is responsible for all ID and related communication and electronic
   systems within a unit to include Tactical Automated Security Sensors (TASS), Small
   Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS), Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) and ID
   navigational systems. When employed, the S-6 branch will typically assist the DFC in the
   preparation of paragraph 5, Command and Signal, of the squadron OPORD and act as the
   DFC’s liaison with the local Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO).
2.3. Staff Interaction. In addition to interacting with other units on the base, the DFC and
his/her staff may need to coordinate, provide liaison and meet with units of other services and
nations in order to effectively conduct ID operations. This may include, but is not limited to,
meeting with adjacent battle space owners (BSO), coordinating response capabilities and even
sharing gathered force protection information.
   2.3.1. Combined Operations. Due to the multi-national character of combined operations
   (vastly different operational methods, language differences, etc), these operations require
   close coordination between the DFC, the S-Staff and other units of the combined force. Five
   values, while not specific to joint operations, have special impact on the conduct of joint
   operations: integrity, competency, physical courage, moral courage and teamwork. The
   aforementioned values will facilitate smooth working relationships between joint warfighters
   and ensure joint operational success.
2.4. Staff Control Tools. Control tools are orders, directives, information, visual aids or any
other method used to clarify intent, provide focus and ensure synchronization of the ID effort.
They assign responsibilities, coordinate fire and maneuver, provide updated information and
ensure safety. They can be given graphically, in writing or orally by anyone in the chain of
command. These tools include, but are not limited to, those described in the following
paragraphs.
   2.4.1. Orders Group (O-Group). At a minimum, O-Group is a meeting of the key ID
   leadership and should be held daily in a secure location determined by the DFC. Times for
   O-Group will vary. All participants should be informed of the times by secure means and
   additional O-Groups may be scheduled if needed. Attendees should arrive early to coordinate
   with the S-Staff, turn in required paperwork, coordinate with peers, etc. The on-duty S-1, S-
   2, S-3, S-4, S-5, S-6, Flight Commander and Flight Chief, the MWD headquarters
   noncommissioned officer-in-charge (NCOIC), the HN/Army/Navy/Marine liaison (if
   applicable) and any others deemed appropriate by the DFC should attend O-Group. Subject
   to the DFC’s discretion, the following is a recommended order for O-Group:
       2.4.1.1. The DFC may open with initial comments.
       2.4.1.2. The S-2 begins by covering the following topics and other topics as necessary:
          2.4.1.2.1. Time hack.
          2.4.1.2.2. Weather for the next 24 hours (if available, a 3-day and 30-day forecast).
          2.4.1.2.3. The latest intelligence summary (INTSUM) for the previous 24 hours (air
          and ground).
          2.4.1.2.4. Trends since the initiation of hostilities.
12                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


         2.4.1.2.5. Projection of enemy activities.
     2.4.1.3. The S-3 presents the third briefing. It may consist of, but is not limited to, the
     following:
         2.4.1.3.1. Summary of ID operations to date.
         2.4.1.3.2. Future operations.
         2.4.1.3.3. Tactical deception operations.
     2.4.1.4. The S-4 will give the fourth briefing. It will include, but is not limited to, the
     following:
         2.4.1.4.1. Logistical issues which could affect the ID mission.
         2.4.1.4.2. Projected status of supplies and equipment.
         2.4.1.4.3. Maintenance services.
         2.4.1.4.4. Administrative logistical issues.
     2.4.1.5. Invited briefers will give briefings on their subject area (if applicable).
     2.4.1.6. The S-1 will give the last briefing. It may include, but is not limited to, the
     following:
         2.4.1.6.1. Personnel present for duty.
         2.4.1.6.2. Hospitalized personnel.
         2.4.1.6.3. Casualties (deceased or non-returnable to duty) from the previous 24 hours.
         2.4.1.6.4. Cumulative casualties.
         2.4.1.6.5. Projection of personnel status.
         2.4.1.6.6. State of morale.
         2.4.1.6.7. Administrative matters (postal, billets, etc).
         2.4.1.6.8. The availability or status of local medical support (e.g., beds available) and
         identify if there is a potential impact on the ID mission. For example, if the local
         medical facility is beyond capacity and cannot support additional casualties, then this
         may be a planning consideration for ASO operations.
     2.4.1.7. The DFC may conclude O-Group with items of his/her choosing. Examples are:
         2.4.1.7.1. Any changes to the ID concept of operation.
         2.4.1.7.2. Special interest items.
         2.4.1.7.3. Overall state of the ID effort.
  2.4.2. Reports. Reports provide key information to the DFC and his/her S-Staff on specific
  ID activities in order to make decisions and develop and implement tactical plans and orders.
  Tables 4.1 through 4.3 are examples of typical reports provided to the DFC and their S-Staff.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                             13


   2.4.3. Flight Control Tools. Control tools are used to synchronize ID actions, provide tactical
   updates to the ID chain of command, accomplish critical tasks and control fire. Leaders also
   use orders, sketches, priorities of work, range cards and other means to control ID forces.
   2.4.4. Range Cards. IAW Field Manual (FM) 7-8, The Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, the
   range card is a sketch of the assigned sector for a direct fire weapon system on a given sector
   of fire. A range card aids in planning and controlling fires and aids the crews and squad
   gunners in acquiring targets during periods of limited visibility. Range cards show possible
   target areas and terrain features plotted in relation to a firing position. Range cards also aid
   replacement personnel in becoming oriented on the sector. Range cards should be updated as
   necessary (when new weapons systems are placed within a sector, terrain changes, etc). In
   establishing defenses, the Flight Chief identifies heavy weapon positions and sights the
   heavy weapons first, establishing either a final protective line (FPL) or a final protective fire
   (FPF). An FPL is a line of fire across the flight front. When the terrain does not lend itself to
   an FPL, an FPF will be designated along a likely avenue of approach or other danger area.
   The gunner prepares their range card and provides the Flight Chief a copy. Range cards are
   completed IAW STP 21-1. Further, range cards are also used to aid leaders in completing
   required sketches. In some locations, panoramic photos have been used as a best practice.
   Coupled with a data section like the range card, panoramic photos may provide a clearer
   picture for gunners; however, range cards may still be required for compiling sketches if
   good imagery isn’t available.
   2.4.5. As defined in FM 7-8, a range card is a record of the firing data required to engage
   predetermined targets within a sector of fire during good and limited visibility. In addition,
   the range card helps identify dead space, where trip flares have been placed, etc. Every
   direct-fire weapon gunner must prepare a range card for his or her position. Range cards are
   prepared for primary, alternate and supplementary positions. Range cards are prepared
   immediately upon arrival to a position, regardless of the length of stay. Range cards are
   updated as necessary; the range card should be updated if the terrain changes, or if trip flares
   or similar items have been added to the area.

Figure 2.1. Range Card.
 14                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


2.5. Squad Sector Sketch. The squad sector sketch is designed to visually display, in detail, the
squad fire plan and other key information. Figure 2.2 shows an example of a squad sector
sketch.
   2.5.1. Sketch. The SL prepares the sketch and provides a copy to the FL. Each sketch should
   include:
   2.5.2. The main terrain features in the sector of fire and the ranges to them.
   2.5.3. Each primary fighting position and the type of weapon(s) in each position.
   2.5.4. The primary and secondary fields of fire for each position.
   2.5.5. Machine gun FPL or FPF.
   2.5.6. Listening Posts (LP)/Observation Posts (OP) locations and SL positions.
   2.5.7. Dead space (show coverage by grenade launchers [M-203]).
   2.5.8. Location(s) of night vision devices/thermal imagers/sensor enunciators.

Figure 2.2. Squad Sector Sketch.




2.6. Flight Sector Sketch. The Flight Chief checks range cards and squad sector sketches. If
there are gaps or other flaws in the fire plan, they make necessary adjustments. If they find dead
space, they take steps to cover it with the M-203 grenade launcher fire or other indirect fire (IDF)
weapons. The Flight Chief compiles two flight sector sketches for the Flight Commander (one
for their own use; the other for the DFC and S-3). See Figure 2.3 for an example. Each sketch
should show:
   2.6.1. Squad sectors of fire.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                         15


   2.6.2. Machine gun positions and their sectors of fire, to include FPLs and FPFs of the
   machine guns and Squad Automatic Weapons (SAW). Include target reference points (TRPs)
   for supporting joint fires.
   2.6.3. Sensors and obstacles.
   2.6.4. IDF planned in the flight’s sector of fire (targets and FPL).
   2.6.5. LP/OP locations and patrol routes, if any.
   2.6.6. Flight/CP post location with an azimuth and distance to an easily recognizable terrain
   feature.
   2.6.7. Location of casualty collection point (CCP), logistics resupply point and Enemy
   Prisoner of War (EPW) collection point.
   2.6.8. Flight and squadron (deployed squadron, not home station) identification.
   2.6.9. Date/time group.
   2.6.10. Magnetic north.

Figure 2.3. Flight Sector Sketch




2.7. Fire Control Measures. At the onset of a ground attack on an air base, pre-established fire
control measures are essential to the successful conduct of ID. FL and Squad Leaders use the
following fire control measures to ensure the proper concentration and distribution of fires.
   2.7.1. Sectors of Fire. As indicated on flight and squad sector sketches, sectors of fire are
   designated to ensure adequate distribution and interlocking of fires across the flight front.
   Flight Chiefs ensure the Flight Commander’s sectors of fire interlock with adjacent sectors
   (as shown in Figure 2.3 above).
   2.7.2. Engagement Areas. The Flight Chief and the SLs use engagement areas to concentrate
   all available fires into a specific area.
   2.7.3. Fire Patterns. These include front, cross and depth fires. These patterns describe the
   relationship between the weapons and the targets. The intent is to ensure weapons do not
   waste ammunition firing on the same target while other targets remain unengaged.
 16                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


   2.7.4. Engagement Priorities. These designate the priority for engaging key targets.
   2.7.5. Rate of Fire. The rate will be designated by the SL or FL.
2.8. Priorities of Work. The priority of work is a list of tasks the DFC and FL can use to
control what gets done by whom and in what order in the preparation of ID. He/she can adjust
the priorities of work based upon the tactical situation and other considerations. The following is
an example of a flight priority of work when occupying a sector:
   2.8.1. Establish security. Position LPs and OPs.
   2.8.2. Position machine guns and SAWs (and, if applicable, MK-19s, M-2s and M-24s).
   Designate FPLs for machine guns.
   2.8.3. Position remainder of squads and assign sectors of fire for M-4 rifles and M-203
   grenade launchers.
   2.8.4. Establish flight CP and communications.
   2.8.5. Clear fields of fire and prepare range cards and sector sketches.
   2.8.6. Coordinate with adjacent flights.
   2.8.7. Prepare primary fighting positions.
   2.8.8. Emplace obstacles and sensors.
   2.8.9. Designate targets for IDF. Coordinate with Joint Fires Fire Direction Center (FDC).
   2.8.10. Improve primary fighting positions such as overhead cover.
   2.8.11. Prepare alternate positions.
   2.8.12. Establish a work rest cycle. Set up latrines.
   2.8.13. Conduct reconnaissance of routine patrol routes.
   2.8.14. Rehearse engagements, disengagements, stand to and counterattack actions. If
   possible, include elements of the mobile reserve in the rehearsals.
   2.8.15. Adjust positions or control measures as required.
   2.8.16. Stockpile ammunition, food and water.
   2.8.17. Dig trenches to connect positions.
   2.8.18. Continue to improve positions.
2.9. ID Communications. Effective communication is essential in ID operations. The DFC
should ensure a secure, reliable communications system is established between the Command
Post (CP), BDOC, Tactical Operation Center (TOC), host nation forces, and most importantly,
the flights, mobile reserve elements, MWD elements, all heavy weapons and the FDC.
2.10. Communication Means. There are several means of communication. Each complements
the other and provides redundancy in the total communications system. The following are
common means of communication used by ID forces:
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                           17


  2.10.1. Hand and arm signals, whistle, flashlights, flares, smoke and other means provide
  quick transmission of messages and instructions. FLs and SLs use hand and arm signals to
  control individual, FT and squad movement.
  2.10.2. Messenger. This is the best way to send long messages and documents. However,
  messengers are the slowest means and are vulnerable to enemy action. When using a
  messenger, messages are normally written with clear, concise text. Nonetheless, the
  messenger is the most secure means of communication.
  2.10.3. Wire. This is a dependable, reasonably secure means of communication and involves
  the use of field wire, telephones, switch boards and other associated equipment. Squads
  normally establish a “hot loop” configuration between fighting positions and the SL has a
  direct line to the flight CP. If landline communications to the BDOC from the flight CP do
  not exist, wire communications should be established. Wire should be buried deep in the
  ground (personnel should inspect the wire prior to installation). If possible, request telephone
  support from the communications unit. Tactical wire emplacement procedures can be found
  in FM 7-8.
  2.10.4. Audible. These include whistles, horns, sirens, bells, voice amplifiers and explosives.
  This means of communication is used to attract attention, transmit pre-arranged messages or
  spread alarms. They are good for only short distances and range and reliability is reduced by
  battle and aircraft noise, weather, terrain or vegetation. Sound signals should be simple to
  avoid misunderstandings.
  2.10.5. Radio. Radios are the most flexible means of communication. ID radio
  communications typically involve tactical radio procedures which are outlined in FM 7-8 and
  STP 7-11B1-SM-TG, Infantry. Tactical radio procedures may involve the use of Signal
  Operating Instructions (SOI). An SOI contains call signs, frequencies, sign/countersigns and
  other key communications information. SOIs will be maintained and trained as determined
  by local plans. Defenders should closely coordinate with communications experts to ensure
  SOI requirements are met. Lastly, personnel should understand that radios are one of the least
  secure means of communication on the battlefield. If a post is outfitted with a hard line,
  personnel should use the hard line before the radio.
  2.10.6. Cellular or mobile phones and satellite phones are sometimes used in ID operations.
  This should only be used for basic communication. These forms of communication are not
  secure and could be intercepted by the enemy. If a post is outfitted with a hard line, use this
  method to communicate before using a cell phone. In addition, Electronic Counter Measures
  (ECM) could block cellular signals on the battlefield. Be aware that taking pictures with
  personal cell phones and posting on social networks (FaceBook, Twitter, MySpace, etc) can
  be detrimental to ID forces. When taking a picture, some phones show the location of where
  the activity took place. This is known as geo-tagging. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM
  and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, the adversary has been known to collect
  intelligence for military operations using this technique.
  2.10.7. In the recent past, technology has become more and more prevalent on the
  battlefield. ID forces must be aware of this technology and seek to exploit it. Technologies
  used in previous operations include the Blue Force Tracker (BFT), portable laptops, Satellite
  Communications (SATCOM) and radio-frequency jammers or ECMs are just a few
  examples. In many cases battlefield Airman have improvised and used the heads up display
18                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


  (HUD) in the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles in order to locate
  Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during nighttime patrols. AF personnel should be
  aware of new and emerging technology, and seek to exploit it on today’s ever-changing
  battlefield.
  2.10.8. Communications Security (COMSEC). Mobile operations inherently require
  communications with greater range than typical static posts. The FT’s primary means of
  communication may be the tactical radio. Along with an in-depth knowledge of how to
  properly utilize the radio net, FTLs must ensure all teams are fully trained on radio operation,
  net protocols and safeguarding COMSEC material. As communications networks are
  susceptible to monitoring, jamming and disruption by the enemy, effective COMSEC
  procedures are essential. The DFC should design an efficient authentication system to protect
  the communications network. In the absence of secure voice radios, proper adherence to
  transmission procedures is essential and use of transmission codes (normally found in the
  SOI) is recommended. If the network is experiencing any type of interference, ensure all
  radio equipment is functioning properly. If the equipment is unusable due to interference, use
  alternative communications means, relocate the antenna or change the frequency.
  Immediately report the interference up the chain of command. This is especially true if you
  believe the interference to be due to the enemy. A good acronym to remember is Meaconing,
  Intrusion, Jamming and Interference (MIJI).
     2.10.8.1. Meaconing is the interception and rebroadcast of navigation signals.
     2.10.8.2. Intrusion is defined as any attempt by an enemy to enter U.S. or allied
     communications systems and simulate our traffic to confuse and deceive.
     2.10.8.3. Jamming is the deliberate radiation, re-radiation or reflection of
     electromagnetic signals to disrupt enemy use of electronic devices, equipment or systems.
     2.10.8.4. Interference is normally a non-deliberate intrusion upon a circuit. It
     unintentionally degrades, disrupts, obstructs or limits the effective performance of
     electronic or electrical equipment. NOTE: Additional USAF-specific COMSEC
     requirements can be found in AFI 33-201, Volume 1, Communications Security, and
     Volume 2, Communications Security User Requirements (both publications are only
     issued by the OPR).

                        PLANNING FOR INTEGRATED DEFENSE

3.1. ID Planning:
   3.1.1. Per AFI 31-101, the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP) forms
   the basis for all installation security planning. Generally, ID forces secure four broad
   categories during contingencies: installations, compounds, airfields and other individual
   resources (such as lines of communication, off-station aircraft, etc). Securing these assets can
   be critical to operations. ID Forces also conduct missions to secure other individual resources
   outside the base perimeter (BP) but inside the BSZ through ASO such as patrolling, convoy
   operations, off-station aircraft security, Counter Surface to Air Fire (C-SAFIRE), Counter
   Indirect Fire (C-IDF), Tactical Security Element (TSE), etc. These missions require thorough
   planning and leadership.
   3.1.2. The entire IDRMP is explained in AFI 31-101 and will not be restated here. However,
   it should be understood that AFI 31-101 is the premier document when seeking information
   on this doctrine and its application within the operational arena.
   3.1.3. Most reference material regarding military planning and orders begins with the unit
   deriving its mission from Paragraph 3 (Execution) from their “parent unit’s” OPORD. The
   required documents for beginning the IDRMP are utilized to understand the commander’s
   intent. If the Installation Commander has not authored his/her intent, the DFC should draft it
   for them and obtain approval. Again, the commander’s intent is absolutely necessary for ID
   planning; you cannot effectively conduct or implement the IDRMP without it. AFI 31-101
   provides an example of a commander’s intent.
3.2. The Base Boundary (BB) and BSZ. Before planning begins, all ID Forces must be
familiar with certain terms to ensure unity of action. These include the BB and BSZ.
   3.2.1. Base Boundary. AFDD 3-10, Force Protection, defines the BB as a line that
   delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and de-
   confliction of operations between adjacent units, formations or areas (see also AFI 31-101).
   Therefore, the BB is not necessarily the base perimeter; rather, it should be established based
   upon the factors of METT-TC, specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to
   control key terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease the
   likelihood of fratricide, prevent non-combatant casualties and minimize collateral damage to
   the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily coincide with the “fenced”
   perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries. Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will
   ideally determine ID boundaries, the DFC will strictly adhere to legal, jurisdictional, HN
   constraints, commander’s intent and higher echelon orders and directives when conducting
   operations within the BB.
   3.2.2. Base Security Zone. The BSZ is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used
   intra-Service only. The Air Force uses the planning term BSZ to describe the area of concern
   around an air base and to support the establishment and adjustment of the BB. As identified
   in AFDD 3-10, the BSZ is the area outside the base perimeter from which the base may be
   vulnerable from standoff threats (e.g., mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems
   [MANPADS]) (see also AFI 31-101). The Installation Commander should identify the BSZ
 20                                                                       AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


   and coordinate with the host nation or area commander (OCONUS) for the BSZ to be
   identified as the BB. If the BB does not include all of the terrain of the BSZ, the Installation
   Commander is still responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with the host
   nation or area commander [OCONUS]) or accepting the risks of enemy attack from the
   terrain outside the BB. The BSZ is, in its simplest terms, the area from which a threat can
   launch an attack against base personnel and resources or aircraft approaching/departing the
   base. Air-minded forces must consider the BSZ for planning constructs. Figure 3.1, below
   shows the base perimeter, BB and BSZ.

Figure 3.1. Base Perimeter, Base Boundary and Base Security Zone.




   3.2.3. Optimally, the BSZ and the BB are the same. However, most locations will have a
   BSZ that extends beyond the BB when surface to air missiles and/or stand-off threats are
   factors/capabilities identified during the process of conducting IPB. There may be
   circumstances where the BSZ, for planning purposes, incorporates more geographical area
   than the BB. For example, there may be key terrain outside the BB from which adversaries
   can impact air operations. The key is coordination as outlined in paragraph 3.2.2. The ID
   Desired Effects for the BB and BSZ are listed in Table 3.1
   3.2.4. BB/BSZ Coordination and METT-TC Factors. BB/BSZ coordination is explained in
   AFI 31-101.

Table 3.1. ID Desired Effects in the Base Boundary and Base Security Zone.
    ID DESIRED EFFECTS IN THE BASE BOUNDARY and BASE SECURITY ZONE
Anticipate Anticipate threat intentions and actions (IPB or crime trend analysis).
  Deter    Deter threat activity through active community policing (e.g., Eagle Eyes Program),
           boundary and internal circulation control, controlled area markings and prudent
           physical security measures.
 Detect    Detect threats through the use of lighting, Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Early
           Warning System (EWS), closed-circuit television (CCTV), etc.
 Assess    Assess to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces, IDS, etc.
  Warn     Warn friendly forces of adversary activity through systems such as mass notification,
           radio, public address, commander’s access channels, voice, hand and arm signals,
           cellular telephones, instant messenger (IM)/short message system (SMS) texting, etc.
 Defeat    Defeat threats through appropriate, progressive force application, coordinated security
           force response and integration of the total force.
 Delay     Delay adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology,
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                                 21


             physical security measures and forces (defense-in-depth).
  Defend     Defend assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates all friendly
             forces into a single, comprehensive plan; ensure friendly forces are trained and
             qualified on arming and UOF; and fighting positions are positioned, where prudent,
             based upon risk analyses.
  Recover    Recover from adversarial events by applying effective command and control, and
             developing and exercising the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2.
3.3. The goal of ID is to neutralize security threats throughout the BSZ in order to ensure
unhindered USAF, joint and coalition missions. Through ID, commanders must:
   3.3.1. Minimize mission degradation from threat activity within the BB and coordinate
   necessary security operations support within the BSZ when the BSZ is not congruent with the
   BB.
   3.3.2. Minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity.
   3.3.3. Protect government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts.
   3.3.4. The end state is to create a flexible, responsive ID operation within varying
   expeditionary threat environments. NOTE: All ID measures must be IAW with applicable
   laws and regulations.
   3.3.5. ID Forces must:
       3.3.5.1. Implement baseline physical security measures IAW AFI 31-101, as well as
       other applicable USAF, Department of Defense (DoD) and HHQ directives. ID forces
       should have a basic understanding of their base IDP and IDRMP. General knowledge
       about the IDRMP concepts can be found in AFI 31-101.
       3.3.5.2. Dominate the BB. This includes a visible ID force presence (when possible),
       community integration in security operations, reliability screening and access control.
       3.3.5.3. Operationalize Force Protection Intelligence (FPI) in order to maintain optimal
       situational awareness throughout the BB and BSZ. This can be accomplished through the
       development of a robust intelligence/information collaboration, analysis and fusion
       capability, utilizing the support prescribed in AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force
       Protection (FP), and FM 2-01.3, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield/Battlespace
       (IPB).
       3.3.5.4. Increase ID force readiness as threats and Force Protection Condition (FPCON)
       levels escalate.
       3.3.5.5. Apply appropriate lethal and non-lethal force IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use
       of Force by Air Force Personnel, local rules of engagement (ROE) and Status of Forces
       Agreements (SOFA).
       3.3.5.6. Execute emergency response procedures designed to isolate, contain and defeat
       hostile actions and restore normal operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.
3.4. Military Symbology. Standard military symbology is used by the DFC, their S-Staff and
FLs to show, in graphic form, ID operations on maps, overlays and various other displays.
Symbols are used to indicate specific units, boundaries and weapon systems, and are
 22                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


standardized for common understanding and use. A comprehensive list of military symbols can
be found in FM 1-02, Operational Terms and Graphics.
3.5. Overlays. These tools are used primarily by the DFC’s staff to keep the DFC and FLs
informed of vital ID information using standard military symbols. Each map overlay should have
a legend containing a title, date and time prepared, author, map references, unit designation and a
security classification. Contemporary systems allow for overlays to be in digital form, making
them easy to produce, update and share. Some example types of map overlays are in Figure 3.2
and normally include, but are not limited to, the following:
   3.5.1. Defensive fighting positions and ID force posting overlay.
   3.5.2. Critical Resources.
   3.5.3. Fire plan overlay (normally composed of a combination of all flight fire plans).
   3.5.4. Support weapons emplacement overlay.
   3.5.5. Integrated detection, obstacle and routine patrol route overlay.
   3.5.6. Service and support overlay.
   3.5.7. Enemy activity overlay.

Figure 3.2. Overlays.




3.6. Troop Leading Procedures (TLP).
   3.6.1. This planning procedure is used by the DFC and their subordinate FLs to prepare their
   units to accomplish an ID mission. They use it upon initial mission notification and whenever
   there is a change to that mission. The TLPs are comprised of the steps listed in Figure 3.3
   Steps 3 through 8 may not follow a rigid sequence and may be accomplished concurrently.
   The DFC and FLs use the procedure to ensure nothing is left out of planning and preparation,
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                         23


   and their forces fully understand the mission and prepare adequately. The DFC and FLs
   continuously update their estimates throughout the planning process and adjust as
   appropriate. Detailed information on TLPs can be found in FM 7-8.

Figure 3.3. Troop Leading Procedures.




   3.6.2. Step 1. Receive the Mission. Leaders may receive the mission tasking either in writing
   or verbally. A mission may encompass ID as well as other security-related factors. The
   DFC/commanders must immediately begin to analyze the mission using the factors of
   METT-TC. What is the mission? What is known about the enemy (threat)? How will terrain
   and weather affect the operation? Consider Observation and Fields of Fire, Avenues of
   Approach, Cover and Concealment, Obstacles and Key Terrain (OACOK). What troops are
   available? How much time is available? What are the civil considerations that must be
   taken into account?
      3.6.2.1. Leaders should use no more than one third of the available time for their own
      planning and for issuing their OPORD. The remaining two thirds is for subordinates to
      prepare for the operation. They should also consider other factors such as available
      daylight and travel time.
      3.6.2.2. In establishing a defense schedule, the leaders should work backwards from the
      time ID forces are expected to fully defend assets to the time the leaders received the
      mission. Scheduled time lines should be realistic and somewhat flexible. However,
      failure to meet time lines will be detrimental to mission accomplishment. The reverse
      planning process is outlined in the warning order. Backwards planning allows leaders to
      establish deadlines for subordinate task completion keeping the “when” requirement of
      the concise mission statement in mind.
   3.6.3. Step 2. Issue a Warning Order. The leaders provide initial instructions in a warning
   order. The warning order contains enough information to begin preparation as soon as
 24                                                                 AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


   possible. The simplest order will explain the 5 Ws (who, what, when, where and why).
   Sample warning orders are shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5

   3.6.4. Step 3. Make a Tentative Plan. Leaders develop an estimate of the situation to use as
   the basis of their tentative plan. It consists of three steps: a detailed mission analysis, an
   analysis of the situation and the course of action (COA) determination (JP 5-0, Joint
   Operation Planning). COA determination consists of four primary activities: development,
   analysis and war gaming, comparison and approval (decision). The decision represents the
   tentative plan. Leaders update their estimate of the situation continuously and refine their
   plans accordingly. They also use the tentative plan as the start point for coordination,
   reconnaissance, task organization (if required) and other instructions. Leaders should be
   cautious to consider the principal of war simplicity, which calls for avoiding unnecessary
   complexity in organizing, preparing, planning and conducting military operations.
      3.6.4.1. COA Development. A COA consists of the following information: what type of
      military action will occur; why the action is required (purpose); who will take the action;
      when the action will begin; where the action will occur; and how the action will occur
      (method of employment of forces). In developing COAs, leaders at all levels must work
      through these sequences as time allows.
      3.6.4.2. To develop COAs, leaders focus on key information necessary to make
      decisions, using the data from mission analysis. They develop COAs to provide options
      to the commander. All COAs selected for analysis should be valid. A valid COA is one
      that is adequate, feasible, acceptable, distinguishable and complete. Potential COAs that
      do not meet all five criteria should be rejected. A good COA accomplishes the mission
      within the commander’s guidance and positions the force for future operations. It also
      provides flexibility to meet unforeseen events during execution and gives forces the
      maximum latitude for initiative. See Figure 3.6.
      3.6.4.3. During COA development, leaders continue risk assessment, focusing on
      identifying and assessing hazards to mission accomplishment.

Figure 3.6. COA Development.
Adequate         COA can accomplish the mission within the commander’s guidance.

Feasible         COA can accomplish the mission within the established time, space and resource
                 limitations.

Acceptable       COA must balance cost and risk with the advantage gained.

Distinguishable COA must be sufficiently different from the other COAs.

Complete         COA must incorporate:
                   Objectives, effects and tasks to be performed
                   Major forces required
                   Concepts for deployment, employment and sustainment
                   Time estimates for achieving objectives
                   Military end state and mission success criteria
      3.6.4.4. COA Analysis. Leaders analyze each tentative COA separately according to the
      DFC’s guidance. COA analysis identifies advantages and disadvantages of each proposed
      friendly COA. Leaders should be cautious to consider the principal of simplicity which
28                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


     calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning and
     conducting military operations. Analysis of the proposed COAs should reveal a number
     of factors which include:
         3.6.4.4.1. Potential decision points.
         3.6.4.4.2. Task organization adjustment.
         3.6.4.4.3. Identification of plan branches and sequels.
         3.6.4.4.4. Risk assessment.
     3.6.4.4.5. COA war gaming.
     3.6.4.5. War gaming provides a means for leaders and participants to analyze a tentative
     COA, improve their understanding of the operational environment and obtain insights
     that otherwise might not have occurred. An objective, comprehensive analysis of
     tentative COAs is difficult even without time constraints. War gaming provides a
     conscious attempt to visualize the flow of the operation, given joint force strengths and
     dispositions, adversary capabilities and possible COAs, the operational area and other
     aspects of the operational environment. It also identifies requirements needed to
     synchronize mission execution.
     3.6.4.6. War gaming facilitates a total understanding of the plan. It is not a rehearsal, but
     a “what-if” analysis. The war game is designed to synchronize all flight actions, whereas
     during COA development the leader is focused on simply integrating flight assets.
     3.6.4.7. COA Comparison. COA comparison is an objective process whereby COAs are
     considered independently of each other and evaluated/compared against a set of criteria
     that are established by the S-Staff and commander.
     3.6.4.8. The goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of COAs so that a COA
     with the highest probability of success can be selected or developed. During this step,
     leaders develop and evaluate a list of important criteria or governing factors; consider
     each COA’s advantages and disadvantages; identify actions to overcome disadvantages;
     make final tests for feasibility and acceptability; and weigh the relative merits of each.
     Selected COAs should:
         3.6.4.8.1. Mitigate risk to the force and mission to an acceptable level.
         3.6.4.8.2. Place the force in the best posture for future operations.
         3.6.4.8.3. Provide maximum latitude for initiative by subordinates.
         3.6.4.8.4. Provide the most flexibility to meet unexpected threats and opportunities.
     3.6.4.9. COA Approval. Once the analysis, war gaming and comparison have been
     completed, leaders will select the best COA based upon the results, the recommendations
     of others and the leader’s personal estimate, experience and judgment.
  3.6.5. Step 4. Initiate Movement. Leaders initiate any movement that is necessary to
  continue preparations or to posture the unit for the operation. As such, this step is more than
  actual physical movement; it also includes initiating preparatory actions. This may include
  movement to an assembly area (AA), battle position, perimeter defense or attack position;
  movement of reconnaissance elements; or movement to compute time-distance factors for the
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                         29


  unit’s mission. Forces may need to start movement to occupy their sectors while the
  leadership elements are still planning. The DFC and FLs may order this at any time during
  the troop leading procedures.
  3.6.6. Step 5. Conduct Reconnaissance. If possible, the DFC and FLs make a personal
  reconnaissance to verify the terrain analysis, avenues of approach, sectorization and other
  aspects of the plan. When time does not allow, the DFC and FLs should at least make a map
  reconnaissance and use aerial photography, if available. Based upon the reconnaissance, they
  adjust the plan as appropriate.
     3.6.6.1. Planners should be aware of the general/direct support ISR assets that are
     available, capabilities of ISR assets and the means to request ISR support if it becomes
     available. ISR assets include SUAS such as the Raven RQ-11B, the Wasp Micro Air
     Vehicle (MAV), Puma All Environment (AE), the Shrike Vertical Take-Off and Land
     Micro Air Vehicle (VTOL Mav) system, etc. In addition, ISR assets also include the
     ScanEagle, MQ-1 Predator, Persistent Ground Surveillance Systems (PGSS), RAID
     cameras, etc. Planners must become familiar with the ISR assets available to them at their
     location as assets will vary location to location.
  3.6.7. Step 6. Complete the Plan. The DFC and FLs complete their plan based upon their
  reconnaissance and any changes in the situation. They should again review the ID mission to
  ensure their plan is in accordance with the original tasking. They gather the information
  delegated to subordinates to complete and compile the entire plan into a comprehensive
  OPORD.
  3.6.8. Step 7. Issue the Complete Order. An OPORD is a directive issued by the DFC and
  FLs to subordinates in order to effect the coordinated execution of a specific ID mission. The
  DFC normally issues the squadron OPORD to their key staff members, flight commanders
  and any others affected by the plan. Upon receiving the squadron OPORD, the FLs complete
  and issue their OPORD. The FL’s OPORD is normally briefed down to the fire team leader
  level. However, at the FL’s discretion, it can be briefed to the entire flight. Examples of
  squadron and flight OPORDs are in Figures 3.7 and 3.8
     3.6.8.1. OPORDs are verbally issued to aid subordinates in understanding the mission,
     the concept of the operation and their assigned tasks. The OPORD needs to be tailored to
     the level of leadership putting it together. A squadron or higher level OPORD should be
     much less specific and provide a higher commander's intent, a leader's intent and then
     mission type orders (effects based orders to accomplish a task, but not how to get it
     done). The lower level OPORDs are then developed from that to the level of detail
     necessary to accomplish the task. Whenever possible, visual aids in the form of sketches,
     maps and terrain models should be used to increase clarity. OPORDs should be as
     detailed as possible and leaders should question subordinates to ensure full understanding
     of the mission and assigned tasks, Service and Support, Command and Signal and any
     support/logistical needs that may deviate from flight Standard Operating Procedures
     (SOP).
     3.6.8.2. Tasks.
 30                                                                   AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


          3.6.8.2.1. Specified Tasks. These are tasks specifically assigned to a subordinate
          team by the leader. Paragraphs 2 and 3 from the OPORD state specified tasks.
          Specified tasks may also be found in annexes and overlays.
          3.6.8.2.2. Implied Tasks. These are tasks that must be performed to accomplish a
          specified task, but which are not stated in the OPORD. Implied tasks are derived from
          a detailed analysis of the OPORD, the enemy situation, the COAs and the terrain.
          Analysis of the team’s current location in relation to future areas of operation as well
          as the doctrinal requirements for each specified task also might provide implied tasks.
          SOP tasks are not considered implied tasks.
          3.6.8.2.3. Essential Tasks. An essential task is one that must be executed to
          accomplish the mission derived from a review of the specified and implied tasks. This
          is normally the task found in the mission statement.

                             frequencies, procedures,        signals. Upon contact with the
                             passwords, emergency            enemy, we will switch over to
                             signals, flares and             voice commands.”

                             communications.
   3.6.9. Step 8. Supervise and Rehearse. The DFC and FLs supervise their respective unit’s
   (squadron/flight) preparation by monitoring the priorities of work, inspecting the ID forces
   and rehearsing critical ID actions. Items to inspect are weapons and ammunition, uniforms
   and equipment, individual Airman understanding of the mission and their specific
   responsibilities, communications, water and rations, camouflage, night vision goggles
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                           37


  (NVG), infrared (IR) strobes, blood chits (if issued) and other important items. This
  inspection is usually called a pre-combat inspection (PCI) or pre-combat check (PCC). An
  example of a PCI/PCC checklist can be found in Attachment 7, but it is not all inclusive and
  should be used only as a guide. Battle drills that should be rehearsed are fire control actions,
  mobile reserve actions, call for indirect fire, downed driver, downed gunner, vehicle rollover,
  vehicle towing procedures and other mission essential battle drills. What battle drills are
  conducted will be determined by the type of mission (mounted or dismounted).
     3.6.9.1. The FLs supervise the unit’s preparation for combat by conducting confirmation
     briefs, rehearsals and inspections. FLs should conduct a confirmation brief after issuing
     the oral OPORD to ensure subordinates know the mission, the commander’s intent, the
     concept of the operation and their assigned tasks. Confirmation briefs can be conducted
     face to face or by radio, depending on the situation. Face to face is the desired method,
     because all section and squad leaders are together to resolve questions and it ensures each
     leader knows what the adjacent squad is doing.
     3.6.9.2. The Flight conducts rehearsals. During the rehearsals, leaders practice sending
     tactical reports IAW the unit’s SOPs. Reporting before, during and after contact with the
     enemy is rehearsed in detail starting with actions on the objective. Rehearsals are not
     intended to analyze a COA. The FL uses well-planned, efficiently run rehearsals to
     accomplish the following:
         3.6.9.2.1. Reinforce training and increase proficiency in critical tasks.
         3.6.9.2.2. Reveal weaknesses or problems in the plan.
         3.6.9.2.3. Integrate and synchronize the actions of attached elements.
         3.6.9.2.4. Confirm coordination requirements between the flight and adjacent units.
         3.6.9.2.5. Confirm each Airman understands the mission, concept of operation, the
         direct fire plan, anticipated contingencies, and possible actions and reactions for
         various situations that may arise during the operation.
     3.6.9.3. Rehearsal techniques include the following:
         3.6.9.3.1. Map Rehearsal. A map rehearsal is usually conducted as part of a
         confirmation brief involving subordinate leaders or portions of their elements. The
         leader uses the map and overlay to guide participants as they brief their role in the
         operation. If necessary, they can use a sketch map. A sketch map provides the same
         information as a terrain model and can be used at any time.
         3.6.9.3.2. Sand Table or Terrain Model. This reduced-force or full-force technique
         employs a small-scale sand table or model that depicts graphic control measures and
         important terrain features for reference and orientation. Participants walk around the
         sand table or model to practice the actions of their own elements or vehicles (if
         working with mobile units) in relation to other members of the flight.
         3.6.9.3.3. Radio Rehearsal. This is a reduced-force or full-force rehearsal conducted
         when the situation does not allow the flight to gather at one location. Subordinate
         elements check their communications systems and rehearse key elements of the flight
         plan.
 38                                                                  AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


          3.6.9.3.4. Reduced-Force Rehearsal. In this rehearsal, leaders discuss the mission
          while moving over key terrain or similar terrain.
          3.6.9.3.5. Full-Force Rehearsal. This technique is used during a full-force rehearsal.
          Rehearsals begin in good visibility over open terrain and become increasingly
          realistic until conditions approximate those expected in the Area of Operation (AO).
          Sometimes commonly referred to as “battle drills.”
3.7. ID Patrol Organization and Planning. A patrol is a detachment dispatched by a larger
unit to conduct a combat or reconnaissance mission. Typical ID patrols are conducted by fire
team and squad sized elements. However, flight sized patrols may also be conducted, dependent
upon METT-TC. Routine ID patrols focus on reconnaissance, early detection of the threat,
checking LP/OPs and sensors and other routine actions in a sector.
   3.7.1. Directed patrols may be either reconnaissance or combat. Regardless of the patrolling
   mission, there are four key principles to a successful patrol:
       3.7.1.1. Detailed planning.
       3.7.1.2. Thorough reconnaissance.
       3.7.1.3. Positive control.
       3.7.1.4. All-around security.
3.8. Organizing for a Patrol. Depending upon the factors of METT-TC, a patrol leader (PL)
will organize the patrol to meet the needs of the mission. The PL must decide what elements and
teams are needed for the patrol, select personnel or units for these elements and teams, and
decide what weapons and equipment are needed. They should use the unit’s normal organization
and chain of command as much as possible to meet these needs. A patrol generally consists of a
patrol leadership element and those elements needed for the mission.
   3.8.1. The leadership element may consist of the PL, the assistant PL (APL) and a radio-
   telephone operator (RTO). However, in a small patrol, the PL may be the only person in the
   leadership element.
   3.8.2. Team organization for reconnaissance patrols will be based upon the mission tasking;
   in particular whether it is an area or zone reconnaissance patrol. The elements needed for an
   area reconnaissance patrol are a reconnaissance element and a security element. In a zone
   reconnaissance, the patrol is organized into several reconnaissance elements. A two-, three-
   or four-man reconnaissance patrol is not organized into elements. Instead, it operates as a
   single unit providing its own security while reconnoitering.
   3.8.3. Combat patrols are normally organized into assault elements, security elements and
   support elements. The PL will also normally designate an aid and litter team, a search team,
   an EPW team and other special purpose teams based upon the factors of METT-TC.
   3.8.4. The PL will select members, weapons and equipment based upon the factors of
   METT-TC. Only weapons and munitions needed to accomplish the mission should be
   carried. Equipment should be selected for aiding control (e.g., flashlights and radios), for
   common use for all patrol members (e.g., common uniform requirements), for use in the
   objective area and for use en route (e.g., maps and binoculars).
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                            39


3.9. Planning for a Patrol. When given an order to lead a patrol, the PL begins the same troop
leading procedure outlined in Paragraph 3.6, tailored to leading a patrol.
   3.9.1. The PL issues a warning order in the following format:
       3.9.1.1. Situation. Only the information needed for the patrol to make preparations is
       included. The complete situation is given in the patrol order.
       3.9.1.2. Mission. This is a brief and clear statement of what the patrol must accomplish.
       It tells who, what, when, where and why.
       3.9.1.3. General Instructions. General instructions are given.
       3.9.1.4. Organization. General and special organizations are given.
       3.9.1.5. Uniform and Equipment Common to All. Includes clothing, personal equipment,
       rations and water to be carried, camouflage measures to be taken and the means of
       identification each are to take.
       3.9.1.6. Weapons, Ammunition and Equipment. Based upon METT-TC, the PL will
       determine required weapons, ammunition and equipment, and possibly vehicles; they will
       assign them to the elements and element leaders will assign them to their members.
       Leaders must do a PCC/PCI prior to their team’s starting point (SP). In addition, leaders
       should check their team members to ensure all equipment made it back following a patrol
       (at the return point (RP)).
       3.9.1.7. Chain of Command. In squad size or smaller patrols, each patrol member is
       given a place in the chain of command. In larger patrols, each element or team leader is
       assigned a place in the chain of command. Each element or team leader then establishes a
       chain of command within the element or team.
       3.9.1.8. Time Schedule. The patrol is given a reverse time schedule for all activities that
       are to take place. The following is an example of a patrol time schedule:
          3.9.1.8.1. Time, place, uniform and equipment for receiving the OPORD.
          3.9.1.8.2. Times and places for inspections and rehearsals.
       3.9.1.9. Specific Instructions. Given to element and team leaders for getting, checking
       and distributing weapons, ammunition, equipment, rations and water; preparing their
       defenders for the mission; coordinating, inspecting, rehearsing and reconnoitering; and
       assistance in preparing the OPORD (e.g., designated person with compass prepares
       primary and alternate routes).
   3.9.2. The PL conducts coordination throughout the entire planning process. They coordinate
   with the S-2 to determine any changes in the enemy situation. They coordinate with the S-3
   for changes in the friendly situation, selection of routes, other patrols in the area, departure
   and reentry of the tactical perimeter (if applicable), transportation requirements (in
   conjunction with the S-4) and communication requirements. The PL coordinates with the
   FDC (if available) to ensure they are aware of the mission and objective, routes to and from
   the objective, fire support plan to include targets en route to and from the objective, targets
   on and near the objective and communications requirements.
 40                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


   3.9.3. The PL conducts a map, ground or aerial reconnaissance prior to completing the plan.
   After this, they assign essential tasks to be accomplished in the objective area. The PL plans
   how the elements are to perform their tasks on the objective. The PL then outlines additional
   tasks which will help the patrol reach the objective and return, such as primary and alternate
   routes, security during movement and at halts, actions on enemy contact, rally points (to
   include the objective rally point), logistical requirements and command and signal
   requirements.
   3.9.4. The PL completes the plan and issues it in the standard operation order format. Terrain
   models, rock drills, sketches and other visual aids should be used to assist in illustrating the
   plan.
3.10. Planning/Organizing for a Convoy. An excellent reference for planning, organizing and
conducting a convoy is AFTTP (I) 3-2.58, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for
Tactical Convoy Operations (FM 4-01.45).
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                            41

                         CONDUCTING INTEGRATED DEFENSE

4.1. General. Conducting ID is accomplished by achieving nine desired effects. Anticipate the
enemy is the critical first step. Upon anticipate, the enemy must be deterred. If the threat is not
deterred then SF elements need to detect the threat. After the threat has been detected, SF
elements need to assess the threat. Once assessed, all friendly forces need to be warned. SF
elements then need to defeat, delay and defend. Finally, recovery operations need to take place.
Other tasks relating to the conduct of ID include counterattack actions, consolidation and
reorganization, EPW actions and stability operations.
4.2. Anticipate. Conducted through threat analysis and IPB through the S-2/IFC.
4.3. Deter. Deter threat activity through mounted and dismounted patrolling, base boundary
posting from DFPs and positive entry control and circulation.
4.4. Detection. Detecting the enemy is the most important step in conducting ID. Effective
detection is accomplished through a combination of means to include:
   4.4.1. Maintain a Consistent Intelligence and Liaison Network. As outlined in Chapter 2, the
   DFC and the S-Staff (primarily the S-2/IFC) must continuously coordinate with available
   agencies such as AFOSI and the battle space owner’s TOC to gather as much information
   about the threat and its likely targets. Based upon current information, the DFC assesses their
   plan and adjusts accordingly. The information is disseminated to key leaders at the O-Group
   so all ID forces are kept abreast of the current threat, the enemy’s most likely COAs and
   changes to the defensive scheme.
   4.4.2. Site ID Force Positions to Enhance Detection. When FLs plan their defenses,
   emphasis should be placed on early detection as far away from critical resources as possible.
   Detection assets such as sensors, thermal imagers, night vision equipment, LP/OPs and
   MWD teams should be placed on key terrain inside and outside the base tactical boundary
   (within the BSZ). Areas should include high ground (hill tops), likely avenues of enemy
   approach (ravines, gullies), possible standoff threat positions (open areas within mortar
   range), aircraft approach and departure lanes and other critical areas requiring observation.
   Also, DFPs and barriers/obstacles should be sited to enhance the overall detection capability.
   4.4.3. Patrolling. Continuous active patrolling provides another means of detection. Patrols
   may either be routine as indicated by the patrol state or directed by the DFC to execute a
   specific mission. ID forces conduct two types of patrols: reconnaissance and combat.
   Reconnaissance patrols are either zone (conducted to obtain information on enemy, terrain
   and routes within a specified zone) or area (conducted to obtain information about a specified
   location and the area around it). Combat patrols are either ambushes (a surprise attack from a
   concealed position on a moving or temporarily halted target) or raids (an attack on a position
   or installation followed by a planned withdrawal). ID patrols are typically fire team to squad
   size and primarily focus on reconnaissance and detection. Attachment 8: Reverse Time
   Schedule outlines organization, planning and other considerations for patrolling in ID
   operations.
 42                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


   4.4.4. Reporting. Once the enemy is detected, it is reported up the chain of command
   through the BDOC in the form of a SALUTE (Size, Activity, Location, Unit/Uniform, Time,
   Equipment) report as outlined in Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-100, Airman’s Manual.
   This report gives the FS, FL and DFC critical information about the threat and allows for
   response preparation.
4.5. Assess. Assess the enemy by using RAID cameras, PGSS, posted sentries, response forces
or technologies such as those in the newly developing arenas of SUAS and TASS just to name a
few. In addition, leaders should consider the use of the Counter Rocket, Artillery and Mortar and
the backscatter system.
4.6. Warn. Warn friendly forces by utilizing mass radio notification, secure messaging and
giant voice.
4.7. Defeat. An effective delaying action will give ID forces the capability to carry out the third
phase of conducting ID – destruction of the threat. ID forces use available fire support and tactics
to carry out this task. Delay can be achieved using a layered application of barriers, obstacles,
technology, physical security measures and forces (defense-in-depth).
   4.7.1. Operational Fires. Based upon the factors of METT-TC, the FL may elect to request
   additional fire support outside their flight capabilities to destroy the threat. Indirect fire is
   controlled through the unit FDC, normally collocated with the JDOC or BDOC. Requests for
   indirect fire support are made by the FL to the JDOC/BDOC. Procedures to call for indirect
   fire support need to be coordinated with the supporting service at your unit’s deployed
   location. There are numerous AF and non-AF assets available to ID forces. Close air support
   assets could include the AC-130H/U, MC-130W, U.S. Army helicopter gunships and other
   fixed wing assets. Control of execution should be carried out only by qualified personnel.
   Other fire support assets may be available from the Army and Marine mortar and artillery
   assets. For more information on indirect fire support see Attachment 9.
   4.7.2. Tactical Employment. Based upon the factors of METT-TC, the FL may elect to
   tactically employ ID forces to defeat the threat. FL may use available flight forces or request
   mobile response forces. The leader accomplishes this using the principle of fire and
   maneuver. Fire and maneuver are conducted to close with and destroy the threat, to learn
   more of its strength and capabilities, and, if necessary, disengage from it. Fire and maneuver
   are conducted at the same time. A fire element covers the move of the maneuver element by
   engaging the enemy with suppression fire. A maneuver element moves to either close with
   the enemy or move to a better position from which to fire at the enemy. Depending upon the
   distance to the enemy positions and the availability of cover, the fire element and the
   maneuver elements switch roles as needed to keep moving. Before the maneuver element
   moves beyond the supporting range of the fire element, it takes a position from which it can
   fire at the enemy. The fire element becomes the maneuver element for the next move. While
   the MK-19s and M-2s may support the fire and maneuver action, most of the maneuvering
   forces’ fire support will come from its own weapons. As the maneuver element gets in and
   among the enemy, the fire element shifts fire to possible escape routes. This allows the
   maneuver element to sweep across the enemy position and secure the area.
   4.7.3. Counterattack. Counterattacks are conducted when a sector or area has been attacked
   by enemy force. If the posted forces determine a counterattack is warranted, it should be
   carried out swiftly with an overwhelming force and all available fire support. The size of the
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                             43


   threat will determine how large of a counterattack force is needed. In some cases, the
   counterattack element could be as small as a fire team; in other cases, it could be a flight.
   Counterattacks are normally carried out in the same manner as any tactical employment of
   troops – using fire and maneuver as outlined in Paragraph 4.7.2
       4.7.3.1. The mobile reserve flight is normally the appropriate ID force to conduct the
       counterattack as it has the assets and time to rehearse these actions. The DFC may
       designate additional forces to reinforce the mobile reserve flight based upon METT-TC
       factors.
4.8. Delay. Delay adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology,
physical security measures and forces (defense-in-depth).
   4.8.1. Obstacles and Barriers. Defenders use obstacles and barriers to shape the terrain to
   their advantage. To be successful in the defense, the leaders must integrate obstacles into
   both the direct and indirect fire plans. Per AFI 31-101, a barrier is a coordinated series of
   obstacles designed or employed to channel, direct, restrict, delay or stop the movement of an
   opposing force and to impose additional losses in personnel, time and equipment affecting
   the opposing force(s). Defenders must understand the basics of how obstacles and barriers
   help provide protection from counter mobility, standoff and blast.
       4.8.1.1. Counter mobility denies possibly explosive-laden vehicles proximity to
       resources/gathering areas far enough away to provide proper standoff.
       4.8.1.2. Proper standoff distance is the best way to diminish the effects of a blast wave.
       4.8.1.3. Blast mitigation is, in a general sense, the various physical measures that may be
       employed to lessen the damage of a blast wave on critical assets. These measures can
       include, but are not limited to, blast walls, blast barriers, standoff, structural hardening,
       retrofitting, etc.
   4.8.2. Tactical Obstacles. A tactical obstacle is designed or employed to disrupt, fix, turn or
   block the movement of the enemy. Barriers play a key role in the defense of critical assets
   and require deliberate planning with the IDWG/ATWG to achieve maximum utilization
   across the ID continuum.
       4.8.2.1. Disrupting Effects. Disrupting effects focus a combination of fires and obstacles
       to impede the enemy’s attack in several ways to include breaking up formations,
       interrupting tempo and causing early commitment of breaching assets. These effects are
       often the product of situational obstacles, such as claymore mines, and normally are used
       forward within engagement areas or in support of forward positions within a defensive
       sector. Normally, only indirect fires and long-range direct fires are planned in support of
       disrupting obstacles.
       4.8.2.2. Fixing Effects. Fixing effects use the combination of fires and obstacles to slow
       or temporarily stop an attacker within a specified area, normally an engagement area. The
       defending unit then can focus on defeating the enemy by using indirect fires to fix the
       enemy in the engagement area while direct fires inflict maximum casualties and damage.
       If necessary, the defender can reposition forces using the additional time gained as a
       result of fixing the enemy. To achieve the fixing effect fully, direct and or indirect fires
       must be integrated with the obstacles.
 44                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


       4.8.2.3. Turning Effects. Turning effects use the combination of direct and indirect fires
       and obstacles to support the DFC’s scheme of maneuver in several ways, including the
       following:
           4.8.2.3.1. Diverting the enemy into an engagement area and exposing their flanks
           when they turn.
           4.8.2.3.2. Diverting an enemy formation from one avenue of approach to another.
           4.8.2.3.3. Denying the enemy the ability to mass their forces on a flank of the
           friendly force.
           4.8.2.3.4. Additional references for obstacles/barriers include: FM 7-8, FM 3-21.9,
           SBCT Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad, and FM 90-7, Combined Arms Obstacle
           Integration.
           4.8.2.3.5. For more on defense-in-depth and barriers, refer to GTA 90-01-011, Joint
           Forward Operations Base (JFOB) Protection Handbook. The JFOB Handbook can
           assist leaders with determining appropriate barriers for employment. It covers barrier
           classification, barrier selection, perimeter barriers, personnel barriers, entry control
           point (ECP) barriers and all other elements pertaining to this realm.
   4.8.3. Firepower. As stated, a well-conceived obstacle and barrier plan will channel an
   enemy force into areas where ID forces can engage them with fire. Upon orders to engage,
   ID forces initiate fires IAW with the FL’s engagement priorities (examples outlined in
   Chapter 2). Based upon the FL’s assessment of the size and capability of the threat, he/she
   may request from the DFC a mobile response force as a backup measure. Mobile response
   forces should be incrementally committed. As ID heavy weapons teams (MK-19, 40mm
   grenade launchers, machine guns and M-2 .50 caliber machine guns) are typically attached to
   the mobile response force, they provide added firepower to ID forces in contact. To avoid
   unnecessary exposure to fire of the ID heavy weapons team, employ these weapons at their
   maximum effective range. If possible, employ these weapons in pre-designated “drive-in”
   positions.
4.9. Defend. Defend assets through threat analysis provided through S-2. Integrate all friendly
forces into the defense plan and all personnel are trained on ROEs, Use of Force (UOF) and
expeditionary skills. Perimeter defense is critical to defending the FOB.
4.10. Consolidation and Reorganization and Recovery. After the enemy withdraws or has
been defeated, the FL directs actions to consolidate and reorganize. The flight reestablishes
security; provides first aid and prepares wounded for medical evacuation; repairs damaged
obstacles and booby traps; redistributes ammunition and supplies; relocates selected weapons to
alternate positions if the FL believes the enemy may have pinpointed them during the attack and
adjusts other positions to maintain mutual support; reestablishes communications; reoccupies and
repairs positions; and prepares for another attack. Squad and team leaders provide appropriate
logistical, casualty and situation reports (as outlined in Tables 4.1 through 4.3) to the FL. The FL
reestablishes the flight chain of command and consolidates flight reports to forward to the DFC.
The flight sergeant coordinates for resupply and supervises the execution of the casualty and
EPW evacuation plan; the flight also continues to improve positions and resumes patrolling as
directed. A common reporting format at the small team level is Liquids, Ammo, Casualties and
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                              45


Equipment (LACE). Once the squad leader determines what they need for resupply, they report it
to flight leadership and then to the S-4.

  4.11.3. Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA). DoD activities, normally in support of the
  U.S. Agency for International Development or Department of State, conducted outside the
  U.S., its territories and possessions to relieve or reduce human suffering, disease, hunger or
  privation. (See JP 3-29, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance)
  4.11.4. Personnel Recovery. An operation to search for, locate, identify, recover and return
  isolated personnel, human remains or items critical to national security. (See JP 3-50,
  Personnel Recovery)
  4.11.5. Noncombatant Evacuation (NEO). An operation to evacuate noncombatants and
  civilians from foreign countries to refugee safe havens when their lives are endangered by
  war, civil unrest or natural disaster. (See JP 3-68, Noncombatant Evacuation Operations)
  4.11.6. Peace Operations (PO). PO include peacekeeping operations (PKO), peace building
  (PB) post-conflict actions, peacemaking (PM) processes, conflict prevention and military
  peace enforcement operations (PEO). (See JP 3-07.3, Peace Operations)
  4.11.7. Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Activities within the eight
  military mission areas that include WMD-related security cooperation and partner activities,
  offensive operations against WMD, defensive operations and managing the consequences of
  WMD attacks. (See JP 3-40, Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction)
  4.11.8. Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Consequence Management.
  DoD support to U.S. Government actions that plan for, prepare for, respond to and recover
  from the effects of domestic and foreign CBRN incidents. (See JP 3-41, Chemical,
  Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Consequence Management)
  4.11.9. Foreign Internal Defense (FID). Participation by civilian and military agencies of a
  government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated
  organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency,
  terrorism and other threats to its security. FID is an example of nation assistance. (See JP 3-
  22, Foreign Internal Defense)
  4.11.10. Counterdrug Operations. Support provided by the DoD to law enforcement agencies
  to detect, monitor and counter the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs. (See JP 3-
  07.4, Joint Counterdrug Operations)
  4.11.11. Combating Terrorism. Actions, including antiterrorism (defensive measures taken
  to reduce vulnerability to terrorist acts) and counterterrorism (actions taken directly against
  terrorist networks) to oppose terrorism. (See JP 3-07.2, Antiterrorism, and JP 3-26,
  Counterterrorism)
  4.11.12. Homeland Defense. The Protection of U.S. sovereignty, domestic population and
  critical defense infrastructure against internal threats and aggression or other threats as
  directed by the President. (See JP 3-27, Homeland Defense)
  4.11.13. Counterinsurgency (COIN). This is an operation that encompasses comprehensive
  civilian and military efforts taken to defeat an insurgency and to address any core grievances.
  (See JP 3-24, Counterinsurgency Operations)
     4.11.13.1. Mindset. Conducting successful COIN operations requires an adaptive and
     flexible mindset. First and foremost, the population is the key center of gravity of
     successful COIN. COIN can also be utilized across the ROMO.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                           49


       4.11.13.2. Understanding the population is to successful COIN as understanding physical
       terrain is to successful conventional land operations. Understanding the population
       requires an intimate knowledge of the causes and ongoing grievances of the insurgency.
       4.11.13.3. A second aspect of the counterinsurgent mindset is being able to think like an
       insurgent to stay ahead of the actual insurgents’ decisions and actions.
       4.11.13.4. Third, successful counterinsurgents must understand it is essential to establish
       an enduring presence within the population to provide continuous security and
       development efforts vital to assuring the population’s sense of security and long-term
       outlook.
       4.11.13.5. Finally, counterinsurgents must understand that the military instrument is only
       one part of a comprehensive approach for successful COIN, although the security
       situation may require the joint force to execute tasks that other organizations are better
       suited to conduct.
       4.11.13.6. Popular Support. The support of the people is the most vital factor in the long-
       term success of any COIN effort. Gaining and maintaining the population’s support can
       be a formidable challenge. It is imperative that the population have trust and confidence
       in their government and its institutions. Counterinsurgents must make every effort to
       reinforce the legitimacy of the HN government in the eyes of the people.
       4.11.13.7. Cultural Understanding. Forces or agencies supporting or conducting COIN
       must understand and be aware of the local and national culture. More specifically,
       counterinsurgents must understand the core grievances, drivers of conflict and friction
       points between different groups. Only when counterinsurgents understand the
       relationships of these factors can their COIN efforts be effective.
          4.11.13.7.1. Cultural awareness facilitates accurate anticipation of the population’s
          perception of COIN operations. These perceptions can determine the success or
          failure of COIN operations. By simultaneously addressing the core grievances and
          drivers of conflict and taking measures against the insurgencies themselves, COIN
          attacks the problem both indirectly and directly, thus providing the best chance for
          success. Insurgency and COIN also tend to be nested in larger, complex and irregular
          conflicts; therefore, understanding and appreciating the strategic context and
          operating environment are essential to success.
4.12. Security Forces Mission Sets.
   4.12.1. Common SF expeditionary mission sets are capability based. To achieve the full
   complement of SF mission sets, the request for forces (RFF) process must be followed.
   4.12.2. Typical base security may not possess the organic capabilities found in Table 4.4,
   Common SF Expeditionary Mission Sets. These capabilities should be specifically requested
   via RFF and filled via unit line number (ULN) line remarks indicating the specific capability
   required. Standard SF unit type codes (UTC) will be used and designated to provide a
   specific capability.
4.13. Military Working Dog Program. The MWD program is a critical enabler to ID and the
DFC’s ability to defeat threats. MWD enhance Air Force and joint capabilities to secure
protection level resources, enforce military laws and regulations, suppress the use of illegal
 50                                                                  AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


drugs, detect explosives and protect installations and resources during peacetime, war and in
support of operations other than war.
   4.13.1. The USAF MWD Team (MWDT) also serves a vital role in offensive and defensive
   operations with the other DoD components. The objective is to employ MWD assets
   aggressively and effectively to counter risks. AFI 31-121, Military Working Dog Program,
   provides the framework for employment and utilization to support ID in achieving the nine
   ID desired effects.
   4.13.2. The DFC will establish local procedures for MWD utilization. These procedures
   must conform to all DoD and Air Force instructions and local SOFA or other HN
   agreements.
   4.13.3. When integrating MWD assets into the defensive plan, the first consideration should
   place MWDs in positions where they can most effectively exploit their keen sense of smell.
   MWDs are most effective during nighttime hours and in areas of minimal activity. Rotate
   MWD teams through all appropriate posts to meet operational needs and to maintain
   proficiency of the MWD team.
   4.13.4. Unless an MWDT is conducting explosives/narcotic detection, observation or
   listening post duties, or psychological deterrence duties, MWDTs will not be placed on static
   posts.
   4.13.5. MWDs may be used to, but not limited to, conduct the following duties:
   4.13.6. Law Enforcement. Controlled aggression certified MWDs seek, detect, bite and hold,
   and guard suspects on command during patrol. They provide a psychological deterrence and
   can defend their handlers during threatening situations. They can assist in crowd control and
   confrontation management, and search for suspects and lost personnel, indoors and outdoors.
   4.13.7. No MWD will be used to validate the response of another MWD or mechanical
   device used to detect explosives or narcotics.
   4.13.8. Drug Suppression. Drug detection dog teams are specially trained in drug detection
   and support the Air Force goal of a drug-free environment. Their renowned capability to
   detect illegal drugs deters drug use and possession, and is a valuable adjunct to a
   commander's other tools such as urinalysis and investigation.
   4.13.9. Explosives Detection. Explosives detection dog (EDD) teams are exceptionally
   valuable in antiterrorism operations. They are capable of detecting unexploded ordnance,
   searching large areas during bomb threats quickly, and are valuable in augmenting EOD
   capabilities.
       4.13.9.1. EDDs will not be used to search suspicious/unattended packages or assess,
       examine and clear items already identified as a possible IED. However, there may be
       times in a theater of combat when an item needs to be cleared. In these cases, only the
       MWD handler will determine if the search will be conducted.
   4.13.10. Combat Operations. In war fighting roles, MWD teams provide enhanced patrol and
   detection capability to perimeter and point defense. In bare base operations, deploy MWDs
   as an early warning system. Given the range of potential contingencies, drug and explosives
   detection are also valuable added capabilities in these environments since they are patrol
   dogs first and detector dogs second.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                             51


   4.13.11. Under no circumstances will any type of MWD be used in the interrogation or
   interview of EPW or detainees. Refer to AFMAN 31-219, USAF Military Working Dog
   Program, for more guidance on contingency operations.
   4.13.12. Physical Security. The MWD team can augment detection roles and temporarily
   replace inoperative sensor systems.

                                           Chapter 5

                               RESILIENCE AND SURVIVAL

5.1. Resilience. The ability to respond, withstand, recover and/or grow in the face of stressors
and changing demands. Resilient Defenders aim to perform at their best, build protective
strategies to withstand demands placed upon them and recover and restore to return to mission
ready status.
   5.1.1. As Airmen, we will face both physical and psychological dangers which may create a
   great deal of physical and psychological stress. Demands, those of Defenders and their
   families, must be managed so as not to distract from the task at hand and help us perform
   optimally. This creates a delicate balancing act for leaders, their personnel and organizations
   to learn, understand and apply the skills necessary to become resilient and teach others these
   skills.
   5.1.2. Just as combat skills and training can prepare Defenders for the physical dangers
   common in war, resiliency training is the best protection from, and preparation for, dealing
   with psychological dangers. Below is a recommended guideline for leaders.
   5.1.3. Overview. Commander and leaders at all levels can assist their Airmen in developing
   the survival and winning mindset and overcome unnecessary hesitation in use of force
   applications. This is achieved through a continual developmental process of interrelated
   training activities, concepts, principles and conditioning. This continual process does not start
   or end at expeditionary training centers; it is part of a commander’s home station
   responsibility and requires leaders to champion cultural shifts which foster the development
   of the survival and winning mindset. In order to meet this responsibility, it is imperative
   leaders understand how to foster a survival and winning mindset, avoid conditioning/training
   pit falls and appropriately apply training elements.
   5.1.4. The Mindset. The first step in enhancing Airmen survival is to actively develop and
   foster a survival and winning mindset. The need for all Airmen to possess a proper mindset is
   essential for their defense and the defense of their fellow Airmen. In all kinds of situations,
   from combat to being lost in extreme climates, survivors share some common characteristics
   in their battles to survive, overcome and win. Survivors maintain a strong situational
   awareness. They are sensitive to cues of danger and their “personal radar” scans for any
   relevant information they can use. Survivors stay in the “here and now;” they accept and
   work with given conditions. They set small manageable goals leading to overall survival and
   winning. The bedrock of the survival and winning mindset is the expectation that something
   can be done and that there is something worth the struggle to survive, fight and win.
   Survivors never give up. Thoughts are focused on maintaining survival, on the goal of getting
   home and back to what one cares about and on ways to make that happen.
   5.1.5. The survival and winning mindset is more important than polished technique. When
   faced with attack, act immediately and take necessary actions to avoid injury. Do not let
   anything get in your way of survival. As Sir Winston Churchill said: “Never give in! Never
   give in! Never, never, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.” The
   essential components of the survival and winning mindset are:
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                              53


       5.1.5.1. Toughness: The uninhibited mental resolution to aggressively react to illegal
       violence with a fierce and violent defense.
       5.1.5.2. Immediate Response: Respond immediately with the appropriate level of force,
       stop the attack and secure the area. A warrior does not wait as the advantage is the
       surprise of instant and direct offense.
       5.1.5.3. Focus: Stay focused and single-minded on your goal of survival. Commit to your
       goal of survival and let nothing stand in your way.
       5.1.5.4. The above characteristics that enable survival can be trained which in turn
       increases the likelihood of survival. In addition, training speeds up an individual’s
       Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop which also increases the odds of survival.
       Noncommissioned Officers need to train the personnel they are charged to lead as it
       could save their life. Training helps to reduce the time it takes for an individual to go
       through their OODA loop, and this could possibly save their life.
5.2. Factors Which Cause Unnecessary Hesitation When Reacting to a Threat. In addition
to developing a survival and winning mindset, commanders should understand and leverage
training to mitigate the factors which cause hesitation when reacting to a threat. In many cases,
individuals have misconceptions of use of force based upon life experiences, media presentation
of use of force incidents, prior training (or lack thereof) and other factors. This section discusses
how commanders and Airmen can identify such factors and develop an effective way of dealing
with them to enable reasonable responses in use of force incidents.
   5.2.1. Psychological Inhibitions - resistance to taking another’s life. As a member of the
   Armed Forces, there are those times when we may be required to take another’s life; proper
   training can improve the ability of each Airman to respond to acts of violence and fulfill this
   duty without unnecessary hesitation. Having to use lethal force or other levels of violence
   may result in usually temporary psychological effects ranging from exhilaration to guilt.
   Though these effects may resolve on their own, leadership and mentoring can provide a
   context for the incident to facilitate the natural recovery process.
       5.2.1.1. Psychological inhibitions can be mitigated through the proper application of
       training as identified in Paragraph 5.3.2.3
   5.2.2. Personal beliefs. Airmen must resolve personal issues within themselves such as
   commitment to mission, mortality and willingness to sacrifice.
       5.2.2.1. Airmen must overcome the false belief, “This could never happen to me.” Past
       active shooter incidents in Germany and Afghanistan have proven that any Airmen could
       become the victim of close-range aggression.
       5.2.2.2. Another belief which may hinder an Airman’s ability to react to violence is the
       false assumption others will respond on their behalf (such as Air Force Security Forces).
       The active shooter incidents at Fort Hood, and in Germany and Afghanistan have proven
       these acts of violence will be well underway (possibly over) before emergency forces can
       respond to neutralize the threat. In most active shooter situations, the person in the best
       position to stop the threat is the individual closest to the threat to include the targeted
       victim.
54                                                                   AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


     5.2.2.3. An individual’s religious preference may affect their ability to inflict aggression
     on others. Airmen who believe their religion prohibits the use of force, including deadly
     force, should consult guidance from a spiritual leader to resolve these issues. Airmen may
     cause harm to themselves or others if they unnecessarily hesitate based upon their
     religious beliefs.
  5.2.3. Understanding Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and ROE. Airmen must be clear on
  the inherent right of personal or unit self-defense. This understanding may prevent
  unnecessary hesitation and save their lives and the lives of their fellow Airmen. Each
  Airman, no matter the career field, duty position or rank, must feel confident that their
  leadership, Air Force and Government will protect them from legal harm if they discharge
  force to protect themselves or their fellow Airmen. Commanders and leaders at all levels can
  overcome this hesitation by reinforcing the Airman’s inherent right to use all means
  necessary and appropriate for personal or unit self-defense and incorporate this information
  into training scenarios.
  5.2.4. Understanding the application of force. Some Airmen may believe that deadly force is
  employed only as a last resort and used only when all lesser means have been exhausted. The
  legal standards do not require Airmen to select the least intrusive alternative, only a
  reasonable one.
     5.2.4.1. A cascading effect occurs when reasonable use of force is not applied
     immediately to gain control or compliance. Circumstances of the incident become either
     more dangerous, out of control or unmanageable for the personnel involved.
     5.2.4.2. The Airman’s ability to determine a reasonable force option quickly and
     efficiently erodes as the complexity of the decision and assessment increases.
     5.2.4.3. When reasonable force is applied immediately and without hesitation, that force
     application results in fewer injuries to both the Airmen and offenders. This is due to a
     quick ending and establishment of control.
     5.2.4.4. According to AFTTP 3-4.6, Active Shooter, when faced with a life threatening
     act of violence, Airmen have no duty to retreat in an effort to avoid using force on a
     hostile aggressor. However, Airmen must remember (based upon the totality of
     circumstances), that disengaging from a threat in order to gain a tactical advantage and
     put them into a position of advantage may be a reasonable response to a dangerous
     situation.
  5.2.5. Commanders are encouraged to evaluate local risks to assigned forces before
  employing policies which restrict an Airman’s ability to protect themselves (e.g., changes in
  arming status, restricting weapons based upon rank, preventing Airmen from carrying
  weapons, etc). In addition, commanders must consider factors which place their subordinates
  at a tactical disadvantage (e.g., arming status other than what they are trained on, office
  layout/design, etc).
  5.2.6. Learned Behavior. No two Airmen have exactly the same background (e.g., morals,
  ethics, values, etc). Some may have combat experience, some may be college graduates and
  all were raised with different value systems by their parents. Individuals entering military
  service must recognize that some of the behaviors they have learned throughout their life
  may cause hesitation in the use of force. Example: Most boys growing up are taught from a
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                          55


  very young age that it is wrong to hit a girl. This does not require conscious thought, but a
  male Airman faced with a situation where he is required to use force on a female may
  hesitate momentarily due to the learned behavior of never hitting a girl.
     5.2.6.1. Airmen must understand that there is no universal description of a person who
     will commit an act of violence. They come in every shape, size, race, creed and color.
     Airmen must overcome some of their learned behavior in order to reduce hesitation in a
     use of force incident.
  5.2.7. Physiological changes. When faced with a threat, Airmen need to understand that
  certain physiological changes occur. These changes are triggered by the sympathetic nervous
  system which is something we are all wired with from birth.
     5.2.7.1. The sympathetic nervous system initiates a defense mechanism referred to as the
     “fight, flight or freeze” response when you are stressed with the perception of death or
     serious bodily harm. This response prepares the body for a survival reaction. A third
     response known as “freezing” could occur once the body’s defense mechanism is
     activated. This response is important because it can affect the Airman’s ability to react to
     the situation at hand. Though these responses can occur very quickly, they can also be
     mitigated or recovered from more quickly through training and preparation as outlined in
     Paragraph 5.3.2.3 and 5.4
     5.2.7.2. Once the sympathetic nervous system is triggered, the Airman experiences
     effects in visual processing, motor skill performance and cognitive processing. These
     effects can be mild or severe depending upon the situation and level of stress experienced
     by the individual. Some of those effects can be positive (i.e., more blood flow to carry
     more oxygen through the body, less sensitivity to pain, etc) to help the individual respond
     optimally. However, when the sympathetic nervous system is overwhelmed, the impact
     can be negative. According to research conducted by Dr. Alexis Artwohl and Bruce
     Siddle, the following are physical responses to fear:
         5.2.7.2.1. Pounding heart
         5.2.7.2.2. Muscle tension
         5.2.7.2.3. Trembling
         5.2.7.2.4. Rapid, shallow breathing
         5.2.7.2.5. Dizziness
         5.2.7.2.6. Nausea
         5.2.7.2.7. Gut wrenching knot
         5.2.7.2.8. Sweating
         5.2.7.2.9. Dry Mouth
         5.2.7.2.10. Goose bumps
         5.2.7.2.11. Tingling sensation in limbs and/or face
         5.2.7.2.12. Insensitive to pain
         5.2.7.2.13. Jumpy, easily startled
 56                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


           5.2.7.2.14. Urge to urinate
           5.2.7.2.15. Urge to defecate
           5.2.7.2.16. Loss of fine motor skills
           5.2.7.2.17. Loss of complex motor skills
           5.2.7.2.18. Loss of depth perception
           5.2.7.2.19. Loss of near vision
           5.2.7.2.20. Increase in gross motor skills
   5.2.8. Perceptual changes from fear:
       5.2.8.1. Tunnel vision - The loss of peripheral vision. Your field of vision may narrow to
       mere inches and you may lose depth perception and the ability to see what is behind the
       threat.
       5.2.8.2. Heightened visual clarity - While experiencing tunnel vision, you may have a
       clear picture of details you ordinarily might not notice or remember.
       5.2.8.3. Hearing distortions - The most common hearing distortion is diminished sound,
       which may include a total loss of hearing, to muffled and distant. You may not hear shots
       being fired, people yelling at you or sirens coming your way.
       5.2.8.4. Time distortion - Things may seem to slow down (slow motion) or speed up.
       Airmen can experience both types of time distortion during the same incident.
   5.2.9. Cognitive/behavioral changes:
       5.2.9.1. Automatic behavior - Most participants in a traumatic event give little or no
       thought to their behavior; they just instinctively do what their experience has
       programmed them to do. This is why police officers and service members are told “you
       will do what you train to do, so trust your training.”
       5.2.9.2. Memory gaps - It is normal when you are involved in a deadly force encounter
       to not remember parts of what happened and parts of what you did. Memories of high
       threat situations are often like a series of snapshots: some vivid, some blurry and some
       even missing.
       5.2.9.3. Intrusive thoughts - Sometimes you may have intrusive thoughts that may not be
       immediately relevant to your current situation. You might think of your family, some
       future event or a previous event that reminds you of the present one.
5.3. Commander Considerations. The Air Force currently provides commanders with a wide
array of training opportunities, which if properly employed, can aid in development of the
survival and winning mindset and mitigating factors affecting the ability to react to threats. The
intent of this chapter is not to infer Air Force commanders must develop new training venues to
achieve these objectives. Rather, it is intended to provide leaders with a philosophical
understanding of how to leverage existing training opportunities to achieve the desired
conditioning. Therefore, it is imperative leaders are able to identify conditioning/training pitfalls
and understand the appropriate application of training elements.
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                           57


  5.3.1. Conditioning/Training Pitfalls. The four primary ways leaders can improperly
  condition their Airmen is by: unintentionally conditioning Airmen to react in an undesired
  manner; the faulty belief task completion of a singular training venue alone will yield desired
  operational capabilities; excessive use of simulation of individual action during exercise
  scenarios; and allowing Airmen to “lose” during training scenarios. Below are some
  examples of how leaders with the best of intentions may allow their programs to employ
  improper conditioning/training pitfalls.
     5.3.1.1. Unintentional Conditioning. Base X conducted operational readiness training by
     placing Airmen in simulated combat scenarios during their field training exercises (FTX).
     All Airmen “deployed” to the FTX were issued weapons; however, only Security Forces
     were issued blank ammunition. When the opposing forces (OPFOR) attacked the base,
     only Security Forces had the means to engage the enemy. This approach was the
     installation’s standard training structure for years. During one year’s event, a follow on
     scenario was conducted where Security Forces were removed from the FTX and blank
     ammunition was issued to the rest of the Airmen. When the base was under attack during
     the second scenario, few Airmen engaged the OPFOR and some never even loaded their
     weapons. When the Installation’s Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) questioned the
     Airmen why they had not engaged, some responded they “forgot” they had a weapon. So
     what was the failure? What this training did was condition the Airmen not to fight back
     even when attacked. In addition, Airmen were conditioned to view their weapon as a
     burden rather than the key to their survival, even though this was not the intention of
     leadership.
     5.3.1.2. The execution of a singular training task in most cases will not yield an
     operational capability. Capabilities are normally developed through a continual
     developmental process of interrelated activities, concepts and principles. For example, a
     commander wishes to develop their Airmen’s ability to engage a hostile threat with their
     weapon and uses Air Force weapons certification firing to meet this objective. This
     singular approach to training does not yield the desired capability because weapons
     certification provides the Airman with the intellectual ability of how to use a weapon, but
     it alone does not condition them to physically (through muscle memory or stimulus
     response) and immediately react to a threat, nor does it cultivate the psychological
     mindset needed to react effectively to violence.
     5.3.1.3. Excessive Use of Simulation of Individual Action During Exercise Scenarios.
     Realistic exercise scenarios yield great benefits in conditioning the appropriate response.
     However, when scenarios are run and individual actions are allowed to be excessively
     simulated (intended to minimize work disruption), the actual outcome is degradation in
     appropriate conditioning. Excessive simulation of individual actions conditions Airmen
     to ignore the initial warnings, hesitate in their actions (wait to hear the direction to
     simulate) or not act at all. An installation may have a robust training and exercise
     program; however, if individuals are allowed to simulate their action, then the exercise
     does little more than meet an annual exercise requirement rather than provide the desired
     level of conditioning. Simulation should be very limited. Defenders need to train the way
     they fight without constant simulation.
  5.3.2. The Appropriate Application of Training Elements. In order for training to be
  effective, it needs to focus less on task certification and more on conditioning the response of
58                                                                  AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


  the Airman. To develop survival and winning mindset, training should condition the
  Airman’s physical, intellectual and psychological abilities to react to violence.
     5.3.2.1. Physical Elements of Training. The physical elements of training achieve two
     objectives: condition the Airmen to be physically capable to execute the task (physical
     fitness) and be able to responsively react to the task without hesitation during periods of
     high stress (muscle memory). It is important to note just because a training class is
     physical in nature, that does not mean it meets the physical elements of training (physical
     fitness or muscle memory). Courses that are physical in nature but merely introduce or
     familiarize a task (e.g., annual weapons qualification, annual chemical warfare training)
     meet the intellectual elements of training. Examples of activities which develop Physical
     Element are:
        5.3.2.1.1. Proficiency Drills (stimulus response)
        5.3.2.1.2. Quick Reactionary Weapons Drills
        5.3.2.1.3. Physical Fitness
        5.3.2.1.4. Weapons Proficiency (not merely qualification)
        5.3.2.1.5. Combatives type training (must be routinely trained)
     5.3.2.2. Intellectual Elements of Training. The intellectual elements of training are to
     inform, familiarize, clarify or introduce subject matter required for a task. Examples of
     activities which develop the intellectual element are:
        5.3.2.2.1. Understanding Policies and Procedures
        5.3.2.2.2. Understanding Individual Responsibilities
        5.3.2.2.3. Understanding Threat Indicators
        5.3.2.2.4. Understanding Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and Rules of Engagement
        (ROEs)
        5.3.2.2.5. Annual Weapons Qualification
        5.3.2.2.6. Annual Chemical Warfare Training
        5.3.2.2.7. Training which overcomes learned behaviors or inappropriate personal
        beliefs (the “this could never happen to me” mentality)
     5.3.2.3. Psychological Elements of Training. The psychological elements of training
     condition Airmen in three main areas to: overcome physiological inhibitions, foster the
     development of a desired mindset and overcome the physical, cognitive and behavioral
     responses to fear and stress. Some training designed to condition Airmen physically can
     also yield psychological benefits. For example, using a virtual weapons training simulator
     achieves the physical element of weapons proficiency while the interface with humanlike
     targets helps overcome the physiological inhibitions of engaging another human.
     Additionally, physical training venues such as combatives helps develop the mindset and
     will to fight, while allowing Airmen to overcome fear of personal injury. Psychological
     training can help inoculate Airmen to the stress and fear of combat by building
     confidence in their ability to handle similar high stress situations and developing mental
     toughness so they can function during high stress situations by introducing them to the
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                             59


       visual, audio and situational stimuli prior to an actual event. Lastly, preparing Airmen
       psychologically yields benefits beyond effectively reacting to enemy contact. This
       element of training can strengthen Airmen resiliency and enhances survival after the
       fight. This is done by introducing them to the visual, audio and situational stimuli prior to
       an actual event so they can adapt to the situation, experience and overcome stress with
       learned strategies and learn how to effectively respond. Examples of activities which
       develop the Psychological Element are:
          5.3.2.3.1. Combatives Training
          5.3.2.3.2. Reality Based Training (Dynamic and Interactive)
          5.3.2.3.3. Continuous Positive Visualization
          5.3.2.3.4. Virtual Simulation
          5.3.2.3.5. Live Exercise (with realistic sounds, smells, sights and scenarios)
          5.3.2.3.6. Mental Toughness Training
5.4. Resiliency and the Individual.
   5.4.1. It is the individual’s responsibility to understand and apply fundamental resilience
   skills to stressful events in their lives, regardless of the location and situation in which they
   find themselves. Each Air Force member must seek to prepare themselves for these events
   prior to being deployed.
   5.4.2. Resilience is the Warrior’s inner strength to face the realities of the environment with
   courage, composure and confidence. This includes training, operations, combat and
   transitioning home. Resilient warriors take care of themselves, their buddies and those they
   lead.
   5.4.3. Strategies to Improve Individual Mental Fitness:
       5.4.3.1. When you are faced with a stressful situation, there are four initial reactions:
       thoughts (what you think), behavior (what you do), physical reactions (how your body
       responds), and emotions (how you feel). You have a powerful brain and have made it
       through stressful situations before. Accept the realities of the situation. Change what you
       can. The following are examples of how to adjust your initial reactions to stress and
       improve your mental fitness:
       5.4.3.2. Self-regulation. Use strategies to manage your physiological and emotional
       response to maximize an optimal response.
       5.4.3.3. Defender mindset (warrior ethos). Identify your personal values or what is
       important to you in life. Recognize that adversity and pain is unavoidable, but can be
       managed by keeping your values in mind when making decisions.
       5.4.3.4. Mental tactics. Be your own personal coach by encouraging yourself, even in
       tough or challenging situations. When in a stressful situation, remember to make
       decisions that will help you live up to your warrior ethos, even if it is not easy to do so.
       5.4.3.5. Internal situational awareness. Notice your initial reactions to situations and
       adjust your behavioral responses to maximize your success and maintain optimal
       performance levels.
60                                                                    AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


     5.4.3.6. Teamwork. Maintain strong relationships with your buddies, cadre and family.
     Contact your Chaplains, mental health professionals and medical providers for additional
     assistance.
     5.4.3.7. Adrenaline management and attention control.
     5.4.3.8. Controlled breathing helps you slow your breathing and heart rate to bring you
     into the optimal range of performance.
     5.4.3.9. Attention conditioning helps you to control your concentration and focus to
     maintain situational awareness and improve decision-making.
     5.4.3.10. STEP-UP (Self-Talk for Enhanced Performance Under Pressure – Asken,
     2005). Think about the actions you have to do when things are not going in the direction
     you want. People that are less resilient have mental static (“I cannot do this, this is too
     difficult”, etc) that prevent them from an optimal response. Positive self-talk helps you to
     think instead of the actions you need to take to achieve your goal.
  5.4.4. Resiliency and the Team:
     5.4.4.1. Team members are the individual’s closest ally to strengthen resilience. They
     share the same experiences, may better understand what the individual is going through
     and how to better deal with the aftermath. Through these shared experiences, team
     members develop relationships that put them in the best position to support one another
     as they build resilience into the team environment. As a team member, you are most
     likely to see behavior changes in your fellow team members. When behavior changes
     become apparent, don’t hesitate to approach the individual and talk about what may be
     troubling them.
     5.4.4.2. Team members can help one another recognize there are many contributing
     factors when bad things happen. They can offer additional perspectives individuals may
     not cognitively recognize in the aftermath of a significant emotional event. Team
     members must understand the limitations they have in dealing with behavioral health
     problems within the team. Some situations may only require listening to your buddy and
     helping them deal with a one-time issue. Other situations may require escalation of
     support from professionals such as Chaplains and mental health professionals. You have
     a responsibility to take care of your teammates…even if it means your wingman may get
     angry with you for doing it.
  5.4.5. Resiliency and the Leader.
     5.4.5.1. It is the leader’s responsibility to understand and apply fundamental resiliency
     skills to stressful events in their lives and the lives of their personnel, regardless of the
     location and situation in which they find themselves.
     5.4.5.2. The following is situational dependent and not always possible. That being
     understood, in order to strengthen individual and unit resiliency, leaders should make the
     effort to stabilize shift work and understand the central importance of a predictable sleep
     cycle for their personnel. By understanding how this affects people, the health of the
     individuals can significantly improve. Additionally, emphasis must be placed on physical
     fitness and personal health issues. Typically, units that conduct physical training sessions
AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013                                                                          61


     together experience higher levels of cohesiveness and a physically and psychologically
     healthier force.
     5.4.5.3. Leaders should develop plans on how to deal with situations that arise which
     could place undue stress on their personnel. Resiliency and stress management will
     always be concerns to leaders whether in peacetime or wartime. The Air Force has
     supported numerous studies and programs concerning resiliency and stress management
     for leaders to access for support information and guidance. A common element
     throughout these briefings is the imperative of preparedness. Leaders at all levels must be
     attuned to signs of stress and have a plan to deal with resiliency issues at the individual
     and unit level.
     5.4.5.4. As a leader and direct supervisor, you are more likely to see some of these
     behaviors than more senior unit leaders, but need to recognize that these behavioral
     reactions may take time to develop and become apparent. Listen to your Defenders…let
     them know you are not simply going to “let this drop.” Listening helps to have a good
     understanding of the extent of the problem, ensures your Defenders understand their
     leaders care about them and enforces the fact they are not dealing with their problems
     alone.
     5.4.5.5. It is important to understand the likelihood of some problems getting worse over
     time and the benefit to Defenders when a leader demonstrates they actively track
     individual problems and care about their Defenders. However, leaders must realize they
     are not equipped to handle every situation on their own. As a leader you must know your
     limitations in dealing with those situations.
     5.4.5.6. Knowing your limitations. Leaders should encourage mental health professional
     involvement as needed and as early as applicable to the situation. This kind of referral
     does not mean the leader stops being involved; it means that other assets and resources
     are called in to support the individual. Leaders should have plans in place and develop
     working relationships with key support personnel (i.e., chaplains, mental health
     professionals, etc) which enable them to have the applicable resources at their fingertips.
     Lastly, leaders must know when to seek help for themselves, not only for their
     subordinates. Self-care is a huge factor in mission sustainment for all Airmen.
     5.4.5.7. Demonstrating resilience through leadership. One concept leaders can use to
     help their personnel develop resilience is “thinking skills.” Some examples of resilient
     thinking are seeing things more positively, accepting military demands and professional
     identity, keeping a sense of humor, avoiding blaming or criticizing self and having
     confidence in managing the stress reactions of yourself and your wingmen.
     5.4.5.8. Practicing an optimistic attitude builds positive emotion and gratitude. It also
     serves to counteract the “negativity bias” (paying more attention to the bad than the
     good). Optimists view adversity as a challenge and setbacks as temporary. Pessimists
     view adversity as permanent and out of their control. Leaders can also develop resilience
     by highlighting and building a sense of purpose in the job that you do regardless of that
     duty and, where possible, giving unit members and/or teams a sense of control in what
     they do. It is important to help your personnel make the best out of a bad situation. If one
     of them is having a bad day, you and other leaders can help them have the best bad day
     possible.
 62                                                                     AFH31-109 1 MAY 2013


       5.4.5.9. Lastly, leaders should understand that morale and resilience have a direct
       correlation. If unit personnel’s morale is high, they will be more resilient. If unit
       personnel’s morale is low, they will be less resilient. Thus, leaders should seek to obtain
       high morale within their units.
       5.4.5.10. Bottom line – Resiliency will help you bounce and bend, and keep you from
       breaking.
5.5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) arises as a
delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation (either short- or long-lasting)
of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress
in almost anyone (e.g., natural or man-made disaster, combat, serious accident, witnessing the
violent death of others or being the victim of torture, terrorism, rape or other crime).
   5.5.1. Typical symptoms of PTSD include episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in
   intrusive memories ("flashbacks") or dreams, occurring against the persistent background of
   a sense of "numbness" and emotional blunting, detachment from other people,
   unresponsiveness to surroundings, inability to experience pleasure and avoidance of activities
   and situations reminiscent of the trauma. Commonly there is fear and avoidance of cues that
   remind the sufferer of the original trauma. Rarely, there may be dramatic, acute bursts of
   fear, panic or aggression, triggered by stimuli arousing a sudden recollection and/or re-
   enactment of the trauma or of the original reaction to it.
   5.5.2. The onset follows the trauma with a latency period which may range from a few
   weeks to months (but rarely exceeds 6 months). The course is fluctuating but recovery can be
   expected in the majority of cases. In a small proportion of patients, the condition may show a
   chronic course over many years and a transition to an enduring personality change.
   Psychological and pharmacological treatments are available to all Airmen and research has
   shown that earlier interventions are more effective.

                PROCEDURES TO REQUEST INDIRECT FIRE SUPPORT

A call for fire is a message prepared by an observer. It has all the information needed to deliver
indirect fire on a specific target. Though normally requested through the FL, any member of the
flight may request fire support by use of the call for fire. Calls for fire are broken down into three
parts with a break and a read back between each part. The information below is the minimum
necessary, and is by no means all inclusive. Personnel should be aware of theater specific
requirements as necessary. Finally, personnel should review AFTTP (I) 3-2.6, J-Fire Multi-
Service Procedures for The Joint Application of Firepower.
PART 1: Identification of Observer. This is the observer’s call sign.
Warning Order. This is sent to achieve communication priority and alert the DFC of the fire
mission. May be: adjust fire, fire for effect, suppress or immediate suppression.
PART 2: Location of Target. Informs the FDC of the location of the target. Normally, a six
digit grid or an existing planned target is used. Observers may also shift from a known point.
PART 3: Description of the Target. Provides the FDC a brief description of the target. Use
acronym “SNAP” to describe the target: Size/shape, Nature/nomenclature, Activity and
Protection/posture.
Shift From a Known Point:
“A78, this is A67, adjust fire, shift BC 4312, over.”
“A67, this is A78, adjust fire, shift BC 4312, out.”
“Direction 230 degrees, left 170, drop 500, over.”
“Direction 230 degrees, left 170, drop 500, out.”
“Insurgent emplacing IED, danger close, over.”
“Insurgent emplacing IED (describe the target: Size/shape, Nature/nomenclature, Activity and
Protection/posture).” A call for fire may also include the following information:
Method of Engagement. Includes type of adjustments danger close trajectory ammunition and
distribution.
Method of Fire and Control. Includes outlining a method of fire and control such as “at my
Command” “cannot observe” “time on target” and “continuous illumination.” The following are
examples of call for fire.
REQUEST                                                        FDC RESPONSE
Grid: “A78, this is B49, adjust fire, over.”                   “B49, this is A78, adjust fire, out.”
“Grid 907453, over.”                                           “Grid 907453, out.”

“Squad size element in trench line cannot observe, over.” “Squad size element in trench line
                                                           cannot observe, out.”

Shift from a Known Point:                                    FDC RESPONSE
“A78, this is A67, adjust fire, shift BC 4312, over.”        “A67, this is A78, adjust fire, shift
                                                             BC 4312, out.”

“Direction 230 degrees, left 170, drop 500, over.”           “Direction 230 degrees, left 170,
                                                             drop 500, out.”

“Mortar team on top of building, danger close, over.”           “Mortar team on top of building,
                                                                danger close, out.”
NOTE: For shifting from a known point, the observer must determine the grid direction to the
target, the lateral shift to the target from the known point and the range shift from the known
point to the target. FDC must have the known point and target number.
