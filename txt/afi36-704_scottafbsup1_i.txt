   ment, reprimand, or suspension of less than 15 days. Issue oral admonishments and reprimands under
   the same conditions and in the same manner as for other employees. If the offense warrants a penalty
   more severe than a reprimand, supervisors normally will terminate the employee, using procedures
   applicable to the employee's type of appointment. Supervisors, however, may impose a suspension not
   to exceed 5 days rather than termination, if a suspension is considered sufficient to rehabilitate the
   employee.
   3.2. For actions against probationers who fail to exhibit fitness for continued employment, see the
   requirements and procedures in AFI 36-1001.

       •   Constructively correct employees individually and in private.
       •   Recommend actions; coordinate proposed and final notices with the CPF, the office of staff

       visors perform these functions. Higher level supervisors may also do so.
       5.2.2. CPOs and their functional chiefs may sign and issue notices, receive and consider
       employee's answers, recommend and make final decisions, and take actions directed by appropri-
       ate authorities outside the Air Force and higher level authorities within the Air Force.

6. Reviewing and Coordinating Disciplinary and Adverse Actions.

       •   Serves as the primary local source of authoritative information and interprets policy and pro-
           cedures concerning civilian discipline and adverse actions.
       •   Shares responsibility with managers to ensure that such actions comply with governing
           requirements.
       •   Coordinates written notices of proposed actions and final decisions before delivery to employ-
           ees.
NOTE: Although not required, the Air Force recommends that supervisors seek advice from a CPF rep-
resentative before administering an oral admonishment.
   6.2. The office of the staff judge advocate reviews notices of proposed adverse actions and notices of
   final decisions for legal sufficiency.

Section B—Administering Constructive Disciplinary and Adverse Actions

7. General Information. This section gives general guidance to supervisors and managers for the con-
structive administering of disciplinary and adverse actions. It doesn't establish mandatory procedures.
   7.1. Constructive Discipline. Maintaining discipline usually is not a problem within a work environ-
   ment where supervisors:
       •   Establish, clearly communicate, and consistently enforce reasonable rules and standards of
           conduct and performance.
       •   Set a good example.
       •   Identify conduct and performance that needs improvement in a way that respects the
           employee's dignity.
       •   Treat employees fairly and encourage them to improve.
       •   Recognize good performers.
   7.2. Principles of Constructive Discipline. Constructive discipline is preventive in nature. The
   objectives are to:
       •   Develop, correct and rehabilitate employees.
       •   Encourage employees to accept responsibility.
       •   Prevent situations where no alternative to taking discipline exists.

    7.3. Carrying Out Constructive Discipline. When considering and taking disciplinary action,
    supervisors:
       7.3.1. Investigate the alleged offense and consider all available relevant information.
       7.3.2. Ensure that any action taken is fair, timely, and for good cause and that it complies with
       applicable law, regulation and policy.
       7.3.3. Ensure that disciplinary action contributes to the objective of constructive discipline in
       paragraph 7.2.
       7.3.4. Conduct interviews and inquiries and discipline employees in private to minimize embar-
       rassment.
       7.3.5. Involve the minimum number of people necessary when gathering facts and coordinating
       actions.
       7.3.6. Don't make information about disciplinary and adverse actions available to those outside of
       management circles or those that aren't affected by the action without the employee's consent.
       7.3.7. Observe the employee's right to representation. See paragraph 27. for guidance concerning
       the employee's right to representation including, where applicable, the employee's right to union
       representation.
       7.3.8. May not ask the employee to resign or retire to avoid discipline (see paragraph 9.).
       7.3.9. (Added-SCOTT) Commanders must maintain a constructive, disciplined work environ-
       ment in which both management and employees recognize and carry out their responsibilities.
       7.3.10. (Added-SCOTT) Necessary disciplinary action or adverse action is taken without regard
       to marital status, political affiliation, except as required by law, race, color, religion, sex, national
       origin, or age. Adverse action based on an employee’s physical or mental handicap is not taken
       when the employee can effectively perform assigned duties.
       7.3.11. (Added-SCOTT) Disciplinary action or adverse action is taken only when necessary and
       then promptly and equitably. The purpose of disciplinary action is to correct and rehabilitate the
       offender, if possible. Penalties must not be disproportionate to offenses and are applied as consis-
       tently as possible considering the particular circumstances of the causes for disciplinary action.
       7.3.12. (Added-SCOTT) Disciplinary actions and adverse actions are personal matters and are
       carried out in private.

8. Distinguishing Disciplinary From Nondisciplinary Situations. Improper identification of whether
a cause of action is a disciplinary or nondisciplinary situation may lead to a failure to meet all require-
ments.
    8.1. A cause of action due to delinquency or misconduct personally attributable to the employee is a
    disciplinary situation. Examples include on or off-duty misconduct, absence without approved leave,
    violation of leave procedures, etc.
    8.2. A cause of action not due to an employee's delinquency or misconduct, but which is personal to
    the employee, is a nondisciplinary situation. Examples include inefficiency, physical or mental inabil-
    ity to perform the duties of the position, or lack of work or funds necessitating a furlough, etc.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                  9


9. Voluntary Separation and Reductions.
   9.1. Determine whether a separation or reduction in grade or pay is voluntary or involuntary based on
   each set of circumstances.
       9.1.1. Under most circumstances, voluntary actions include those that employees:
           •   Are free to choose.
           •   Clearly understand.
           •   Are permitted a reasonable time period in which to choose a course of action.
           •   Are permitted to set the effective date.
           9.1.1.1. Supervisors may suggest another effective date for a voluntary action, but may not
           arbitrarily set an earlier or later date.
       9.1.2. An employee confronted by supervisors with a potential disciplinary or adverse action may
       choose to voluntarily:
           •   Accept a reduction in grade or pay.
           •   Resign.
           •   Retire.
           9.1.2.1. Supervisors may discuss these alternatives with employees but may not advise or ask
           employees to resign or retire.
           9.1.2.2. (Added-SCOTT) Neither should resignation be encouraged when there is substantial
           medical and other evidence about an employee’s mental condition which casts doubts that the
           employee understands the voluntary alternatives involved. If management desires to separate
           the employee, it may initiate action to do so by disability retirement or by adverse action pro-
           cedures, as appropriate.

Section C—Disciplinary and Adverse Actions and Their Requirements

10. Governing Requirements. Supervisors and managers must respect employees' rights established by
law, regulation, policy, or collective bargaining agreements. Take disciplinary and adverse actions by:
   •   Notifying employees of the proposed action.
   •   Giving employees an opportunity to respond to proposed actions.
   •   Notifying employees of the final decision.
   •   Informing employees of their access to appellate or grievance procedures.
Supervisors must accomplish disciplinary and adverse actions through written documents that meet spec-
ified criteria. EXCEPTIONS: Supervisors need not document oral admonishments discussed in para-
graph 11. or, where applicable, oral notices of proposed reprimands discussed in paragraph 12.4.4.
   10.1. Standard for Taking Disciplinary and Adverse Actions: Managers and supervisors:
       10.1.1. May take a disciplinary or adverse action only for such cause as will promote the effi-
       ciency of the service.
10                                                 AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        10.1.2. May not take a disciplinary or adverse action against an employee on the basis of any of
        the reasons prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.
     10.2. Burden of Proof:
        10.2.1. In order to meet the standard for taking an action, managers and supervisors must:
            •   Clearly specify the charges or reasons upon which the action is based.
            •   Be able to prove the specific charges or reasons which form the basis for the action by a
                preponderance of the evidence.
            •   Be able to show the connection or “nexus” between the charges and the impact on the effi-
                ciency of the Air Force.
            •   Be able to show that the penalty imposed was appropriate under the circumstances (see
                paragraph 32.).
        10.2.2. Harmful Error. If harmful error is alleged in an appeal or grievance, the burden is upon
        the appellant or grievant to show that -- based upon the record as a whole -- the error was harmful
        (i.e., the outcome would probably have been different absent the error).
     10.3. Applying Requirements. Managers ensure that disciplinary and adverse actions comply with
     all legal and regulatory requirements.
        10.3.1. Third party review may find actions that don't comply with governing requirements defec-
        tive, either procedurally or on merit or both. The third party may reverse the action or reduce the
        severity of the action.
        10.3.2. An action that is not sustained by a third party because of a harmful error in procedures
        may be initiated again if the Air Force corrects the deficiency. An action may not be initiated
        again if the third party's modification or reversal is based on the merits of the case.

11. Oral Admonishment.
     11.1. Supervisors:
        11.1.1. Issue oral admonishments to correct minor misconduct or delinquency or to motivate
        employees to improve their work habits, work methods, or behavior.
        11.1.2. Note the date they issue an oral admonishment on the employee's AF Form 971, Supervi-
        sor's Employee Brief.
            11.1.2.1. Delete the reference to the admonishment 2 years after the effective date.
     11.2. The Relationship of Oral Admonishment to Other Disciplinary Actions. An oral admon-
     ishment is informal and the least severe penalty enforced in the Air Force discipline program. Oral
     admonishments are disciplinary actions but not adverse actions. See paragraph 37.3. for an explana-
     tion of the use of oral admonishments in relation to Attachment 3.
     11.3. Difference From Performance Discussions or Counseling Sessions. Performance discus-
     sions and counseling sessions are nondisciplinary. Use them to guide, encourage, or instruct employ-
     ees (see AFI 36-1001).
     11.4. Steps In Considering and Taking an Oral Admonishment. This paragraph sets out recom-
     mended steps for supervisors to follow when imposing an oral admonishment for an employee's mis-
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                11


   conduct or delinquency. These steps are not mandatory unless stated as such. EXCEPTION: Follow
   a collective bargaining agreement if it gives other instructions. Supervisors:
      11.4.1. Observe employee representation entitlements according to paragraph 27.
      11.4.2. Gather available facts.
      11.4.3. Interview employees privately. Tell them the purpose of the interview. State the problem
      and the facts so they can clearly understand.
      11.4.4. Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter. If
      employees request reasonable time for thought before responding, honor the request, if possible.
      11.4.5. Consider employees' answers and any explanations offered.
      11.4.6. Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees that you
      will issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.
      11.4.7. Determine appropriate action:
          11.4.7.1. If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees. Take no fur-
          ther action.
          11.4.7.2. If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide to issue an
          oral admonishment, tell the employees and explain why. Tell the employees that they are being
          disciplined by receipt of an oral admonishment. Identify areas where employees need
          improvement, suggest how they may do so, and offer to help.
      11.4.8. Document the admonishment on AF Form 971. Include:
          •   The words "oral admonishment" to distinguish the action from nondisciplinary counsel-
              ing.
          •   A brief description of the reason for the admonishment.
          •   The effective date.
          •   A note that you advised the employee of the admonishment.
      11.4.9. Ask the employee to initial AF Form 971. See the requirements for recording and deleting
      references to oral admonishments in paragraphs 11.1.2. and 11.1.3.
NOTE: Employees' initials on AF Form 971 show their awareness of the oral admonishment, not their
agreement.
      11.4.10. Follow up on oral admonishments by offering help, making suggestions, and encourag-
      ing the employee to improve. Note these follow-up actions and any improvement in employees'
      conduct on AF Form 971.

12. Reprimand.
   12.1. Purpose and Use. Supervisors and managers use reprimands to correct significant misconduct
   or delinquency and repeated lesser offenses. It is a severe disciplinary action that should be adequate
   for many disciplinary situations requiring an action more severe than an oral admonishment.
      12.1.1. Supervisors make sure written reprimands are clearly identified with the subject: "Notice
      of Reprimand."
12                                                  AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        12.1.2. Supervisors send a copy of the "Notice of Reprimand" to the CPF for temporary filing in
        the employee's Standard Form 66, Official Personnel Folder (OPF), for 2 years from the date of
        the reprimand. The CPF destroys it when the 2 years expire.
        12.1.3. Supervisors note the date they issue a reprimand on the employee's AF Form 971. Delete
        the note when the reprimand expires.
        12.1.4. In the establishment of a progression of penalties (see paragraph 34.), supervisors may
        make a reprimand more "severe" by:
            •   Referencing previous offenses;
            •   Indicating the seriousness of their concern with the continued misconduct or delinquency;
                or
            •   Warning that a further offense could result in a more severe penalty. Note: Be sure to use
                the phrase, "could result" rather than "will result. "
        12.1.5. Supervisors may issue a reprimand as the last step in a progression of penalties if the writ-
        ten notice clearly warns that a further offense could lead to removal.
     12.2. The Relationship of Reprimands To Other Disciplinary Actions:
        12.2.1. A reprimand is the least severe formal penalty. It is a disciplinary action but not an
        adverse action. It carries the same weight as a suspension when it is used as a prior offense pen-
        alty to support the penalty imposed for a later offense.
        12.2.2. Reprimands may constitute a more severe penalty when:
            •   Air Force policy precludes the use of suspension.
            •   A suspension might be managerially unsound even though the offense is serious enough to
                warrant suspension.
            •   The offense doesn't warrant suspension but meets the criteria in paragraph 12.1.4.
     12.3. Difference From Letters Stating Standards or Requirements.
        12.3.1. Don't use letters documenting standards of conduct as disciplinary actions or reprimands.
        12.3.2. Don't use letters that establish special requirements, such as letters outlining leave
        approval procedures or warning employees of the potential consequences of certain delinquencies,
        as reprimands.
        12.3.3. Use reprimands to discipline employees who have been advised of management's expec-
        tations but fail to meet them for reasons within their control. Supervisors may restate these
        requirements in letters of reprimand.
     12.4. Steps In Considering and Taking a Reprimand. This paragraph sets out recommended steps
     for supervisors to follow when imposing a reprimand for an employee's misconduct or delinquency.
     The steps are not mandatory unless stated as such. EXCEPTION: Follow a collective bargaining
     agreement if it gives other instructions. Supervisors:
        12.4.1. Complete the steps in this paragraph as soon and efficiently as possible but not necessarily
        during one session.
        12.4.2. Observe employees' right to representation according to paragraph 27.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                    13


       12.4.3. Gather available facts.
       12.4.4. Interview employees privately. Tell them the purpose of the interview. State the problem
       and the facts so they can clearly understand. If applicable, tell employees the interview serves as
       an oral notice of proposed reprimand.
NOTE: Unless a governing collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise, supervisors must give
employees a notice of proposed reprimand. The notice may be given orally or in writing.
       12.4.5. Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter. If
       employees request reasonable time for thought before answering, honor the request, if possible.
       Follow the guidelines in paragraph 28.
       12.4.6. Consider employees' answers and any explanations they offer according to paragraph 29.
       12.4.7. Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees that you
       will issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.
       12.4.8. Determine appropriate action:
          12.4.8.1. If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees. Take no fur-
          ther action.
          12.4.8.2. If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide an oral
          admonishment is adequate penalty under the circumstances, take the steps outlined in para-
          graphs 11.4.7. through 11.4.10.
          12.4.8.3. If the discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide a repri-
          mand might be warranted, tell employees that you have not made a decision but will tell them
          when you do so.
          12.4.8.4. If, after discussing the case with the CPF, you decide to reprimand the employee,
          prepare a "Notice of Reprimand" and coordinate it with the CPF before delivering it to the
          employee. Note: This notice is required. See paragraphs 17.5. and 17.6. concerning the
          notice contents.
          12.4.8.5. Send documentation of the action to the CPF according to paragraphs 12.1.2. and
          20.
          12.4.8.6. Note the reprimand on the AF Form 971 according to paragraph 12.1.3.

13. Suspensions:
   13.1. Purpose and Use:
       13.1.1. Consider a suspension, regardless of its duration, as an adverse action. Use it as a severe
       disciplinary action. Ordinarily, it is the final step in the disciplinary process before removal action
       and is accompanied by a warning to employees that a further violation of rules could result in
       removal. Note: Be sure to state the warning in terms of "could" rather than "will" result in
       removal.
       13.1.2. A suspension prevents an employee from performing work and denies salary for the sus-
       pension period. Therefore, supervisors may not impose a suspension for indebtedness or for per-
       formance-related factors in nondisciplinary situations.
14                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        13.1.3. Normally, you shouldn't suspend employees for more than 30 days.
     13.2. Suspensions for 14 Days or Less. When proposing a suspension for 14 days or less, supervi-
     sors must provide employees:
        •   Advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action (see paragraph
            16.).
        •   A reasonable time, but not less than 24 hours, to answer charges orally and in writing and to
            furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their answer.
        •   The right to representation by an attorney or other representative (see paragraph 27.).
        •   A written decision and the specific reasons for the decision at the earliest practicable date (see
            paragraph 17.).
        13.2.1. Normally, supervisors give employees 7 days to answer a proposed suspension for 14
        days or less.
     13.3. Suspensions for More Than 14 days. See paragraph 14.4. for requirements for suspensions
     for more than 14 days.

14. Removal, Suspension for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough for 30
Days or Less.
     14.1. These actions include:
        •   Actions based solely on factors unrelated to performance.
        •   Actions based on factors both related and unrelated to performance.
        •   Actions based solely on factors related to performance that aren't covered by AFI 36-1001.
NOTE: See paragraph 15. for special procedures when a reduction in grade is based on reclassification or
job-grading determinations.
     14.2. Removal. A disciplinary removal is the most severe disciplinary action. Consider it rehabilita-
     tive since it could help employees improve their performance in future positions.
        14.2.1. Before initiating a removal, carefully review the facts and circumstances in each case.
        Make sure they support the conclusion that the employee has demonstrated unwillingness or
        refusal to conform to the rules of conduct or has so breached the employee-employer relationship
        that other rehabilitation is not appropriate and removal is warranted for the offense.
        14.2.2. Supervisors and managers may remove an employee:
            •   For misconduct on or off the job. (See paragraph 10.2.1.).
            •   For actions before appointment which reflect upon the employee's suitability for federal
                employment.
        14.2.3. Normally, supervisors take a progression of disciplinary measures before deciding to
        remove employees. EXCEPTION: If employees commit egregious misconduct or flagrantly vio-
        late rules and regulations, supervisors may remove them for a first or second offense.
     14.3. Furlough for 30 Days or Less. For a furlough of any duration, managers must apply for prior
     approval from HQ USAF/DPC. Don't announce a proposed furlough before getting it approved.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                   15


       14.3.1. Submit requests through command channels and include:
           •   The reasons you consider a furlough necessary.
           •   The efforts you made to avoid the furlough.
           •   The number of employees involved, their skills, and the proposed length of the furlough.
   14.4. Action Requirements. Supervisors and managers give employees against whom they initiate
   an action under this paragraph or paragraph 15.:
       •   At least 30 days advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action.
           EXCEPTIONS: See paragraph 14.5.
       •   A reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer your charges orally and in writing and
           to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their answer.
       •   The right to representation by an attorney or other representative (see paragraph 27.).
       •   A reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support the proposed
           action, to prepare an answer, and to secure affidavits (see paragraph 28.1.). EXCEPTION: If
           the employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, follow the provisions of that
           agreement.
       •   A written decision and the specific reasons for the decision at the earliest practicable date (see
           paragraph 17.).
   14.5. Exceptions. (Additional information concerning use of the following exceptions is in 5 CFR
   752.404[d]).
       14.5.1. Crime Provision. Supervisors need not comply with the requirement for 30 days'
       advance written notice when proposing a removal or suspension (including indefinite suspension)
       if they have reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence
       of imprisonment may be imposed. Supervisors may require the employee to furnish an answer,
       including affidavits and other documentary evidence, within a reasonable time under the circum-
       stances, but not less than 7 days. When the circumstances require that the employee be kept away
       from the worksite, and no other alternatives are available, supervisors may place the employee in
       a nonduty status with pay for such time as is necessary to effect the action.
       14.5.2. Furlough Without Pay due To Unforeseeable Circumstances. Supervisors need not
       give employees the advance written notice and opportunity to answer for furloughs without pay
       due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or
       sudden emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities. Despite the waiver of the
       advance notice requirement and the right to answer, supervisors must give employees the other
       protections provided by law and regulation, including the right to appeal where appropriate, or
       grieve the action.

Section D—Change To Lower Grade Based on Reclassification or Job-Grading Determination.

15. Change to Lower Grade. This paragraph addresses reduction in grade (demotion) of an employee
whose position is downgraded because of a determination that the position warrants classification at a
lower grade due to a classification error or job grading standard change when the position has been clas-
16                                                 AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


sified at the higher grade for less than 1 year. Note: When demoting employees under the circumstances
of this paragraph, managers also apply the provisions of paragraphs 14.4. , 16., and 17.
     15.1. Contents of Notice of Proposed Adverse Action. In addition to the requirements of paragraph
     16., managers make sure the notice of proposed adverse action:
        •   Contains a statement why the position is being downgraded (for example, because of an erro-
            neous classification or because of the application of a new or revised standard).
        •   Encloses a copy of the official position description and either the OPM classification certifi-
            cate or the classification decision of the Air Force comparing the grade controlling duties and
            responsibilities of the position with the applicable published classification or job-grading
            standards. EXCEPTION: If the classification guides and standards are too long to copy,
            include a statement outlining the arrangements you made for the employee to review the
            items.
        15.1.1. Proposing officials must not suggest in the notice of proposed adverse action that the
        notice constitutes a final decision to demote the employee. The notice may state, however, that the
        Air Force or OPM has decided to downgrade the position.
     15.2. Consideration of Employee's Answer. The employee's answer is considered by an Air Force
     official according to paragraph 5.2.2.
        15.2.1. When the classification decision results from an OPM certificate, recommending or
        deciding officials need not consider or respond to employees' disagreement with that decision.
        EXCEPTION: If the Air Force classification decision was based on application of an OPM or Air
        Force precedent decision and employees' answers contest that decision, managers must consider
        and respond to employees' answers in notices of decision.
     15.3. Effective Date of Downgrading. The position may not be downgraded before the deciding
     official makes a final decision on the proposed demotion or the advance notice expires.

Section E—Notices of Proposed Adverse Action, Notices of Final Decision, and Related Requirements

16. Notice of Proposed Adverse Action. This notice gives the employees a fair opportunity to defend
themselves against the proposed action. Supervisors must make it clear in all notices that the proposed
action doesn't constitute a final decision. See paragraph 16.2.5. for a sample of how to word this state-
ment.
     16.1. In the notice of proposed action, supervisors must include:

       16.2.3. The amount of time allowed for the employee to answer and a statement that you will con-
       sider extending the time if the employee requests an extension and supports that request. (See

       answer).
       16.2.4. The person or office to receive any written answer and the person to whom the employee
       must reply orally. Designate an individual with authority either to make or recommend a final
       decision on the proposed adverse action (see paragraph 26.).
       16.2.5. Wording that states:
          •   That management has proposed the action but hasn't yet made its decision.
          •   That a designated official will consider employees' answers.
          •   That whether the employees' answer, management will issue a final written decision (see
              paragraph 17.).
       16.2.6. The amount of official time allowed for employees in an active duty status to:

       16.2.10. The employees' duty status during the notice period.

17. Notice of Decision. Supervisors must give employees a written notice of decision if they issued a
written notice of proposed action and they are still on the rolls. This applies regardless of whether
18                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


employees answer the notice of proposed action or supervisors decide to cancel the proposed action or to
take a lesser action. Note: Supervisors must give employees a written notice of decision on a proposed
reprimand regardless of whether the proposal was accomplished orally or in writing.
     17.1. The person designated to make the decision on a proposed action (deciding official) may lessen
     the proposed action. For example, the official may decide to change a proposed removal to a suspen-
     sion or demotion.
     17.2. If supervisors decide to propose a more severe action than originally proposed, they must cancel
     the original notice and give the employee a new proposal.
     17.3. Supervisors, or their designees, must deliver notices of decision for adverse actions to employ-
     ees at or before the time the actions goes into effect. If this isn't possible, make a diligent effort to
     deliver the notice and document this effort according to paragraph 19.
     17.4. When preparing a notice of reprimand, supervisors apply the requirements and recommenda-
     tions in paragraph 17.5. and paragraph 17.6.
     17.5. In notices of decision, supervisors must include:
        17.5.1. The decision in specific terms. For example, write: "It has been decided to (remove you),
        (suspend you for ____ calendar days, (reprimand you), (etc.)."
        17.5.2. The specific reasons for the decision. Include:
            •   Only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action.
            •   A reference to the proposed notice and which reasons you've sustained.
            •   If proposed orally, the reasons for a reprimand in enough detail to document the basis for
                the action.
            •   The employee's past disciplinary record but only if it was relied on in proposing the action
                and included in the notice.
        17.5.3. The effective date of an adverse action. For suspensions include the first and last day of
        the suspension and the date and time the employee is to return to duty.
        17.5.4. The expiration date for a reprimand. (For example, "This reprimand will be filed in your
        official personnel folder and noted on AF Form 971 for 2 years from the date of this decision.")
        Tell employees when the reprimand will be destroyed and the reference to it on AF Form 971
        deleted.
        17.5.5. Information about an employee's right to a grievance procedure, if applicable. (see para-

        17.5.7. A copy of Optional Form 283, U. S. Merit Systems Protection Board Appeal Form, if
        applicable, and a copy, or access to a copy of the MSPB regulations. (Obtain Optional Form 283
        through normal distribution channels. MSPB allows local reproduction of its regulations.)
        17.5.8. The signature of an official with the authority to decide the action (see paragraph 5.).
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                 19


       17.5.9. The decision date. Date the decision before delivering it to the employee.
   17.6. In the notice of decision, supervisors may include recommended, nonmandatory information
   such as:
       17.6.1. Whether the employee answered and whether you considered all of these answers (see
       paragraph 29.).
       17.6.2. The name, location, and phone number of the person in the CPF designated to help the
       employee.

18. Timeliness of Action. Supervisors initiate inquiries while information is fresh and readily available
and then normally initiate appropriate action as soon as they establish the facts.
   18.1. When Federal criminal charges have been or may be brought against employees, managers
   must consider any objection made by the United States Attorney to proceeding with an administrative
   action.
   18.2. If supervisors anticipate a substantial delay in effecting an action, they inform employees of the
   considered action and of their decision, whenever they make one.

19. Delivery of Notices. Supervisors make sure employees receive notices on a timely basis or that their
action to attempt delivery constitutes an intelligent and diligent effort under the circumstances. Supervi-
sors may deliver notices either personally or by mail.
   19.1. Normally, supervisors, or their designees, hand notices to employees and ask them to sign one
   copy, acknowledging receipt. Should an employee refuse to sign the acknowledgement copy, the per-
   son making the delivery can sign and date a statement of delivery to include the place, date, and time
   of delivery, and note the employee's refusal to sign. Note: The employee's written acknowledgement
   doesn't indicate agreement with the notice.
   19.2. If personal delivery is impossible for some reason, supervisors must chose a method of mail
   delivery. This delivery method is important; seek advice about preferable means from the CPF.
   19.3. Supervisors must maintain accurate records of every attempt at delivery as part of the file
   required by paragraph 20.
   Document evidence of an employee's effort to avoid delivery.

20. Recording Actions. Supervisors send a record of actions taken under this instruction to the CPF for

   •   The notice of decision including the specific reasons for it.
   •   Any order effecting the action.
   •   A statement of your reasoning as to the appropriateness of the penalty imposed in disciplinary
       actions (including reprimands).
   •   Any supporting material. (See paragraph 25. for more information on supporting material).
20                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


     20.1. Send a copy of the file to the MSPB or Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Office, Appellate
     Review Division (AFCARO/ARD) if either asks for it and to the affected employee if requested by
     the employee.
     20.2. Retain records of reprimands for 2 years from the date of the notice of decision to reprimand.
     Screen and destroy expired reprimands from the Official Personnel Folders. Delete references to
     expired reprimands from the AF Form 971 (see paragraph 12.1.3.).
     20.3. Delete references to oral admonishments from the AF Form 971 2 years from the date of the
     admonishments (see paragraph 11.1.2.1.).

21. Advance Notice Period:
     21.1. Oral admonishments and reprimands require no minimum advance notice period.
     21.2. For a suspension for 14 days or less, supervisors must give at least 24 hours advance notice.
     Normally, supervisors give employees 7 days' notice.
     21.3. The minimum notice period for adverse actions under paragraph 14. and paragraph 15. is 30
     days. EXCEPTION: See paragraph 14.5. for information on the use of a shortened notice period.
     21.4. Supervisors may take additional time if needed. You need not set a tentative date for action
     when issuing a notice of proposed action. In the notice of proposed action, state that any adverse
     action will go into effect "not earlier than ______ days (the number of days of advance notice) from
     the date you receive this notice."

22. Identification of the Proposed Action. In the notice of proposed action, supervisors state the most
severe action proposed. State the exact number of calendar days for proposed suspensions. EXCEP-
TION: Provide no end date for indefinite suspensions. (See Attachment 1 for definition of indefinite
suspension).
     22.1. Supervisors may later reduce a proposed action, but they can't make the proposed action more
     severe without canceling the original notice and giving the employee a new proposal. Don't propose
     the most severe action with the expectation that it may later be reduced.
     22.2. When an adverse action results in pay reduction, state the employee's new salary in the notice.
     For a change to a lower grade, state the employee's exact pay plan, series, position title, and grade. If
     an employee doesn't qualify for grade retention, state whether the employee is entitled to pay reten-
     tion.

23. Specific Reasons (Includes Causes of Action). In the notice of proposed action, state all the spe-
cific reasons relied on to support the proposed action. (For reprimands, include this information in the
notice of reprimand unless a written notice of proposed reprimand was issued.) Supervisors need not
include every reason that might have been used to support their proposed action.
     23.1. Normally, cover the current cause of action in the introductory paragraph of the notice of pro-
     posed action. Include supporting reasons (such as prior offenses) in separate paragraphs.
     23.2. The supervisor who initiates the action must identify and state the cause of action. Causes for
     adverse action may be reasons personal to the employee such as on or off-the-job misconduct, delin-
     quency, or physical or mental inability to perform the duties of the position. Causes also may be
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                21


   impersonal reasons such as the application of new or revised classification standards or the need to
   correct a merit promotion error.

24. Adding Reasons. If supervisors amend a notice to add further reasons for action, they must give
employees sufficient time to answer the added reasons and take no action until the required notice period
expires. Note: The advance notice period starts again from the date the added reasons are received by
the employee.

25. Material Relied on To Support the Action. Supervisors assemble the material they relied on to
support the reasons for the proposed action and make the file available to the employee. This material may
include:
   •   Statements of witnesses.
   •   Documents.
   •   Investigative reports or extracts from the reports.
   •   Relevant material concerning any previous record or action that serves as the basis for the current
       action.
   25.1. Supervisors may enclose a copy of the supporting material with the notice of proposed action,
   stating in the notice that they've done so.
   25.2. Supervisors must allow employees, the employee's representative, or the employee's designated
   physician under 5 CFR 297.205 to review all supporting material. Don't use material to support your
   reasons for the action that can't be shown to these individuals.

26. The Official to Whom Employees Answer. Normally, the person who signs the notice of final deci-
sion receives employees' oral or written answers. Managers may designate another person to receive the
answer as long as that person has the authority to recommend a final decision and serves in a position
superior to the employee (not necessarily in a supervisory position or in a higher grade), or a designated
CPF official (see paragraph 5.2.2.).

27. Employee Representation.
   27.1. Supervisors and managers must give a union representative of an appropriate bargaining unit
   the opportunity to be represented at any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of
   the agency in connection with an investigation if:
       •   The employee reasonably believes the examination may result in disciplinary action against
           the employee and;
       •   The employee requests representation.
   27.2. Employees who receive a notice of proposed disciplinary or adverse action may get help prepar-
   ing their answer. Employees may be represented by an attorney or other representative when making
   an oral answer to a proposed adverse action.
   27.3. Representatives may accompany employees answering charges orally or may answer for
   employees. Representatives' time qualifies as official duty time or as whatever the collective bargain-
   ing agreement states if representatives clear time in advance and serve in an active duty status.
22                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        27.3.1. Employees in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to representation according to
        the terms of any governing collective bargaining agreement.
        27.3.2. Employees who aren't in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to be represented by
        the person of their choice, subject to paragraph 27.4. and paragraph 27.6.
     27.4. Disallowing Representatives. Managers may disallow the employee's choice of representative
     if any of these criteria apply:
        •   Activities of the individual as a representative could cause a conflict of interest or position.
        •   Release of the individual from his or her duties could give rise to unreasonable costs to the
            Government.
        •   The individual's priority work assignments preclude his or her release to serve.
        27.4.1. Fully, clearly, and specifically state the basis for the disallowance in writing. Include cita-
        tions of regulatory provisions and other authorities.
        27.4.2. Deliver the disallowance to the employee within 5 workdays after receiving notification
        of a designated representative or as soon as possible thereafter if the employee is unavailable.
        27.4.3. In an adjudication, use this notice of disallowance as the basic explanation of your posi-
        tion (see paragraph 27.6.2.1.).
     27.5. Bargaining Unit Employees' Right To Challenge Disallowance of Representative.
     Employees in an exclusive bargaining unit may challenge the decision to disallow their choice of a
     representative through the collective bargaining agreement or 5 U.S.C. 7118, as appropriate.
     27.6. Nonbargaining Unit Employees' Right to Challenge Disallowance of a Representative.
        27.6.1. Employees who aren't in an exclusive bargaining unit have the right to challenge the deci-
        sion to disallow their choice of a representative by addressing the challenge, through the CPF, to
        AFCARO/ARD.
            27.6.1.1. In the challenge, employees must explain why the representative should serve and
            why the manager's reasoning for disallowance is wrong.
            27.6.1.2. Employees must make sure the challenge is received by the CPF within 5 days of the
            disallowance.
        27.6.2. Within 2 workdays after receipt of the employee's challenge, the CPF sends the file to
        AFCARO/ARD for decision.
            27.6.2.1. The CPF makes sure the file contains a clean, readable, and unmarked copy of the
            following documents, as applicable:
               •   The designation of representation, the disallowance, and the employee's challenge.
               •   The employee's and the designated representative's official position descriptions.
               •   Official organization charts showing the relationship among relevant positions.
               •   Relevant official functional statements.
               •   Relevant local and MAJCOM (or comparable organization) regulations.
               •   Cases, policy statements, and other materials cited as authorities.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                23


           27.6.2.2. When it is necessary to submit a marked copy, you must certify to the unavailability
           of an unmarked copy, and identify all extraneous markings.
       27.6.3. The CPF sends the employee an information copy of the transmittal letter to AFCARO/
       ARD.
       27.6.4. The Director of AFCARO, or designee, expedites a final decision based on the file
       received from the CPF.
       27.6.5. AFCARO/ARD sends the decision to the employee with an information copy to the CPF.
       These decisions aren't subject to further administrative review.
       27.6.6. Supervisors and managers wait for AFCARO's decision before taking any further action
       on the disciplinary or adverse action.

28. Employees' Answers. Employees who receive a written notice of proposed adverse action may
answer that notice to the designated official as many times as they wish. (See paragraph 30. for review of
answers as a result of premature appeals or grievances.)
   28.1. Time Allowed:
       28.1.1. Supervisors must give employees a reasonable response period for:
           •   Obtaining advice and assistance.

       employees).
       28.1.3. Within the response period, supervisors must allow employees who request it a reasonable
       amount of official time for the purposes specified in paragraph 28.1.1. EXCEPTION: Follow the
       applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement if the employee is covered by that
       agreement.
       28.1.4. Supervisors must determine reasonable total response time and reasonable official time
       for each action initiated. Base this determination on:
           •   The facts and circumstances of the individual case.
           •   The complexity of the issues involved the case.
           •   The amount and type of material in the file to be reviewed.
           •   The need for help and the employee's difficulty in getting it.
       28.1.5. Supervisors must honor reasonable requests from employees for additional time, if possi-
       ble. Note: The Air Force authorizes no standard, predetermined definition of "reasonable. "
24                                                  AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


     28.2. Character of Answer. Employees may answer the notice of proposed action orally and in writ-
     ing. When an employee answers the notice of proposed action orally, supervisors summarize the pri-
     mary points of the interview. If possible, obtain the signature of the employee to show agreement with
     the record.
     28.3. Content of Answer. Supervisors must give employees the opportunity to answer in whatever
     way they think may influence the final decision in their favor or reduce the penalty.
        28.3.1. In their answers, employees may:
            •   Deny or dispute the charges.
            •   Address matters that aren't related solely to the charges in the notice of proposed action.
            •   Plead extenuating circumstances.
            •   Submit affidavits and statements in support of their answers.

29. Consideration of Answer. Designated officials give thorough and objective consideration to
answers received before the notice of final decision is issued.
     29.1. Deciding officials may not issue the notice of final decision before time allowed for answers
     expires, including extensions.
        29.1.1. If an employee's answer in any way refutes the reasons contained in the advance notice,
        the deciding official must review the evidence objectively and determine whether a "preponder-
        ance of evidence" supports the proposed action. That official decides whether the action stands,
        needs modification, or may be withdrawn.
     29.2. The person designated to receive employees' answers writes a letter explaining any manage-
     ment delays in reaching a final decision caused by the need to collect additional evidence or other
     unusual circumstances. Include the approximate date the final decision will be made.
     29.3. Under no circumstances may the deciding official base the decision to take an action solely on
     the conclusion that the employee "failed to refute" the charges.

30. Premature Appeal or Grievance. Employees may not grieve or appeal a notice of proposed action
or a notification that initiation of action is being contemplated. Designated officials to receive employees'
answers to notices of proposed actions consider an employee's attempt to obtain appellate or grievance
reconsideration of a proposed action to be an answer to the notice of proposed action.
     30.1. Employees may contest final decisions that have gone into effect by filing a timely appeal or
     grievance.

31. Appeal and Grievance Rights. Disciplinary actions and adverse actions are subject to review under
the procedures of the MSPB, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Air Force, or negotiated grievance
procedures between the Air Force and exclusive collective bargaining units, as applicable. Written
notices of final decision contain specific information about those rights; and, if alternatives exist, the
employee is required to select the procedure to be used. Some general rules are included below; but
because not all employees have the same appellate or grievance rights, an employee who has received a
notice of final decision should carefully review the appellate or grievance information in it and may ask
CPF assistance on specific questions.

   31.1. Oral Admonishments, Reprimands, and Suspension for 14 Days or Less. Bargaining unit
   employees with access to a negotiated grievance procedure may grieve those actions through that pro-
   cedure only.
       31.1.1. Bargaining unit employees without access to a negotiated grievance procedure and non-
       bargaining unit employees may grieve such actions through the DoD grievance procedure in DoD-
       CPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance System.
   31.2. Removals, Suspensions for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough
   for 30 Days or Less.
       31.2.1. Employees who may appeal an action covered by paragraph 31.2. to the MSPB or grieve
       the action through the negotiated grievance procedure of a collective bargaining agreement, where
       applicable, but not both, include:
           31.2.1.1. An employee in the competitive service who has completed a probationary or trial
           period.
           31.2.1.2. An employee in the competitive service serving in an appointment that requires no
           probationary or trial period, and who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the
           same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less.
           31.2.1.3. An employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible and who has com-
           pleted 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position.
           31.2.1.4. Unless excluded by 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(8), an employee in the excepted service who is
           a nonpreference eligible and who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the
           same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.
           31.2.1.5. An employee with competitive status who occupies a position in Schedule B of 5
           CFR, Part 213.
           31.2.1.6. An employee who was in the competitive service at the time his or her position was
           listed under Schedule A, B, or C of the excepted service and still occupies that position.
           EXCEPTION: See paragraph 2.1. for the employees excluded from this instruction.
       31.2.2. An employee not included in paragraphs 31.2.1.1. through 31.2.1.6., but who has received
       an action covered by 31.2., may grieve such action through the DoD grievance procedure in DoD-
       CPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance System, unless that proce-
       dure excludes either the employee or the action being grieved from its coverage.

Section F—Selection of Appropriate Disciplinary Actions.

32. Penalty Selection. Supervisors determine which penalty to impose in a particular situation by apply-
ing responsible judgement to Air Force disciplinary policy. Take the disciplinary action on the basis of
conclusions that sufficient evidence is available to support the reasons for action and that the action is
warranted and reasonable in terms of the circumstances which prompted it.
   32.1. Governing Criteria. Supervisors observe the principle of "like penalties for like offenses in
   like circumstances." Apply penalties as consistently as possible considering the particular circum-
   stances of the cause for disciplinary action.
26                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        32.1.1. Don't apply penalties with "...mathematical rigidity or perfect consistency regardless of
        variations in circumstances or changes in prevailing regulations, standards, or mores," (Douglas v.
        Veterans Administration, et al., MSPB Decision No. AT075299006, 10 April 1981).
        32.1.2. Supervisors consider all relevant penalty selection factors. Select penalties that aren't dis-
        proportionate to the offense and contribute to the solution of the problem and to the attainment of
        an effective management environment.
     32.2. Factors in Penalty Selection. Some of the factors that may be relevant in selecting the appro-
     priate penalty are listed at paragraphs 32.2.1. through 32.2.12. Not all of the factors will be relevant
     in every case and others may be relevant in particular cases. Selection of an appropriate penalty
     (including a reprimand) involves a responsible balancing of the relevant factors based on the individ-
     ual case. Some of the relevant factors may weigh in the employee's favor while others may not or may
     even cause management to view the situation as more serious and deserving of a more severe penalty
     than originally thought. When selecting a penalty, supervisors and managers consider the following
     factors:
        32.2.1. The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, posi-
        tion, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvert-
        ent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated.
        32.2.2. The employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role,
        contacts with the public, and prominence of the position.
        32.2.3. The employee's past disciplinary record.
        32.2.4. The employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job,
        ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability.
        32.2.5. The effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and
        its effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties.
        32.2.6. The consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or
        similar offenses in like or similar circumstances.
        32.2.7. The consistency of the penalty with the Guide to Disciplinary Actions (Attachment 3).
        32.2.8. The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the Air Force.
        32.2.9. The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in com-
        mitting the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question.
        32.2.10. The potential for the employee's rehabilitation.
        32.2.11. The mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, per-
        sonality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part
        of others involved in the matter.
        32.2.12. The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the
        future by the employee or others.
     32.3. Penalty Support. If an employee grieves or appeals an action, supervisors and managers must
     prepare to support the appropriateness of the penalty (see paragraph 10.2.1.).
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                   27


       32.3.1. Supervisors and managers must include a statement of their reasoning as to the appropri-
       ateness of the penalty imposed in the record described in paragraph 20.

33. The Guide To Disciplinary Actions (Attachment 3). The guide helps supervisors and managers
select appropriate penalties by providing a framework for interrelating all the relevant facts to possible
courses of action and to available penalties. Use it to evaluate causes of action (offenses), whether or not
specifically described, so that a sound, supportable penalty may be selected. Avoid mechanical use of the
guide. The guide is an expression of typical causes and typical penalties only; therefore, causes of action
and penalties in the guide may not meet the demands of all situations. Use it as guidance along with
supervisory judgment in considering the particular circumstances of the matter and the appropriateness of
the particular action contemplated.
   33.1. Cause of Action. The "Cause of Action" column in the guide explains many of the common
   offenses, but it does not include every possible one. In using that column to apply general Air Force
   policy, supervisors compare each cause of action in the particular case at hand to all of those described
   and use those that relate to the situation. If there is a corresponding cause of action shown in the
   guide, use it to guide further consideration. If the cause of action in the particular case at hand is not
   shown, supervisors fit that offense into the general framework by relating its nature and seriousness to
   the fundamental characters of those listed. Supervisors need not use the precise language in the guide
   to describe an offense.
   33.1. (SCOTT) A cause of action cannot support a disciplinary or adverse action, unless it is included
   in the appropriate notice.
   33.2. Typical Penalty.
       33.2.1. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the "Typical Penalty" column in the guide establishes
       a range of penalties for a particular or comparable offense, not a required one. The guide pre-
       scribes no minimum penalty for any cause of action, except where required by law or executive
       order. Supervisors may not establish a minimum penalty by policy statement or by implementing
       instruction. Unless restricted by law or executive order, supervisors and managers may impose no
       penalty at all or may choose from penalties ranging from oral admonishment to removal.
       33.2.2. When considering which offense column of the guide to use, supervisors and managers
       need not establish that an employee's prior offenses were of the same character as the current
       offense. The severity of the penalty depends on the relationship of the current offense to relevant
       factors including those discussed in paragraph 32.2. See Attachment 3 for further guidance on
       how to determine the penalty.

34. Progression of Penalties. Supervisors and managers apply increasingly more severe penalties as the
employee continues to breach the employee-employer relationship. Such a progression establishes a con-
structive disciplinary process (see paragraph 7.).
   34.1. Supervisors usually begin a progression of penalties with oral admonishments and proceed
   through reprimand to suspension. If employees continue not to meet their responsibilities, the super-
   visor may end the progression of penalties in removal.
   34.2. For example: if the supervisor imposed a 3-day suspension for a first offense, a second offense
   would call for at least a 3-day suspension, even though the applicable items in the guide might show a
   range of reprimand to removal. Similarly, if a supervisor imposed a 5-day suspension for a second
28                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


     offense, consideration of the penalty to be imposed for a third offense would begin with a 5-day sus-
     pension.
     34.3. Supervisors impose a removal for misconduct or delinquency only after a progression of penal-
     ties unless discharge for a first or second offense is clearly warranted.
     34.4. Supervisors need not include suspensions in a progression if the preceding reprimands clearly
     show that removal could result from repetitive improper behavior (see paragraph 12.1.4. and para-
     graph 12.1.5.).

35. Combination of Offenses. A particular situation may involve only one offense, may appear to
involve more than one offense when there is actually only one, may involve more than one significant
offense, or may involve more than one offense only one of which is significant. Avoid multiplying a sin-
gle offense into several by including petty instances in your notice of proposed action when the significant
offense provides ample basis for taking necessary action.
     35.1. When different, significant offenses occur in combination, supervisors may include each
     offense as a cause of action. In this case, supervisors may impose a more severe penalty than would
     be appropriate for a single offense; but the penalty normally will not exceed that typically imposed for
     the most serious offense as determined by applying the appropriate offense column of the guide for
     the number of offenses in combination, including any prior offenses.

36. Series of Offenses. A series of offenses occurs when more than one offense is committed by an
employee at different times and appropriate action could not be completed on each of these offenses indi-
vidually before another was committed, even though management has proceeded at a reasonable pace.
Supervisors may assess a more serious penalty for a series of offenses than would be appropriate for a sin-
gle offense. However, the penalty imposed normally will not exceed the most severe shown in the appro-
priate offense column of the guide (considering the number of offenses in the series and any prior
offenses) for the most serious cause of action in the series.

37. Prior Offenses. See Attachment 1. Supervisors may use an employee's prior offenses in determin-
ing the severity of the penalty for a current offense even though the prior offenses may have involved dif-
ferent infractions. When used in this manner, supervisors show the prior offenses and the resulting
penalties imposed in the notice of proposed action (if any) and in the notice of final decision.
     37.1. Supervisors may consider a suspension as a prior offense only if its effective date fell within the
     3 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed action.
     37.2. Supervisors may consider an oral admonishment or a reprimand as a prior offense only if its
     effective date fell within the 2 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed action.
     37.3. Supervisors may not consider a breach of the employee-employer relationship for which an oral
     admonishment was imposed as an "offense" for the purpose of applying Attachment 3.
        37.3.1. Supervisors may use an oral admonishment to support their decision that a reprimand
        would be an appropriate penalty. Don't use an oral admonishment to support selection of an
        adverse action penalty.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                              29


     37.3.2. Supervisors may use an oral admonishment in any disciplinary action to document that an
     employee has been apprised of a rule, regulation, other directive, or of his or her past misconduct
     or delinquency.

                                       GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Adverse Action—A removal, suspension, furlough for 30 days or less, or reduction in grade or pay.
These actions don't include those resulting from reduction in force. Adverse actions may or may not be
for disciplinary reasons.
Bargaining Unit Employee—An employee included in an appropriate bargaining unit for which a labor
organization has been granted exclusive recognition.
Cause of Action—A recognizable offense against the employee-employer relationship such as a
violation of rule, regulation or procedure; employment-related off-duty misconduct; failure to fulfill an
employment-related agreement; or a mandatory requirement to take an action personal to an employee. It
is disciplinary if it results from delinquency or misconduct by the employee. (A disciplinary cause of
action is also called an offense.) It is nondisciplinary, for example, if it results from the employee's
disability, the employee's declination of functional transfer, or a management determination such as
reclassification of the employee's position or termination of an extended temporary promotion.
Charge—Sometimes used to refer to the reason stated in notices of proposed action and of final decision
when the reason is disciplinary.
Counseling—A nondisciplinary method of providing information, instruction, guidance, advice,
assistance, or encouragement. Don't confuse counseling with oral admonishment, which is disciplinary.
Current Continuous Employment—A period of employment or service immediately preceding an
adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a
workday.
Days—Days refers to consecutive calendar days, including holidays, weekends, and other nonduty days.
Disciplinary Action—An action management takes to correct an employee's delinquency or misconduct.
Included are oral admonishments, reprimands, suspensions, removals and, in some cases, reductions in
grade or pay. Except for oral admonishments and reprimands, these disciplinary actions are also adverse
actions.
Furlough—A nondisciplinary action placing an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status
because of lack of work or funds or for other nondisciplinary reasons. A furlough is an adverse action if
it is for a period of 30 calendar days or less. A furlough for more than 30 calendar days is a
reduction-in-force action covered by 5 CFR Part 351.
Grade—A level of classification under a position classification system.
Harmful Error—An error by management in the application of its procedures that is likely to have
caused management to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or
cure of the error.
Indefinite Suspension—The placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay
pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action. The indefinite suspension continues for an
indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice
of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative action.
Nexus—A reasonable connection or factual relationship between the reasons for the action taken and the
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                    31


efficiency of the service.
Nondisciplinary Adverse Action—An adverse action that is taken for reasons other than to correct an
employee's delinquency or misconduct.
Offense—A cause of action due to an employee's delinquency or misconduct.
Oral Admonishment—A disciplinary discussion between a management official who has authority to
take disciplinary action and an employee subject to that authority in which the employee is informed that
he or she has been disciplined by receipt of an oral admonishment. It is a disciplinary action which is not
an adverse action.
Pay—The rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee.
Preponderance of the Evidence—The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering
the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than
untrue.
Prior Offense—A prior cause of action for which a disciplinary penalty has been imposed.
Reason—Includes the current cause of action and facts, circumstances, and considerations relied on to
support the action (for example, prior offenses).
Reprimand—A formal disciplinary letter issued to an employee by a management official who has
authority to discipline the employee. It is a disciplinary action which is not an adverse action.
Similar Positions—Positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and
require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged
between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work.
Suspension—An action placing an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without
duties and pay. A suspension is a disciplinary action and an adverse action.

                               GUIDE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
NOTE: See Section F of this regulation for information concerning use of this guide and selection of
appropriate penalties in disciplinary actions:

A3.1. Cause of Action Column:
   A3.1.1. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION EXACTLY AS SHOWN
   IN THIS COLUMN. What is important is to state exactly what the employee did wrong, preferably
   without using legal terms suggesting crime. If such legal terms were used, it might be necessary to
   prove all the elements necessary to establish that the crime has been committed, including felonious
   intent.
   A3.1.2. Cause is best identified by a specific charge or label for the offense IF that charge or label is
   relevant. BE CAREFUL TO SELECT A LABEL WHICH FITS THE FACTS AND NOT TO
   DISTORT THE FACTS TO FIT A SPECIFIED OFFENSE IN THE GUIDE.

A3.2. Typical Penalty Column. This column does not dictate the penalty to be imposed for a particular
(or comparable) offense; rather, it establishes the range of penalties within which the penalty imposed
usually falls. Unless otherwise restricted, management may impose no penalty at all or has available a
choice of severity of action ranging from oral admonishment to removal.
NOTE: See paragraph 3. of this instruction for information concerning employees in probationary or
trial period, or in first year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions.
   A3.2.1. Oral Admonishment. An oral admonishment is a disciplinary action that is often adequate
   to effect the required correction or improvement, particularly when the employee has no previous his-
   tory of violations. See paragraph 37.3. for the use of the oral admonishment in relation to this attach-
   ment.
   A3.2.2. Reprimand. A reprimand is a severe disciplinary action that should be adequate for many
   disciplinary situations which require an action more severe than an oral admonishment. It may be
   made more "severe" according to paragraph 12.1.4.
   A3.2.3. Suspension. A suspension is a severe disciplinary action. Ordinarily, it is the final step in the
   disciplinary process before removal and is accompanied by a warning to the employee that a further
   violation of rules COULD result in removal (see paragraph 13.1.1.)
       A3.2.3.1. A suspension may NOT be imposed for indebtedness nor performance-related factors
       when the situation is nondisciplinary.
       A3.2.3.2. Suspensions seldom should exceed 30 days unless an indefinite suspension is used.
   A3.2.4. Removal. Removal is the most severe disciplinary action. Before it is initiated, the facts and
   circumstances in the case must be carefully reviewed to ensure they support the conclusion that the
   employee has demonstrated unwillingness or refusal to conform to the rules of conduct or has so
   breached the employee-employer relationship that other rehabilitation is not appropriate and removal
   is warranted for the offense.

lished; (b) there has been a failure

added warning that a "continuation
of offenses could result in removal."
2. Tardiness of less than one-half Reprimand               Reprimand               1-day suspension

NOTE: Counseling or an oral

fourth offense would typically result
in a suspension of 5 days or less with
the added warning that a "continua-
tion of offenses could result in
removal."

                                ATTACHMENT 5 (ADDED-SCOTT)

              SPECIFIC DISCIPLINARY AND NONDISCIPLINARY SITUATIONS

A5.1. (SCOTT) Substandard Performance of Duties. It is important to recognize the true character of
a substandard performance problem. That requires a careful evaluation of the total circumstances sur-
rounding the substandard work to determine whether the employee is responsible for the condition and
can control the essentials of the problem. Appropriate corrective action is not necessarily disciplinary. A
disciplinary action is appropriate when the causes of the substandard performance are within the
employee’s control and when it is expected that the disciplinary action can motivate a change in behavior
or correct the substandard performance. Other situations may result in personnel actions, including
adverse actions, but such actions should be identifiable as nondisciplinary.
   A5.1.1. (SCOTT) If the cause of the unacceptable work is personal to the employee, but is not in the
   employee’s control, the situation is not disciplinary. For example, unacceptable performance caused
   by the employee’s inability to perform no matter how hard the employee tries requires nondisciplinary
   treatment. An action based solely on unacceptable performance is processed under AFI 36-1001, if
   applicable.
   A5.1.2. (SCOTT) If the employee has the skills, knowledge, and capacity to perform well, and fails
   to do so, the situation is probably one which calls for disciplinary action to clearly inform the
   employee of management’s concern and to motivate improvement through elimination of the causes
   of the substandard performance. Characteristic of these disciplinary situations are carelessness, negli-
   gence, refusal to perform, performance in a dilatory manner, loafing, or disregard for policy or proce-
   dure. An action which has a disciplinary component is processed under this document, as applicable.

A5.2. (SCOTT) Medical Incapacity. An adverse action taken because an employee fails to meet medi-
cal standards for retention in the employee’s position is nondisciplinary. Management has the authority
and responsibility to make sure that employees meet medical standards, and employees are obligated to
cooperate. Therefore, an employee can be disciplined (including removal) for refusal to take a mandatory
medical examination.

A5.3. (SCOTT) Functional Transfer. While failure to accompany a position in a functional transfer is
both personal to the employee and within the employee’s control, adverse actions in such cases are non-
disciplinary.

A5.4. (SCOTT) Failure To Apply For and Accept Return Assignment According To Overseas
Employment Agreement. Failure to honor an overseas employment agreement by not applying for and
accepting return assignment according to the terms of the agreement is a nondisciplinary basis for separa-
tion.

A5.5. (SCOTT) Preappointment Considerations. Sometimes, after an employee is appointed, infor-
mation is developed about the employee’s conduct or health which raises a question as to the desirability
of the employee’s retention.
   A5.5.1. (SCOTT) When such information was fully disclosed and reviewed by the Air Force
   appointing officer or by the OPM before the employee’s appointment, disciplinary action is not appro-
   priate solely on the basis of such previously disclosed preappointment information.
50                                                     AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


     A5.5.2. (SCOTT) If the information was not known or disclosed before appointment, disciplinary
     action may be taken for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. Generally, an
     employee who is serving under other than a temporary appointment may not be removed, unless the
     preappointment consideration would have been material in preventing the employee’s appointment.
     However, falsification of an employment application or preappointment information may be grounds
     for removal.

A5.6. (SCOTT) Substance (Drug and Alcohol) Abuse. AFI 36-810, Substance Abuse Prevention andControl,
and AFI 44-107, $LU)RUFH&LYLOLDQ'UXJ'HPDQG5HGXFWLRQ3URJUDP, provides the procedures for offering
rehabilitative assistance for substance abuse for self and supervisory referral in addition to establishing policy and
procedures for the Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Program. Disciplinary and adverse actions related to Civilian Drug
Testing are governed by the provisions of AFI 36-810, and AFI 44-107, as well as this publication.

        A5.6.1. (SCOTT) The various rehabilitation and alcohol and drug abuse acts (29 USC 791 et seq., 42
        USC 290dd-1, and 42 USC 290ee-1) were intended to provide assistance to individuals who, because
        of the long-term effects of their substance abuse addiction, have lost the ability to control their behav-
        ior. The acts were not intended to protect those who misuse alcohol or drugs occasionally.
        A5.6.2. (SCOTT) Circumstances where the employee claims addiction to alcohol or drugs; the
        employee must show a direct causal connection between the substance abuse addictive condition and
        the misconduct or poor performance on which a disciplinary or adverse action is based in order to be
        entitled to consideration for rehabilitative assistance as accommodation. To provide such rehabilita-
        tive assistance, the supervisor refers the employee for interview according to AFI 36-810 and AFI 44-107.
            A5.6.2.1. (SCOTT) One referral of the employee for interview meets the Air Force obligation to
            provide reasonable accommodation. Therefore, disciplinary or adverse action is not contingent
            upon another referral for interview for misconduct or poor performance that occurs or is brought
            to the employee’s attention after the date established for the initial interview.
            A5.6.2.2. (SCOTT) Demotion to a position for which the employee is qualified may constitute
            reasonable accommodation in cases when keeping an alcohol or drug addict in his or her position
            during rehabilitation might not be reasonable or might impose an undue hardship on management.
            A5.6.2.3. (SCOTT) Management may impose disciplinary or adverse action short of removal for
            any act of misconduct or poor performance while giving an employee the opportunity to rehabili-
            tate.
            A5.6.2.4. (SCOTT) Certain acts of misconduct or poor performance attributed to an employee
            who is an alcohol or drug addict disqualify the handicapped employee from being able to perform
            the essential functions of his or her position. Employees whose acts of serious misconduct pose a
            risk to themselves or others may be subject to adverse action including removal even in the
            absence of an opportunity to rehabilitate.
        A5.6.3. (SCOTT) Circumstances regarding the use of illegal drugs: The supervisor is required to ini-
        tiate disciplinary or adverse action, ranging from reprimand to removal, against an employee who is
        found to use illegal drugs unless the employee voluntarily identifies himself or herself during an
        appropriate notice period, obtains counseling or rehabilitation and thereafter refrains from using ille-
        gal drugs.
AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994                                                                    51


A5.7. (SCOTT) Motor Vehicle Operator. Disciplinary and adverse actions against individuals assigned
to operator and incidental operator positions must be applied according to applicable laws and regula-
tions. The following grounds are among those constituting sufficient cause of action against operators and
incidental operators:
   A5.7.1. (SCOTT) The employee is convicted of operating under the influence of narcotics.
   A5.7.2. (SCOTT) The employee is convicted of leaving the scene of an accident without making
   himself or herself known.
   A5.7.3. (SCOTT) A federal medical officer finds the employees fails to meet the required physical
   standards.
   A5.7.4. (SCOTT) The employee’s state license is revoked.
   A5.7.5. (SCOTT) The employee’s state license is suspended. The employee may be continued in his
   or her position not to exceed 45 days from the date of suspension of the state license, for operation on
   other than public highways. This is to permit continuance of an employee in a position for which a
   currently valid state license is required where it is probable that the employee will have his or her state
   license restored within the 45-day period. If it is apparent from the nature of the suspension that the
   state license is not likely to be restored within the 45 days, the employee should be immediately
   barred from the operation of a motor vehicle. Additional guidance is in 5 CFR 930, Subpart A.

A5.8. (SCOTT) Misuse of Leave. Since management has the discretion to approve or deny most
requests for leave, the general rule is that management may not take action based on an employee’s use of
approved leave, whether it be sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay. Use of accrued sick leave in
the absence of fraud or subterfuge, is an entitlement of every employee who is ill or incapacitated by
injury, and an approval is contingent on submission of supporting evidence acceptable to management.
The right of the employee to take sick leave for nonemergency examination is subject to requesting this
leave in advance, with the approval of the proposed time subject to the need for the employee’s services.
When management approves an employee’s request for leave, the approving official presumably makes a
determination that the employee’s presence on the job is not required. If management needs the
employee’s services, it may deny leave and if the employee does not report for duty, show the absence in
the time and attendance reports as absence without leave (AWOL). Neither the denial of leave nor the
time and attendance reporting entry of AWOL is punitive, and neither means that the employee has insuf-
ficient reason for requesting leave. Rather, they mean that the employee’s presence is required and that the
reason for requesting leave is not one for which leave must be approved. The employee’s failure to honor
the leave denial and the unauthorized absence may form the basis for disciplinary or adverse action.
   A5.8.1. (SCOTT) If management has in the past approved an employee’s leave, but believes that the
   extent of the leave used is such that the employee is not on duty on a regular, full-time or part-time
   basis in a position which requires a regular, full-time or part-time employee, or if the employee has
   consistently failed to obtain advanced approval for leave, management has the opportunity to establish
   an appropriate record as part of a basis for further action by:
       A5.8.1.1. (SCOTT) Informing the employee that his or her attendance record is unsatisfactory
       and needs to be improved.
       A5.8.1.2. (SCOTT) Warning the employee that further sick leave will not be approved without
       sufficient medical documentation and that annual leave and leave without pay (LWOP) will be
       approved only if requested in advance and the employee’s services are not essential during the
52                                                   AFI36-704_SCOTTAFBSUP1_INT 22 JULY 1994


        period for which the leave is requested. NOTE: If the employee is then absent without prior
        approval or proper medical documentation, management may record the employee’s absence as
        AWOL. Such unauthorized absence may serve as a basis for disciplinary or adverse action.
     A5.8.2. (SCOTT) Exception to the General Rule. Adverse action may be taken based on a record of
     excessive unscheduled LWOP when three criteria are met:
        A5.8.2.1. (SCOTT) The records shows that the employee was absent for compelling reasons
        beyond the employee’s control so that management approval or disapproval was immaterial
        because the employee could not be on the job.
        A5.8.2.2. (SCOTT) The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the
        employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available
        for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.
        A5.8.2.3. (SCOTT) Management showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee
        available for duty on a regular, full-time, or part-time basis. NOTE: This exception would be
        applicable only under certain unusual circumstances such as the inability of an employee to return
        to duty or to work on a regular basis because of the continued effects of illness or injury (on- or
        off-the-job). Other circumstances may, in rare cases, meet these criteria. This exception would
        probably not apply, for example, to situations of repeated absences to attend to personal affairs or
        because of failure to obtain adequate transportation to work. These situations presumably are
        under the control of the employee and, therefore, are reasons to deny leave and record the absence
        as AWOL. Separation of an employee who is receiving employee’s compensation after on-the-job
        injury would be handled as explained in 5 CFR 353.

A5.9. (SCOTT) Off-Duty Misconduct. Because the Air Force does not interfere unnecessarily in the
private affairs of its employees, care must be taken in citing an employee’s off-duty misconduct as a cause
of action. As in any other disciplinary or adverse action, there must be a nexus between the cause of action
and the efficiency of the service.

A5.10. (SCOTT) Arrest, Indictment, or Conviction for Criminal Offenses:
     A5.10.1. (SCOTT) Arrest. The fact that an employee was arrested for a crime is not by itself suffi-
     cient as a cause of action since the employee, in fact, may be innocent of the crime. However, the
     underlying misconduct which led to the arrest may be the basis for disciplinary action even though no
     later trial is held or the employee is acquitted.
     A5.10.2. (SCOTT) Criminal Indictment. Criminal indictment by itself is not sufficient as a cause of
     action, except for an indefinite suspension pending disposition of criminal action.
     A5.10.3. (SCOTT) Criminal Conviction. If the cause of action relied on for disciplinary action is
     criminal conviction, later acquittal of the employee or dismissal of the criminal charge could vacate
     the cause of the criminal charge could vacate the cause for management’s administrative action. If the
     cause of action relied on is the employee’s underlying the act of wrongdoing rather than the convic-
     tion, the administrative action generally will not be affected by the later court action on the criminal
     case.
