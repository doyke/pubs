   (MMOC) and Transportation Control Center (TCC)) will be notified of the evacuation and
   subsequent return to the primary work center.
   1.7.3. Wind and pressure values from any form of back up equipment will be estimated
   while at the AOL.
   1.7.4. The AOL has the following limitations:
       1.7.4.1. Building 349 blocks the view to the northwest.
       1.7.4.2. There is no real-time display of the ASOS. However, the ASOS can be called at
       DSN: 632-2493 to hear the most current conditions.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies and
Individuals. Weather information will not be released to non-government agencies or the
general public without approval from Public Affairs Office (341 MW/PA) and Staff Judge
Advocate (341 MW/JA). Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the WF
CC/NCOIC.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback.
   1.9.1. Per AFMAN 15-129, units that regularly utilize weather support from Malmstrom’s
   WF will provide post-mission/utilization feedback, when possible. Customers have
   opportunity to provide feedback via reverse side of the daily flimsy and communications
   listed below. This information will be used to ensure proper quality assurance (QA) and to
   provide a metrics database. Informal feedback methods include:
       1.9.1.1. Email the flight     commander,      NCOIC,      or     WF   organizational   email
       (341oss.osw2@us.af.mil).
341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    11


       1.9.1.2. Phone calls to the flight commander (x3268) or NCOIC (x3267).
       1.9.1.3. Face to face feedback after any briefing.
   1.9.2. The WF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and gauge
   unit strengths and weaknesses. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately
   reflect the satisfaction and accuracy of the weather support being provided to Malmstrom’s
   flying units and ground units by the WF.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. WF members have a role when the airfield is advised of an
emergency or mishap. The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and the OWS are also involved.
In general, the WF will ensure applicable data used in the development of any weather product,
and/or service provided/saved for an investigation (to include MEFs, model output, space
weather products, mission impact slides, etc.) is saved.
1.11. Weather Flight Product            Access. The     WF     products   can    be   located    at
S:\Weather\Web\Weather.html.

                                            Chapter 3

                          AIRFIELD OBSERVATION SERVICES

3.1. General. Airfield observation services include those weather related actions that affect the
Malmstrom aerodrome (defined within 5SM of the main helipad) or the base as a whole.
3.2. Observations. Malmstrom uses the ASOS running in full automatic mode as its primary
source for observations. When augmentation or back-up is needed, it is done in accordance with
AFMAN 15-111. Attachment 3 contains examples of the different types of observations.
   3.2.1. Official Manual Observing Site. Malmstrom’s official observation site is located at the
   northeast corner of bldg 1441. The view to the southwest is blocked by 3-Bay hangar (bldg
   1440).
   3.2.2. METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report). Routine METAR observations are
   disseminated every hour 56 minutes after the hour. The observation is automatically
   generated by the ASOS and is disseminated longline and displayed locally.
   3.2.3. SPECI (Special Observation). SPECI observations are taken whenever certain weather
   events, defined in AFMAN 15-111 and listed in Attachment 4, occur at Malmstrom AFB.
   This type of observation is also automatically generated by the ASOS and is disseminated
   longline and displayed locally.
   3.2.4. LOCAL (Locally Generated Observation). A LOCAL observation will consist of
   Altimeter only and be passed verbally to the SOF which is collocated with the observer.
3.3. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). Besides monitoring the ASOS’s scheduled hourly
METAR observations, weather personnel recheck weather conditions at least every 20 minutes
when any of the following are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within one hour.
NOTE: In addition to the below minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert for
any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation. Weather
personnel will also monitor area observation and forecast products as often as necessary to keep
abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
   3.3.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   3.3.2. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,000 feet.
   3.3.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
   3.3.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
   3.3.5. Visibility is 1 mile (1600 meters) or less.
   3.3.6. Precipitation (any form) is observed.
   3.3.7. Thunderstorms are observed.
   3.3.8. Fog or mist is present.
3.4. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The CWW is a process for Facility Managers
(FMs), ground crews, security forces, maintenance crews, flying unit personnel, and/or anyone
else out in the complex or on base to report changes in weather conditions to the on-duty weather
forecaster (DSN: 631-2710/2463, COMM: 406-731-2710/2463). CWW inherently dictates close
341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   19


contact between the WF and the previously mentioned organizations or personnel, especially FM
personnel. The FMs receive one-on-one training by the WF and are a valuable resource out in the
missile complex. WF leadership will be responsible for ensuring CWW compliance by
coordinating training with associated CWW unit leadership. Due to the vastness of the missile
complex, there may be significant difference in complex weather and Malmstrom AFB. FMs will
notify weather personnel when any of the following are seen or occur at the MAFs:
   3.4.1. Dense fog/mist which reduce visibility to less than 1SM.
   3.4.2. Hail.
   3.4.3. Tornadoes and/or funnel clouds.
   3.4.4. Any damage caused by weather.
3.5. Continuous Weather Watch. The ASOS will conduct a Continuous Weather Watch when
in fully automatic mode (normal configuration). The ASOS will monitor weather conditions
continuously. In addition to taking METARs, the ASOS will take and disseminate observations
as conditions occur that meet SPECI observation criteria. Weather flights may perform a
Continuous Weather Watch during ASOS augmentation if locally determined to be more
appropriate due to existing meteorological conditions.
3.6. METWATCH. METWATCH provides and organized approach for weather personnel to
maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within designated
areas. This process involves notifying supported units and updating any forecast products when
pre-established weather conditions or unforecast changes (timing, location, or forecast values) in
weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources
(Satellite, Weather Radar, Websites, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Weather Radio, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task. The 25 OWS will perform a
continuous METWATCH for Malmstrom AFB and the complex. WF personnel will act as the
“eyes forward” for the 25 OWS by providing immediate feedback on current or short-term
anticipated changes in weather conditions. NOTE: Though similar to MISSIONWATCH
(Chapter 4, paragraph 4.4), transient missions are not considered “local” though the mission
may have originated/terminated at Malmstrom AFB.
   3.6.1. EYES FORWARD Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the WF’s role in
   allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
   detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
   picture and near-term forecast for the OWS. The WF provides meaningful meteorological
   information not contained in the coded observations to the 25 OWS as an integral part of our
   METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc). Additionally, the WF integrates the current
   state of the atmosphere in to an understanding of future impacts on forecast conditions and
   communicates the impacts/information to the 25 OWS, as needed.
3.7. Pilot-to-METRO Service (PMSV) Support. Weather information is available via PMSV
during duty hours on frequency 239.8 MHz. During closure hours, PMSV will not be monitored.
There will be a minimum of one radio check each day to verify PMSV radio is in full service.
For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, PMSV support can be obtained through a
phone patch to the 341 MW/CP at DSN 632-3801. Commercial 406-731-3801, or to the 25 OWS
at DSN 228-6598/6599/6588, Commercial 520-882-6598/6599/6588.

  3.7.1. In the event of a PMSV outage, the WF will notify the 40 HS, CP, and the 25 OWS.
     3.7.1.1. Long Term Outage (over four hours): WF members will contact and complete
     the following:
         3.7.1.1.1. 40 HS: Ensure SOF is aware of the extended outage.
         3.7.1.1.2. CP: Let them know of the extended outage.
         3.7.1.1.3. 25 OWS, DSN 228-7655: Let them know of the extended outage.
         3.7.1.1.4. Heliport Management, DSN 632-6727/Commercial 406-731-6727: Place
         request for PMSV outage in local Safety Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).
         Prepare/provide the following message: (The decoded message will read: “Frequency
         239.8 PMSV not available.” See Figure 3.1).

                 MISSION EXECUTION FORECAST (MEF) SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission forecast services are those weather related actions directly related to
completing each customer’s daily mission(s). The MEF is the primary tool used to accomplish
these tasks. MEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be anything from a
local flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast. Any event, both flying
and non-flying, which will be affected by weather normally requires some sort of MEF.
4.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). Malmstrom AFB TAFs will be produced and
disseminated by the 25 OWS in accordance with AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, and AFMAN 15-
129. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 5. TAFs cover a 30
hour period and are valid for 8 hours. TAF will apply to the area within a 5SM radius of
Malmstrom AFB, and will be issued every 8 hours during the WF’s duty hours or as mission
dictates. The TAF will be amended during flying operations to properly represent the current
conditions.
4.3. Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF). MEFs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using a 12-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129, and may be provided by a
number of methods (verbally, person-to-person, 175-1s, etc.) During this process, the WF will
fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information
supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule) and agencies. The end result is a
product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to
various customers by whatever means proves most effective. MEFs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the 25 OWS and AFWA.
However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource
protection, the WF will amend the MEF to accurately reflect conditions and back-brief the 25
OWS when time permits.
   4.3.1. Flying MEF. The WF will produce a variety of weather products to support aviation
   movements throughout the missile complex. Primary products will include the FLIMSY
   (Forecast for Local or Informational Message) and the Flight Weather Briefs.
       4.3.1.1. FLIMSY MEF. MEFs are generated by the WF forecaster as needed. The
       FLIMSY is the primary briefing tool for all wing flying missions. The FLIMSY provides
       temperature, enroute and flight-level winds, hazards, space weather impacts, current
       watches, warnings, and advisories, and forecasted destination and alternate weather
       conditions for the base as well as the east and west missile complex. MEFs will be issued
       at 0630L, 1100L, and as needed. However, other alternate briefing forms are available,
       such as DD Form 175-1 and verbal briefings. The WF forecaster will also perform a
       MISSIONWATCH for mission limiting weather at Malmstrom and the complex.
       4.3.1.2. Flight Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide traditional Flight
       Weather Briefings (DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) to aircrews flying outside
       of the local flying area. Briefings will be requested as soon as possible to complete the
       175-1. Aircrews operating away from home base will schedule flight weather briefings
       with the appropriate OWS, preferably two or more hours prior to flight time. There is an
       internet based aircrew weather briefing system in the operations/flight planning area for
 22                                                         341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


       transient aircrews to obtain weather data from the appropriate OWS. The 25 OWS can be
       contacted by phone (DSN 228-6598/9), fax (DSN 228-7361, or via internet access:
       (https://ows.dm.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?UID=&BW=H&UF=O&AOR=2&USEH
       F=1).
       4.3.1.3. In the event that immediate weather support is needed and the WF forecaster is
       not available, aircrews can obtain weather information from the 25 OWS website located
       at:
       https://ows.dm.af.mil/Tailored_met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&B_ICAO=KG
       FA&UNIT_ID=25&BW=H&aor=2&UF=M. Additionally, the 25 OWS forecaster,
       responsible for Malmstrom AFB, can be reached at DSN 228-7644 for general weather
       questions.
   4.3.2. Ground Support MEFs. The WF will produce a variety of weather products to support
   ground movements throughout the missile complex.
       4.3.2.1. Ground Support Slides. The WF will produce the Ground Support Slides for the
       Transportation Control Center (TCC). These are situational awareness products depicting
       the forecasted conditions for the three missile squadrons.
           4.3.2.1.1. Weekday slides will be updated three times a day and as valid watches,
           warning, and advisories change during the duty day. Slides will contain a forecast and
           current conditions slide, a forecasted stoplight chart for a 12hr period for each
           squadron and a legend slide.
           4.3.2.1.2. Weekend slides will be updated every 24 hrs in the morning and contain a
           forecast slide, a forecasted stoplight chart for a 24 hr period for each squadron and a
           legend slide.
       4.3.2.2. CAT-1 Brief. The WF will produce a Pre-Brief Route Forecast for the CAT-1
       briefing held the day prior to be briefed in person. The main Route Forecast will be
       created 2 hrs prior to start time the day of the CAT-1. The WF will also verbally brief the
       Route Forecast in a variety of telecons with the TCC/MSC, convoy commander, and
       group and wing leadership.
       4.3.2.3. Missile Movement Brief. The WF will produce a Missile Movement Weather
       brief to be incorporated in to the main Missile Movement brief given by maintenance and
       will brief in person. An email will dictate the time and location of the briefing.
   4.3.3. Pre-Departure Brief. The WF will produce a Pre-Departure brief for the missile crews
   heading out to the field. This brief includes a satellite slide, radar & current conditions slide,
   missile squadron slide, wind chill slide (winter), 24 hr Malmstrom forecast slide, and a 5-day
   outlook slide. These slides will also contain audio narration.
   4.3.4. Malmstrom Forecast. The WF will produce a Fitness Forecast or the Health and
   Wellness Center (HAWC). This slide will contain a nine hour stoplight chart for a variety of
   weather parameters deemed important by the FAC which can affect fitness testing.
4.4. MISSIONWATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which the WF monitors
the weather for all local missions, to include all working areas. All on-site meteorological and
commercial data sources (satellite, radar, internet sites, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task.
It is through this method that MEF amendments/updates are accomplished. During rapidly

                                            Chapter 6

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
(High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations, alerts
and warnings, and products available to Malmstrom personnel.
6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of light and solar wind, our ability to provide lead-
times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Malmstrom’s missions have a wide variety of
parameters possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication,
radar, Global Positioning System (GPS) Com, etc.).
6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from Air Force Weather Web
Services (AFW-WEBS). Most space weather products from the strategic center are “now-casts”
and/or very short-term forecasts (6-hourly period), so the duty forecaster will check websites for
updated products when a new TAF is issued and update the MEF accordingly.
   6.4.1. GPS Products. GPS products are primarily “now-casts” and/or <1 hourly forecast.
   Due to the frequent refresh rate required for monitoring these products, the MEF provides a
   web link. Duty forecasters will only need to monitor these products when specifically
   requested by the customer.

                                            Chapter 8

                          RESOURCES PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 25 OWS and the
Malmstrom WF. The 25 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted weather watches and
warnings. The WF acts as the ‘eyes forward” for the 25 OWS, and is responsible for issuing all
observed warnings and advisories. However, the WF can issue any forecasted warning if there is
an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back brief the OWS
when time permits and will also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies.
Conversely, the WF will act as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The
goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to Malmstrom AFB and the missile
complex.
8.2. Weather Watches. A Weather Watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.,
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of the center-point of the main
helipad as well as for any location within the 341 MW complex. Tables 8.1 contain all of the
Watches and desired lead-times (DLT) issued for Malmstrom AFB and the missile complex.

8.4. Observed Weather Warnings. In accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-66, General Industrial
Operations, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and Activities,
lightning warnings are the only type of observed warning issued on Malmstrom AFB or the
missile complex. Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually,
audibly or via National Lightning Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid
until lightning has not occurred in the area for 15 minutes. The WF will provide timely
notification to all supported units upon issuance and expiration of a lightning warning. Observed
weather warnings are contained in Table 8.3 & 8.4.

Icing Advisory (> Light)
8.7. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings will be numbered consecutively by identifying
the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory) followed by a five-digit number. The
first two numbers indicate the current month while the second three numbers indicate the
sequence number. For example, the message “Weather Warning 02-005” means the month is
February (02), and this is the fifth (005) warning issued in the month. The message “Weather
Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12) and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory
issued in the month. Examples of different messages are contained in Attachment 3. NOTE: In
the event that JET is inoperable, the AF Form 3806 and/or AF Form 3807 will be filled out by
the duty forecaster.
8.8. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase
from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
times specified above. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one time. If a warning is
issued for one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning, with
a new number, will be issued to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be
specified for each criterion, if necessary.
8.9. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
8.10. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be cancelled when the weather phenomena are
no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at the end
of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria are no longer
occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. See paragraph 8.4 for cancellation
of observed lightning warnings.
8.11. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the purpose of these
procedures, severe weather is defined as any weather phenomenon considered critical enough by
the customer to require advance/special notice and subsequent actions to prevent serious injury
or damage to personnel, property, or resources. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather
watches, warnings, and advisories are disseminated to all Malmstrom AFB agencies to ensure
 30                                                      341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


personnel and resource protection. These procedures document a two-tier system with the WF
and the 25 OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
    8.11.1. 341 OSS/OSW Responsibilities. The WF will perform the SWAP responsibilities as
    defined in AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, and AFI 10-206. More specifically, WF will
    accomplish the following procedures for notification:
       8.11.1.1. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1630 MT, Monday through Friday,
       except federal holidays/authorized down days), the duty forecaster will implement SWAP
       whenever one or more conditions in Table 8.8 are met. It is likely the above personnel
       will be present in the weather station and do not need to be recalled.
       8.11.1.2. Standby/Recall Procedures.        During nights, weekends, and federal
       holidays/authorized down days, the duty forecaster at the 25 OWS will implement SWAP
       by notifying the CP by phone whenever one or more conditions in Table 8.8 are met to
       determine if the SWAP needs to be activated. CP will notify the on-call WF person.
       8.11.1.3. Activation. The duty forecaster will discuss the meteorological situation with
       the OWS, manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on
       standby) with the SWAP member. (If a SWAP member is unavailable, coordinate with
       the WF Flight/CC, or WF NCOIC.) If deemed necessary, the SWAP member will report
       to the weather station as soon as possible after notification by the duty forecaster. Once
       the SWAP member has arrived, they will assist in evaluating the situation, determine the
       need to recall additional personnel, and execute the SWAP duties/responsibilities in
       Table 8.8.
       8.11.1.4. Upon arrival at the weather station, the SWAP standby member, time
       permitting, will conduct a meteorological teleconference (METCON) with the 25 OWS
       Forecaster/Shift Supervisor.
       8.11.1.5. Weather personnel will augment the ASOS if needed.

        8.11.2. 25 OWS Responsibilities. 25 OWS will immediately notify the 341 OSS/OSW
        duty forecaster when any watches or warnings listed in Table 8.8 are issued. 25 OWS
        and the WF will implement their SWAP IAW local guidance. If there is no answer at the
        primary number, 25 OWS will make a backup call to the 341 MW/CP and alert them to
        the severe weather threat. As soon as 25 OWS finishes contacting the primary or
        alternate POC, it will implement internal SWAP. Although most SWAP criteria are
        issued by 25 OWS, the WF could issue a SWAP criteria warning, at which time, it will
        notify 25 OWS and both will start coordinated SWAP. 25 OWS will accomplish the
        following procedures when severe weather is determined likely:
        8.11.2.1. 25 OWS Internal SWAP. 25 OWS internal SWAP includes: increased vigilance
        by forecasters and supervisors; increased communications with supported units as
        necessary; and reallocation of internal resources and actions, as necessary.
        8.11.2.2. Intensify METWATCH.
        8.11.2.3. Review watch/warning criteria for Malmstrom AFB, collaborate with WF and
        issue products as required.
        8.11.2.4. If the OWS is acting as the WF, they will provide data to the Command Post
        (341 MW/CP) for OPREP reporting purposes as outlined below in paragraph. 8.11.7.
     8.11.3. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather actually occurs, accomplish the following:
        8.11.3.1. Notify 25 OWS flight leadership (if not already present).
        8.11.3.2. Examples include reports from local law enforcement and emergency
        management agencies, local news media, and supported WFs.
        8.11.3.3. The 25 OWS SWAP leader will perform a “data save” and provide all pertinent
        information to the WF leadership. The flight leadership will compile the information and
        provide a summary to the 25 OWS and AFGSC/A3W for further dissemination at their
        discretion.
 32                                                      341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


   8.11.4. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPs. In the event of severe weather, in
   accordance with AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, and AFI 10-206, the WF will query the
   NWS, local spotters, and online damage assessment data sources to collect the area impacts
   of severe weather (on base or in the missile complex) as time permits. Following a severe
   weather event in which Hail > 3/4 inch, Tornado, Heavy Snow, Freezing Precip and/or
   Blizzard occur, the WF will provide 341 MW/CP with the following information required for
   inclusion in an OPREP-3 report produced by 341 MW/CC.
       8.11.4.1. Actual severe weather experienced, along with any other pertinent information
       (damage reports, visual/radar tornadic confirmations, etc.).
       8.11.4.2. TAF valid at the time of occurrence.
       8.11.4.3. Any watches, warnings, and/or advisories issued to include actual and desired
       lead time.
       8.11.4.4. Operational status of meteorological and communication equipment.
       8.11.4.5. The CP, in turn, will provide the WF with a copy of any weather related
       OPREPs. The WF will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to the OWS and higher
       headquarters as soon as possible. NOTE: 341 MW/CC is the releasing authority for
       OPREP-3s.
       8.11.4.6. The WF will notify and provide 25 OWS and AFGSC/A3BW of any OPREP-3
       and severe weather reports immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement
       for post-analysis and verification. Request 25 OWS to provide required information, if
       needed, by performing a weather data save.
8.12. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM)/Effective Downwind Messages (EDM). The
WF is the primary unit for providing CDM/EDM support. CDM bulletins can be produced in
station but are also available on the OWS website. They are used to determine the spread of
chemical and biological agents that are released at the surface (CDM) as from a fuel leak and
aloft (EDM) as from a nuclear detonation.
341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  33


                                           Chapter 9

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General. Timely and efficient dissemination of weather information is crucial to the
success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most organizations will receive this
information via our primary dissemination system. Some organizations will receive courtesy
calls, however, AFI 10-229 restricts the WF from directly notifying (via telephone) more than 3
organizations in order to focus on incoming weather phenomena. This chapter describes the
weather dissemination systems, dissemination procedures, and back-up systems and procedures
as of the date of writing.
9.2. Dissemination and Back-up Systems. Currently the WF uses the Joint Environmental
Toolkit (JET) as its primary method of disseminating observations, forecasts, warnings, watches,
and advisories (WWA). The JET consists of a dedicated computer server in the Network Control
Center connected through the base local area network (LAN). The CP, TCC, and MMOC have
user accounts to access the JET webpage. Agencies currently without JET passwords will
receive critical weather information through the wings dissemination system (CP notifications,
CP email, pop-ups, etc.). The WF will follow documented backup dissemination procedures
documented in the SOPs in the event that JET becomes inoperative.
9.3. Dissemination and Back-Up Procedures. Observations will be taken only when
augmentation is needed (hail, tornado, funnel cloud, volcanic ash and items deemed necessary
for flight safety) and disseminated through the ASOS as described in Chapter 3. When the
ASOS is out of service, observations will be disseminated long-line through JET. If all long-line
transmission resources are out of service, a call via telephone to the OWS for long-line
transmission. Locally, observations will be relayed by the WF to the 40 HS via in person or
telephone.
   9.3.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories (WWA). WWAs will be disseminated
   via JET (see paragraph 9.2 for a list of the organizations) When WWAs are issued, WF will
   give a courtesy call to the CP, MMOC and TCC. If JET is out of service, the 25 OWS and/or
   the WF will contact the same organizations.
9.4. Base Warning Notification Pyramid Structure Diagrams. Per AFI 10-229, the
following diagram shows how weather watches/warnings are sent through the wing.

                                          Chapter 10

                                  WEATHER EQUIPMENT

10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on back-up
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
10.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses a wide range of equipment to determine the
current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to provide
customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   10.2.1. ASOS. The ASOS is an integrated weather system consisting of multiple weather
   sensors and information technology components that continually measure/derive wind speed
   and direction, temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, barometric pressure, altimeter, sea
   level pressure, cloud heights & coverage, pressure altitude, density altitude, freezing
   precipitation and liquid precipitation and liquid precipitation amounts. However, it cannot
   accurately measure sector visibility, sky conditions throughout the horizon circle,
   accumulated snowfall, or hail. It automatically generates surface aviation weather
   observations based on user-defined events, either by time or occurrence of a particular
   weather element or category. The ASOS runs in full automatic mode and is the primary
   source of Malmstrom AFB’s official observation. The backup for the ASOS consists of the
   Kestrel 4000, TMQ-53 and manual observation.
   10.2.2. Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD). Also known as the Weather Surveillance Radar,
   1998, Doppler (WSR-88d), the NEXRAD is a Doppler radar weather system which provides
   precipitation and wind information. The WF operates this system via the Open Primary User
   Processor (OPUP). The OPUP is a dedicated computer to ingest and analyze radar data and
   display it graphically and is directly linked to the Great Falls National Weather Service’s
   (NWS) radar.
   10.2.3. Lightning Tracking Software (LTS2005). The LTS2005 displays real-time lightning,
   both cloud-to-ground and most intra-cloud discharges, anywhere in the continental US
   (CONUS), including MAFB and the Missile Complex. It also has adjustable alert areas that
   can be tailored to the mission. The internet provides the WF backup lightning data although
   it is not real-time as it is time lagged by about 10-20 minutes.
   10.2.4. Remote Automated Weather Systems (RAWS). Five RAWS are located at the
   Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) in Alpha, Bravo, Golf, Oscar, and Kilo flights. They can
   accurately measure wind speed and direction, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind chill,
   visibility, barometric pressure, altimeter, cloud heights, and liquid precipitation amounts.
   However, they cannot accurately measure sector visibility, sky conditions throughout the
   horizon circle, freezing precipitation, accumulated snowfall, lightning or hail.
   10.2.5. FMQ-22. This sensor is installed at 11 MAFs. The sensor accurately measures all
   components of a surface observation (similar to the base ASOS).
10.3. Communications Equipment. JET. This is our primary system for disseminating
forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories.
 36                                                       341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013


   10.3.1. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (239.8 MHz) allows the WF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying. If the PMSV is out of service,
   aircrews can contact the 25 OWS via phone patch (where possible) to get weather data.
   10.3.2. Phones/Hotlines. The WF has a secondary crash-net phone used by the CP for
   passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
   10.3.3. Local Area Netwrok (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. The WF’s ability to
   support the wing would be severely degraded if the base network were to go down.
10.4. Maintenance. The organizations in Table 10.1 provide preventive maintenance and repair
for the weather equipment.

Table 10.1. Maintenance Providers.
Equipment            Provider
PMSV                 Comm Focal Point, DSN: 632-2622, COMM: 406-731-2622 / 781-0557

RAWS                 AAI
10.5. Restoring Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in the
event natural disasters or any other anomaly simultaneously impact systems base-wide. The
priorities for weather equipment are listed in Table 10.2 (priorities may be adjusted based on
incoming weather).

10.6. Building Power. Building 1441 is equipped with a back-up generator. The generator
should start up automatically when power is cut off to the building. 341 CES performs monthly
tests to ensure the generator is working properly.
341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 37


                                          Chapter 11

                              OWS/WF BACK UP SUPPORT

11.1. General. This chapter briefly describes how weather services will be provided should any
such events requiring backup procedures.
11.2. 25 OWS. When weather operations at 25 OWS are interrupted (e.g., power outage,
natural disaster, etc.), associated TAF, weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility will
be transferred to WF until such time the 25 OWS is postured to resume operations. Other 25
OWS weather information responsibilities (e.g., graphical products) will be transferred to other
agencies as necessary to continue to keep weather information available to Malmstrom AFB.
11.3. WF. For standard station evacuations, support will resume from the alternate operating
location site. For longer interruptions, the WF will coordinate required support with other
organizations. The 25 OWS will not normally produce and disseminate tactical-level weather
products for Malmstrom AFB mission execution. The WF will coordinate the transfer of this
responsibility in advance with 25 OWS.
 38                                                     341MWI15-101 23 OCTOBER 2013

                                RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

12.1. General. This chapter describes support required by the WF in order to accomplish its
daily mission. Per AFMAN 15-129, support to the WF by other local agencies that are mandated
by USAF or other local directives are not included in this chapter.
12.2. 341st Command Post (341 MW/CP) will notify the WF with sufficient lead time of any
wing events or incidents such as alerts or recalls that may involve or require weather
support. NOTE: Information on briefing format is usually needed. Preparation time varies
based on required format.
   12.2.1. Utilize the JET software for prompt notification of weather watches, warnings, and
   advisories.
   12.2.2. Disseminate weather watches, warnings, and advisories according to local
   procedures.
   12.2.3. Notify senior wing leadership when any weather warning or severe weather watch
   (e.g., tornado, > 3/4 inch hail, blizzard, heavy snow, freezing precip), is issued.
   12.2.4. Notify the WF when any local agency reports a funnel cloud, tornado, large hail
   (3/4” or greater) or any other significant weather event.
   12.2.5. Notify the WF of any significant weather related event (material damage, injuries,
   etc.).
   12.2.6. Include the WF on their dissemination/notification list for any weather related
   OPREP-3s or incident.
   12.2.7. Initiate SWAP by contacting the WF standby forecaster for any Watch or Warning
   issued outside of the wing’s normal duty hours that is listed in Table 8.8
12.3. 40th Helicopter Squadron (40 HS). will provide 341 OSS/OSW with timely notification
of changes to schedule operations that affect weather support requirements.
   12.3.1. Notify the WF of required additional support as soon as it becomes known to include
   monitoring of alternate observations/forecasts and tracking of weather conditions that may
   affect local flying operations.
   12.3.2. Coordinate and provide time during flying safety meetings for weather presentations
   selected subjects.
   12.3.3. Provide the WF with access to a weekly flying schedule via PEX and advise of any
   additional weather support requirements or flying requirements over and above the daily
   flying schedule. In addition, as a minimum, the schedules must include take-off and landing
   times and the location/time of in-flight operations.
   12.3.4. Provide a pilot report (PIREP) of any significant or unexpected weather encountered
   in flight via PMSV and/or debrief to the WF.
   12.3.5. Provide the WF feedback via the provided feedback form and/or verbally post flight.

   A3.1.2. Sample Breakdown
       A3.1.2.1. Type of Observation. There are three types of observations:
            A3.1.2.1.1. Meteorological Observation (METAR). This is an observation taken
            routinely in accordance with AFMAN 15-111.
            A3.1.2.1.2. Special Observation (SPECI). This is an observation taken as a result of
            one of the special criteria (listed in attachment 4) being met.
            A3.1.2.1.3. Local (LOCAL). This is an observation which is manually generated by
            the WF when backing-up the ASOS. They will only be done as single element
            observations for altimeter setting changes.
       A3.1.2.2. Station Identifier. This is also called the International Civil Aviation
       Organization (ICAO). This code identifies the location of the observation (in this case
       KGFA=Malmstrom AFB).
       A3.1.2.3. Date and Time. The date is the first two digits (30) and represents the 30th day
       of the month. The time is the next five characters (1456Z) and represents the time the
       last element of the observation was observed and transmitted in Zulu (GMT).
       A3.1.2.4. Type of Observation. In this case it’s “Auto” meaning automatically taken and
       transmitted.
       A3.1.2.5. Wind. The first three digits provided the wind direction the wind is coming
       from in degrees (220). The next two digits is the sustained wind speed (08), G = gusts
       and the last two digits are the gust speed (15) measured in knots.
       A3.1.2.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome)
       that can be seen from the airfield, reported in statute miles (SM). The most common
       visibility reported is 7 miles, however, Malmstrom’s ASOS reports up to 10 miles.
       A3.1.2.7. Present Weather. This is any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the
       airfield. This is mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A3.1. lists the
       present weather codes.

VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how far up into the fog can
be seen.

The last three digits (none for SKC) is the height above the airfield of the clouds in hundreds of
feet (080=08000 or 8,000ft and 110=11000 or 11,000ft).
       A3.1.2.9. Air Temperature/Dew Point. These are in °C which negative temperatures
       designated with an M (M09 = -9°C).

     during the forecast period.
  A5.2.7. Specification of Temporary Conditions: Forecast conditions specified as temporary
  become predominant conditions. Forecast conditions specified as temporary do not occur as
  forecast. Forecast conditions specified as temporary are no longer expected to occur.
  A5.2.8. Changes to Predominant Conditions: Forecast change conditions (BECMG group)
  occur before the beginning of the specified period of change and are expected to persist.
  Forecast change conditions (BECMG group) do not occur by the specified time. Forecast
  change conditions (BECMG group) are no longer expected to occur.
  A5.2.9. Representative Conditions: Forecast conditions are considered unrepresentative of
  existing or forecast conditions and amending the forecast improves safety, flight planning,
  operations efficiency, or assistance to in-flight aircraft.
