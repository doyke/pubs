     placarded.
     10.8.8. Posting fire symbols on the main ramp Combat Aircraft Parking Areas (A-10
     CAPA) and (C-130 CAPA) is not required on DMAFB as long as procedures in
     paragraphs 12.40.8.1-3 are followed.
  10.23. A minimum of two fire extinguishers, with a classification of 2A:10BC or greater, are
  required at any one Ammunition and Explosives (AE) storage location when personnel are
  present and the structure doors are open to include inventories. During 100% inventories,
  when all doors in a multi-bay facility are accessed, position fire extinguishers outside of the
  structure in an accessible location and no more than 50’ apart.
     11.1.3. 355 FW/SEW will issue all explosives licenses for DMAFB. Host and tenant
     units will draft and coordinate AF Form 2047 with required agencies prior to submitting
     to 355 FW/SEW for final approval.
     11.5.6. Reduced parking distance criteria for licensed locations will be evaluated and
     approved by DMAFB FES and 355 FW/SEW on a case-by-case basis. If reduced
     parking distance is approved based on mission necessity, include the criteria in the
     remarks section of the AF Form 2047.
  11.6. AF Form 2047 will be clearly displayed at the licensed location in the immediate
  vicinity of the stored munitions.
         11.7.7.2. Once approved by the 355 FW/SEW Weapons Safety Manager (WSM), the

  11.11. Licenses issued solely for exercise-use munitions, such as GBS and smoke grenades,
  will include the following in the remarks section of AF Form 2047 and in the applicable OI
  or exercise plan: “NOT FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE OF MUNITIONS. Munitions will
  be returned to the munitions storage area at the end of each exercise.” Once a license is
  approved, it may apply to each exercise employing the specified quantities of munitions,
  provided an annual license review is accomplished. This license is only valid during
  exercises, and munitions will not be stored at any other times.
     12.40.7. Live Ordnance Loading Area (LOLA). The DMAFB LOLA is sited as a
     composite North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) revetted Type B (prop) Combat
     Aircraft Parking Area (CAPA). The LOLA can accommodate up to 12 fighter aircraft at
     one time for loading HC/D 1.1 ordnance. All assigned or deployed units operating from
     the DMAFB LOLA, including U.S. Military and NATO forces, will adhere to the
     following requirements:
         12.40.7.1. The using organization’s scheduler will coordinate with MOC 72-hours
         prior to conducting munitions operations in the LOLA. Aircraft owner/user
         organizations are responsible for providing security of the LOLA ramp when
         required. Coordinate LOLA security operations with BDOC at 228-3200/5131.
         12.40.7.2. The LOLA consists of 12 designated parking spots for fighter aircraft,
         with spot 1 located nearest the taxiway to the southeast. Whenever possible, aircraft
         parking spots should be used sequentially from spot 12 to spot 1. The NEWs for the
         LOLA and LOLA Munitions Holding Area are outlined in Figure 12.1.
         12.40.7.3. Inform MOC of aircraft munitions status as well as start and stop times for
         munitions loading operations.
         12.40.7.4. Post appropriate fire/hazard warning symbols at the LOLA entrance.
         Ensure a fire extinguisher is present at each revetment, positioned IAW T.O. 00-25-
         172, Table 3-1. Notify ECC at 228-4757 and MOC of fire symbol changes at the start
         and finish of all LOLA operations. Remove fire warning symbols at the completion
         of LOLA operations.
         12.40.7.5. Munitions-laden trailers may be parked between aircraft only during
         uploading and downloading operations. Munitions-laden trailers may not remain at
         the aircraft parking spot longer than required to complete the loading/unloading
         operation. Munitions-laden trailers will be placed on the LOLA munitions holding
         area when not being used in a weapons loading operation.
         12.40.7.6. When armed or damaged munitions are encountered, stop all activities and
         declare a ground emergency. Notify MOC at 228-7441 and ensure DMAFB FES,
         EOD, 355 SFS, and 355 FW/SEW are notified.
         12.40.7.7. Explosives-loaded aircraft require monitoring/security at all times by the
         owning/using organization. During any maintenance operations, personnel must have

      12.40.8. Combat Aircraft Parking Area (CAPA) Explosives Operations. The main
      ramp at DMAFB is the primary CAPA for A-10 aircraft. Three rows of parking spots are
      designated A2 through A26, B1 through B26, and C1 through C26. The C-130 CAPA is
      located just to southeast of the A-10 CAPA on the main ramp. NEW limits for the A-10
      and C-130 CAPAs are listed in Figure 12.2.
            12.40.8.1. DMAFB FES will have access to the approved local flying schedule
            listing all aircraft sorties and munitions configurations. DMAFB FES will receive
            notification of the start and end of each flying day and will be informed of significant
            updates to the approved flying schedule.
            12.40.8.2. DMAFB FES will respond to any emergency on the A-10 CAPA based on
            the highest hazard class/division (HC/D) present during daily training operations,
            HC/D 1.2. When HC/D 1.1 munitions are present on the A-10 CAPA, Emergency
            Control Center (ECC) will receive notification of exact location(s) and aircraft tail
            numbers(s).
            12.40.8.3. DMAFB FES will respond to any emergency on the C-130 CAPA
            according to the highest approved munitions hazard, HC/D 1.3, based on current
            explosives site plans.
            12.40.8.4. In the event of an emergency on the on the A-10 or C-130 CAPA, ECC

       12.41.6. Hot Cargo Pad (HCP) Operations.
           12.41.6.1. (Added) The primary HCP for incoming and outgoing aircraft carrying
           explosive cargo is located at the end of Taxiway F. In the Hot Pit (HP) area, HP 30
           and HP 31 are alternate HCPs but are not capable of holding HC/D 1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.2,
           1.2.3 munitions. NEW limits for the three HCPs are defined in Figure 12.3.
           12.41.6.2. To maintain QD requirements, compensatory measures are required for
           the primary HCP at Taxiway F. When this HCP is in use, 355 SFS will close the
           traffic gate adjacent to Gate 29B to restrict vehicle and personnel traffic from the
           area. 355 SFS will also ensure that the swinging barricade is placed across the
           jogging track adjacent to the perimeter fence to restrict personnel from entering the
           area. Vehicle and personnel traffic may flow unrestricted once explosive cargo is
           removed from the area. 355 FW/SEW is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
           for these procedures.
           12.41.6.3. No other operations will be conducted within a 1,250-foot radius while
           HCP explosives loading or unloading operations are in progress.
           12.41.6.4. Fire extinguishers will be positioned IAW TO 00-25-172, Table 3.1.
           12.41.6.5. Post the appropriate fire symbol at the HCP entrance according to the
           highest explosives class present and notify ECC at 228-4757.
           12.41.6.6. Airfield Operations will notify the following agencies prior to all HCP
           operations and after termination: BDOC at 228-5131, ECC at 228-4757, 355
           FW/SEW at 228-6398/6397 (cell 909-0317), and 355 CES/CEOFE Airfield Lighting

     12.45.1. 162nd ACA Detachment will arm at EOR during 355 FW flying operations.
     When 355 FW flying is complete or unscheduled 162nd ACA Detachment may arm and
     de-arm at the Alert CAPA. In the event of a weapons system malfunction or declared In
     Flight Emergency (IFE), 162nd ACA Detachment aircraft will taxi to appropriate EOR
     location.
  12.47. During flight line delivery and retrieval of aircraft munitions, the preferred method is
  to use a munitions trailer throughout the operation. However, to meet mission requirements,
  BDU practice bombs, chaff/flare modules, small arms ammunition, and impulse carts
  required for a single aircraft load may be temporarily placed at the aircraft parking spot in a
  designated location to await aircraft loading or pick-up by 355 EMS Line Delivery. Impulse
  carts and small arms ammunition must be stored in an approved container prior to placing on
  the ground. All other aircraft munitions will be directly loaded from and downloaded to the
  munitions trailer.
     12.64.1. Every effort will be made to contact the responsible activity through Command
     Post or MOC using the applicable standby rosters. 355 SFS will be notified of the
     appropriate risk category for incoming munitions. All vehicles transporting risk category
     munitions will be parked at the munitions railhead. Unless other arrangements are
     coordinated, vehicle operators will be responsible for security of munitions. 355 SFS
     will accomplish random checks of the MSA railhead area.
  14.4. 355 FW/SEW will maintain facility information and usage in the Assessment System
  Hazard Surveys II (ASHS II) database to validate future explosives site planning criteria.
  355 FW/SEW will coordinate with 355 CES for a quarterly base map update, including
  planned construction projects and future facility sites, utilities, roads, and other
  infrastructure.
     14.4.1. 355 FW/SEW requires accurate map coordinates to properly evaluate
     construction activities for explosives siting considerations. Coordinate through 355
     FW/SEW during the design stage of all building projects, including new construction or
     alteration of existing facilities and infrastructure, for implementation into the ASHS II
     database. This coordination shall provide information detailing the purpose of the
     construction and a map of the proposed location.
     14.4.2. 355 FW/SEW will review design requests to determine if the construction
     location and intent complies with safety instructions. 355 FW/SEW will outline
     necessary restrictions or provisions required prior to construction of the facility.
     14.4.3. New construction within existing DMAFB explosives arcs or construction of
     explosives storage/operating facilities shall not begin until 355 FW/SEW receives an
     approved explosives site plan from the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board
     (DDESB) or a waiver from the Secretary of the Air Force.

MEMORANDUM FOR 355 FW/SEW

FROM: (Unit)/CC


SUBJECT: (Unit) Explosive License Justification

1. This letter outlines mission essential quantities of munitions required to support the (Unit) mission and serves to justify the requirement of
an explosive facility license IAW AFMAN 91-201 ACCSUP Para. 11.7.7.2.
NOTE: State mission requirements in specific detail that drive why the unit is required to store munitions within the facility. Any other data that
may serve as justification (directly or indirectly, major or minor) for the existence of the explosive storage facility may aid your unit in meeting
this justification. List all items listed on the AF Form 2047 below. List all applicable Technical Order, Air Force Instruction, and AFCAT 21-209
references.

EXAMPLE (Paragraph 2):
2. Explosive licensed quantities are based on base defense, exercises, evaluations, competitions and requirements outlined in AFCAT 21-209,
Wing Installation Security Plan and AFI 31-101. The quantity listed on the license allows the 355th Security Forces Squadron to meet minimum
mission requirements. Specific munitions requirements are as follows:

          a. Explosive CTG, 5.56MM, M193, 1305-00-926-3930, 8,000 each is required to conduct exercises and evaluations. Squad exercises
with 15 or more participant’s use up to 500 rounds per exercise period. The extra 500 will allow training variations. Items support Security
Forces training/exercises, they are only allowed in the armory for the duration of the exercise, 5 duty days prior and after.

            b. Kit, UWARS, 1377-01-394-5663, 10 each are required for maintenance replacement on survival kits, 4 per week. The workload
drives up to 4 kits per week. This quantity is sufficient to sustain workflow for maintenance replacement requirements until more items can be
re-supplied. REF: T.O. 14S1-11-3 and T.O. 11P12-15-7.

           c. Grenade, Hand, Smoke Red, GREEN, 1330-00-289-6852, 20 each are required to
support simulated attack scenarios during Operational Readiness Exercise and Emergency Management Exercise operations only. Munitions will
be picked up from the Munitions Storage Area immediately prior to the beginning of the exercise. Serviceable munitions and expenditures will
be turned-in to MSA for permanent storage immediately upon ENDEX of exercise.

            d. Cartridge, Impulse, ARD-863, 1377-01-369-2492, 900 each are required for arming weapons bomb racks for loaded stores in
support of three A-10C flying squadrons. 858 impulse cartridges are required for arming 11 weapons stations on 78 aircraft. 42 impulse
cartridges are required to replace unserviceable or expended impulse cartridges as needed.
