1.2.2.). In addition, this change indicates that Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) personnel should be used
for nonappropriated fund (NAF) audits involving suspected fraud (paragraph 5.3.2.6.); adds a require-
ment for management to establish an audit committee made up of senior officials to oversee audits of
NAF activities (paragraph 5.2.); adds a requirement for SAF/FM to establish and ensure effective opera-
tion of the NAF audit committee (paragraph A3.9.2.); adds a requirement for AFAA to periodically
review public accountant audits of NAF activities (paragraph A3.10.2.); deletes Chapter 6, Management
Advisory Service Program; and updates applicable references (Attachment 1).
(MOUNTAIN HOME) Updated paragraphs 1.2.4.2.3. (Added), 1.4.2.1. (Added)-1.4.2.5.1. (Added),
and Chapter 6 (Added); added "Once progress reports have been accumulated, a Financial Management
Indicator (FMI) report will be prepared quarterly for HQ ACC/FMFP. The report shows all recommenda-
tions tracked by CPTS/FM from the time the report is issued until it is closed. It also shows any recom-
mendations that have slipped six months from the original ECD, therefore, it is important for unit’s to set
ECDs that are attainable" to paragraph 6.5. (Added); and deleted paragraph 5.5. A bar ( | ) to the left of
the paragraph number annotates change.

                                                Chapter 1

                                           AUDIT REPORTS

1.1. Overview. The AFAA is the sole provider of internal audit services to the Air Force, and a report is
the usual product of an AFAA audit. This chapter provides information on processing AFAA audit reports
and tracking the implementation of report recommendations. Attachment 3 identifies report processing
responsibilities. In addition, public accountants audit nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities and issue
reports following policy in AFPD 65-3. Chapter 5 contains information on public accountant audits and
reports of NAF activities.

1.2. Audit Process. AFAA uses an audit process that attempts to make the most efficient and effective
use of audit resources. Prior to announcing an audit, AFAA conducts substantial preliminary research to
identify appropriate audit subjects that AFAA includes in a plan it provides to management annually. The
process permits flexibility and timely adjustment of audit requirements due to changes in Air Force policy
and emphasis.
    1.2.1. Audit Phases. Each audit consists of three phases: research, application, and report processing.
    The research phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives and thoroughly plan the
    audit. The research phase culminates with development of the audit program which provides the ana-
    lytical methodology for a thorough examination designed to disclose deficiencies and their underlying
    causes and impact. During the application phase, auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit
    results and provide a basis for specific recommendations. At the conclusion of field work, the AFAA
    prepares a draft report that presents identified audit results and recommendations so management can
    take appropriate corrective actions without the need for further review or study. AFAA releases the
    draft report to management for formal comments. After receiving the management comments, AFAA
    adds them to the final report, along with an AFAA evaluation, and distributes the final report. Desig-
    nated activities formally track the final report until management indicates it has implemented all the
    agreed-to actions. Follow-up audits determine whether actions taken by management corrected cited
    deficiencies.
    1.2.2. Deconflicting Audits. Before starting each audit, AFAA first determines if conducting the
    audit would adversely affect the units involved. AFAA will defer the audit start or select other loca-
    tions when the unit is experiencing significant operational demands (i.e., deployments, exercises, or
    inspections) and conducting the audit would conflict with the unusual workload demands. Deconflict-
    ing audits is accomplished through coordination with base, major command (MAJCOM), field oper-
    ating agency (FOA), direct reporting unit (DRU), and Air National Guard (ANG) gatekeepers.
    NOTE: Throughout the remainder of this instruction, MAJCOM is used as a collective term to denote
    “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and ANG.”
    1.2.3. Audit Limitation. Internal audits do not criticize responsible management decisions. Most
    management decisions involve some degree of risk and uncertainty. Even when later events show the
    wrong decision was made, this, by itself, does not mandate an audit report. Unsuccessful decisions
    become subject to audit when they result in inefficient operations, inadequate procedures, or other
    deficiencies and when reporting them would lead to improving systems, procedures, or avoiding
    future errors.
AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007                                                              5


       1.2.4.2.3. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) 366 CPTS/FM (Financial Management) acts as liaison
       between management and auditors. 366 CPTS/FM monitors follow-up actions on Report of Audit
       (ROA) with copies of forwarding letters, target dates, corrective actions letters and related corre-
       spondence. 366 CPTS/FM will notify affected units upon receipt of an audit announcement letter.
       366 CPTS/FM will schedule an in-brief with 366 FW/DS (Director of Staff) and commanders of
       all units involved with the audit.

1.3. Types of Reports.
   1.3.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA Air Force-level audit reports are the result of centrally man-
   aged, single or multi-site, audits that the AFAA addresses to the Secretariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM.
   AFAA also provides these reports to the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptrol-
   ler (SAF/FM) for tracking recommendations and to the Department of Defense Inspector General
   (DODIG) for information. The AFAA issues two types of Air Force-level reports: standard and
   interim.
       1.3.1.1. Standard Report. The standard report (also known as a “blue book”) represents the nor-
       mal reporting vehicle for conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
       1.3.1.2. Interim Report. AFAA issues interim reports (a) when audit results require prompt man-
       agement attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction) or (b) to convey the audit status for a
       lengthy audit (preliminary). The interim report provides management an opportunity to initiate
       early corrective actions on identified findings and for AFAA to acknowledge those actions in the
       audit report.
   1.3.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA installation-level audit reports result from single-site audits
   covering issues specific to an activity or installation. The AFAA issues four types of installation-level
   reports: regular, special, interim, and Commanders Audit Program (CAP).
       1.3.2.1. Regular Report. The regular report is the most commonly issued installation-level
       report. AFAA area audit offices use regular reports to convey the installation-level results of
       locally initiated and centrally directed audits.
       1.3.2.2. Special Report. Special reports convey the results of audits that identify significant mat-
       ters. The findings in these reports usually involve issues such as unlawful activities or other con-
       ditions that could embarrass the Air Force.
       1.3.2.3. Interim Report. AFAA area audit offices issue interim reports for the reasons cited in
       paragraph 1.3.1.2.
       1.3.2.4. Commanders Audit Program Report. CAP reports convey results from a personalized
       audit tailored to specific issues in organizations under the jurisdiction of the requesting com-
       mander.

1.4. Draft Report Processing. The AFAA sends draft reports to tenant, installation, MAJCOM, Air
Staff, or Secretariat officials, as appropriate, for comments. Attachment 3 provides a list of responsibili-
ties for processing draft Air Force-level reports.
   1.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA simultaneously distributes (e-mails) draft reports to the Sec-
   retariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) and applicable offices of col-
   lateral responsibility (OCRs).

    1.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA e-mails each draft report to the designated unit audit
    focal point who forwards it to the functional OPR for comment. The audit focal point acts as a liaison
    officer between management and AFAA and monitors audit project and report processes, including
    follow-up tracking. AFAA addresses installation-level reports to the appropriate commander and,
    except for CAP reports, to other units having oversight authority (e.g., MAJCOM). AFAA limits dis-
    tribution of CAP reports to the requesting commander and the unit commander.
       1.4.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Upon completion of audit, the Northwest Area Audit
       Office (NWAAO) will notify 366 CPTS/FM to arrange an out-brief between auditor(s) and
       affected organizations. Out-brief will consist of dissemination of information collected during the
       audit, findings, recommendations, and potential monetary benefits (PMB). The unit and/or
       NWAAO personnel will notify 366 CPTS/FM immediately if there are nonconcurrences to the
       audit. 366 CPTS/FM will hold meetings with unit management and auditors to try to resolve non-
       concurrences at the lowest level, and will elevate to the appropriate levels to resolve the differ-
       ences.
       1.4.2.2. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Affected organizations will have 3 days from out-brief
       to appoint a point of contact (POC) responsible for timely completion of management comments.
       1.4.2.3. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) POCs will have 15 days total to respond to audit results
       and recommendations, in writing, explaining corrective actions, establishing estimated comple-
       tion date(s) (ECD), and agreeing or disagreeing with reported PMBs.
       1.4.2.4. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) POCs will submit management comments, prepared for
       the 366th Fighter Wing Commander’s (366 FW/CC) signature, to NWAAO through 366 CPTS/
       FMA (Financial Analysis). Package will include an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, signed
       by wing audit liaison and coordinated through the POC’s group commander, 366 CPTS/FMA, 366
       CPTS/FM, 366 FW/CV (Vice Commander), 366 FW/CC (Commander), and 366 CPTS/FMA (for
       distribution).
       1.4.2.5. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) 366 FW letterhead will be used when preparing replies.
           1.4.2.5.1. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Unit management will coordinate draft manage-
           ment comments with 366 CPTS/FM. When preparing management comments, POC will
           ensure each paragraph in the draft ROA is referenced. "Introduction" and "Objectives" para-
           graphs are to be "Noted." "Audit Results," "Recommendations" and "Potential Monetary Ben-
           efits" paragraphs are to be "CONCUR" or "NONCONCUR." Paragraphs answered
           "NONCONCUR" will include a statement that a discussion was held with NWAAO and the
           issue remains unresolved. Recommendations may also be answered "CONCUR, WITH
           INTENT" if recommended action is not considered proper, but there is agreement that action
           is required and management plans to take alternative corrective action. The alternative action
           taken or planned along with actual or anticipated action dates should be cited. The "Manage-
           ment Comment" paragraph contains management response. This latter paragraph will end with
           either "CLOSED" or an ECD. ECDs may not be within 30 days of the suspense date, and
           should not exceed 12 months of the suspense date. If the 12-month limit is exceeded, mile-
           stone dates/actions must be incorporated into the response.

1.5. Management Comments. Management will respond in writing (e-mail responses are acceptable) to
all draft audit reports containing recommendations or potential monetary benefits (PMB). Reference para-
AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007                                                             7


graph 1.5.3. for potential responses. AFAA includes management comments verbatim, along with an
audit evaluation, in the final report. The management OPR and AFAA auditors will coordinate closely so
the final report fully documents management’s position on issues in the report. NOTE: Management may
verbally coordinate on reports that do not contain recommendations or PMB.
   1.5.1. Comments Requirements. Management will write comments concisely and include:
       1.5.1.1. A statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence on each finding, recommendation, and
       PMB.
       1.5.1.2. Appropriate comments describing intended or completed corrective actions and an actual
       or estimated completion date for each corrective action. If corrective actions will take longer than
       a year, the management comments should contain interim milestones for completing major seg-
       ments or action.
       1.5.1.3. Rationale for any disagreements.
       1.5.1.4. Comments on the reasonableness of all auditor-estimated PMB. See Chapter 4 for fur-
       ther information on PMB. NOTE: When management corrects deficiencies during the audit, the
       draft report normally presents the findings and recognizes management's actions in lieu of a rec-
       ommendation. If the report contains PMB, management must still comment on the reasonableness
       of the PMB estimate.
   1.5.2. Suspense Dates. For reports with recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows manage-
   ment 30 calendar days from the date of the draft report to provide written comments. For interim
   reports, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days. For reports with no recommendations
   or PMB, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days to provide a verbal or e-mail concur-
   rence and 30 days to provide a written response.
       1.5.2.1. The AFAA can grant extensions for management comments in unusual circumstances. If
       management cannot respond by the due date, the management OPR telephones or e-mails the
       AFAA and requests an extension. AFAA can grant extensions, usually in 15-day increments, not
       to exceed 30 days from the original suspense date.
       1.5.2.2. For oral requests exceeding 15 days from the original suspense date, the management
       OPR will follow up with a written request (e-mail is acceptable) that includes both the reasons for
       the delay and a firm date when AFAA can expect to get management comments.
   1.5.3. Potential Responses. The following list provides potential responses to audit recommenda-
   tions. See Attachment 2 for specific examples of management comments.
       1.5.3.1. If management agrees with the findings, recommendations, and PMB, the management
       comments will describe corrective actions, both taken or planned, and give actual or planned com-
       pletion dates. Planned completion dates should be at least 90 days from the date comments are
       provided. Reference paragraph A2.1.
       1.5.3.2. If management agrees with the findings and agrees action is required but not the actions
       recommended in the report, management can concur with intent and propose other ways to correct
       the reported deficiencies. The response must explain what action management will take to correct
       the problem. AFAA does not consider such responses as nonresponsive if the alternative action
       would correct the problem. Reference paragraph A2.2.

       1.5.3.3. If management agrees with the findings and recommendations but disagrees with the
       PMB, management must clearly state the reason for disagreement and give a revised PMB esti-
       mate. If management disagrees there will be any PMB, the AFAA will elevate the entire amount
       as a nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. If management agrees there
       will be a PMB, but specifies a lesser amount, the AFAA will elevate only the difference between
       the management estimate and the AFAA estimate. Reference paragraph A2.3.
       1.5.3.4. If management nonconcurs with any finding, management comments should specify the
       reason for the nonconcurrence. The AFAA will elevate the nonconcurrence for resolution in
       accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.4.
       1.5.3.5. If management concurs with the finding but does not agree corrective actions are neces-
       sary, management should explicitly agree with the finding and explain the reason corrective
       actions are not appropriate. The AFAA audit team will elevate the nonconcurrence for resolution
       in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.5..
    1.5.4. Disagreements. Management will notify AFAA immediately if they disagree with any report
    finding, recommendation, or PMB. Management can meet with AFAA and explain their position on
    the points of disagreement or introduce new information. These discussions promote effective correc-
    tive action by clarifying audit findings, recommendations, and PMB. AFAA may revise the draft
    report after discussions with management.

1.6. Management Comments Evaluation. After the management OPR provides comments to AFAA,
the AFAA audit team will evaluate the comments to determine if they meet the requirements of paragraph
1.5.1. and corrective actions, taken or proposed, are adequate and timely. When management comments
are not responsive or when management does not provide comments within the required time, AFAA fol-
lows the procedures described in Chapter 3. When management comments are responsive, the AFAA
audit team inserts the comments and an AFAA evaluation into the final report and distributes the report.

1.7. Revised Report Procedures. If, after issuing a draft report for comment, the audit management
team revises the report (paragraph 1.5.4.), the audit team will reissue the report for comment. AFAA will
allow management an appropriate amount of time to comment on the revised report, not to exceed 30
days.
    1.7.1. Air Force-Level Reports. The Air Force Audit Agency, Pentagon Liaison Office (SAF/AGA)
    distributes copies of the revised Air Force-level report to the HQ USAF OPR and all other activities
    that received the initial draft report.
    1.7.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA team chief distributes the revised report to the unit
    audit focal point and other activities that received the initial draft report.

1.8. Final Report Distribution.
    1.8.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final reports to applicable HQ USAF offices,
    SAF/FM, the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, applicable MAJCOMs, and the DODIG. AFAA also pre-
    pares follow-up tracking sheets and forwards them to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial
    Operations (SAF/FMP). SAF/FMP personnel monitor and report on the implementation of corrective
    actions agreed to in Air Force-level audit reports.
AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007                                                               9


   1.8.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final installation-level reports to responsible unit
   officials and, except for CAP reports, to applicable MAJCOM audit focal points. The audit focal
   points, in turn, track the recommendations and ensure management implements all agreed-to correc-
   tive actions. NOTE: Due to the limited distribution of CAP reports (pararaph 1.4.2.), implementation
   of CAP report recommendations is monitored informally at installation level. CAP reports do not con-
   tain PMB.

1.9. Report Availability. The draft report is an internal Air Force action document and is not widely dis-
tributed. However, the final audit report is a historical document for use by internal and external organiza-
tions. Within the Air Force, management and auditors use the final report for reference. Outside the Air
Force, government agencies such as the DODIG; the Government Accountability Office; and the Con-
gress have access to the report. AFAA releases final reports to the public, when requested, under the Free-
dom of Information Act.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                      ACCESS TO INFORMATION

2.1. Overview. Air Force management grants AFAA auditors access to information according to AFPD
65-3. This chapter provides guidance for resolving access-related disagreements.

2.2. Elevation of Disagreements.
     2.2.1. If an installation refuses to allow access to needed information, the auditor sends written notice
     to the AFAA representative who attempts to resolve the issue with the MAJCOM OPR. If discussions
     with the MAJCOM OPR do not result in access to requested information within 7 calendar days of the
     disagreement, the AFAA representative forwards the request and the MAJCOM position to SAF/
     AGA.
     2.2.2. If management denies access for an Air Force-level audit and the AFAA directorate does not
     resolve the issue, the Assistant Auditor General forwards the request and the results of any discussions
     to SAF/AGA.

2.3. HQ USAF Discussions. SAF/AGA refers access disagreements to the HQ USAF OPR for review
and possible resolution. If these discussions do not resolve the problem within 15 calendar days of the dis-
agreement, SAF/AGA refers the request, along with MAJCOM and HQ USAF positions, to SAF/AG who
submits the package to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) for decision.

2.4. SECAF Decision. The SECAF makes a decision on the access denial within 30 calendar days of the
disagreement and advises applicable Air Force activities of the decision. In accordance with provisions of
DOD Directive 7600.2, Audit Policies, SAF/AG advises the DODIG when the SECAF decision denies
access.

2.5. Denial of Access to Joint Staff Information. If the involved parties cannot agree to an access
request, or AFAA finds the release conditions unacceptable, the AFAA requests the DODIG to formally
notify the Joint Staff of the disagreement and requests the Joint Staff to give the auditors the information
they need. Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, the Joint Staff must either provide
the needed information or forward a recommendation for denial to the Secretary of Defense for a determi-
nation within 30 calendar days.
AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007                                                            11


                                                Chapter 3

                           NONCONCURRENCES (DISAGREEMENTS)

3.1. Required Resolution. Air Force management and audit officials must resolve all disagreements
within 6 months of the final report date according to AFPD 65-4, Followup on Internal Air Force Audit
Reports and Liaison with External Audit Organizations. Management and audit must try to resolve any
disagreements at the lowest management level possible. If they cannot resolve the problem, AFAA must
move the issues to the next higher level of authority, where they will discuss and resolve the disagree-
ments.

3.2. Disagreements with Air Force-Level Reports. SAF/AGA refers final reports to SAF/FMP for res-
olution whenever disagreements exist between the AFAA and management officials. SAF/FMP submits
final reports with unresolved issues to the Under Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution.
See AFI 65-403, Follow-up on Internal Air Force Audit Reports, for additional information.

3.3. Nonconcurrences with Installation-Level Reports. If local auditors and management officials dis-
agree on matters in a report, and they cannot resolve the disagreement, the auditors will prepare and issue
the final report containing management’s non-responsive comments and an audit rebuttal. The auditors
will send the report within 5 calendar days to the AFAA MAJCOM representative for resolution with the
MAJCOM functional OPR.
   3.3.1. The MAJCOM OPR will evaluate the audit and local management positions and provide writ-
   ten comments to the AFAA representative and installation officials within 60 calendar days explaining
   the MAJCOM position.
       3.3.1.1. When MAJCOM supports the audit position, the OPR can, with AFAA representative
       concurrence, include proposed alternative actions to correct the problem.
       3.3.1.2. When MAJCOM supports the management position, the AFAA representative will eval-
       uate the MAJCOM position and either close out the disagreement or elevate it to SAF/AGA for
       resolution with HQ USAF.
   3.3.2. When elevating a disagreement for resolution, the AFAA representative will send SAF/AGA a
   copy of the report, applicable management comments, the MAJCOM written position, and other
   information derived from previous resolution within 90 days of the final report date. The AFAA rep-
   resentative will advise the MAJCOM OPR of this action.
   3.3.3. Working with the HQ USAF OPR, SAF/AGA can take an additional 90 days to resolve the
   nonconcurrence. The SAF/AGA representative will evaluate the HQ USAF OPR position and either
   close out the nonconcurrence or elevate it to SAF/FMP for a final decision.
   3.3.4. SAF/US is the final resolution authority. While SAF/US has delegated authority to decide non-
   concurrences in installation-level issues to SAF/FMP, management or AFAA can appeal the SAF/
   FMP decision to SAF/US.

3.4. Late Management Comments.
   3.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments for Air Force-level
   reports by the last revised due date (not to exceed 60 calendar days from the date of issuance), the
12                                      AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007


     AFAA audit team, in coordination with SAF/AGA, will contact the Air Force action officer weekly to
     discuss (a) problems encountered, (b) the potential for resolution, and (c) the estimated date to receive
     signed comments. After 75 days, the Auditor General may get involved to resolve the problems delay-
     ing receipt of management comments. After 90 days, the AFAA may issue the final report without
     management comments and submit the report to SAF/FMP for resolution in accordance with para-
     graph 3.3.
     3.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments to the draft report
     within 30 calendar days, the AFAA audit team will meet with unit officials to determine the specific
     cause for the delay and, if appropriate, provide additional time for unit officials to prepare their
     response. If management comments are not received after 60 calendar days, the AFAA will either
     grant additional time or issue the final report without management comments.
        3.4.2.1. If it becomes necessary to issue a final report without management comments, the MAJ-
        COM OPR must act immediately to ensure the subordinate unit commander responds to the audit
        report. If the unit commander provides comments within 60 calendar days after the final report
        date, AFAA will evaluate the comments. If the comments are responsive, AFAA will reissue the
        final report with the management comments and AFAA evaluation inserted. If the comments are
        not responsive, AFAA will send the comments to the MAJCOM OPR for resolution in accordance
        with paragraph 3.3.
        3.4.2.2. If the AFAA receives no comments within 90 calendar days following the final report
        date, the AFAA representative will elevate the report to SAF/AGA for resolution with the appro-
        priate HQ USAF OPR and advise the MAJCOM OPR of this action.

                                                Chapter 4

                               POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFITS

4.1. Definition. Potential monetary benefits:
   4.1.1. Is an estimate the AFAA measures and expresses as a dollar value and expects the DOD or the
   Federal Government overall to save if management implements audit recommendations.
   4.1.2. Represents the best estimate or an actual known amount at the time the auditor prepared the
   audit report.
   4.1.3. Can be either funds put to better use or questioned cost, but not both.

4.2. Funds Put to Better Use. Most PMB resulting from internal audit are classified as “funds put to
better use.” “Funds put to better use” means that if management implements the audit recommendations,
funds could be used to meet other requirements. The following list shows examples of actions that result
in “funds put to better use”:
   4.2.1. Reductions in outlays.
   4.2.2. Allowing funds from programs or operations to be deobligated and used in programs or opera-
   tions other than that for which they were originally budgeted.
   4.2.3. Withdrawal of interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.
   4.2.4. Costs avoided by implementing recommended improvements for the operations of the estab-
   lishment, a contractor, or a grantee.
   4.2.5. Avoiding unnecessary spending noted in pre-award reviews of contract or grant agreements.
   4.2.6. Reduction to any approved requirement, either funded or unfunded.

4.3. Questioned Cost. When an auditor questions an incurred cost because of one of the following fac-
tors, it is known as “questioned cost”:
   4.3.1. An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative agreement,
   or other agreement or document that governs the expenditure of funds.
   4.3.2. A cost that, at the time of the audit, is not supported by adequate documentation.
   4.3.3. An expenditure of funds that is unnecessary or unreasonable for the intended purpose (applica-
   ble to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).

4.4. Disallowed Cost. When management, in a management decision, sustains or agrees a questioned
cost should not be charged to the government, it is known as a “disallowed cost” (applicable to incurred
cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).

4.5. Computation. Auditors compute estimated monetary benefits from the most reasonable data avail-
able. Actual monetary benefits are often impossible or impractical to determine. Therefore, auditors base
estimates on generally accepted principles, models, or formulas. For example, AFAA auditors use the
lower limit when expressing a single amount for a statistically projected range of values.
14                                      AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007


     4.5.1. The AFAA expresses monetary benefits in terms of “current year” dollars.
        4.5.1.1. Monetary benefit computations include any appropriate offset costs.
        4.5.1.2. Offset costs include all direct or indirect costs incurred in implementing the action that
        will result in the monetary benefit.
     4.5.2. PMB can be one-time or annual. Annual benefits recur for an indefinite period of time, but
     AFAA limits computations to a 6-year period; that is, the current year plus five.

4.6. Coordination. Before issuing a draft report to an audited organization, AFAA personnel coordinate
PMB amounts of $50,000 or more with the organization responsible for the funds (for example, the appro-
priate item manager at an air logistics center) if the responsible organization differs from the audited orga-
nization. If the organization responsible for the funds is also the audited organization, AFAA coordinates
PMB with the audited organization during the normal draft report discussion period.

4.7. Summary of Audit Results (SAR) Statement. The AFAA attaches a SAR statement to each draft
report given to management. The SAR statement explains PMB of $50,000 or more. The report will nor-
mally explain PMB amounts of less than $50,000, or management can ask for an explanation from the
auditor. The amount included in the SAR statement will agree with the amount in the report.

4.8. Management Response.
     4.8.1. Management can agree or disagree with the estimated PMB in reports of audit. However, man-
     agement should not disagree with the audit estimate solely to defer the decision until actual benefits
     materialize.
     4.8.2. Management should comment on the reasonableness of the auditor's estimate and must justify
     disagreements with evidence that supports an alternate estimate.

4.9. Reporting Potential Monetary Benefits. AFAA includes all PMB in the Semi-Annual Report to
the Congress, RCS: DD-IG(SA)1717, and the Follow-up Status Report, RCS: DD-IG(SA)1574.

                                                Chapter 5

                               NONAPPROPRIATED FUND AUDITS

5.1. Nonappropriated Fund Audit Requirements.
   5.1.1. HQ Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) arranges for annual financial audits of central NAF
   instrumentalities and individual NAF activities with annual revenues or expenses exceeding $7 mil-
   lion. Groups of activities, such as the installation Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Fund, are
   not subject to this audit requirement even if its revenues or expenses exceed $7 million. However,
   individual entities in an MWR Fund (installation, MAJCOM, or Air Force) with annual revenues or
   expenses exceeding $7 million must have annual financial audits. Exceptions to these audit require-
   ments must be approved by the DODIG.
   5.1.2. Annual audits are also required for highly sensitive situations, such as potential fraud or large
   public exposure. Other audits, as deemed necessary by management and the NAF audit committee
   (paragraph 5.2.), are conducted based on assessed risk and resource availability.
   5.1.3. ANG NAF activities that are properly approved, operated in accordance with ANG regulations,
   and receive no appropriated fund support need not undergo an audit by federal entities or audits con-
   tracted by those entities.

5.2. NonappropriatedFund Audit Committee. Air Force will establish and maintain an audit commit-
tee made up of senior officials independent of NAF management to oversee audits of NAF activities. The
audit committee shall establish requirements for all NAF audits and base the requirements upon the appli-
cation of risk assessments. The Auditor General of the Air Force will serve as an advisor to the audit com-
mittee, but shall not be part of the committee.

5.3. Audit Coverage of Nonappropriated Fund Activities.
   5.3.1. Public Accountant Audits. Each year, NAFs are budgeted and approved for certified public
   accountant firms to audit Air Force NAF activities. The NAF audit committee shall establish require-
   ments and identify contract deliverables for the public accountant audits and assist in monitoring the
   conduct of financial statement audits. Certified public accountant audit responsibilities are listed in
   Attachment 3, Section A3B.
   5.3.2. AFAA Audits. In addition to the public accountant audits, the AFAA performs audits of NAF
   activities. Much like the Air Force Inspector General and other appropriated fund organizations,
   AFAA is considered “oversight” and the use of AFAA is authorized to provide audit support to NAF
   activities. Moreover, audit is a necessary component of oversight to ensure Air Force resources are
   properly and efficiently used to support NAF activities. Accordingly, AFAA “oversight” audits will be
   performed without NAF reimbursement. The AFAA:
       5.3.2.1. Does not have internally or externally established NAF limits of audit coverage. The
       AFAA schedules and performs NAF audits as deemed appropriate.
       5.3.2.2. Includes Air Force-wide system and functional reviews of NAF activities in the AFAA
       annual audit plan when appropriate.
       5.3.2.3. Includes installation-level audits of NAF activities in area audit office annual audit plans,
       based on audit priorities.
16                                     AFI65-301_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 27 MARCH 2007


        5.3.2.4. Notifies HQ AFSVA of planned audits on NAF activities to avoid duplicate audits.
        5.3.2.5. Provides copies of installation-level reports on NAF activities to the installation audit
        focal point, HQ AFSVA/SVFR, SAF/FMCEB, and the applicable MAJCOM audit focal point.
        5.3.2.6. Should be used for audits of NAF activities involving suspected fraud and other serious
        improprieties rather than public accountants.

5.4. Audits of Private Organizations. The Air Force does not provide appropriated funds, NAFs, or
personnel supported by these funds to audit private organizations such as museum foundations, thrift
shops, Air Force Aid Societies, scouting groups, spouses’ clubs, and auxiliaries on Air Force installations,
unless authorized by the SECAF. When indications of fraud or other improprieties exist, regardless of the
amount of revenues, the commander can request an AFAA audit to protect the Air Force's interest.

5.5. Processing Public Accountant Reports. The Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA) program
requires public accountants to issue a separate report for each audit.
     5.5.1. Reporting Level. The PACA program requires public accountants to prepare and distribute
     NAF activity reports based on the terms of the contract.
        5.5.1.1. When findings and recommendations are system-wide or procedural, public accountants
        consolidate installation-level audit results and issue a report to HQ AFSVA which will work with
        the appropriate oversight board or committee to correct any deficiencies.
        5.5.1.2. Public accountants should promptly report any findings that suggest irregular conduct or
        the possibility of fraud to the Air Force Services Agency, Contract Audit Management Office (HQ
        AFSVA/SVLA), and the installation’s servicing Air Force Office of Special Investigations
        (AFOSI) detachment.
     5.5.2. Management Comments. Commanders of audited activities prepare management comments
     for each finding and recommendation in the audit report and give them to the public accountant firm
     within 35 calendar days (50 days for overseas) from the date they receive the draft audit report.
     5.5.3. Evaluation of Management Comments. In the installation-level report, public accountants
     evaluate the responsiveness and adequacy of management comments for each finding and recommen-
     dation. They state whether the actions taken or planned respond to the recommendations and if any
     alternative management actions correct the reported deficiency. When public accountants evaluate
     management comments as nonresponsive, the accountant explains why management actions are inad-
     equate. These evaluations follow each management response in the final report.
     5.5.4. Report Distribution. The contract quality assurance evaluator normally receives and distrib-
     utes the public accountant report to the following:
        5.5.4.1. Installation commander.
        5.5.4.2. Local audit focal point.
        5.5.4.3. Manager of the activity audited.
        5.5.4.4. Servicing AFAA area audit office and AFOSI detachment.
        5.5.4.5. NAF Accounting Office.
        5.5.4.6. Base liaison between FM and SV (usually the NAF Financial Analyst).

   5.5.5. Command Review. MAJCOM Services staffs review public accountant reports, advise activ-
   ity commanders on preparing management comments, suggest or direct corrective actions where nec-
   essary, and monitor implementation of corrective actions. HQ AFSVA also periodically crossfeeds
   internal control weaknesses, findings, and recommendations that public accountants identify during
   audits to Services Commanders/Division Chiefs within the Air Force.
   5.5.6. Resolution of Nonconcurrences. SAF/FM works with HQ AFSVA and the appropriate over-
   sight board or committee to resolve disagreements with findings or recommendations in public
   accountant audit reports that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM level. If SAF/FM cannot resolve the dis-
   agreements, they follow policy in AFPD 65-4. The resolution period is 6 months from the date the
   public accountant issues the report.

5.6. Processing AFAA Audit Reports. AFAA addresses, processes, and distributes reports on NAF
activities according to the requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of this instruction. AFAA reports on NAF
activities receive management follow-up attention as specified in AFPD 65-4.

                                       PROGRESS REPORTS

If any recommendations remain open after the initial response, POC will monitor the status of each rec-
ommendation. Within 5 duty days of ECD on a given recommendation, POC submits a progress report
addressed to HQ ACC/FM through 366 CPTS/FM (copy to NWAAO), following the same procedure
identified in paragraph 3.2.3, stating either the OPEN item is recommended for closure or is it necessary
to extend estimated completion date (ECD). Progress report is signed by 366 FW/CV. A Staff Summary
Sheet is completed by 366 CPTS/FM for 366 FW/CV coordination. If an extension is requested, four
items of information must be submitted:
6.1. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) ROA paragraph number and recommendation number
6.2. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Original ECD
6.3. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Revised ECD
6.4. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Explanation of why ECD was revised
6.5. (Added-MOUNTAIN HOME) Upon receipt of progress reports, 366 CPTS/FM will forward a copy
to NWAAO, HQ ACC/FMFP, and a courtesy copy to unit being audited. Once progress reports have been
accumulated, a Financial Management Indicator (FMI) report will be prepared quarterly for HQ ACC/
FMFP. The report shows all recommendations tracked by CPTS/FM from the time the report is issued
until it is closed. It also shows any recommendations that have slipped six months from the original ECD,
therefore, it is important for unit’s to set ECDs that are attainable. FMIs emphasize ACC’s commitment to
ensure corrective actions are timely, and will maximize quality improvement from investment in over-
sight resources. 366 CPTS/FM is the audit focal point and will be the point of contact for FMI reports.
