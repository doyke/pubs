      The Inspector General Complaints Program is prescribed in AFI 90-301, Inspector General
Complaints. Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to promptly report fraud, waste, abuse
(FWA), or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice; abuse
of authority, inappropriate conduct, or misconduct (as defined by AFI 90-301); and a deficiency or like
condition, to an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an
established grievance channel. You have a right to file an IG complaint at any level, but experience has
shown that many complaints can be resolved through the chain of command. For this reason, although not
required to, you are encouraged to discuss your concerns with your chain of supervision and/or your
commander before coming to the IG.


                       Hotline Reporting Programs
     Anyone, whether military or civilian, may report suspected cases of fraud, waste, abuse, or
mismanagement through the chain of command, or to a hotline at AFRC, Air Staff, or DoD. Individuals
wishing to make a report of fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement may contact a hotline as noted below:
