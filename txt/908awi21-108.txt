SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision adds Commanders to be familiar with this instruction (paragraph 2.1.); deletes the
requirement for a debriefing for in landing status code 1, but emphasizes debriefings at the
termination of the last flight of the day and for all aborts/In-Flight Emergency (IFEs). (paragraph
2.3.1.); explains what the Supervisor of Flying (SOF), or 357 AS/DO will be responsible for
(paragraph 2.4.); discusses who is responsible for documentation of discrepancies and proper
fault codes (paragraph 2.5); explains that Flight/Shop supervisors will provide qualified
specialist(s) for debriefing when required (paragraph 2.6.); and directs Quality Assurance office
to assist in Functional Check Flight (FCF) debriefing (paragraph 2.7.); task the Command Post/
 2                                                        908AWI21-108 14 SEPTEMBER 2007


Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) to notify the ProSuper/Expediter of landing time, aircraft
status, and system requiring debriefing (paragraph 2.8.); it changes the Dispatch/Debrief Section
(DDS) from the ProSuper/Expediter (paragraph 3.3.); states what the Maintenance Operations
Center (MOC) will be responsible for (paragraph 3.5.); to include debrief discrepancies. (3.5.1.).
1. General: Aircraft maintenance debriefing is essential to ensure malfunctions are identified
and aircraft status is properly documented. Debriefing is a review of applicable AFTO (Air Force
Technical Order) Forms 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and documentation
of discrepancies on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and
Air Mobility Command (AMC) Form 278, Debriefing Form. Maintenance debriefing is done
immediately upon arrival at the debriefing area and prior to mission debriefing.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Commanders, Maintenance Group Superintendents, Flight Chiefs, and Section Chiefs
     are responsible for compliance with this instruction and responsible to ensure all personnel
     are thoroughly familiar with AFI 21-101_AFRC_I, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
     Management and AFI 11-2c-130v3, C-130 Operations Procedures, and all the procedures in
     this instruction are adhered to. Immediately upon landing a face-to-face debriefing of the
     aircrew will take place at the debriefing location.
     2.2. Plans and Scheduling or Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will verify mission
     data and input flying time into the GO81, Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) for
     Mobility System.
     2.3. The Debriefer (MOC is the primary when available, the Pro Super/Expediter or
     designated personnel) will:
        2.3.1. Ensure debriefing is conducted at the termination of each sortie/mission or when a
        sortie/mission is aborted. Aircraft scheduled for turn-around sorties/missions need not be
        debriefed if returned in landing status code 1 or 2. However, debriefing is required,
        regardless of landing status, after the last flight of the day for each aircrew. The Crew
        Chief recovering the aircraft will perform debrief responsibilties for flights that land after
        normal duty hours, i.e. night missions.
        2.3.2. Ensures personnel are available to conduct debriefing.
        2.3.3. Review debriefs and aircraft forms to ensure required information is complete and
        accurate to include GO81 Geographical Location (GEOLOC) code for possessed aircraft.
        2.3.4. Ensure mission essential discrepancies are identified and coordinate with the Pro
        Super/Expediter to determine aircraft status based on debrief information.
     2.4. Supervisor of Flying (SOF), or 357 AS/DO will:
        2.4.1. Ensure the aircraft commander or flight engineer and required aircrew members
        take part in every debriefing session.
        2.4.2. DELETED.

      2.5.1. (Added) Contact Hanks Ops 20 minutes prior to landing and relay ALPHA
      STATUS, FUEL, LOX, and a SHORT DESCRIPTION of any DISCREPANCIES so that
      appropriate personnel will be available for debriefing (during normal duty hours).
      2.5.2. (Added) Attend the debriefing or send an aircrew member that is knowledgeable
      of the current aircraft condition and discrepancy.
      2.5.3. (Added) Ensure all data is entered on AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
      Flight Data Document, 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and 781H
      Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance.
          2.5.3.1. (Added) Ensure a copy of the 781 Flight Data is given to the debriefer or
          faxed to PS&D at 953-1917 and MOC at 953-7432.
      2.5.4. (Added) Ensure discrepancies entered on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
      Discrepancy and Work Document, are identified as Mission Contributing (MC) or
      Mission Essential (ME). The Debriefer will assist the aircrew in entering the proper fault
      codes when documenting discrepancies.
      2.5.5. (Added) If maintenance personnel are not available, aircrew personnel will enter
      discrepancies in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document
      as stated in para. 2.5.3. and 2.5.4.. The assigned crew chief will transcribe this
      information onto the AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form at the start of the next duty day.
   2.6. Flight/Shop supervisors will provide qualified specialist(s) for debriefing when required.
   2.7. Quality Assurance will assist in Functional Check Flight (FCF) debriefing to ensure all
   FCF requirements are completed and documented.
   2.8. Command Post/MOC will notify the ProSuper/Expediter of landing time, aircraft status,
   and system requiring debriefing.
   2.9. (Added) ProSuper/Expediter, or Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will notify
   specialists required for debriefing.
3. Procedures:
   3.1. At home station and at deployed location (2 days or more), aircraft will be debriefed at
   the end of the flying day. The AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form may be used to record
   discrepancies for multiple sorties on the same day. In the event multiple discrepancies are
   annotated on the same AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form, each Job Control Number needs to
   have Sortie of the day/leg and base identifier recorded in the remarks section. For
   discrepancies completed between flights, the crew chief will write “Corrected” after the
   discrepancy on the AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form.
      3.1.1. On cross-country missions the crew chief will ensure that a completed AMC Form
      278 Debriefing Form is left with the aircraft forms upon return to home station. For
      discrepancies that are completed while the aircraft is cross-country, the aircrew
      member/crew chief will write “Corrected” after the discrepancy on the AMC Form 278
      Debriefing Form, enter the date discovered and corrected and the station code where the
      discrepancy was corrected.
   3.2. At home station, debrief will be accomplished, at the primary location, in building 1016
   or as identified in the 908 AW weekly flying schedule. Flights with no discrepancies may be
4                                                      908AWI21-108 14 SEPTEMBER 2007


    debriefed at the aircraft or in the Expediter truck. At deployed locations, debrief locations
    will be established in accordance with local procedures.
    3.3. The Debriefer (MOC is the primary when available, ProSuper/Expediter or designated
    personnel) will:
       3.3.1. Debrief aircraft commander and other aircrew personnel who are knowledgeable
       of aircraft conditions.
       3.3.2. Ensure AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form, applicable technical data, and required
       specialists are available.
       3.3.3. Coordinate with aircrew to ensure proper entries in the AFTO Form 781s to
       include completed discrepancies, identification of mission essential discrepancies, and
       corrective actions for in-flight operational checks.
           3.3.3.1. (Added) When debriefing an abort, dropped object, inflight emergency
           (IFE), flight control and/or engine malfunctions refer to 908 MOC debriefing
           checklist for determination and course of action.
       3.3.4. Coordinate with the Pro Super/Expediter to determine aircraft status based on
       debrief information.
       3.3.5. Review AMC Form 278 Debriefing Form for the previous three flights and
       identify repeat/recurring discrepancies by checking the appropriate block in RED. If the
       discrepancy is identified as a repeat or recurring, enter the word “REPEAT” or
       “RECURRING” in red in the discrepancy block of the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
       Discrepancy and Work Document.
       3.3.6. At the end of the flying day, compute flying time annotated on AFTO Form 781H,
       Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, transfer data to AFTO Form 781J,
       Aircraft and Engine Operating Time, Cycle and Oil Added (Half Pints, Pints, Quarts)
       ensuring total time on AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and
       Maintenance and AFTO Form 781J, Aircraft and Engine Operating Time, Cycle and Oil
       Added (Half Pints, Pints, Quarts) are identical.
    3.4. The ProSuper/Expediter will:
       3.4.1. Review forms for accuracy and completeness.
    3.5. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will:
       3.5.1. Enter debrief discrepancies with the GEOLOC code into GO81 MIS. The
       expediter will inform MOC of what symbol to assign each job. The ProSuper makes final
       determination of aircraft status and what code to assign discrepancies if there is
       uncertainty or disagreement.
       3.5.2. (Added) Enter aircraft discrepancies using the GEOLOC code and close out
       discrepancies for aircraft broken off station where no GO81 MIS capability exists. MOC
       will input discrepancies in GO81 MIS and close them out when the aircraft returns to
       mission capable status.
    3.6. (Added) Plans and Scheduling will:
908AWI21-108 14 SEPTEMBER 2007                                                     5


     3.6.1. (Added) Verify mission data, correct AFTO Form 781 as required, and enter
     information in the automated maintenance data system.
