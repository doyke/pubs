This pamphlet implements Air Force Instruction 38-101, Air Force Organization. The pamphlet
addresses skip echelon support provided to Air Combat Command (ACC) active-duty units
during peacetime operations. IAW AFI 38-101, numbered/named air forces (NAFs), groups, and
flights have no or minimal staff. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational
effectiveness rather than review and transmit paperwork. This pamphlet does not apply to the
Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Command units or personnel. This publication may
not be supplemented or further implemented/extended. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates office symbols and squadron names. It also identifies staff agency support
at the NAF and/or MAJCOM level.

                                          Chapter 1

                                     INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview: This pamphlet addresses skip echelon support provided to Air Combat
Command (ACC) active-duty wings and units during peacetime operations. It provides general
guidance only, is not a directive, and is not intended to encompass all possible circumstances.
Component NAFs (C-NAFs) possess a broader staff to support some additional functions.
1.2. Purpose: IAW AFI 38-101, paragraph 1.2.4, “Major Commands (MAJCOMs) sit on top of
a skip-echelon staffing structure. MAJCOMs, wings and squadrons possess the full range of staff
functions needed to perform required tasks. Numbered/named air forces (NAFs) groups, and
flights have no or minimal staff. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational
effectiveness rather than review and transmit paperwork. The chain of command and
responsibility for mission accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels. Problems,
however, often are solved by staff communication through the functional chain, bypassing
echelons where the function is not found.” (NOTE: Component NAFs (C-NAFs) possess a
broader staff to support the Air Force component commander at the operational and tactical
level. When designated as the Air Force component to a Combatant Commander (CCDR), the
C-NAF functions at the operational level.).
1.3. Applicability: During peacetime, ACC active-duty wings and units obtain support for the
majority of functions and activities directly from HQ ACC. There are exceptions where wing
functions, such as: safety and judge advocate issues where the NAF/USAFWC Commander is
the general courts-martial convening authority, and some personnel activities specified in this
pamphlet. These peacetime functions should not be associated with NAF functions that exist to
support the NAF Commander in his/her role as a CCDR and are limited to USAF operations in
CCDR area of responsibility (AOR). As a result, a wing will not interface with these functions
unless the wing has assets deployed to the respective CCDRs. The following describes, by
function and organizational entity, a representative assessment of where issues and actions
should be addressed for resolution, i.e., the NAF or MAJCOM. It is not intended to be all
inclusive, nor should it preclude keeping the appropriate chain of command informed of
activities/actions ongoing at the wing level.

      issue. The wing IG refers cases involving reprisal or mental health allegations to the
      NAF IG for technical and legal review. The NAF IG then forwards the case to HQ
      ACC/IGQ. Cases initiated at the wing level involving senior officials (O-6 select or
