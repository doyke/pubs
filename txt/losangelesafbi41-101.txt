        specific details (Building #_____ Floor #_____ Room #_____ and/or other landmarks
        to identify victim location).
        1.4.2.4. Provide a good ―call back‖ telephone number.
  1.5. Non-medical base personnel trained in Self Aid Buddy Care may provide care within
  the scope of their training until EMS arrives.

Automated External Defibrillator— is a portable electronic device that automatically
diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular defibrillation and
ventricular tachycardia in a patient, and is able to treat them through defibrillation.
Defibrillation— the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the
heart to reestablish an effective rhythm.

Public Access Defibrillation— the deployment of automatic external defibrillators in public
facilities for the use by laypersons to provide early intervention to victims of cardiac arrest.
