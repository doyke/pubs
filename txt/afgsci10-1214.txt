                                 Chapter 1
                  GENERAL PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Missile Alert Facility Food Service Management Program. The primary mission of the
missile alert facility (MAF) Food Service program is to provide trained personnel to perform
chef tasks. The MAF chef will assist the Facility Manager (FM) with emergency response
procedures and provide buddy care. Additional duties and other taskings that do not directly
support the mission should be kept to a minimum to avoid interfering with the successful
accomplishment of that mission.

1.2. MAF Food Service Management Staff. Staff personnel must remain knowledgeable of the
tasks and activities being performed to effectively manage resources. Personnel in leadership
positions will use monthly MAF visits as a management device to ensure the quality and
effectiveness of the operations tasks being performed. These visits should stress safety, security,
technical data usage, and ensure compliance with MAF directives.

1.3. Resource Utilization. Assigned personnel and resources must be effectively utilized to
maximize mission accomplishment. The following limitations may be waived by the Operations
Group commander (OG/CC) when operational requirements dictate.

1.3.1. Alert days per month should not exceed a total of 16 alert/travel days Squadron CCs will
designate in writing to the OG/CC, through the OG Group Chef Superintendent, Chefs available
for duty who perform less than twelve alert/travel days per month with the following exceptions:
OGV Evaluator, OSS Trainer, Squadron Chef NCOICs and Missile Alert Facility Feeding
Operation (MAFFO) (accounting and storeroom personnel).

1.3.2. Reduced MAF alert tours, leaves, TDYs, additional duties, etc., must be closely monitored
to ensure equitable alert load distribution.

1.3.3. MAF Chef activities should be limited to permit at least eight hours rest during each 24-
hour alert period. This does not preclude response to abnormal indications requiring immediate
response or preparing food for maintenance teams.

1.3.4. In order to equalize workloads, MAF Chefs can be utilized at any MAF. Develop
schedules which best use MAF Chef resources.

1.3.5. MAF Chefs earn the minimum of 50 percent of their alert-related time as a rest period
following a MAF alert.

1.4. Clarification and Guidance. Units requiring clarification or guidance on MAF Chef
activities may request this information by letter or message.

1.4.1. Send requests to HQ AFGSC/A3IA through 20 AF/A3NF, with information copies to HQ
AFGSC/A1S.

requesting unit, with information copies sent to HQ AFGSC/A1S, HQ AFGSC/IGISR,
20 AF/A3NF, and the other missile units.

1.5. Waiver Authority. HQ AFGSC/A3IA is the waiver authority for this instruction unless
specifically stated otherwise. Waivers will be granted on an individual and controlled basis.
Waiver authority may not be delegated. The intent of waivers is to temporarily obtain
authorization for an existing condition. Permanent solutions must be implemented as soon as
practical.

1.5.1. Submit fully justified waiver request, through each intermediate level of command, to
HQ AFGSC/A3IA.

1.5.1.1. Describe the specific requirement and state the reason a waiver is required.

1.5.1.2. Indicate when the waiver will no longer be required.

1.5.2. Intermediate command levels will recommend approval or disapproval.

1.5.3. After staffing a response, HQ AFGSC/A3IA will answer the request via official
correspondence to the requesting unit, with information copies sent to HQ AFGSC/A1S,
20 AF/A3NF and the other missile units.

1.6. Recognition and Awards

1.6.1. 20 AFI 36-1, Twentieth Air Force Functional and Professional Awards Program will be
used for submission of 20 AF awards for all assigned 3M0X1s.

1.6.2. Operations Group can submit one 3M0X1 per HQ AFGSC/A1S and HQ USAF/SV
awards. Air Force guidance is to select only one winner per base.

1.7. Meal Hours. Hours should be set to allow enough time for personnel to get their meals;
however, care must be taken to ensure chefs aren't over tasked by extended meal hours. The chef
should obtain meal orders at least one hour prior to the start of the meal period to allow time for
preparation. Meal times will be standardized throughout the Operations Group. MAF meal hours
are listed in Table 1.1.

Figure A3.1. SLP Format

Lesson plans will be available for reference in the training area for all technical STS/JQS tasks
taught. Lesson plans will be standardized throughout missile facility management in accordance
with this attachment and the guidance set forth by AFI 36-Series.

PART I

This information will assist the instructor in preparing for the lesson and provide supervisors
with a tool to see at a glance how a task is taught.

I. LESSON TITLE. Title of training and STS/JQS number(s). This will ensure all technical tasks
are covered by a lesson plan.

II. REFERENCES: List all sources of information used in lesson development (instructions, tech
data, equipment manuals etc.). Utilize the STS/JQS technical references (TR) when developing a
lesson plan. This is where information for the lesson development originates, not what is
required to do the task. This listing ensures changes affecting references are identified and all
affected lesson plans are updated.

III. INSTRUCTIONAL AIDS/EQUIPMENT. List all materials (including written materials)
required during the course of instruction.

IV. AVERAGE TIME OF PRESENTATION. Approximate length of lesson. This will help plan
the master schedule.



PART II – PRESENTATION

I. INTRODUCTION. The introduction consists of the attention/motivation and the overview.
This is presented to ensure students understand why the lesson is important and provides a
synopsis of how the less will flow.

EXAMPLE

I. INTRODUCTION:

A. ATTENTION/MOTIVATION: ______________________________________________

B. OVERVIEW: _____________________________________________________________

DEVELOPMENT: This is the meat of your lesson. The development will sequence you through
AFGSCI 10-1214 1 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  31


the task and provide valuable information to enhance the lesson. Remember, the lesson plan does
not replace tech data, but provides the instructor with systems knowledge, the “how’s and
why’s” of the lesson. The two-column format of the development section of the lesson plan is
optional.

II. DEVELOPMENT                                     INSTRUCTOR NOTES

Each lesson objective is written here followed      This section is for instructor use; write
by the support material. Lesson containing          anything in this section that will aid in the
more than one objective, then list just the first   instruction of the lesson. Some examples are:
one at this point.                                  -- Lesson plan errors as they are found
                                                    -- Instructional aids, handouts, computer
LESSON OBJECTIVE: A precise statement               presentation (power point file name)
that the question “what must the student            -- New thought provoking questions
accomplish to demonstrate the lesson was            -- New experience
understood?” Objective must state the:              -- Scenarios to use
                                                    -- Questions and answers labeled for quick
CONDITIONS: What will the students be               reference. When the lesson plan is reviewed,
given to perform the task?                          this
                                                    information should be moved to the
PERFORMANCE: What must the student                  development section (left side) of the lesson
accomplish (this should include a statement         plan. This allows space for new information.
indicating how the student will demonstrate
his/her understanding of the lesson)?

STANDARD: What accuracy is required for successful completion of the lesson?

A. Use a combination of outline and paragraph format.

B. If more than one tech order or section of the tech order is being used you should include the
TO number or section number to ensure a smoother more professional presentation of the lesson.
C. In a demonstration/performance lesson indicate where you demonstrate and where you want
the students to perform. This will ensure each objective is complete before starting the next
objective or the conclusion.

D. If the lesson contains more than one objective you should summarize after each objective.
The interim summary may be included in the development to ensure compliance.

E. Each new objective should start on a new page. This is to provide clarity. You may only want
to teach a portion of this lesson during this training session.

F. Area to consider when writing a lesson plan.

1. Questions and answers that may be included.

2. Common problem areas associated with the task.

3. Why a step or group of steps are important.

4. Grouping of or doing mechanical steps out of sequence and why.

5. Personal experience that may emphasize the importance of a step or group of steps.

EXAMPLE: Step A of the tech data reads; “turn compressor control switch to the off position”

IMPROPER: Turn switch off (this is considered rewriting tech data).

PROPER: Perform step A

a. If data plate is missing, off is counterclockwise.

b. Knob may be stripped, if it is, call in work order to CE.

c. Wait for the compressor belt to come to a complete stop before proceeding. This is the type of
information that would enhance the tech data and is of value to the instructor and student.

III. CONCLUSION: The conclusion consists of the summary, remotivation, and the closure. This
part of the lesson is presented to reinforce the highlights of the lesson, the reason a student
should remember the lesson and that the lesson is complete for the day.
