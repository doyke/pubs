This volume provides information and guidance for the execution of civil engineer contingency response
activities. It describes procedures for a rapid transition from routine, day-to-day operations to an emer-
gency response posture. Using the disaster and attack planning and preparation procedures of Volumes 1
and 2 as its basis, this volume gives definitions; describes duties; lists organization, equipment, and mate-
rials; and tells how work is accomplished to ensure recovery and continued operation of the installation
during and after a crisis. This publication applies to all Air Force active, Air National Guard (ANG), and
Air Force Reserve Command Civil Engineer units. This pamphlet supports Air Force Instruction (AFI)
10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contin-
gency Response Planning, and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning
and Operation. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include a
new publication title, the removal of detailed procedures for expedient utility and facility repair; siting
and installing airfield lighting and mobile aircraft arresting systems; airfield damage repair; and base
denial concepts and methods. Instead, only general information will be discussed concerning these topics.
Detailed procedures relating to these subjects are available in other volumes in this publication series as
well as the Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 series. ertified Current, 7 July 2011

                                               Chapter 1
                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. General Information. The unpredictable nature of war and disasters requires a great degree of flex-
ibility by the civil engineer (CE) force during disaster and attack recovery operations. CE units must
maintain contingency response capabilities to restore operations, save lives, mitigate human suffering,
and minimize damage during and after a crisis on or near the installation. The CE contingency response
plan (CRP) should be followed to ensure a coordinated response; however, no plan covers all possible
scenarios. Therefore, all elements of the civil engineer team must have the ability to quickly adjust to
changing circumstances. Engineering knowledge, experience, and common sense are crucial factors to
installation recovery. Immediately after a disaster or attack, civil engineers operate in the reactionary
mode to immediately eliminate life-threatening hazards. In later phases of the recovery, the engineer force
begins a more deliberate effort. The environment may still be chaotic and there are still many immediate
actions that must be taken, but the overwhelming dangers that prevailed during the emergency are past.
The effort to identify and quantify the damage, assign repair priorities, and determine recovery strategy
now begins. Volumes 1 and 2 of this pamphlet series discuss preparedness planning and steps to take prior
to experiencing a natural/manmade disaster or installation attack. This volume, coupled with Volume 4,
Airfield Damage Repair Operations, provide CE procedures that form the basis for an effective installa-
tion recovery capability.

1.2. Overview. CE must ensure the installation has a rapid response capability to continue or immedi-
ately regenerate essential air base functions after a disaster or attack by clearly identifying recovery tasks
in the CE contingency response plan. Instructions must describe the tasks in terms of what, who, where,
how, when, and in what priority. This volume addresses specific tasks as they relate to requirements in the
following areas:
     1.2.1. Command and control aspects of installation recovery (including organization and emergency
     communication procedures).
     1.2.2. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) contamination monitoring and con-
     trol.
     1.2.3. Defense against chemical agents.
     1.2.4. Fire emergency services.
     1.2.5. Damage and hazard assessment operations.
     1.2.6. Unexploded explosive ordnance operations.
     1.2.7. Emergency utility and facility repair.

2.1. Introduction. In chaotic situations such as the aftermath of a disaster or an attack, effective com-
mand and control (C2) are crucial for successful installation recovery. Capable C2 relies on an efficient
installation recovery organization and communications structure to manage and respond to contingencies
(Figure 2.1.). While some confusion is usually present during most crises, proper organization and com-
munications during emergencies limit confusion by clearly defining the chain of command and lines of
communication.

Figure 2.1. Capable C2 Improves Installation Response to All Contingencies.




2.2. Overview. This chapter briefly examines C2 organization and communications concepts as they
relate to installation recovery after a natural or manmade disaster, major accident, or attack. Initially, the
specific organizational structure used during installation recovery activities will be examined, including
the role of control centers and specialized teams. Then, a discussion on incident response communications
and how they are essential for passing information up and down the chain of command in response to a
changing installation recovery situation or strategy follows. To be efficient, the communications system
must be reliable and communications procedures must be simple, clear-cut, and understood by all person-
nel involved.

2.3. Organization. Clearly, command and responsibility begin at the top echelons of an organization;
however they permeate down to the youngest professional Airman—which is one reason why command
leadership in a crisis often rely less on control and more on decentralized responsibilities. Decentralized
responsibilities permit independent action and initiative to deal with contingency situations that demand

an immediate response. At the installation level, the Disaster Response Force (DRF) is the organizational
structure for installation response in an emergency. The DRF structure is set up according to AFI 10-2501,
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations; and is established to miti-
gate the effects of major accidents; natural disasters; enemy attacks; and terrorist use of CBRN materials
on Air Force personnel, resources, and operations. Figure 2.2. represents a typical DRF organizational
structure. The DRF includes the Installation Control Center (ICC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), Emergency
Communications Center (ECC), Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Incident Commander, First/Emer-
gency Responders, Unit Control Centers (UCC), Emergency Support Functions (ESF), and the Base
Defense Operations Center (BDOC).

Figure 2.2. Typical Installation Recovery Command and Control Organization.




     2.3.1. Installation Control Center (ICC). The top echelon of the installation DRF organization is
     the ICC. The ICC directs strategic actions supporting the installation's mission. The installation com-
     mand and control or C2 node (Figure 2.3.) is part of the ICC and provides essential communications
     links with installation, higher headquarters, and civilian agencies. As the focal point for installa-
     tion-wide warning and notification and operation, the ICC communicates directions and information
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                13


   and recommends courses of action concerning the incident. The ICC controls the CAT, EOC, and
   UCCs. The Installation Commander serves as the senior leader of the ICC.

Figure 2.3. Installation C2 Node Provides Essential Support to ICC.




   2.3.2. Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT is a limited staff formed when the crisis resolution does
   not require formation of the entire ICC. It is activated for a specific incident to command, control, and
   coordinate the required support. The size and composition of the CAT is scalable to support the Instal-
   lation Commander’s requirements. It usually requires a team chief and functional experts to respond
   to a specific situation.
   2.3.3. Emergency Communications Center (ECC). The ECC includes a central dispatch capability
   or its interim equivalent for the installation. It should include the minimum functions of Fire Alarm
   Communications Center (FACC), Security Forces (SF) desk, and Medical dispatch (when applicable).
   The ECC may be virtual until a central dispatch facility can be established. The central dispatch capa-
   bility is a goal that installations must work towards while using current assets. The interim virtu-
   ally-consolidated configurations are considered to be in compliance with this guidance until the
   central dispatch capability can be achieved. Existing resources should be used as backup capabilities
   once physical consolidation occurs.
   2.3.4. Emergency Operations Center. The EOC is the C2 support element that directs, monitors,
   and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident. The EOC is activated and
   recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander. The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident
   status and seeks support through the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inher-
   ent and cumulative (acquired through Mutual Aid Agreements) capability. The EOC may also support
   the Multiagency Coordination System (MCS) and joint information activities. The following para-
   graphs highlight other aspects of EOC organization and operations.
      2.3.4.1. Recovery Activities. The EOC determines the scope of the damage and its impact on the
      installation mission. The EOC accounts for personnel and casualties and monitors material
      resources. It develops a recovery strategy, directs recovery actions, and tracks recovery progress.

      2.3.4.2. Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). The Emergency Support Functions (ESF) capa-
      bilities are grouped into an organizational structure of the EOC that provides support, resources,
      program implementation, and services that are most likely to be needed during an incident (see
      Table 2.1.). Installation ESFs serve as the primary operational-level mechanism. Personnel
      assigned to direct ESFs must be highly knowledgeable with decision-making authority for their
      function. Refer to AFI 10-2501 for ESFs’ scope, offices of primary responsibility (OPR), and
      offices of collateral responsibility (OCR).

      2.3.4.3. EOC Director. The EOC Director is the Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander or
      other senior representative designated by the Installation Commander. The EOC Director provides
      oversight for the Installation Commander to support and control emergency response to incidents.
      The EOC Director can support multiple ICs simultaneously, while providing senior officer-level
      C2 for sustained response and recovery operations.
      2.3.4.4. Senior Engineer Personnel. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) is usually the senior engi-
      neer member of the EOC and may also hold a core position on the ICC staff. The BCE is the com-
      mand and control link between the EOC and the Damage Control Center (DCC). From the EOC,
      the BCE directs the dispatch of damage assessment teams; receives, reviews and evaluates dam-
      age assessment reports; and assists the commander in developing and implementing the installa-
      tion recovery strategy. This level of activity will demand that the BCE be totally conversant with
      civil engineer contingency and wartime operational concepts. He or she must be knowledgeable of
      Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) procedures and sequencing, damage assessment and response
      procedures, capabilities and limitations of all recovery teams, firefighting operational concepts,
      and installation recovery plans and priorities. Without a solid background in these areas, decisions
      become more difficult and more prone to error. In turn, command and control suffers and the
      effectiveness of the unit deteriorates. Such knowledge and information must be gained during
      peacetime. Due to its complexity and scope, it cannot be assimilated well under conflict condi-
      tions. But more importantly, because of its criticality to the success of the installation mission, it
      cannot be left to chance.
      2.3.4.5. Readiness and Emergency Management Personnel. The Readiness and Emergency
      Management Officer or Superintendent is appointed as the EOC Manager by the installation com-
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              15


      mander in accordance with AFI 10-2501. The EOC Manager, through Emergency Support Func-
      tion (ESF) 5 and the CBRNE Control Center, monitors the status of CBRN survey teams, controls
      their dispatch, and ensures areas of CBRN contamination and locations of survey teams are plot-
      ted on the EOC map. He or she advises EOC personnel and installation commanders on major
      accident, natural disaster, CBRNE and conventional warfare effects, alarm status, protective mea-
      sures and predicts the effects of CBRN contamination on mission capability. Like the BCE, the
      EOC Manager must be thoroughly knowledgeable in the necessary peacetime and wartime tasks
      and responsibilities. These include, as a minimum, all major facets of major accident, natural
      disaster, CBRN defense, and EOC operations.
      2.3.4.6. Essential Data Requirements. The items in Table 2.2. are fundamental to the EOC exe-
      cuting command and control.

   2.3.5. Unit Control Center (UCC). Effective recovery operations rely on a system of interconnected
   control centers, each having separate and distinct responsibilities yet, at the same time, working
   together toward a common end position—restoration of the installation’s mission capability. UCCs
   provide mission support to the Incident Commander as directed by the EOC and to the Installation
   Commander as directed by the ICC. The EOC and ICC resolve any conflicting requirements. UCCs
   provide a focal point within an organization to maintain unit C2, relay information to and from unit
   personnel, provide expertise to the EOC or Incident Commander, and leverage unit resources to
16                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


     respond to and mitigate the incident. Unit commanders will consider assigning highly knowledgeable
     personnel to the EOC and the UCC to facilitate mission accomplishment.
     2.3.6. First Responders. First Responders, as defined by Air Force Incident Management System
     (AFIMS), are members of the DRF elements that deploy immediately to the disaster scene to provide
     initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement and secu-
     rity personnel, and key emergency medical personnel provide the immediate response to major acci-
     dents, natural disasters, and CBRNE incidents (Figure 2.4.). All First Responders are Emergency
     Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First Responder duties have pri-
     ority over other assigned duties.
     2.3.7. Emergency Responders. Emergency Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of DRF
     response elements that deploy after the First Responders to expand C2 and provide additional support.
     Emergency Responders include follow-on firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security person-
     nel, and emergency medical technicians, as well as EM and operations personnel, explosive ordnance
     disposal (EOD) personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facil-
     ities, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineers, mortuary affairs personnel, and other spe-
     cialized team members. Emergency Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties.
     Emergency Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with
     their emergency duties.

Figure 2.4. First Responders Provide Immediate Reaction During An Emergency.




     2.3.8. Incident Commander (IC). The Incident Commander (IC) is a trained and experienced
     responder who provides on-scene tactical control using subject matter experts (SME) and support
     from other functions (Figure 2.5.). The first IC on-scene is normally an SME from the Fire, Medical,
     or SF response element. He or she will establish initial command and control, then relinquish the IC
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              17


   role to the appropriate functional when properly relieved. Personnel designated as ICs must have com-
   pleted Incident Command System (ICS) training IAW AFI 10-2501 and meet Department of Defense
   (DOD) and Federal certification standards for the specific type of incident. For example, the IC must
   meet Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services Pro-
   gram, and Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services Cer-
   tification Program, requirements for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) and suspected CBRNE
   responses. Fire Emergency Services (FES) personnel serve as IC for EOD incidents during peacetime
   and terrorist response incidents after SF personnel have contained or neutralized any hostile forces.
   The following sections and function are aligned under the IC and operate under his or her guidance:
      2.3.8.1. Operations Section. The Operations Section is responsible for managing all tactical
      operations at an incident and for all activities focused on reducing the immediate hazard, saving
      lives and property, establishing situational control, and restoring normal operations. The buildup
      of the Operations Section is generally dictated by the number of tactical resources involved and
      span of control considerations. The Operations Section may be the first section to be established.
      In other situations, the IC may establish Logistics, Planning, and even the Finance and Adminis-
      tration functions before designating an Operations Section. The Operations Section includes three
      units: Ground-based Tactical Resources; Aviation or Air Resources, such as helicopters and
      fixed-wing aircraft; and Staging Areas.

Figure 2.5. Broad Range of SMEs Is Available to the IC.




      2.3.8.2. Planning Section. The Planning Section collects, evaluates and disseminates informa-
      tion and intelligence to the IC and staff, prepares status reports, displays situation information,
      maintains resource status, and develops and documents the Incident Action Plan (IAP). Informa-
      tion and intelligence functions are located in the Planning Section unless the IC needs to assign
      these functions elsewhere due to exceptional situation circumstances. The Planning Section devel-
      ops and documents the IAP, which includes overall incident objectives and strategies established
      by the IC. The IAP addresses tactical objectives and support activities required for one operational
      period, generally 12 to 24 hours. The IAP also provides continuous incorporation of “lessons
      learned” as the incident progresses. Four units within the Planning Section can be activated as nec-
      essary: Resources, Situation, Documentation, and Demobilization. The Planning Section Chief
18                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


        determines the need for each unit. If a unit is not activated, that unit’s duties remain with the Plan-
        ning Section Chief.
        2.3.8.3. Logistics Section. The Logistics Section manages support requirements, including
        ordering resources from off-incident locations. It provides facilities, transportation, supplies,
        equipment maintenance and fuel, food services, communications and information technology sup-
        port, and emergency responder medical services, including inoculations. The basic Logistics Sec-
        tion includes the Supply, Food, Ground Support, Communications, Facilities, and Medical Units.
        The Logistics Section is managed by the section chief with a deputy assigned when needed for
        span of control reasons. For large incidents, the Logistics Section may be divided into the Service
        and Support branches, each led by a branch director who reports to the section chief.
        2.3.8.4. Finance and Administration Section. The Finance and Administration section man-
        ages incident financial aspects when financial, reimbursement, or administrative services are
        needed to support incident management. Not all incidents will require such assistance. When a
        Finance and Administration Section is established, four units may be filled by technical special-
        ists: Time, Procurement, Compensation/Claims, and Cost.
        2.3.8.5. Information and Intelligence Function. The Information and Intelligence Function
        analyzes and shares information and intelligence with personnel whom the IC designates. In this
        context, intelligence includes national security and other classified information, operational infor-
        mation, risk assessments, medical intelligence, weather information, geospatial data, structural
        designs, toxic contaminant levels, and utilities and public works data from various sources.
     2.3.9. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Control
     Center. The CBRNE Control Center is managed under ESF 5, Emergency Management. The control
     center is subordinate to the EOC Director and serves as an advisory element to the EOC and the Instal-
     lation Commander. The control center directs CBRN reconnaissance activities to shape the hazards
     and advises the commander on hazards, countermeasures, and protective actions. The CBRNE Con-
     trol Center plots and maintains CBRN hazards status on the installation, in off-base areas of opera-
     tional concern, and at potential recovery installations. The CBRNE Control Center also conducts
     CBRN and release other than attack (ROTA) plotting and reporting activities IAW NATO Standard-
     ization Agreement (STANAG) 2103, Allied Tactical Publication (ATP) 45, NATO Reporting Nuclear
     Detonations, Biological and Chemical Attacks and Predicting and Warning of Associated Hazards
     and Hazard Areas, or MAJCOM guidance. These activities facilitate force survivability and mission
     continuation for forces on and off the installation, both in the hazard area and in the downwind hazard
     area. The CBRNE Control Center manages the readiness support team (RST), shelter management
     teams (SMT), contamination control area (CCA) and contamination control team (CCT) operations
     and supports installation warning/reporting and operations with United States, joint service, coalition
     and host nation forces. CBRNE Control Center personnel coordinate with medical, bioenvironmental,
     and intelligence representatives to provide advice to the commander. The control center may include
     host nation CBRN defense specialists and may provide reciprocal manning at the host nation control
     center.
     2.3.10. Damage Control Center (DCC). Civil engineer strategies and priorities are determined in
     the EOC; however, most of the actual engineer functions are controlled by the DCC. The DCC is man-
     aged by the chief of operations and predominantly staffed by senior enlisted personnel from the vari-
     ous elements of the operations flight. Operations personnel (Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
     3E6X1) are usually part of the staff acting as damage plotters, status keepers, schedulers, resource
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                19


  allocators, and coordinators. Additionally, if the FES alarm center is not in a splinter- protected facil-
  ity, it may be located in the DCC.
     2.3.10.1. Functions. From a civil engineer point of view, the responsibilities of the DCC are sim-
     ilar to those of the EOC. The difference lies in the level of responsibility. The DCC is one of many
     functional control centers activated to deal with contingencies. Its responsibilities as a functional
     control center are to recall and account for personnel, receive and disseminate information, report
     damage and casualty information, and deploy and monitor response teams. Specifically, the DCC
     monitors and coordinates the civil engineer recovery actions involved in damage assessment,
     decontamination, and damage recovery and repair as directed by the EOC. The staff can also
     include civilian personnel in a natural disaster response. If available during wartime, civilian per-
     sonnel can also be used; however, workaround plans must exist that take into account the possibil-
     ity of non-availability of these civilian employees.
     2.3.10.2. Personnel Accountability. It is doubtful that the full complement of civil engineer per-
     sonnel will be available in the aftermath of any major disaster. Individuals will be on leave, TDY,
     hospitalized, or unable to reach the installation. The recovery effort cannot wait until these persons
     return; it will have to proceed with available manpower. For this reason, an accurate accounting of
     personnel present for duty is essential so civil engineer management can make assignments to
     vital installation recovery functions. Several options to account for personnel during a contin-
     gency exist. Personnel may be instructed to report to a central assembly point to sign in or to report
     to their work section and sign in. Regardless of the method employed, assembly instructions
     should be in complete detail, including who reports where, when, to whom, and with what equip-
     ment.
         2.3.10.2.1. The following scenario provides an example of typical personnel accountability
         actions following an emergency.
             2.3.10.2.1.1. At the time a recall is initiated, on-duty individuals are sent to unlock assem-
             bly locations and provide sign-in materials as required.
             2.3.10.2.1.2. Incoming personnel report to their assigned assembly area and sign in by Air
             Force Specialty (AFS). The sign-in procedures may be accomplished in a number of ways
             such as sign-in sheets for each AFS or a vertical plotting board with sections for the vari-
             ous AFSs.
             2.3.10.2.1.3. At a time designated by disaster plans and indicated on recall checklists, per-
             sonnel strengths are reported from assembly locations to the DCC. This report should
             include the information in Table 2.3. The DCC compares this information to the unit man-
             ning document, verifies information as necessary through the unit orderly room, and for-
             wards necessary data to the EOC.

            2.3.10.2.2. Personnel accountability procedures will vary from installation to installation.
            Therefore, adherence to locally established procedures is important to provide an accurate
            count of personnel present for duty to those responsible for making installation recovery deci-
            sions.
        2.3.10.3. Essential Data Requirements. In addition to a current copy of the CE Contingency
        Response Plan, the DCC should maintain the data listed in Table 2.4.

     2.3.11. Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC). The BDOC is a command and control facility
     that serves as the focal point for installation security and defense. It plans, directs, integrates, coordi-
     nates, and controls all base defense efforts (Figure 2.6.). It also coordinates and integrates into area
     security operations with rear area and rear tactical operations centers.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             21


Figure 2.6. Base Defense Forces Are Coordinated Through the BDOC.




   2.3.12. Specialized Teams. Specialized teams are formed from existing installation and unit person-
   nel resources to support emergency response operations (Figure 2.7.). Emergency response support
   teams that are part of the DRF include the readiness support team (RST), shelter management teams
   (SMTs), contamination control teams (CCTs), and post attack reconnaissance (PAR) teams. Other
   teams that support emergency response, but have functional responsibilities beyond emergency
   response, are not considered part of the DRF. Examples of such teams are Fatality, Search and Recov-
   ery (FSRT) and Crash Recovery.

Figure 2.7. Specialized Team Members Perform Life-Sustaining Operations.




   2.3.13. CE Emergency Teams. If the impact of any catastrophe is to be minimized, it is essential that
   civil engineer personnel transition immediately to a contingency mode of operation. Civil engineer
   emergency teams are the forces that will quickly react to keep the installation operational during the
   disaster or attack response period, reduce the loss of life, prevent property damage, and begin imme-
   diate damage identification and repairs following an emergency. Individuals selected for positions on
   these teams must be highly skilled in their specialty and possess the maturity, level-headedness, and
22                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


     physical stamina to operate effectively in the chaotic and demanding environment that accompanies
     all catastrophes. The availability of qualified personnel at the time of a disaster or attack will be a
     prime determining factor in how the emergency teams are structured.
        2.3.13.1. Continental United States (CONUS) Emergency Teams. Due to the varying sizes
        and compositions of CONUS engineer organizations, the number of emergency teams and number
        of team members for each installation can vary. It is incumbent on each BCE to evaluate assigned
        personnel strengths and build the needed response teams. The response teams may be filled by
        military, civilian, or a combination of these forces.
        2.3.13.2. Theater Emergency Teams. By the nature of their location, theater emergency teams
        have a greater likelihood of facing an attack situation than their CONUS counterparts. Natural
        disasters cannot be ruled out, however. At an overseas installation having a peacetime USAF engi-
        neer presence, theater emergency crews for natural disaster response will be based on standard
        manning document authorizations, at least for the initial stages of response. As with the CONUS
        emergency teams, the positions may be filled by military personnel, civilian employees, or a com-
        bined force. They could be augmented for disaster recovery activities if damages exceeded
        in-house capability to any great extent. For overseas locations with no in-place USAF engineer
        force, deployed Prime BEEF units would form the emergency response teams. In an attack situa-
        tion, Prime BEEF forces should be in place prior to commencement of hostilities, thereby forming
        an integral part of the theater emergency response force either by augmenting in-place forces or
        performing as an independent unit. Teams are based on the anticipated availability of Prime BEEF
        forces addressed in the Civil Engineer Force Module construct. See Chapter 4 of AFPAM 10-219,
        Volume 1, Contingency and Disaster Planning, for potential composition and organization of
        emergency teams.

2.4. Communications. Ensuring the availability of interoperable communications for incident response
is a primary concern for commanders. While the installation command and control node within the ICC
remains the central C2 function, the BCE is responsible for providing radio net communications between
FES, the DCC, the EOC, and the installation C2 node (if the latter two are not collocated). Furthermore,
most units are working toward a goal of establishing an ECC that includes a central dispatch capability
with functions for the Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC), SF desk, and Medical dispatch when
applicable (Figure 2.8.). Each of these functions is critical to emergency response and installation recov-
ery actions during and after a crisis. CE personnel help maintain essential communications by adhering to
the following procedures:
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 23


Figure 2.8. Central Dispatch Capability Includes First Responder Functions.




   2.4.1. Establish Alternate Communications. An alternate means of communication must be estab-
   lished and maintained during emergencies. Cell phones, field telephones, and runners could all be via-
   ble alternatives to radios. Consider the following circumstances when determining alternate
   communications. Cell phone communications may need to be digital and/or secure. Utilizing runners
   may be impractical if great distances are involved. Field telephones are useful only when the wires
   connecting them are maintained. If radios are inoperative due to power failure, mobile vehicle radio
   units may be the next option. If radios cannot be used due to suspected enemy monitoring, use other
   means such as secure cell phone networks, field phones, or runners. If radio “dead zones” or areas of
   high interference are present, use message-relaying techniques, changing location, or moving closer to
   the control center. Sometimes the effects of dead zones are directional, that is, transmissions are
   picked up by other radios not in the same direction as the control center. CE personnel using radios
   should be familiar with the locations of dead zones and how to minimize their effects. The installation
   communications officer and intra-base radio personnel can assist in identifying dead zones. Once
   identified, it is a good idea to annotate the information on the control center’s installation layout map.
   Make it a practice to advise all new or infrequent radio users of these locations and ways to minimize
   their effects.
   2.4.2. Control Radio Assets. Maintaining strict control over mobile radio assets is a good communi-
   cations practice in support of installation recovery activities. Keep assets fully serviceable and ready
   for immediate use; pay close attention to recharging batteries. Several dead batteries causing partial
   loss of communications when performing recovery actions can severely reduce the efficiency and
   effectiveness of repair and damage assessment crews. Needless to say, this immediately impacts the
   speed at which the installation’s mission capabilities are reestablished. Quickly replacing lost or dam-
   aged radios during contingencies or wartime is virtually impossible.
   2.4.3. Maintain Sound Radio Discipline. The key to effective radio communications is to ensure all
   personnel exercise radio discipline, use good enunciation, and brevity during contingencies. Refer to
   AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, Civil Engineer Disaster and Attack Preparations, for more information
   on setting up emergency communications.
24                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


2.5. Continuity of Command and Control. In addition to establishing alternate command centers like
the alternate EOC, DCC, and Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC), civil engineers must per-
form several other actions to help ensure continuity of command. They include the following:
     2.5.1. Predesignated Personnel. Provision must be made for the continuity of engineer leadership
     both in the EOC and the DCC. The establishment of alternate command centers aids in solving part of
     the problem in terms of facility support. However, the possibility exists that key personnel assigned to
     serve in either the primary or alternate command centers may become casualties and unable to per-
     form their primary duties. Other engineer personnel must be predesignated to fill in for key personnel
     casualties. This predesignation must be done in advance of any hostilities, and sufficient training and
     command and control familiarization must be provided so that a smooth transition can be obtained if
     and when required.
     2.5.2. Change-Over Briefings. Continuity of command and control also is influenced by
     round-the-clock shift operations. In effect, continuity is affected every time there is a shift change.
     The degree of professionalism and effort put into change-over briefings is directly proportional to the
     degree of command and control continuity maintained (Figure 2.9.). These briefings must be in suffi-
     cient depth and scope so as to make individuals on the next shift conversant on all major recovery
     activities under way and those programmed to start during the watch. Fancy eyewash slides are not
     necessary nor worth the time to produce; however, just passing the logbook will not cut it either. Brief
     replacement shift personnel as you would wish to be briefed.

Figure 2.9. Thorough Change-Over Briefings Improve C2 Continuity.




     2.5.3. Recall of Dispersed Equipment and Personnel. Equipment and personnel are dispersed in
     order to minimize destruction, damage, and injury. Lines of communication must be maintained with
     dispersed assets and information exchanged on the current status of the assets. Dispersed assets that
     survived the disaster can be recalled to assist in taking recovery actions. The commander should con-
     sider recalling the assets for recovery actions after assessing the possibility of a threat recurrence.
     Only those dispersed assets necessary for sustained operation of critical functions should be recalled.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                25


2.6. Summary. This chapter discussed the concepts for command and control during contingencies. It
also acknowledged that in a contingency situation, the installation leadership relies heavily on a clearly
defined organization, dependable communications, and decentralized responsibilities to respond quickly
and appropriately to a myriad of emergency situations and tasks prevalent during an attack or disaster. The
tasks and responsibilities of the installation control center, emergency operations center, and the damage
control center were also discussed along with the duties and responsibilities of key personnel in these con-
trol centers. Units must establish effective communications and proper organization to accomplish a suc-
cessful installation recovery—civil engineers play an essential role in that effort.

                             CBRN CONTAMINATION MONITORING

3.1. Introduction. The uncertainty of what warfare techniques or major accidents may be encountered in
the future makes it necessary that civil engineer forces be prepared to operate in many hazardous environ-
ments. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) environments represent dangerous condi-
tions that civil engineer forces could face during a wartime contingency or peacetime accident.

3.2. Overview. This chapter will primarily focus on contamination monitoring of threats represented in
the CBRN acronym. Employment of these threats could involve covert measures or conventional attack
and each requires increased vigilance and accurate detectors to provide adequate warning (Figure 3.1.) to
our personnel. Although, there is no single function that monitors for CBRN contamination, CBRN
reconnaissance teams, shelter teams, and contamination control teams will each be tasked to support con-
tamination monitoring and control for CBRN threats. ESF-5, Emergency Management, manages CBRN
monitoring and control activities through the CBRNE Control Center.

3.3. Chemical Agent Monitoring. Chemical agents can be introduced to the installation environment by
the use of bomblets, artillery shells, missiles, sprays, and aerosols and through the installation water sup-
ply. An actual chemical environment is characterized by solid, liquid, aerosol, or gaseous chemical agents
which pervade an area causing widespread incapacitation or death. Since the types of chemical agents
present may be nerve, blood, blister, or choking agents, monitoring methods will have to be geared to
detect a range of substances. The most important factor to remember for chemical monitoring activities is
the need for early and accurate detection of any chemical warfare agent to ensure that personnel have time
to take adequate protection measures. Effective monitoring for the presence of chemical agents involves
the use of appropriate detection equipment in a manner that provides the best opportunity for early detec-
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 27


tion of any chemical agents introduced into the area. The following paragraphs describe current chemical
detection equipment and recommended monitoring procedures.
   3.3.1. Chemical Detection Equipment. The most common chemical detection devices available for
   use by USAF personnel are:
       3.3.1.1. M8 Chemical Agent Detector Paper. The M8 chemical agent detector paper (Figure
       3.2.) provides a single method for testing for the presence of liquid nerve or blister agents. It con-
       sists of twenty-five 4- x 2 1/2-inch sheets of dye-impregnated paper bound in booklet form and
       perforated for easy removal. It is best suited for use on nonporous materials since its reliability is
       reduced when the agent is absorbed. Since some solvents can cause the paper to change color, it is
       unreliable for determining the completeness of decontamination.

Figure 3.2. M8 Chemical Agent Detector Paper.




       3.3.1.2. M9 Chemical Agent Detector Paper. The M9 chemical agent detection paper (Figure
       3.3.), with its adhesive backing, provides greater employment flexibility than the M8 paper. The
       M9 detector paper is supplied in a roll 2 inches wide by 30 feet long. The adhesive backing allows
       it to be attached to clean, dry surfaces. The M9 detector paper is used to indicate the presence of
       liquid nerve/blister agents. The paper may be worn around the wrist, arm, and/or ankles for contin-
       uous monitoring, or it may be exposed on a surface for visual warning or monitoring.

      3.3.1.3. M256A1 Chemical Agent Detector Kit. The M256A1 chemical agent detector kit (Fig-
      ure 3.4.) is an integrated kit that will detect the presence of chemical agents in liquid or vapor
      form. It provides a portable capability for detecting field concentrations of nerve, blister, and
      blood agents. The M256A1 kit consists of twelve individually packaged sampler/detectors,
      instruction cards, and a packet of M8 chemical agent detector paper. The M8 paper is used to
      detect liquid nerve and blister agents.

      3.3.1.4. M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm (ACAA). The M22 is an automatic chemical
      agent alarm system capable of detecting and identifying standard blister and nerve agent vapors.
      The system is man-portable, operates independently after system start-up, and provides an audible
      and visual alarm. The M22 system also provides a communications interface for automatic battle-
      field warning. The system consists of the M88 detector, as many as five M42 alarm units, a confi-

      3.3.1.5. Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM). The ICAM is a handheld attack recovery
      device for monitoring chemical agent contamination on personnel and equipment (Figure 3.6.). It
      detects and discriminates between vapors of nerve and mustard agents. The device provides
      instantaneous feedback of chemical hazard levels for quick determination of contamination (or
      not) of front-line assets. It is faster and more reliable than the original CAM.

Figure 3.6. Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM).




      3.3.1.6. M272 Chemical Agent Water Test Kit. The M272 kit is manually operated and can
      detect and identify hazardous levels of nerve, blister, and blood agents in treated or untreated
      water resources in about 20 minutes (Figure 3.7.). The kit contains enough equipment to conduct
      25 tests for each agent. The kit also contains simulants used for training.

      3.3.1.7. HazMatID System. The HazMatID system (Figure 3.8.) is a Fourier Transform Infrared
      (FT-IR) spectrometer that can be used for both quantitative and qualitative materials analysis. It
      can be used for the analysis of solids, powders, pastes, gels and liquids, and the technique is non-
      destructive. It is a highly specific tool that measures how chemical samples interact with infrared
      light. Each chemical has its own unique infrared fingerprint, which when analyzed by the HazMa-
      tID is compared against an onboard library database to provide identification in less than 20 sec-
      onds.

Figure 3.8. HazMatID System.




      3.3.1.8. Hazard Categorization (HAZCAT) Chemical Identification System. The HAZCAT
      Chemical Identification System (Figure 3.9.) is a portable testing system designed for on-site
      identification or categorization of chemical material. The system uses simple field tests with
      easy-to-follow flow charts. One flow chart is provided for solids and a second chart for liquids,
      enabling the user to identify or categorize unknowns quickly in the field.

      3.3.1.9. Advanced Portable Detector (APD) 2000. The APD 2000 (Figure 3.10.) is a handheld
      chemical detection and monitoring device that simultaneously detects nerve and blister agents. It
      has data-logging features to record monitoring events. The APD 2000 can be set to automatically
      clear and reset following an alarm or be set as a continuously sampling monitor. It can be powered
      by six standard or rechargeable C batteries, AC adapter, or 9 to 18 Volt DC supply.

Figure 3.10. APD 2000.




      3.3.1.10. Ahura First Defender. The Ahura First Defender (Figure 3.11.) is a rugged, handheld
      chemical identification unit designed for point-of-use applications. The unit identifies toxic indus-
      trial chemicals (TICs), narcotics, contraband, chemical weapons, and white powders. It is
      enclosed in a lightweight, rugged, and weather/chemical resistant package and weighs approxi-
      mately 4 pounds. The unit is designed to operate over a temperature range of -20oC to 40oC (-4o F
      to 104o F) in dry (desert) and wet (tropical) environments.

        3.3.1.11. MultiRAE Plus. The MultiRAE Plus (Figure 3.12.) is a programmable, multi-gas
        monitor that can be used for a wide variety of air sampling surveys. It measures real-time concen-
        trations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a parts per million (ppm) range. The MultiRAE
        Plus can be used as a personal monitor, a handheld monitor for spot checks, or as a continuously
        operational general area monitor.

Figure 3.12. MultiRAE Plus Gas Monitor.




     3.3.2. Chemical Monitoring Procedures. The monitoring procedures outlined in this section should
     be considered as general guidance. Local environmental conditions and intelligence estimates of prob-
     able enemy actions during an attack will dictate specific chemical monitoring procedures. The pri-
     mary concerns of chemical monitoring are in providing initial chemical attack warning, attack
     recovery all-clear indications, decontamination management assistance, and contamination avoidance
     assistance.
        3.3.2.1. Initial Chemical Attack Warning. When intelligence reports or enemy actions indicate
        a chemical attack is probable, chemical agent alarms should be activated. If a detector indicates
        the presence of a toxic substance, warn everyone in the area and relay the information immedi-
        ately to the appropriate control center. This advance warning will enable the main force to increase
        their protection level before the arrival of the chemical agent. The positioning of the detectors will
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                33


       depend on the availability of detection equipment, environmental conditions, and the perceived
       hostile threat. Detectors are positioned upwind of the installation and near key areas. If the wind
       direction shifts substantially, the detectors may have to be repositioned. Readiness and Emergency
       Management personnel are responsible for deploying and redeploying detectors.
       3.3.2.2. Monitoring for Attack Recovery All-Clear Indication. Since personnel can accom-
       plish their assigned tasks easier without the protective chemical ensemble, monitoring for the con-
       tinued presence of chemicals following an attack is important. The M256A1 kit is normally used
       by reconnaissance teams to support the determination as to when it is safe to unmask. To deter-
       mine if liquid contamination remains, M8 or M9 detection paper can be used.
       3.3.2.3. Monitoring in Decontamination Operations. Effective chemical monitoring is essen-
       tial during decontamination operations to ensure that toxic chemicals have been eliminated or
       reduced to nontoxic levels. The ICAM or M256A1 chemical agent detector kit is used to detect
       vapors that may be offgasing from equipment and other surfaces following decontamination. The
       M8 and M9 can be used to detect liquid contamination, but if solvents were used during the decon-
       tamination process, the M8 detector paper could give an erroneous indication. If personnel are
       careful in removing contaminated protective gear, decontamination is not normally required. Con-
       taminated equipment remains in a holding area until needed for reuse, disposal, or more extensive
       decontamination.
       3.3.2.4. Monitoring in Contamination Avoidance. Even after a chemical attack has been
       launched, casualties can be reduced through proper use of protective gear and by avoiding areas
       contaminated with chemical agents. Good chemical monitoring procedures can be invaluable in
       detection of these chemical “hot spots.” Depending upon the type of toxic agent involved, any of
       the previously discussed detection equipment might be used to avoid contaminated areas. As men-
       tioned earlier, M9 detection paper can be placed on the individual’s protective overgarment in the
       wrist, arm, and ankle areas to continuously monitor for the presence of liquid nerve/blister agents.
       The ICAM or M256A1 detector kit can be used to sample for suspected contamination prior to
       entering an area. Finally, for suspected nerve agent vapor, the automatic chemical agent alarm set
       can be moved into an area ahead of the work force to detect contamination. Caution: Chemical
       contamination ingested into air filters, ducts, and other components of collective protection shel-
       ters continues to pose a danger to personnel after the general area has been declared free of con-
       tamination. Coordinate chemical monitoring support and guidance for this type of situation with
       the Readiness and Emergency Management staff or the CBRNE Control Center.
   3.3.3. A Final Consideration. The value of any chemical detection system lies in its ability to detect
   a toxic agent and warn friendly forces in sufficient time for them to assume a protective posture. This
   quick detection capability is challenged by the inherent limitations of current detection systems and
   the fact that some potential installations with USAF presence could be only a few flight minutes from
   hostile air bases. If these limitations are to be overcome in future chemical confrontations, civil engi-
   neers must understand the limitations of available detection devices and be prepared to compensate
   for reduced warning by increased readiness and immediate protective action.

3.4. Biological Agent Monitoring. Biological agents can be employed through aerosols, insect vectors
(infected insects), and the water supply (Figure 3.13.). Biological agents are used by an enemy to produce
disease, which reduces the ability of the opponent to continue combat operations. Potential antipersonnel
biological agents consist of living microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. These pathogens
34                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


affect the body much like common diseases such as typhoid or influenza. The effects of these agents can
range from minor incapacitation (common cold) to prolonged illness that results in death (plague). Since
biological agents are easily transmitted to other personnel, this dreadful weapon has the potential for cov-
ering larger areas than many other forms of warfare. Although there are no verified instances of the use of
biological weapons in modern warfare, these pathogens could be produced, stockpiled, and disseminated
without being immediately detected. Poor sanitary conditions prevalent during wartime compound bio-
logical warfare detection problems. The following paragraphs describe current biological detection equip-
ment and recommended monitoring procedures.

     3.4.1. Biological Detection Equipment. The most common biological detection devices used by
     USAF personnel are the Joint Portal Shield, DOD Biological Sampling Kit, and the BioCapture air
     sampler.
        3.4.1.1. Joint Portal Shield (JPS). The Joint Portal Shield is an automated biological detection
        and identification system specifically designed for fixed sites. The system is housed in an Interna-
        tional Standards Organization (ISO) container equipped with uninterruptible power and environ-
        mental conditioning systems (Figure 3.14.). The JPS sensor suite automates the detection,
        collection, and identification of biological warfare agents and reports this information to a central-
        ized command and control center.

       3.4.1.2. DOD Biological Sampling Kit. The DOD Biological Sampling Kit (Figure 3.15.), with
       its associated handheld assays (HHA), provides a presumptive identification capability for biolog-
       ical warfare (BW) agents in environmental samples and is employed for field screening suspect
       munitions or munitions fragments for the presence of BW agents; screening envelopes or pack-
       ages that display suspicious liquids, powders, or suspensions; and screening suspect terrorist lab-
       oratory or weapons materials that might be associated with the manufacture or delivery of BW
       agents. The DOD Biological Sampling Kit can also be used as a contamination identification kit
       for indoor areas where it is suspected a BW agent has been released in fairly high concentrations.
       The kit must be stored at 4o C (39.2o F), has a one-time-use-only capability, and is not for diagnos-
       tic use.

Figure 3.15. DOD Biological Sampling Kit.




        3.4.1.3. BioCapture Air Sampler. The BioCapture air sampler (Figure 3.16.) is a hand-held,
        battery-powered unit that captures airborne pathogens and spores into a concentrated liquid sam-
        ple for analysis. The air sampler simplifies the collection process with its single button operation
        and removable collection cartridges.

Figure 3.16. BioCapture Air Sampler.




     3.4.2. Biological Monitoring Procedures. Monitoring for biological warfare agents is more difficult
     than chemical agent monitoring because there are few available detectors to provide an immediate
     warning when pathogens are present. Therefore, the bulk of biological monitoring consists of close
     observations of personnel for unexplained illnesses, periodic sampling of water supplies for biological
     contamination, and active reconnaissance operations for sampling following suspicious enemy activi-
     ties. For example, a spray released by an enemy aircraft which did not activate chemical agent detec-
     tors might lead to suspicions of a biological agent release. Under these conditions, an active sampling
     mission is conducted, normally by readiness and emergency management and bioenvironmental engi-
     neers. The samples are forwarded to the nearest medical laboratory facility to determine if hazardous
     pathogens are present.
        3.4.2.1. If biological agents are discovered, the civil engineer force may have to take action to pre-
        vent degradation of the installation’s operational capability by the pathogen. The location and type
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               37


       of biological contamination will dictate control actions. Contamination in the water supply may be
       controlled by increasing the chlorine level or requiring all consumers to boil water prior to use.
       Biological contamination associated with insect or animal populations in the area may be reduced
       by increased pest control.
       3.4.2.2. If the installation has minimal biological monitoring capability that limits immediate
       warning of a biological attack, one of the most important preventative measures that civil engi-
       neers can take is to ensure that sanitation measures are maintained to the highest possible degree.
       Also, be aware that reduced sanitation levels common to a wartime environment can contribute to
       the spread of a biological agent and mask initial detection efforts.

3.5. Radiological Monitoring. In the event of a nuclear attack, shelters will be points of survival from
which personnel will emerge to carry out recovery and rehabilitation tasks. For this reason, installations
use a radiological exposure control system to ensure the safety of shelter occupants.
   3.5.1. Radiation Exposure. Radiological exposure must be controlled to ensure the safety of all per-
   sonnel. Exposure levels have been developed to categorize and manage the risk posed to warfighters
   who have been exposed to radiation. The criteria used to assist commanders in measuring unit expo-
   sure to radiation are based on total past cumulative dose in centigray (cGy). Centigray is the unit that
   is used to describe the dose of radiation to which personnel are exposed.
       3.5.1.1. Radiological Exposure During War. When combat units are exposed to less than 125
       centigray (cGy), overall effectiveness of the unit will not be degraded. However, above this
       threshold, commanders must be aware that their force’s capability to fight will be diminished. The
       term “combat effective” is used for personnel who will be suffering radiation sickness signs and
       symptoms to a limited degree and who will be able to maintain their performance at least 75 per-
       cent of their pre-exposure performance level. Those individuals who are predicted to be “perfor-
       mance degraded” would be operating at a performance level between 25 and 75 percent of their
       pre-exposure performance. Those predicted as “combat ineffective” should be considered as capa-
       ble of performing their tasks at 25 percent (at best) of their pre-exposure performance level. Table
       3.1. and Table 3.2. provide examples of expected radiation intensities and effects after a nuclear
       attack (Source: Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) (I) 3-2.56, Multiservice

      3.5.1.2. Nuclear Risk Criteria. There are three degrees of risk—negligible, moderate, and emer-
      gency. Table 3.3. provides the risks associated with each respective radiation exposure status
      (RES) category. Latent ineffectiveness (LI) is the casualty criterion defined as the lowest dose at
      which performance is degraded (i.e., 25 to 75 percent capable) within 3 hours and will remain so
      until death or recovery or become combat ineffective at anytime within 6 weeks.
          3.5.1.2.1. Negligible (1 percent LI). Negligible risk is acceptable when the mission requires
          units to operate in a contaminated environment. However, it should not be exceeded unless a
          significant advantage will be gained.
          3.5.1.2.2. Moderate (2.5 percent LI). Moderate risk is usually acceptable in close support
          operations. Moderate risk must not be exceeded if troops are expected to operate at full effi-
          ciency.
          3.5.1.2.3. Emergency (5 percent LI). The emergency risk dose is only acceptable in rare situ-
          ations termed disaster situations. Only the commander can decide when the risk of the disaster
          situation outweighs the radiation emergency risk.

NOTES:
1. RES categories are based on previous exposure. Risk levels are graduated within each RES category
   in order to provide more stringent criteria as the total radiation dose accumulated becomes more
   serious.
2. Reclassification from one RES category to a less serious one is made by the commander upon
   advice from medical personnel and after ample observation of the actual state of health of exposed
   personnel.
3. All exposures to radiation are considered total body and simply additive. No allowance is made for
   body recovery from radiation injury.
4. Exposure criteria given for RES-1 and RES-2 units should be used only when the numerical value of
   a unit’s total past cumulative dose is unknown.
5. Each of the degrees of risk can be applied to radiation hazards resulting from enemy or friendly
   weapons or both and from initial nuclear radiation resulting from planned friendly supporting fire.

      3.5.1.3. Effects of Radiation. The harmful effects of nuclear radiation are caused by the ioniza-
      tion produced in the cells composing living tissue. As a result of the ionization, some of the com-
      ponents essential to the normal functioning of the cells are altered or destroyed. All radiation is
      capable of producing ionization directly or indirectly. Alpha and beta particles, X-rays, and
      gamma rays cause radiation injury of the same general type. Since gamma rays have the greatest
      penetrating ability, they are the ones that the shelter monitor is most concerned with when deter-
      mining hazards to personnel. To further understand the effects of radiation on living tissue, it is
      helpful to have some background information on the characteristics and effects of various types of
      radiation as described in the following paragraphs and Figure 3.17.
          3.5.1.3.1. Alpha Particles. Alpha particles are particles of matter which have been ejected
          from the nucleus of a radioactive material and are literally small pieces of matter traveling
          through space. Alpha particles have the lowest penetrating power of any nuclear radiation and
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               41


         can be stopped by 1 inch of air, a sheet of paper, or undamaged human skin. Alpha particles are
         hazardous if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through open wounds.
         3.5.1.3.2. Beta Particles. Beta particles are charged particles found primarily in fallout radia-
         tion. They are extremely light and travel at high velocities. Beta particles have a greater pene-
         trating power than alpha particles, but they can still be stopped by a few feet of air or heavy
         clothing. Beta particles can cause tissue damage in humans if fallout is ingested or heavy fall-
         out contamination of the skin is not quickly removed. The primary effect of beta particles will
         be radiation burns (appears similar to thermal burns) to exposed skin tissue.
         3.5.1.3.3. Gamma Rays. Gamma rays are emitted during a nuclear detonation and from fall-
         out, and are uncharged radiation similar to X rays. They are highly energetic and pass easily
         through most materials. Because of their high penetration ability, exposure to a gamma radia-
         tion source can result in whole-body exposure. It requires several feet of earth or at least one
         inch of lead to reduce the penetrating powers of gamma rays.

Figure 3.17. Nuclear Weapon Radiation Hazards.




      3.5.1.4. Principles of Fallout Protection. Three basic methods are used to minimize exposure to
      ionizing radiation: time, distance, and shielding. Protection is provided by controlling the length
      of exposure time and the distance between the body and the source of radiation, and placing an
      absorbing material between the body and the source of radiation. For a better understanding of the
      three methods of protection, they will be discussed separately.
         3.5.1.4.1. Time. When considering the principle of time, examine it from two angles—radio-
         active decay and individual exposure time. We have no control over radioactive decay. The
         decay rate is determined by the half-life of the radioactive elements that make up the fallout.
         Half-life is the time required for a given radioactive element to lose half of its original radio-
         activity. While the decay rate cannot be controlled, exposure time can be controlled. When
         radiation levels are very high following an attack, exposure should be kept to an absolute min-
         imum. No task should be conducted outside of the protection of the shelter unless it is abso-
         lutely necessary. Even after radiation levels have decreased, carefully monitor and rotate
         exposure among the shelter occupants to ensure no individual receives an excessive amount.
42                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


            Personnel should keep an accurate record of daily radiation exposure and accumulated radia-
            tion dosage to that date.
            3.5.1.4.2. Distance. The simplest way to explain the distance factor in radiation protection is
            to say that the farther personnel are from the source of radiation, the safer they are. This dis-
            tance factor can be very important in determining the protection factor of various areas when
            large buildings are used as shelters.
            3.5.1.4.3. Shielding. The amount and type of shielding are important in determining the over-
            all protection factor of the shelter. Since alpha and beta particles are stopped by thin protective
            barriers, the main concern in selection of shelter shielding material is the reduction of gamma
            ray penetration. The efficiency of a given substance in stopping gamma rays is determined by
            its density. The denser the material, the more effective it is in preventing penetration. Figure
            3.18. is an abstract illustration of the effectiveness of various shielding material against the
            penetrating effects of radiation particles. Selection of the appropriate shielding substance will
            be based on the application intended and the availability of materials. For example, in a situa-
            tion where space is critical, iron or steel would be an excellent choice since its high density
            allows effective shielding with minimum thickness. In situations where space is not a consid-
            eration but cost is important, a less dense, lower cost material like earth or concrete might be a
            better choice.

        3.5.1.5. Shelter Protection Factors. The principles of fallout protection described in the preced-
        ing paragraphs have a significant impact on determining the protection factor of a shelter. The pro-
        tection factor may be defined as the relative reduction in the amount of radiation received by a
        person in a protective location compared to the amount received if unprotected. To illustrate, if a
        shelter has a protection factor of 100, an unprotected person would be exposed to 100 times more
        radiation than someone inside the shelter. Knowing the protective factor of the shelter is essential
        if the shelter monitor is to calculate outside radiation levels based on interior readings.
     3.5.2. Radiological Monitoring Instruments. Shelter monitors must have the proper tools. Many
     instruments are available, but they all fall into two general classes: survey meters and dosimeters.
     These instruments are designed to detect and measure gamma radiation. Some are capable of detect-
     ing alpha and beta radiation. For fallout, the primary concern is with gamma radiation. Below are cur-
     rent radiological monitoring instruments and recommended monitoring procedures. To better
     understand the use of radiological monitoring instruments, contact personnel assigned to the readiness
     and emergency management flight.

      3.5.2.1. GR-135 Radiation Detector. The GR-135 is a point radiation detector (Figure 3.19.)
      that uses laboratory gamma spectrometry to identify radiation sources. It uses a high-efficiency
      moderated solid-state detection system that has maximum neutron sensitivity with minimum
      gamma interference. The detector converts radiation into incident photons which goes through
      photomultiplier tubes to generate electrical pulses which are then read by the detector. It is able to
      identify common industrial and medical isotopes. It can also identify illicit nuclear materials.

      3.5.2.2. Radiation (RAD) Portal Monitor. A radiation portal monitor is a detection device that
      provides a passive, non-intrusive means to screen trucks and other vehicles for the presence of
      nuclear and radiological materials (Figure 3.20.). The system is capable of detecting various types
      of radiation emanating from nuclear devices, dirty bombs, special nuclear materials, natural
      sources, and isotopes commonly used in medicine and industry. The portal monitor captures and
      alerts to energy emitted by radioactive sources that happen to pass nearby.

       3.5.2.3. ADM-300 Multifunction Survey Meter. The ADM-300 is a battery-operated, self-diag-
       nostic, multi-function instrument (Figure 3.21.). It is used alone to locate and measure low and
       high intensity radioactivity in the form of gamma rays or beta particles. It is used with external
       probes to locate and measure alpha, beta, gamma, and X-rays and neutron radiation.

3.6. Release Other Than Attack (ROTA) Events. Hazardous material releases other than traditional
military CBRN attacks could occur anytime or anywhere, during peacetime or periods of war, and inside
or outside the CONUS. These ROTA events could occur accidentally, intentionally by terrorists, or
through other deliberate action. Whether stateside or in a forward operating location, the aftermath of a
ROTA event could be chaotic; and, like any other hazardous materials release, engineers will play a vital
role in mitigating the effects of a release. Hazardous material releases may include, but are not limited to,
CBRN or TIM releases due to damaged or destroyed storage or production facilities, transport vehicles,
storage bunkers, ammunition supply sites, power plants, and other sources. Toxic industrial materials may
be toxic industrial chemical (TIC), toxic industrial biological (TIB), or toxic industrial radiological (TIR).
Table 3.4. presents various types of ROTA events based on their origin.

Nuclear
                  Nuclear material can be released into the atmosphere from the core of a nuclear
 Nuclear Reactor reactor that has been damaged or which has gone out of control. Material released
         or       from a nuclear-reactor incident will be mostly, or all, particles of nuclear fuel.
 Fuel Production Similar incidents may occur at nuclear-fuel reprocessing or production facilities.
     Facilities   Such a release can result in very high levels of radiation, covering distances of
                  hundreds of kilometers.
Toxic Industrial Materials
                  Nuclear waste and radiological materials are usually stored well below ground level,
  Nuclear-Waste
                  usually in a special lead drum contained in concrete shelters. Damage to such a
         or
                  facility may rupture some of the drums and release the radiological material into the
   Radiological
                  atmosphere over an extended period of time. Such a release will result in low-level
 Material Storage
                  radiation covering a fairly short distance, which will be dangerous to anyone
     Facilities
                  remaining in the hazard area for an extended period of time.
                  RDDs are designed to release radioactive materials into the environment. This could
   Radiological   be achieved by combining nuclear materials with conventional explosives or
 Dispersal Device combustion to produce radioactive particles or smoke. The use of an RDD could
      (RDD)       result in hazardous areas extending far downwind. High levels of radiation detected
                  as a passing cloud could indicate use of an RDD.
                  Storage facilities for biological agents usually consist of underground concrete
                  shelters. These shelters are closer to the ground surface. Damage to such a facility
 Biological-Agent may release some biological material from the shelter into the atmosphere as a jet of
      Bunkers     biological agent, smoke, dust, and soil. The release area will be localized, and the
   or Production  amount of viable agent dispersed will likely be less than that dispersed from an
     Facilities   efficient biological weapon. However, since many biological agents require only a
                  few inhaled organisms to affect a person, the downwind distance of the hazard area
                  may still be considerable.
                  Damage to stockpiled munitions containing chemical agents will result in
                  considerably smaller quantities of agent released than the intentional use of
     Chemical
                  munitions; therefore, the downwind hazard area will usually be smaller than for a
    Stockpile or
                  chemical attack. Damage to containers of TIM being transported by road, rail, or
  TIM Transport/
                  boat can result in large quantities being released into the atmosphere. However, the
      Storage
                  toxicity and stability of these materials will be less than for chemical agents and the
                  hazard areas will also be smaller than for a chemical attack.
                  TICs are stored in very large quantities (greater than 1,500 kg) in large tanks, often
                  under pressure and at low temperatures. A catastrophic tank rupture will result in a
                  highly toxic cloud, which usually exhibits dense-gas behavior. This type of release
  Bulk Chemical may also occur intentionally by a terrorist or other deliberate action. Such a cloud
      Storage     will not travel with the wind until after its concentration has been reduced
                  consider-ably, often below toxic levels. In addition to their toxicity, TICs are often
                  corrosive, flammable, explosive, or able to react violently with air or water, which
                  may pose a greater danger than the immediate toxic effects.

3.7. Joint Service Detection Equipment. A significant portion of current chemical, biological, and
radiological detection equipment is “off-the-shelf” technology, and improved equipment and technology
are systematically finding their way to the field as a result of ongoing research, development, and acqui-
sition. The Joint Service Installation Protection Program (JS-IPP) is tasked to outfit DOD installations
with CBRN protection and response capabilities using current Government and Commercial
Off-The-Shelf technology. The IPP capabilities consist of the areas in Table 3.5. Although there are many
CBRN defense systems currently fielded or planned to be fielded in the next several years, the focus of
current research is directed in two primary areas: (1) improved chemical, biological, and radiological
point and remote detection systems and (2) interface airbase detection and warning system with other ele-
ments of the installation survivability and recovery system. Both of these areas are impacted by Air Force
and DOD CBRN defense modernization efforts and are critical to current and future force protection mea-
sures. The next few paragraphs provide a brief discussion of several current and planned detection sys-
tems.

3.8. Summary. This chapter addressed various CBRN monitoring and detection devices and a planned
warning and reporting system. These items are/will be used by a range of organizations and personnel.
Regardless, civil engineers will play a vital role employing many of these devices to efficiently monitor
and detect contamination on and around an installation. Properly used, this equipment helps to ensure
mission sustainment and mission restoration following attacks or disasters involving CBRN and Toxic
Industrial Materials (TIM).

                             DEFENSE AGAINST CHEMICAL AGENTS

4.1. Introduction. The intentional use of hazardous chemical agents against our personnel remains a real
threat and our warfighters must be able to control chemical agent contamination and perform decontami-
nation operations on equipment and personnel. Engineers have to possess the knowledge to employ pro-
tective measures and precautions that increase their ability to continue extended operations in a chemical
environment. They must also be proficient in the use of CBRN protective equipment and be aware of
equipment limitations in a CBRN environment. Understanding chemical agent avoidance, individual pro-
tection, and decontamination procedures is crucial to both individual survival and an installation’s recov-
ery after a chemical attack.

4.2. Overview. This chapter will provide civil engineer personnel with a basic understanding of (1) how
threat chemical agents kill or incapacitate personnel, and (2) how to employ passive defensive measures
such as avoidance, individual protection, and decontamination procedures.

4.3. Chemical Agent Types and Effects. The primary use of chemical weapons is to kill, injure, or inca-
pacitate personnel. Chemical agents may be classified by their action and effects (nerve, blood, blister,
and choking). The effects produced by these agents in humans are generally dose-dependent. That is,
increased doses of a specific agent produce a corresponding increase in the severity of its effects.
     4.3.1. Basic Types of Chemical Agents. There are numerous chemical substances that may be used
     in a chemical warfare environment, but they all fall into one of four general categories (Figure 4.1.).
     The following paragraphs identify the basic types of chemical agents and describe their effects on
     human beings. The characteristics, first aid, and defense against various chemical agents are presented
     in Table 4.1. through Table 4.4.

Figure 4.1. Basic Types of Chemical Agents.




        4.3.1.1. Nerve Agents. These agents directly affect the human nervous system and are highly
        toxic in both liquid and vapor forms. Nerve agent effects on the human body are similar whether
        they are inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Symptoms of nerve agent exposure include a runny
        nose, tightness of the chest, difficult breathing, excessive perspiration, drooling, nausea, vomiting,
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               51


      dimness of vision, pinpointing of the pupils, convulsions, and death. In a vaporous state, the agent
      is readily absorbed by eyes, nose, and throat tissues. As a liquid, it readily penetrates the skin,
      eyes, and tissues of the body. When inhaled, nerve agents act rapidly with symptoms developing
      within one to two minutes; when absorbed through undamaged skin, symptoms are slower to
      develop, but equally deadly. When the eyes are exposed to a nerve agent vapor the pupils become
      pinpointed. However, if the vapor concentration is very low, this pinpointing of the pupils may not
      occur for ten minutes or more. If the only exposure to the nerve agent is skin contamination, the
      pupils may remain normal or be only slightly reduced in size. Depending upon the dose received
      and the adequacy and speed of first aid treatment, the effects of nerve agents may range from mild
      disability to death.

      types are painless, and others sting. These agents come in many forms. In the liquid state, blister

      agents form oily droplets that may vary from colorless to dark brown in color; as a vapor, they are
      normally invisible. The characteristics and effects of blister agents are described below.
          4.3.1.2.1. In liquid or vapor form, these agents may burn or blister any part of the body they
          contact, either external or internal (Figure 4.2.). The severity of injury depends on the type
          and concentration of the agent, the exposure time, the weather, and the degree of activity of the
          affected individual.

Figure 4.2. External Blistering Caused by Blister Agent.




          4.3.1.2.2. Blister agents are effective even in small quantities and can cause delayed casual-
          ties. A drop of mustard-type agent the size of a pin-head can produce a blister 1 inch in diam-
          eter. Unprotected personnel exposed to low concentrations of the agent in vapor form over a
          long period of time will eventually become casualties.
          4.3.1.2.3. If these agents come into direct contact with the eyes, they cause redness, inflamma-
          tion, and frequently temporary blindness.
          4.3.1.2.4. Mustard-type agents are quickly absorbed through the skin. Depending upon the
          degree of contamination and prevailing weather conditions, a reddening of the affected area
          may occur at any time up to 12 hours after exposure. Blisters may appear in a day or less fol-
          lowing the reddening. Healing time varies from about 6 days to as much as 8 weeks in severe
          cases.
          4.3.1.2.5. Inhalation of blister agents will cause serious damage to tissues in the mouth, nose,
          throat, and lungs.
          4.3.1.2.6. The serious effect of blister agents is not always immediately apparent. Exposure to
          certain mustard-type agents may go unnoticed due to the lack of any immediate pain and the
          fact that signs of injury may not appear for several hours. The vapor of other types of blister
          agents irritates the eyes and respiratory tract immediately. Other liquid blister agents sting the
          skin and cause pain within seconds after exposure.

       4.3.1.3. Blood Agents. These agents are disseminated as vapors and inhaled into the body. Blood
       agents affect the circulatory and respiratory systems by preventing body cells from using oxygen
       carried by the blood. Symptoms may include dizziness and convulsions. After inhaling a high con-
       centration of blood agents, a person may become unconscious and die within minutes.
       4.3.1.4. Choking Agents. Choking agents are disseminated as gases and inhaled into the body.
       These agents affect the respiratory system by damaging the lungs and, in extreme cases, causing
       them to fill with fluid. Coughing, choking, tightness in the chest, nausea, headache, and watery
       eyes are common symptoms of choking agents. The individual may experience no immediate
       symptoms, but suffer delayed effects 2 to 4 hours after initial exposure. Delayed effects may
       include rapid and shallow breathing, painful cough, discomfort and fatigue, shock, and even death.

     4.3.2. Chemical Agent Effects. Chemical agents cannot harm an individual unless they can enter the
     body. The most common routes of entry are inhalation into the respiratory system or absorption
     through the skin.
        4.3.2.1. Respiratory Effects. The effects caused by inhalation of an agent are dose dependent.
        The dose received depends on the concentration of the agent in the air, the length of time an indi-
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 55


       vidual is exposed to this concentration, and the physical activity of the individual. The level of
       activity directly affects the rate of breathing and, therefore, determines the amount of air and
       chemical agent inhaled in a given period of time. For example, brief exposure to a low or moderate
       concentration of an agent during vigorous physical activity may cause as much harm as the same
       exposure to a high concentration while at rest.
       4.3.2.2. Skin Effects. Absorption of liquid chemical agents through the skin normally takes much
       longer than entry by inhalation. Harmful effects may be avoided by removing or neutralizing the
       liquid agent on the skin or clothes before it is absorbed into the body. Absorption rates vary for
       chemical agents, but will normally be increased when the individual is physically active and per-
       spiring.
       4.3.2.3. Cumulative Effect. The effect of many chemical agents is cumulative; when repeated
       exposure to low concentrations is allowed, serious injury or death could occur.

4.4. Factors Influencing Effectiveness of a Chemical Agent Attack. There are a number of factors
which determine the effectiveness of a chemical attack against our forces. Civil engineer personnel must
be aware of these factors to adopt a defensive posture appropriate to the chemical threat.
   4.4.1. Individual Activity. The body cooling process and the breathing rate are directly affected by
   the individual’s physical activity level. In general, the higher the individual’s respiratory volume, the
   greater the incapacitating effects of the chemical agent through inhalation or absorption.
   4.4.2. Protective Equipment. An individual’s ability to function in a chemical warfare environment
   is directly related to the degree of protection provided by protective equipment and the person’s toler-
   ance to wearing that equipment. The best protective mask, hood, gloves, and overgarment are useless
   if the individual is not able to function without removing or loosening parts of the ensemble.
   4.4.3. Environment. Weather conditions and topography have a significant impact on the behavior
   of chemical agents. Extremely cold temperatures transform certain liquid agents to solids, rendering
   them ineffective. High winds can quickly disperse vapor and gas agents. The most favorable weather
   conditions for employment of chemical agents usually occur at night, during early morning, at dusk,
   and when there is a heavy overcast with light, steady winds. Smooth terrain is usually more favorable
   for the employment of chemical agents than rough terrain. Low places are better than higher eleva-
   tions since the agents tend to linger and settle in low areas.
   4.4.4. Persistency. The persistency of a chemical agent is measured by the agent’s physical proper-
   ties, prevailing weather conditions, method of dissemination, and characteristics of the terrain, mate-
   rial, or equipment on which the agent is deposited. The terms “persistent agent” and “nonpersistent
   agent” express the relative duration of effectiveness of chemical agents in the area of release. These
   terms do not refer to the duration of the effects of the agents on personnel.
       4.4.4.1. Persistent Agents. If the chemical attack consists of liquid droplets from air-burst artil-
       lery shells, bomblets, or bulk-filled missile warheads or of spray from an aircraft, persistent agents
       are probably being used. These agents are used to contaminate equipment and terrain and to cause
       personnel casualties through skin absorption. The agents may include persistent nerve agents, blis-
       ter agents, or a combination of both.
       4.4.4.2. Nonpersistent Agents. Nonpersistent agents are probably being used if the attack con-
       sists of vapors and aerosols from point detonation, near surface detonation, artillery munitions,
       bombs, or bomblets. These agents normally cause casualties by entry into the body through the
56                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


        respiratory system. The agents may include nonpersistent nerve agents, blood agents, choking
        agents, or various combinations of these substances.
     4.4.5. Training. The extremely demanding environment of chemical warfare requires realistic peace-
     time training to ensure that all personnel are proficient in the use of chemical defense equipment. In
     contrast to an earlier war with Iraq, we may not have the “luxury” of several months for refresher
     training prior to the start of a conflict. We cannot rely on predeployment lead times to provide suffi-
     cient time for equipment checks and hands-on practice. If we are to survive a future chemical attack,
     it is only prudent to remain current on all chemical warfare defense requirements and maximize all
     peacetime training opportunities—in effect, we must be able to aptly employ CBRN passive defensive
     measures.

4.5. Passive Defensive Measures. Passive defense operations for chemical agents uses the principles of
CBRN defense (contamination avoidance, protection, and decontamination) to prepare for possible oper-
ations in a chemical environment. These principles form a hierarchy that protects the force, sustains oper-
ational effectiveness, and minimizes casualties. Civil engineers play a vital role in the planning and
execution of an installation’s passive defensive measures. Although this chapter focuses on chemical
defense, the following measures apply equally to all CBRN hazards. See AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Bio-
logical, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, and AFTTP (I) 3-2.42,
Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Opera-
tions, for more information on CBRN passive defensive operations.
     4.5.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is one of several passive defensive
     measures employed to protect personnel and resources and help sustain unit operations. These mea-
     sures include both individual and/or unit actions that avoid or minimize the effects of CBRN hazards.
     While some contamination avoidance measures are accomplished when planning and preparing for a
     disaster or an attack, other contamination avoidance measures are taken immediately prior to, during,
     and after an attack. The latter measures include alarms and signals, reconnaissance, and contamination
     mitigation efforts.
        4.5.1.1. Alarms and Signals. Alarms and signals are used to convey warnings of an attack or
        CBRN hazard. Installations use standardized, easily recognizable and reliable alarm methods so
        their personnel can respond quickly and correctly to an attack or CBRN hazard. Standard alarms
        and contamination markers help give orderly warning that may also require a change in mis-
        sion-oriented protective posture (MOPP) level. Alarms and signals include audible alarms, auto-
        matic alarms, and visual signals.
        4.5.1.2. Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is an important part of contamination avoidance. The
        responsibility for reconnaissance after an attack does not rest with any single organization or spe-
        cialized team, but with every individual assigned to an installation. Everyone should be alert for
        signs of attack, including contaminated areas and the alarming of automatic detectors. However,
        unless CE personnel are assigned to a Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) or other DRF survey
        team, their reconnaissance activities may be limited to their immediate work area, assigned equip-
        ment, or vehicle. In any case, if signs of chemical contamination are discovered, warn installation
        personnel by communicating the nature and location of the hazard and marking the area with stan-
        dard CBRN hazard markers and decals. If standard hazard markers or decals are not available use
        improvised or expedient means such as, masking tape, chalk, or paint to mark the hazard. Figure
        4.3. display samples of expedient CBR and Conventional hazard markers.

      4.5.1.3. Contamination Mitigation Efforts. Installation attack preparations and contamination
      avoidance measures help to mitigate the effects of chemical contamination. Both are designed to
      reduce vulnerability and avoid contamination of personnel and critical equipment. Individuals
      support their unit’s contamination mitigation efforts by knowing what to do and responding appro-
      priately to chemical attacks. Although not all-inclusive, the following paragraphs highlight some
      individual actions that help mitigate the effects of chemical contamination. See Paragraph 4.5.2.,
      and AFMAN 10-2602 for more detailed information on contamination mitigation actions.
          4.5.1.3.1. Practice proper hygiene and sanitation methods at all times.
          4.5.1.3.2. Minimize skin exposure for protection against hazards (e.g., wearing shirt sleeves
          down and closing neck buttons). Although inhalation of an agent is a major concern, many
          agents can enter the body by penetrating the skin or through skin cuts, cracks, or abrasions.
          4.5.1.3.3. Isolate or cover mission-essential equipment (with tarps, plastic sheeting, and over-
          head cover) to prevent contamination from being deposited on the equipment.
          4.5.1.3.4. Respond correctly to attack and CBRN hazard warnings. If time permits, seek the
          best available protection and assume MOPP 4 (or as directed by the commander).
          4.5.1.3.5. Remain vigilant; avoid driving or walking through suspected chemical agent pud-
          dles, mists, etc. Monitor and report CBRN detector response.
58                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


            4.5.1.3.6. Avoid contamination from unexpected sources. For example, discarded contami-
            nated clothing, chemical detector equipment, air filters, and similar items are potential sources
            of recontamination if not disposed of properly.
            4.5.1.3.7. Perform operational decontamination on contaminated items as needed and take
            contaminated waste to unit waste-disposal points. Obey all restrictions placed on previously
            contaminated items. NOTE: Low levels of contamination may continue after decontamination
            and present a hazard to personnel nearby.
            4.5.1.3.8. Ensure the control of contaminated areas, facilities, and equipment to prevent the
            spread of contamination. Use personal protective covers or coatings and removal of these cov-
            ers or coatings upon entry into uncontaminated areas.
            4.5.1.3.9. See AFTTP (I) 3-2.56, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chem-
            ical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance, for more information
            on CBRN contamination avoidance procedures.
     4.5.2. Protection.
        4.5.2.1. Collective Protection (COLPRO). COLPRO provides relief from sustained operations
        in full CBRN protective equipment and provides clean environments for operations that cannot be
        performed under CBRN-contaminated conditions. COLPRO neutralizes or removes CBRN haz-
        ards from personnel and equipment, minimizes the hazard and spread of contamination, and facil-
        itates the prompt restoration of normal operations.
        4.5.2.2. Individual Protection. When civil engineer forces must operate in a hostile chemical
        environment, individual protective equipment (IPE) must provide complete protection and allow a
        full range of movements. Detailed descriptions of individual protective equipment can be found in
        applicable equipment technical orders. Figure 4.4. are examples of several CBRN protective
        ensembles. At the onset of a chemical attack, the primary concern will be the proper use of this
        equipment as well as recognition of the factors which may limit effectiveness in a chemical envi-
        ronment.
            4.5.2.2.1. Limiting Factors for Personnel in Protective Ensembles. Maximum effective-
            ness of forces in a chemical environment requires the base civil engineer (BCE) to be aware of
            the factors which limit individual effectiveness while operating in a protective chemical
            ensemble. Recognizing the significance of these factors, the BCE can schedule tasks in a man-
            ner that will reduce the impact on mission accomplishment.

Figure 4.4. Work Requirements Influence Type of Chemical Ensemble Used.




             4.5.2.2.1.1. Heat Exhaustion. One of the most critical factors for personnel working in
             chemical protective gear is the ambient air temperature. Individuals working at moderate
             to heavy work rates under warm weather conditions will be highly susceptible to heat
             exhaustion. The symptoms for heat exhaustion range from dizziness to fainting. The per-
             centage of casualties from heat exhaustion is reduced if personnel are in good physical
             condition and have time to become acclimated to wearing the ensemble. The emergency
             operations center (EOC) will direct work/rest cycles to minimize the effects of thermal
             stress. Table 4.5. provides general guidelines for work/rest cycles and water replacement.

information pertains to acclimated service personnel.
5 The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for at least
4 hours of work in the specified heat category. Individual water needs will vary ± 1/4 qt/hr.

                4.5.2.2.1.2. Fatigue. Operating in full chemical protective clothing and equipment tends
                to increase fatigue resulting from such factors as mask breathing resistance, increased
                body temperature from work energy and solar heat, and psychological and physiological
                stress. To maintain individual alertness and efficiency during these periods, supervisors
                should recognize the need for more frequent and longer rest periods.
                4.5.2.2.1.3. Senses. Individuals who are required to perform duties involving the senses,
                such as manual dexterity, visual acuity, or voice communication, will operate at decreased
                levels of efficiency. Increased peacetime training in protective ensembles will increase
                individual proficiency in these areas.
                4.5.2.2.1.4. Personal Needs. Personnel cannot be expected to perform in full chemical
                protection gear for an indefinite period. There must be designated safe areas where they
                can remove these overgarments and attend to personal needs such as eating, caring for
                wounds, showering, shaving, and elimination of body wastes.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                           61


        4.5.2.2.2. Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP). The limitations of the chemical
        warfare ensemble in terms of heat retention and bulkiness have long been recognized by the
        Air Force. Efforts have been under way for some time to develop an improved ensemble that
        overcomes these shortfalls. Until this improved system is fielded, however, the existing
        ensemble will have to remain the primary system for individual protection. To reduce individ-
        ual fatigue and permit increased efficiency when working in the ensemble, MOPP levels have
        been established. These levels range from wearing only the overgarment to donning the full
        complement of ensemble components. Normally, the MOPP levels for an installation are
        determined by the EOC based on intelligence data and existing conditions at the installation.
        Due to the high-intensity nature of some civil engineer installation recovery activities, the
        standard MOPP levels may not be responsive to mission deadlines or requirements. In such
        cases, MOPP levels can be altered by the installation command element. These alterations will
        allow personnel to further remove or loosen parts of their chemical protective equipment dur-
        ing times of decreased threat, thereby reducing heat-related casualties and maintaining a
        higher degree of effectiveness. This altered readiness posture should be based on the prevail-
        ing chemical threat, work rate, and ambient temperature range. Keep in mind that any reduc-
        tion in standard MOPP levels is a command decision, not one that is made on-scene in the
        field. Refer to AFMAN 10-2602, for more information on MOPP levels.
        4.5.2.2.3. Donning the Chemical Ensemble. Civil engineer Prime BEEF personnel receive
        hands-on training in the use of the chemical ensemble. This section is not intended to replace
        that training. Rather, it will provide general guidance and emphasize techniques which may be
        helpful in a chemical environment. Warning: Due to the short time required to receive a fatal
        dose of a chemical agent, donning of chemical protective gear at the first indication of chemi-
        cal attack is essential. Refer to Technical Order (T.O.) 14P3-1-141, Chemical Protective
        Ensemble, for proper donning procedures.
        4.5.2.2.4. Actions in the Event of a Chemical Attack. To help ensure their survival, engi-
        neers must know what to do if a chemical attack occurs. The following paragraphs provide
        information and recommendations that may help enhance individual survival during chemical
        attacks.
           4.5.2.2.4.1. Individual Actions Preceding a Chemical Attack. Installation commanders
           direct MOPP levels and variations by weighing operational requirements against the
           chemical threat. Individuals must remain alert and constantly aware of the chemical threat,
           especially if they are wearing less than full protective gear. Although wearing the ensem-
           ble may be uncomfortable, personnel do adapt to wearing protective clothing and equip-
           ment for extended periods. Despite possible discomfort, remain in MOPP until otherwise
           directed because the amount of time required to put on the protective ensemble during a
           chemical attack will usually be longer than the amount of time required to receive a casu-
           alty-producing dose of chemical agent. Now is also the time to once again review chemical
           alarms and signals. Alarm signals and actions may be location-specific, so review proce-
           dures again upon arrival at a deployed location. If possible, equipment and materials
           should be covered to prevent contamination. Plastic sheeting, canvas, shelter halves, pon-
           chos, vegetation, corrugated metal or any expedient material can be used for this protec-
           tion.
62                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


              4.5.2.2.4.2. Individual Actions During a Chemical Attack. Individuals may suffer inju-
              ries from an attack that occurs directly at their location or upwind from that area. In either
              case, individuals should take defensive actions when they recognize or are alerted to a
              chemical attack. Table 4.6. provides samples of defensive actions that individuals should
              take during a chemical attack. Note: Individual actions should be adjusted to conform to
              local policies and procedures.

Table 4.6. Individual Attack Response Actions.
                                 Actions for Personnel In Open Areas
Seek the best available protection (e.g., building, bunker).
Move to a ditch, depression, or structure that provides protection from the blast, fragments, and small
arms fire if a building or bunker is not available.
Drop to the ground, don the protective mask, crawl to the closest available protection, and don the
remaining individual protective equipment (IPE) if no warning is received and an attack begins.
Perform buddy checks, ensuring that the IPE is worn correctly.
Use available material to provide overhead cover (e.g., rain gear, poncho, tarp, or plastic).
Perform self-aid and buddy care while maintaining a low profile.
   If the skin or eyes are contaminated, decontaminate them.
   If clothing or equipment is contaminated, decontaminate as soon as the situation permits.
                     Actions for Vehicle/Equipment Operators and Passengers
Drive to the best available protection within 1 minute, while passengers don IPE.
Move the vehicle or equipment into or under shelter if possible.
Drive near a ditch, depression, or structure that provides protection from the blast, fragments, and small
arms fire if no shelter is available.
Exit, take cover, and don IPE.
Perform buddy checks, ensuring that the IPE is worn correctly.
Perform self-aid and buddy care while maintaining a low profile.
   If the skin or eyes are contaminated, decontaminate them.
   If clothing or equipment is contaminated, decontaminate as soon as the situation permits.
                                              All Personnel
If indoors, close doors and windows if time permits.
If outdoors, cover exposed items with plastic if time allows.

              4.5.2.2.4.3. Individual Actions After a Chemical Attack. Following a chemical attack,
              the individual should remain in full chemical protective gear and continue the mission.
              First aid should be provided to casualties in the immediate vicinity, and status reports
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               63


                should be forwarded to local supervisors or commanders. If exposed skin was contami-
                nated, decontamination should proceed immediately. As time permits, inspect clothing and
                equipment for contamination and decontaminate as appropriate. Individuals should not
                remove protective clothing and equipment until advised that the area is safe.
                4.5.2.2.4.4. Conditions for Unmasking Following a Chemical Attack. P e r s o n n e l
                should not unmask after a chemical or potential attack until authorized by the installation
                commander. Notification of all clear conditions will normally be disseminated from the
                EOC over a giant voice broadcasting system and/or other notification systems. Outlying
                areas may have to be notified by radio or runner.
   4.5.3. Decontamination. CBRN agent contamination should be avoided when possible. When this is
   not possible, personnel and equipment must be decontaminated to reduce or eliminate the risk to per-
   sonnel and to make equipment serviceable. The levels of decontamination are immediate, operational,
   thorough, and clearance as described in Table 4.7.

Table 4.7. Levels of Decontamination. (Source: AFTTP (I) 3-2.60.)
                                        Decontamination Levels
                   Immediate decontamination minimizes casualties and limits the spread or transfer of
   Immediate
                   contamination.
                   Operational decontamination sustains operations by reducing the contact hazard,
  Operational      limiting the spread of contamination, and eliminating or reducing the duration that
                   MOPP equipment must be used.
                   Thorough decontamination reduces contamination to the lowest detectable level by the
                   use of tactical-level capabilities. The intent of thorough decontamination is to reduce
   Thorough
                   or eliminate the level of MOPP. This is accomplished by units (with or without external
                   support) when operations and resources permit.
                   Clearance decontamination provides decontamination to a level that allows
   Clearance
                   unrestricted transportation, maintenance, employment, and disposal.

      4.5.3.1. Methods of Decontamination. Decontamination is accomplished by neutralization,
      physical removal, and weathering. The following paragraphs define each of these methods.
          4.5.3.1.1. Neutralization. Neutralization is the most widely used method of decontamination,
          particularly for chemical warfare (CW) agents. Neutralization is the reaction of the contami-
          nating agent with other chemicals to render the agent less toxic or nontoxic. When mixed with
          a reactive decontaminant, the agent is converted into other substances (i.e., reaction products).
          The reactive decontaminant may be a commonly available material (e.g., household bleach) or
          a specifically designed decontaminating agent. Table 4.8. lists measurements and weights of
          containers that could be used for decontaminant.
          4.5.3.1.2. Physical Removal. Physical removal is the relocation of the contamination from
          one mission-critical surface to another less important location. Physical removal generally
          leaves the contamination in toxic form. It often involves the subsequent neutralization of the
          contamination. For example, if soap and water are used to remove the agent, the runoff may be
          drained into a pit containing bleaching powder. However, depending on mission requirements,
          physical removal can be an effective technique without subsequent neutralization.
64                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


         4.5.3.1.3. Weathering. Weathering involves such processes as evaporation and irradiation to
         remove or destroy the contaminant. The contaminated item is exposed to natural elements
         (e.g., sun, wind, heat, precipitation) to dilute or destroy the contaminant to the point of reduced
         or negligible hazard. This may be as simple as letting a vehicle sit in the hot desert sun to bake
         off the contaminant. Natural weathering is the simplest and most often preferred method of
         decontamination, particularly for terrain and non-mission-essential buildings and roads.

      4.5.3.2. Principles of Decontamination Operations. Decontaminate immediately for an agent
      on the skin. Perform higher levels of decontamination as a result of risk assessment. Personnel
      should consider the following:
         4.5.3.2.1. Speed. Personnel should conduct decontamination operations as quickly as possi-
         ble. Direct exposure to some CBRN, TIC, or TIM agents will create casualties and could be
         fatal within minutes. The sooner equipment is decontaminated, the less likely it is to absorb the
         agent or spread to other surfaces.
         4.5.3.2.2. Need. Decontaminate only what is necessary. Personnel have a limited amount of
         resources available and should expend resources only where they are needed.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            65


        4.5.3.2.3. Priority. Decontaminate the most essential items first; foremost will be the skin if
        contact occurs. Once wearing protective equipment, personnel should begin decontamination
        operations on clothing, equipment, and vehicles.
        4.5.3.2.4. Limited Area. Personnel should perform decontamination near the area where the
        contamination occurs. This limits the spread of contamination to other areas and reduces the
        time spent traveling.
     4.5.3.3. Decontamination Response. Installation commanders decide whether decontamination
     is required to restore combat power and, if so, what level of decontamination is required (see
     Table 4.9.). As mentioned in Paragraph 4.5.3., levels of decontamination are immediate, opera-
     tional, thorough, and clearance. Immediate and operational decontamination are time-critical.
     These levels of decontamination save lives and help to regenerate and maintain combat power.
     The units and activities affected will continue their primary mission. However, the level of effort
     required for thorough and clearance decontamination will remove the unit (for an extended period
     of time) from the primary mission. Decontamination is not a sequential process that requires the
     conduct (in order) of immediate, operational, and thorough decontamination. For example, weath-
     ering may alleviate the requirement to conduct thorough decontamination.

              4.5.3.3.1. Immediate. Immediate decontamination is carried out to save lives and reduce pen-
              etration of agent into surfaces. This may include decontamination of personnel, clothing, and
              equipment. Immediate decontamination will help prevent casualties and permit the use of indi-
              vidual equipment and key systems.
                 4.5.3.3.1.1. Skin decontamination is a basic survival skill and should be performed within
                 one minute of being contaminated. Decontamination of the eyes is an immediate decon-
                 tamination action that involves flushing the eyes with water as soon as possible following
                 contamination.
                 4.5.3.3.1.2. Personal wipe down should be performed within 15 minutes. This is done to
                 remove contamination from individual equipment. Use detector paper or an ICAM to
                 locate the agent. Use a radiac set to locate radiological contamination; and then brush,
                 wipe, or shake it off.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             67


           4.5.3.3.1.3. Operator wipe down should be done within 15 minutes. Operators use the
           M295 Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit to decontaminate the surfaces they need
           to touch or contact to operate the equipment. Radiological contamination in the form of
           dust particles may be wiped, scraped, or brushed off.
        4.5.3.3.2. Operational. Operational decontamination is carried out by contaminated units
        (with possible assistance from a decontamination unit). It is restricted to the specific parts of
        contaminated, operationally essential equipment, material, and work areas to minimize contact
        and transfer hazards and to sustain operations. This may include individual decontamination
        beyond the scope of immediate decontamination, decontamination of mission-essential equip-
        ment, and limited terrain decontamination. Operational decontamination reduces the level of
        contamination, thus lessening the chance of spread and transfer. When combined with weath-
        ering, MOPP levels may be reduced without further decontamination, depending on the sur-
        face or material being decontaminated and the agent.
           4.5.3.3.2.1. Contamination control procedures are performed when the presence of CBRN
           hazards are suspected or confirmed. Personnel in MOPP4 that become contaminated will
           experience performance degradation, and must process through the CCA. The CCA allows
           gross contamination to be removed from personnel and equipment, provides temporary
           relief from MOPP4 operations, and permits a return to an increased operating tempo
           (OPTEMPO) in pursuit of mission accomplishment.
           4.5.3.3.2.2. To be effective, operational decontamination operations should be performed
           within 15 minutes of contamination. For equipment that is painted with a chemical
           agent-resistant coating (CARC); decontamination operations may be delayed up to 6
           hours.
        4.5.3.3.3. Thorough. Detailed equipment and aircraft decontamination is conducted as part
        of a reconstitution effort during breaks in combat operations. These operations require
        immense logistical support and are manpower-intensive. Thorough decontamination is carried
        out to reduce contamination on personnel, equipment, materiel, and work areas. This permits
        the partial or total removal of IPE and maintains operations with minimum degradation. While
        conducting thorough decontamination, contaminated units will be non-mission-capable. The
        resulting decrease in MOPP will allow the unit to operate with restored effectiveness.
           4.5.3.3.3.1. The detailed equipment and aircraft decontamination restores items so that
           they can be used without protective equipment. As a safety measure, some services require
           the use of protective gloves until clearance decontamination has been completed. These
           operations require support from a CBRN decontamination unit or element.
           4.5.3.3.3.2. Representative actions that may follow a thorough decontamination include:
           (1) replacing personnel who may have become injured or ill during decontamination oper-
           ations; (2) reordering supplies (e.g., detector paper, decontamination solution, decontami-
           nation kits and apparatuses); (3) maintaining or repairing vehicles and equipment,
           including recalibration or replacement of detectors and alarms; (4) marking used decon-
           tamination sites and selecting new decontamination sites, reporting old and new decon-
           tamination sites, and recording and reporting previously contaminated personnel and
           equipment; (5) documenting resource expenditures; (6) conducting force health protection;
           and (7) preparing after-action reviews.

        4.5.3.3.4. Clearance. Clearance decontamination of equipment and personnel allows the
        operation to continue unrestricted. Decontamination at this level will probably be conducted at
        or near a shipyard, advanced base, or other industrial facility. Clearance decontamination
        involves factors such as suspending normal activities, withdrawing personnel, and having
        materials and facilities not normally present. Essentially, resources from an industrial base
        (e.g., Army Materiel Command, Air Force Material Command, Naval Sea Systems Command,
        and Marine Corps Systems Command [MARCORSYSCOM]) will be required. During clear-
        ance decontamination, resource expenditures are documented, force health protection mea-
        sures are conducted, and after-action reviews are prepared.
     4.5.3.4. Decontamination Procedures. Decontamination is the removal or neutralization of haz-
     ardous levels of contamination from personnel, equipment, materiel, and terrain. The ultimate pur-
     pose of decontamination is to restore full combat power in the shortest possible time. The
     following paragraphs will briefly discuss various types of equipment used for decontamination
     and personnel, limited area, and vehicle decontamination activities.
        4.5.3.4.1. Decontamination Equipment and Material. Various materials and equipment
        may be used to assist civil engineer personnel in their decontamination tasks. For personnel
        decontamination, the M291 skin decontamination kit is used. The M295 individual equipment
        decontamination kit provides a means to decontaminate individual equipment through physi-
        cal removal and absorption of chemical agents, with no long-term harmful side effects. For
        area and vehicle decontamination, other materials and equipment may be required. The fol-
        lowing paragraphs describe decontamination equipment and materials which may be useful to
        civil engineer forces in a chemical environment.
            4.5.3.4.1.1. M291 Skin Decontamination Kit. The M291 kit (Figure 4.5.) provides the
            user the capability to completely decontaminate through physical removal, absorption, and
            neutralization of chemical agents on the skin. This wallet-sized kit contains six separately
            packaged laminated pads soaked with the nontoxic decontaminant Ambergard XE-555.
            Ambergard absorbs and neutralizes chemical agent. M291 pads are used to wipe skin,
            clothing, masks, gloves, personal equipment, and weapons. The six pads of an M291 kit
            should be sufficient for three personal decontaminations. The kit operates in ranges from
            -50°F to 120°F (See T.O. 11D1-1-131).

             4.5.3.4.1.2. M295 Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit. The M295 kit (Figure
             4.6.) allows the individual to decontaminate their equipment through physical removal and
             absorption of chemical agents. Each M295 kit consists of a carrying pouch containing four
             individual decontamination packets. Each packet contains a decontamination mitt filled
             with decontamination powder. The packet is designed to fit comfortably in the pocket of
             the ground crew ensemble. Each individual mitt is comprised of absorbent resin contained
             within a non-woven polyester material. The kit operates in ranges from -25°F to 180°F.
             Refer to Technical Manual TM-3-4230-235-10 for additional information.

             4.5.3.4.1.3. Joint Service Personal Decontamination System (JSPDS). T h e J S P D S ,
             also known as the Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion or RSDL (Figure 4.7.), is a
             broad-spectrum liquid CW agent decontaminant that will remove and destroy military
             chemical agents on contact. After CW agent destruction, JSPDS leaves a nontoxic residue
             that may be washed off with water. It does not need to be removed immediately. JSPDS is
             safe for use on all intact skin surfaces and for limited duration use in the eyes. JSPDS
             reacts rapidly, providing the full removal and destruction of CW agents within 2 minutes,
70                                                                  AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


             enabling efficient decontamination of casualties. The JSPDS is fielded with three kits per
             package.

             4.5.3.4.1.4. Fire Trucks and Water Tankers. Fire trucks, water tankers, and other equip-
             ment capable of carrying or pumping large quantities of water may be used for decontam-
             ination tasks. Fire trucks are especially useful; they are capable of moving to a
             contaminated area or piece of equipment, decontaminating the item with high-pressure
             spray, and moving to the next location (Figure 4.8.). However, following an attack, fire
             vehicles may be unavailable due to firefighting requirements. After firefighters have
             accomplished all other required mission responsibilities, such as emergency responses and
             fire protection standby requirements, they may be called upon to assist in area contamina-
             tion control procedures. The firefighter’s role is restricted to flushing contaminated sur-
             faces with large amounts of water. The wing or installation commander will direct to what
             extent fire vehicles will be used for this purpose.

      4.5.3.5. Personnel Decontamination. Decontamination of personnel is a vital step in the recov-
      ery process following a chemical attack. Persons going into collective shelters must remove chem-
      ically contaminated protective gear to prevent contamination of the interior of the shelter.
      Individuals who have been operating for extended periods in the chemical environment require
      decontamination and fresh clothing to prevent injury or death from the effects of the chemical
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            71


     agent. Decontamination must be performed before commanders allow forces to remove portions
     of their protective ensembles following the all clear signal. Although not responsible for decon-
     tamination of personnel other than their own, civil engineers must anticipate being called upon to
     set up expedient decontamination facilities and to provide assistance in the installation-wide
     decontamination operation. Personnel are normally decontaminated as they process into a collec-
     tive protection facility by removing their contaminated protective equipment. If no collective pro-
     tection facility is available, an open air contamination control area should be established.
     Contamination on skin surfaces should be removed by using the M258A1, M291, or the JSPDS.
     When the situation allows, personnel should be allowed to shower. Readiness and Emergency
     Management personnel can provide further guidance.
     4.5.3.6. Area Decontamination. Large area decontamination is generally not feasible with cur-
     rent equipment. However, small areas can be decontaminated if necessary. Installation functions
     that can continue without area decontamination should be left to the natural decontamination pro-
     cess of weathering. AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning, states that lim-
     ited area (roads, grounds, buildings, facilities, aprons, taxiways, and runways) decontamination is
     the responsibility of the BCE. Most units task the heavy repair element of the operations flight to
     identify, train, and equip personnel to perform area decontamination. There are also numerous
     entrance ways and pieces of equipment that will require decontamination before civil engineer
     forces can accomplish their maintenance and repair duties. Common area decontamination meth-
     ods are discussed in the following paragraphs.
        4.5.3.6.1. Decontamination of Various Surfaces. The areas that civil engineers may be
        asked to decontaminate could vary considerably. It could be a paved surface, a vital installa-
        tion structure, or an area covered by grass and vegetation. Under most circumstances, it will be
        best to allow the contamination to weather and dissipate naturally.
            4.5.3.6.1.1. Hard Surfaces. If small hard surface areas must be decontaminated, use
            soapy water spray to remove the contamination. Use of bleach will aid in neutralizing the
            agent.
            4.5.3.6.1.2. Grass and Low Vegetation. The only way to effectively decontaminate veg-
            etation areas is by burning. Gasoline, fuel oil or other methods may be used to start the
            fires. Spreading dry bleach over the burned area will reduce the residual contamination
            hazard. Warning: Vaporized chemical agents mixed with the smoke created by this
            method may create a downwind hazard. Note: Natural weathering is usually preferable to
            burning.
        4.5.3.6.2. Buildings. Buildings are also difficult to decontaminate. Chemical agents settle
        into cracks and joints and are hard to dislodge. On wooden buildings, toxic chemical materials
        may soak into the wood and be virtually impossible to remove. When decontamination is nec-
        essary, wash with hot soapy water solution or apply high-pressure steam to the surface. Nor-
        mally, complete decontamination of a building is not necessary. It will generally suffice to
        limit decontamination efforts to the entry areas of a structure.
        4.5.3.6.3. Equipment. Civil engineer equipment, such as generators, air compressors, and
        other specialized gear, should be decontaminated before they are repaired. Scrubbing with a
        chlorine bleach solution, washing with hot soapy water, and applying high-pressure steam or
        water are all viable decontamination methods. Warning: Despite basic decontamination,
72                                                                    AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


          deadly contaminants can remain trapped in the air breathing equipment of generator engines
          and air compressors.
      4.5.3.7. Vehicle Decontamination. According to AFI 10-211, transportation personnel will
      decontaminate civil engineer vehicles and Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) support equipment.
      This does not relieve the civil engineer unit from being knowledgeable of equipment decontami-
      nation procedures. If an enemy attack is severe, transportation personnel alone may not suffice to
      decontaminate the needed equipment. Additionally, civil engineer forces should be prepared to
      assist in the development of expedient vehicle decontamination sites.
          4.5.3.7.1. Vehicle Decontamination Sites. Hundreds of gallons of water and other liquid
          agents may be used to decontaminate equipment. Runoff from the decontamination site must
          be controlled to prevent contamination of water sources and other areas off the installation. If
          the decontamination site is established on an unimproved surface, measures must be taken to
          prevent the development of massive bogs and mud holes in which vehicles could become
          stuck.
          4.5.3.7.2. Decontamination Sites on Hard Surfaces. Vehicle decontamination sites on hard
          surfaces require no assistance from civil engineers other than the control of runoff. If no ade-
          quate, permanent drainage system is available, the best method of controlling runoff is to dig
          channels around the lower end of the surface to direct the runoff into a sump (Figure 4.9.). Dry
          bleach or other active agents can then be spread over the sump area to deactivate the toxic
          chemical. If runoff from the decontamination site does not pose an immediate threat to other
          functions on the installation, it is not necessary to devote manpower to constructing the chan-
          nels and sump.

Figure 4.9. Hard Surface Decontamination Site.




          4.5.3.7.3. Decontamination Sites on Unimproved Surfaces. The size of the decontamina-
          tion site will depend on the size of the decontamination operation, the manpower and materials
          available for construction, and the time available for construction. A minimum length of 50
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            73


          feet is needed if the decontamination site is to accommodate the wash, scrub, and rinse stages
          of equipment decontamination. The following paragraphs provide some suggested methods.
             4.5.3.7.3.1. Crushed Stone. Digging a broad, shallow ditch and filling it with crushed
             stone (Figure 4.10.) will prevent vehicles from becoming mired in large mud holes during
             decontamination operations. Ideally, the ditch should be gently sloped on rising ground to
             promote drainage. The crushed stone used should be from 1 1/2 inches to 3 inches in size.
             In the absence of adequate stone for construction of this type of site, a dry, rocky stream
             bed in the area could be used as an acceptable substitute.

Figure 4.10. Crushed Stone Decontamination Site.




             4.5.3.7.3.2. Corduroy Road. Corduroy roads were used extensively in the past to over-
             come travel difficulties caused by bad weather. Civil engineer units can construct small
             sections of these roads using logs, heavy timber, or utility poles to provide an improved
             surface for vehicle decontamination sites. As illustrated in Figure 4.11., these items pro-
             vide a stable surface for decontamination of tracked and wheeled vehicles without creating
             a large muddy area.

4.6. Summary. This chapter presented basic guidance on overcoming the effects of CBRN attacks and
releases through the use of a number of chemical defense measures. These measures enhance individual
survival and installation recovery after a chemical attack. Individual survival is improved by understand-
ing how CBRN agents and materials kill or incapacitate personnel. The ability to conduct personnel,
equipment, vehicle, and gross area decontamination is also crucial to an installation’s recovery—person-
nel decontamination facilities and equipment decontamination sites must be developed to ensure that
effective decontamination can take place. See AFTTP (I) 3-2.60 for more information on decontamination
concepts, principles, and detailed decontamination procedures.

                                 FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES (FES)

5.1. Introduction. Fire suppression, a critical concern during day-to-day operations, becomes increas-
ingly more important during and following an emergency. The effects of a major disaster or hostile attack
can be overwhelming, but they are greatly compounded by uncontrolled fires. The effectiveness of an
installation’s fire protection can reduce the installation’s susceptibility to fires, but no amount of fire pro-
tection can completely eliminate the danger of fire during certain contingency situations. A major gas
explosion, a fuel spill, an earthquake, or an enemy attack is almost certain to increase the likelihood of a
serious fire (Figure 5.1.).

Figure 5.1. Firefighters Battle Fuel Spill Fire At Kirkuk AB, Iraq.




5.2. Overview. This chapter will address fire protection roles and responsibilities, equipment and materi-
als, manpower support, and safety considerations. Fire protection operations will then be discussed con-
centrating on command and control, response considerations, and communications. The second half of
this chapter will relate to auxiliary firefighting concepts and responsibilities, techniques used by engineer
personnel serving as auxiliary firefighters, and concepts for search and rescue operations.

5.3. Roles and Responsibilities. The primary role of FES during and just after an emergency is to rescue
survivors, keep loss of life to a minimum, and extinguish or prevent the spread of fire. In wartime situa-
tions, these taskings must be put in the context of ensuring weapon systems are able to regenerate to meet
operational taskings. The factors that influence the ability to meet this primary role are the accessibility to
the mishap, time of arrival, and the availability of FES resources, all of which are often not controllable
by firefighters. To counteract this uncertainty, it is essential that all FES members be well trained and pre-
pared to react to a variety of circumstances.
   5.3.1. Base Fire Marshal. As the base fire marshal, it is the responsibility of the BCE to assist the
   installation commander in discharging FES responsibilities. This means the BCE must use personal
   knowledge, as well as the pool of knowledge represented by the fire chief and other FES personnel, to
   provide the commander accurate information for decision-making.
76                                                                         AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


        5.3.1.1. During any contingency, the BCE continuously reevaluates the situation, always main-
        taining an overview of the total picture to prevent unnecessarily using all resources against a sin-
        gle problem area. The decisions the BCE makes under emergency conditions must be based on
        their impact on the total installation mission. For example, FES resources may have to be diverted
        from a warehouse fire to control flames and clear wreckage of a burning aircraft so that other air-
        craft can take off and land. Each situation requires two important considerations—how to respond
        to the hazard and how the decision impacts the overall mission capability. In the above example,
        saving the warehouse at the expense of flying operations might have jeopardized the entire instal-
        lation mission.
        5.3.1.2. The FES response to contingencies places the BCE in a position of awesome responsibil-
        ity, but there is virtually no situation that cannot be overcome by the application of the collective
        experience of the civil engineer force and the implementation of well-rehearsed contingency
        response procedures. An understanding of the decision-making process for controlling hazards
        greatly enhances the BCE’s effectiveness as base fire marshal. First, when a hazard is discovered,
        immediate action is taken to contain the situation. This may require evacuation of a building, inter-
        ruption of utilities service to the affected site, and discontinuation of an ongoing activity; e.g., air-
        craft refueling or welding in a dangerous area. Second, the BCE (or designated representative)
        joins the fire chief in a joint inspection of the hazard situation. The responsible organizational
        commander is also alerted to the problem and advised of necessary corrective action. If these steps
        do not resolve the problem, the BCE advises the installation commander who makes a decision to
        continue or cease the hazardous operation. The installation safety officer must also be informed
        promptly. The point is: do not make decisions for higher authority unless time and imminent haz-
        ard require you to do so; then advise the commander of your decision immediately.
        5.3.1.3. The discussion in the previous paragraph outlines a process found to be effective during
        attack preparations and other instances where time is available for a more methodical approach. In
        an attack environment, however, time will not be available for a predetermined step-by-step
        approach, and hazardous and emergency conditions will be much more numerous. Because of the
        emergency and expedient nature of the attack recovery environment, some situations which would
        be considered hazardous in peacetime or before an attack occurs will have to be tolerated. Addi-
        tionally, joint on-scene meetings of key personnel and notification of several different installation
        agencies will not be feasible for every emergency occurrence. Delegation of authority to FES per-
        sonnel (e.g., the fire chief or other on-scene command and control FES personnel) will be neces-
        sary. They will have to know the responsibilities of the base fire marshal and oftentimes make the
        decisions appropriate to this position since the base fire marshal may be serving in the much
        broader role of base civil engineer on the EOC CAT. Inherent in this tasking is the need for these
        individuals to understand how their response to a specific emergency impacts the installation mis-
        sion as a whole. For example, evacuating a sizable area, which might be done in peacetime for
        safety purposes, may be a severe mission hindrance in wartime in that it could interfere with air-
        craft turnaround or activities of other emergency base recovery crews. The ability to be flexible,
        realistically assess risk, and maintain an overall installation mission perspective is needed on the
        part of FES command and control personnel. It is the base fire marshal’s job to ensure FES person-
        nel gain this experience, knowledge, and expertise prior to a wartime or contingency situation.
     5.3.2. CONUS Versus Theater Fire Suppression. The procedures for fire suppression are similar
     for CONUS and theater locations. Minor differences involve available manpower and types of emer-
     gencies.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               77


     5.3.2.1. CONUS locations are not subject to rapid conventional attacks which could quickly
     engulf a theater installation in flames. However, broken gas mains and ruptured POL storage tanks
     during an earthquake at a CONUS airfield could produce similar results. CONUS FES must be
     capable of responding to fires under two conditions—with a full complement of military and civil-
     ian personnel available and with civilians only when military Prime BEEF members are deployed.
     The limitations imposed by deployments make it essential that high-priority facilities receive first
     response from the reduced FES force during large-scale fires. Reciprocal agreements with
     off-base fire departments will pay dividends during emergencies when the residual firefighting
     force is at diminished strength. Civilian firefighters must be aware that their services will be more
     demanding when military firefighters are deployed. They should expect to be placed on extended
     or altered shifts and take a fully active role in all leadership positions. If conditions permit even-
     tual backfills with military FES personnel from other units, these individuals must be integrated
     into the CONUS installation FES force rapidly and effectively. Programs for thorough installation
     familiarization and specialized training (e.g., wide-frame aircraft firefighting at an aerial port)
     must be immediately available for these augmenting personnel.
     5.3.2.2. The theater BCE must execute fire suppression plans under the prevailing threat of both
     rapid conventional attack and natural disasters. Since the theater BCE’s military forces are nor-
     mally in place, major loss of forces due to deployments should not be a limiting factor. The BCE’s
     civilian firefighters should be available for natural disaster response; but in some locations, their
     wartime availability could be suspect. At most locations Prime BEEF firefighting teams from the
     CONUS should be augmenting theater forces and be in place prior to hostilities as part of the
     USAF deterrent force posture. The USAF fire chief at each augmented theater installation must
     ensure that these augmenting forces are quickly integrated into the installation’s FES capability
     and trained on support of the weapon systems assigned to that installation. In the event, however,
     that augmenting forces have not arrived, each theater installation should be prepared to operate, at
     least initially, with in-place military forces only. Even if the BCE has a full complement of fire-
     fighters available, the fires resulting from a massive enemy attack can quickly overwhelm a fully
     staffed FES flight. For this reason, theater forces, like their CONUS counterparts, must also be
     prepared to react to fires on a priority basis.
     5.3.2.3. At some theater locations, there may be no USAF firefighters in place. Typical of such
     situations could be a bare base operation where only a token host nation firefighting presence
     exists. A bare base operation of this type places unique and difficult demands on deployed Prime
     BEEF firefighter personnel. The USAF fire chief and supporting fire service personnel must take
     several actions quickly upon arrival to establish a fire protection and crash rescue response pos-
     ture. The more important tasks that must be accomplished include the following:
        5.3.2.3.1. Determine, in concert with host nation firefighting personnel, who is responsible for
        what in terms of areas, facilities, weapon systems, etc.
        5.3.2.3.2. Determine similar responsibilities as above with firefighting personnel of other US
        military services if they are also present at the bare base location.
        5.3.2.3.3. Ascertain the status and availability of firefighting assets that will be used by USAF
        forces.
        5.3.2.3.4. Train firefighting personnel on assets that are unique or differ significantly from
        those in the USAF inventory.

        5.3.2.3.5. Familiarize firefighting personnel with the installation layout and critical facilities
        and systems.
        5.3.2.3.6. Ensure fire protection features are incorporated into the layout, erection, and con-
        struction of tent cities and other mobile facility assets.
        5.3.2.3.7. Determine shortfalls and supply and equipment requisition needs.
        5.3.2.3.8. Develop operating procedures for use during attack response and recovery time-
        frames.
     5.3.2.4. Safety Responsibilities. FES personnel have a responsibility both to themselves and to
     the installation populace with respect to safety. Any major firefighting operation is inherently dan-
     gerous and must be undertaken only by skilled personnel familiar with the hazards involved.
        5.3.2.4.1. The maintenance of fire safety is a greater problem in contingency situations than
        during normal, day-to-day operations. Conditions which are likely to prevail during an emer-
        gency require a greater awareness and adherence to fire safety practices. Temporary shelters,
        such as tent cities, set up to house displaced personnel and augmenting forces are especially
        vulnerable to fire. Occupants of these facilities must be made aware of the dangers and instruc-
        tions regarding appropriate safety precautions. It is also likely that many operations will be
        performed under conditions of increased stress and discomfort. Personnel will be tired, pres-
        sures will be on for getting a job done quickly, and the working environment could be austere.
        These factors can produce a situation where fire safety is not a paramount concern among
        work crews and the potential for a serious accident is high.
        5.3.2.4.2. A safety consideration which is common to theater installations is the danger asso-
        ciated with foreign electrical systems. The 220 or 380 voltage system found at most overseas
        locations presents a greater hazard to firefighters in the form of dangling “hot” wires or when
        hit by a stream of water from the fire hose than does a typical CONUS 110-volt system. As a
        consequence, a primary action in any fire suppression effort at theater installations is the isola-
        tion of the facility electrical supply. Introduction of firefighters to the host nation’s electrical
        system and most common methods of isolation must be a part of the FES installation familiar-
        ization program.
        5.3.2.4.3. The most pronounced fire safety problem during wartime is the inferno that could
        result from an enemy attack on an Air Force installation. In such a situation, FES’s task will be
        one of containment and suppression rather than education, prevention, and oversight. It is also
        here, however, that the efforts taken with respect to training the installation populace and pre-
        planning prior to hostilities pay off. Fire safety features such as instructing personnel on extin-
        guisher use, maintaining fire safety distances during beddown construction, and enforcing
        proper storage and warehousing practices, aid in limiting the spread of fires and loss of mili-
        tary hardware and equipment. Even after an attack is over and facility fires have been con-
        trolled, FES combat support operations will remain at an increased level. For example, aircraft
        refueling and weapons loading will be at a much higher level than during peacetime, requiring
        fire equipment standby during hazardous operations. Additionally, FES should anticipate
        increased aircraft emergencies as pilots return from combat with battle damage and unspent
        ordnance.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                   79


5.4. Manning and Equipment. The most crucial ingredients in a successful contingency fire suppres-
sion effort are highly trained personnel and adequate firefighting equipment. The personnel that shape the
FES Unit Type Codes (UTC) are evolving. UTC manning information can be accessed at https://
www.afma.randolph.af.mil/orgunits/MAS/WartimeReadiness/MANFOR.asp. Other sources for spe-
cific FES Theater manning and equipment requirements are the CE Supplement to the War and Mobiliza-
tion Plan-1, Appendix 5, Fire Emergency Services (FES), and the CE UTC Management Community of
Practice (CoP) at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-23.
   5.4.1. Manpower. USAF firefighter manning at the vast majority of theater locations will consist of
   CONUS-supplied Prime BEEF teams or in-place forces with an augmenting Prime BEEF component
   from the CONUS. In wartime situations, firefighter manpower is increased so that complete
   around-the-clock coverage can be provided in consonance with increased sortie rates and surge
   requirements. The critical nature of fire suppression dictates that fire protection personnel are usually
   never diverted to other duties during contingency operations. The firefighter’s primary duty through-
   out an emergency or contingency is to provide fire suppression and rescue operations support. Under
   normal circumstances, firefighters should not be designated for such duties as airfield damage repair,
   structural repair, debris clearance, or security augmentation. Never allow firefighters or fire vehicles
   to accomplish explosive ordnance disposal duties. Participation in this very hazardous task could
   cause the installation to weaken its fire suppression and crash rescue capability. On the other hand,
   firefighters should be expected to prepare dispersal locations, hardening features, security positions,
   protective bunkers, etc., associated with their supplies and equipment during beddown and attack pre-
   paredness and planning time frames. In a bare base situation, they should set up the fire station com-
   plex. Additionally, in an attack recovery environment, firefighters should be expected to perform
   explosive ordnance reconnaissance to prevent damage to fire protection resources. Furthermore, when
   attack recovery is permitted, firefighters should be prepared to reconstruct protective revetments and
   other similar passive defense items supporting firefighting vehicles and supplies.
   5.4.2. Vehicles. Fire vehicles needed for expeditionary operations may be in place or pre-positioned.
   Where shortages exist, vehicles may be leased with adequate lead time; or, when lead time is not
   available, vehicles may be tasked from home station fleets and backfilled with leased vehicles as soon
   as possible. Unlike CONUS locations, expeditionary operations usually rely less on firefighting
   resources outside the flight, such as mutual aid fire departments. Consequently, more organic
   resources may be projected at deployed locations. Mutually beneficial reciprocal agreements are usu-
   ally developed locally at home station locations. Such agreements can make the resources of non-AF
   (local) fire departments available to mitigate risk that may occur when home station resources are
   deployed in support of expeditionary operations.
   Theater firefighting vehicles are usually configured to support various quantities of aircraft types at a
   beddown location. These vehicle configurations are somewhat flexible; i.e., a specific vehicle pack-
   age can support “X” number of small-frame aircraft or “Y” number of large-frame aircraft. The actual
   number and types of vehicles deployed to a real-world contingency or crisis will depend on the type
   of contingency, in-place firefighting assets, threat, availability of fire vehicles and airlift, and accept-
   able risks that often drive planning decisions.
   5.4.3. Extinguishing Agents. There are several extinguishing agents in use for Air Force fire sup-
   pression efforts. The agents range in complexity from plain water to complicated chemical com-
   pounds. Some of these agents are good for only one type of fire, while others will work on many types
   of fires. Due to the complexity of agent reaction with fire, there is no universal extinguishing agent.
80                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


     Magnesium metal fires, for example, must be extinguished with special chemical agents since the
     application of conventional agents can cause violent reactions. Besides water, common firefighting
     agents used during Air Force fire suppression operations are as follows:
        5.4.3.1. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF). AFFF is the primary firefighting agent used in
        most crash firefighting vehicles and is also used in some hangar fire suppression systems. Lighter
        than water or fuel, AFFF seals a fire to prevent reignition through mechanical separation of fuel
        from the oxidizer.
        5.4.3.2. Halogenated Extinguishing Agents (Halon). Halon extinguishes fire by reacting with
        the combustion products which are responsible for rapid flame propagation. Once the flaming
        combustion is stopped, radiant heat feedback to the fuel is also stopped, curtailing the production
        of flammable vapors and causing surface combustion to die out. Halon 1211 (Bromochlorodifluo-
        romethane) is the principal halogenated extinguishing agent used on some Air Force portable fire
        extinguishers.
        5.4.3.3. Dry Chemical. Dry chemical agents extinguish fire by separating the fuel from the oxi-
        dizer.
        5.4.3.4. Dry Powder. Dry powder agents extinguish fire by insulating the extremely hot fuels
        (such as metals) from the oxidizer. It also forms a barrier between adjacent materials and burning
        metals which cannot be extinguished.

5.5. FES Operations.
     5.5.1. Command and Control. Any uncertainty about the responsibility for directing firefighting
     operations can have disastrous results. During firefighting and rescue operations, no one outside the
     FES organization will give orders or interfere with the fire chief or firefighters. It must be known
     throughout the organization that the senior FES official is in charge at the scene of a fire or emergency.
     Keep in mind that this individual may not always be the chief or assistant chief. During wartime, mul-
     tiple fire responses or attrition may force more junior personnel to take command.
        5.5.1.1. The senior FES official controls the firefighting forces by radio, public address system,
        and runners. At the scene of every emergency operation, a control point is established by this indi-
        vidual. This control point must be the focal point of the operation where all support equipment and
        personnel report.
        5.5.1.2. Each level of supervision must be responsible for executing preplanned firefighting/crash
        rescue procedures tailored to meet the fire conditions at the scene. A strong and aggressive peace-
        time training program is required to support this effort.
     5.5.2. Response Criteria. An awareness of appropriate response criteria for FES personnel allows
     the BCE to make informed decisions for the employment of these forces during a contingency situa-
     tion. Table 5.1. outlines response criteria for various circumstances. The fire chief, after evaluating
     available resources, should formulate response criteria specific to his/her installation.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                     81

  On-Base Crash       Respond with all available equipment.
  Off-Base Crash      Response must be predetermined and authorized by the installation commander.
                      Strategically position crash equipment along the active runway. If an arresting
    Emergency         system engagement is anticipated, deploy most equipment on the end of the
     Landings         runway where the aircraft is to be engaged. Anticipate that the pilot may miss the
                      aircraft arresting system.
     Arresting        Keep all but essential personnel off the active runway. The objective is to return
      System          the runway to service quickly. The senior fire official on scene is in complete
    Engagement        charge until the danger of a fire is ruled out.
                      Refer to the Base Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2 for
   Bomb Threat        guidance. Do not permit firefighters to search for explosives. Hold firefighters
                      ready for first aid and fire control if the explosive detonates.
                      Do not place firefighters or equipment in unnecessary danger. Require security
                      forces’ protection for fire vehicles responding to unsecure areas.
       Riots/
 Terrorist Actions/ Consider installing screened windows and protective plating on fire vehicles.
  Enemy Attacks Enforce strict security of the fire station. Post armed guard, if necessary. Allow no
                    one to enter the fire station without the fire chief’s permission.
                      Respond only after the nature of the hazard has been determined and when a
                      specific response has been directed by the installation commander. If response is
  Chemical Attack
                      initiated, ensure that all firefighting personnel are clothed in the protective
                      chemical ensemble.

   5.5.3. Movement of Crash Vehicles. The movement of large firefighting vehicles to the site of an
   emergency can present several unforeseen difficulties. The size and weight of these vehicles may limit
   airlift capabilities. Large vehicles may only fit in larger transport aircraft or may have to be partially
   disassembled to fit intra-theater airlift aircraft. Long distance, over-the-road movement should not be
   attempted unless there is no alternative (ship, rail, land haul, or air). Most of the larger fire vehicles are
   not designed to be driven for long distances, which could overstress the drive engines causing them to
   fail. If the situation demands that these vehicles be driven over the road, conduct a reconnaissance to
   determine allowable bridge loadings, tunnel dimensions, clearances of utility crossings, road widths,
   grades, and surface roughness of the proposed route.
   5.5.4. Airfield Fire Suppression. Airfield fire suppression is a primary concern during disasters and
   enemy attacks. Airfield operations contain many potential ignition points in the form of fuel-filled air-
   craft, POL distribution points, and explosive munitions. Rapid response to any of these “hot spots”
   can mean the difference between a contained blaze and a towering, uncontrollable inferno.
       5.5.4.1. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Response Time. The prepositioning crite-
       ria for potential airfield crash and fire situations are outlined in Table 5.1. Maximum ARFF
       response time requirements for the first arriving major firefighting vehicles are indicated below.
       They include dispatch time, turnout time, and travel time to the incident site. (Source: DODI
       6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program.)
82                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


          5.5.4.1.1. One minute to any incident on the runways or overruns after pre-positioning for an
          announced emergency.
          5.5.4.1.2. Five minutes to any incident on the runways or overruns for an unannounced emer-
          gency.
       5.5.4.2. Response Procedures. While specific firefighting techniques are detailed in the appro-
       priate technical manuals, response procedures depend on the nature of the contingency. The BCE
       should assist FES operations by keeping the fire chief abreast of all unusual activities which may
       impact fire suppression requirements. For example, during contingencies that involve deploy-
       ments of aircraft from other locations, it is essential that FES personnel be aware of types, num-
       bers, and locations of additional aircraft that have arrived. These data are normally available from
       the aircraft maintenance personnel. Refueling locations, munitions loading areas, types and haz-
       ards of munitions, and munitions routes must be reported to FES.
          5.5.4.2.1. In responding to an airfield fire involving an aircraft crash, it is essential to know
          the aircraft’s fuel quantity, weapons, cargo, and number of occupants. This information will be
          passed to the controlling agency when the aircraft declares an emergency. The controlling
          agency then relays relevant information to FES. Using this data, FES flight personnel can refer
          to appropriate technical documents regarding munitions, fuel, or hazardous cargo and are then
          able to provide this information via radio to on-scene firefighting personnel (Figure 5.2.).

Figure 5.2. Aircraft Fuel, Occupants, and Munitions Information Is Vital to Firefighters.




          5.5.4.2.2. Information relayed from the flight crew can be extremely valuable to firefighting
          personnel at the scene of a crash. Knowing the number of persons on board, rescue personnel
          will not waste valuable time searching for additional survivors once the reported number of
          persons are accounted for. The aircraft fuel quantity will allow the firefighters to estimate the
          size of a potential fire. If the aircraft is carrying conventional weapons, T.O. 11A-1-46, Fire
          Fighting Guidance, Transportation and Storage Management Data, can be used by fire pro-
          tection personnel for guidance on all types of conventional weapons and munitions. This T.O.,
          used in conjunction with AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, provides the firefighter
          with adequate knowledge to effectively control conventional munitions hazards.
          These publications provide vital information concerning special explosion hazards (ejection of
          fuses, bomblets, missiles, etc.), chemical hazards, net explosive weights, types of protective
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 83


          clothing required, fire symbols, and safe withdrawal distances. Table 5.2. provides an example
          of data that can be found in the aforementioned publications.
          5.5.4.2.3. If the aircraft involved in the crash is carrying nuclear weapons, consult applicable
          11N-series technical orders for applicable firefighting guidance. A major difference between
          firefighting operations involving nuclear weapons and those involving conventional munitions
          is the radiation hazard. There is no danger of nuclear detonation, but the high explosive com-
          ponent of the weapon may detonate when engulfed in fire which can rupture the bomb and
          release radioactive contamination.

      5.5.4.3. Use of Prefire Plans. Prefire plans are developed according to T.O. 00-105E-9 for indi-
      vidual types of aircraft prior to an emergency using AFTO Form 88, Aircraft Prefire Plan, or sim-
      ilar automated product. When aircraft crashes or fires occur during contingency situations, the use
      of these plans is highly recommended. The prefire plans provide uniform and chronologically
      assembled aircraft crash or rescue information which can be crucial during airfield fire suppres-
      sion operations. Current copies of aircraft prefire plans should be placed in locations determined
      by the fire chief. Such areas may include the fire chief’s vehicle, assistant chief’s vehicle, and res-
      cue vehicle. This information is also maintained in the fire alarm communications center and can
      be transmitted via radio whenever needed. During contingency operations when additional aircraft
      may be deployed into the installation, firefighting supervisory personnel must ensure that appro-
      priate prefire plans are prepared for the types of aircraft upon their arrival.
   5.5.5. Structural Fire Suppression. The suppression of installation structural fires during and fol-
   lowing a disaster or enemy attack can be a massive effort. Depending upon the situation, structural
   fires may be concentrated at one location or widely dispersed throughout the installation. For exam-
   ple, an accidental fire caused by individual carelessness may be limited to a single structure. On the
   other hand, an enemy attack could leave a POL facility engulfed in flames on one side of the installa-
   tion, aircraft maintenance hangars burning in the center of the installation, and installation housing
   units ablaze on the opposite side of the installation. The presence of numerous, widely dispersed fires
   calls for prompt decisions on the part of the BCE to assist the fire chief in the effective application of
   firefighting resources.

       5.5.5.1. Response Time. Response time guidance is provided to assist the BCE in determining
       how FES assets may best be employed. These response times may be valid only during limited
       emergencies. A large-scale contingency may tax firefighting resources to the extent that response
       times (Table 5.3.) will have to be adjusted. In fact, changing facility priority considerations during
       major emergencies may cause abandonment of pre-established response times.

       5.5.5.2. Response Procedures. Procedures for responding to structural fires, similar to those for
       aircraft fires, are outlined in appropriate technical orders and are taught in various phases of the
       firefighter’s training. The BCE is not normally involved in selecting specific procedures to deal
       with a given structural fire situation, but must be familiar with the general concepts when making
       decisions concerning the employment of firefighting assets. The BCE can assist the fire chief in
       overcoming structural fires in several ways. Facility priority changes that occur as a result of the
       emergency should be immediately reported to the fire chief to prevent misallocation of resources.
       Coordination should be provided between repair crews and firefighters to ensure that hazards are
       reduced by proper utility isolation at the burning structure. If the fire resulted from an enemy
       attack, the BCE should be prepared to allocate EOD personnel to render unexploded explosive
       ordnance safe. The BCE can further assist the fire chief by authorizing reassignment of firefight-
       ing resources from fires at less critical structures to higher priority areas.
       5.5.5.3. Use of Prefire Plans. Facility prefire plans should have been developed according to
       AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, to assist firefighters
       during emergencies. A properly prepared AF Form 1028, Facility Prefire Plan, (or similar auto-
       mated product) contains specific information about the facility. A single line graphic drawing with
       the proper identifying symbols is attached to each Form 1028. This facility sketch should show the
       facility floor plan, facility size, access doors, utility shutoffs, fire hydrants, locations of special
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               85


     hazards, and any other information useful during firefighting operations. Facility prefire plans are
     normally available for these structures:
        5.5.5.3.1. Mission-essential facilities (identified in installation contingency response plans).
        5.5.5.3.2. Missile sites, rocket pads, and launch control facilities.
        5.5.5.3.3. Facilities with installed fire suppression systems.
        5.5.5.3.4. Multi-story facilities.
        5.5.5.3.5. Hospitals.
        5.5.5.3.6. Places of public assembly and recreation.
        5.5.5.3.7. Nurseries, day care centers, and schools.
        5.5.5.3.8. Other facilities as determined by the fire chief.
  5.5.6. Special Considerations for Contingency Operations.
     5.5.6.1. Contingency operations place great demands on the firefighting Prime BEEF teams that
     deploy as well as the firefighters remaining at home station to continue the fire protection effort.
     In essence, FES operations during a contingency situation may be characterized by:
        5.5.6.1.1. Limited manpower at both the CONUS and theater locations.
        5.5.6.1.2. Greatly increased fire protection support requirements at overseas and CONUS
        locations.
        5.5.6.1.3. Discontinuance of some routine services at existing bases or not established at new
        bases.
        5.5.6.1.4. Shortages of water and extinguishing agents.
        5.5.6.1.5. Shortages in desired numbers and types of firefighting vehicles.
        5.5.6.1.6. Extended working hours/shift requirements.
        5.5.6.1.7. Environmental constraints that may restrict firefighting operations to providing
        only control and containment.
        5.5.6.1.8. Overseas FES facilities of a lower standard or capability than normal CONUS facil-
        ities.
     5.5.6.2. During non-emergency conditions, firefighting personnel have several primary functions.
     They may serve as rescue persons, crash vehicle operators, structural pumper crew members,
     alarm room operators, maintenance technicians, fire inspectors, or trainers. During contingency or
     wartime operations, the primary duties will be crash firefighting and rescue operations. Although
     these skills should be maintained by all firefighters, it is realistic to assume that some individuals
     will be more proficient than others. The fire chief, both at overseas beddown locations and at
     CONUS installations, must take these differing levels of ability into account when developing
     shifts and assigning responsibilities.
     5.5.6.3. Prime BEEF firefighters who will deploy to theater locations should anticipate that they
     may encounter unfamiliar equipment. There will be different water distribution systems, foreign
     manufactured firefighting and rescue equipment, and in some situations, a language barrier to be
86                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


        encountered when trying to communicate with fellow firefighters of the host country. Veteran fire-
        fighters, having served prolonged periods at theater locations, should conduct informal training
        sessions for other team members who are unfamiliar with theater firefighting/rescue equipment.
        Such an effort, particularly when encouraged by the CONUS BCE, will pay dividends when Prime
        BEEF firefighters join a theater FES flight at the deployment site. The “break in” period will be
        shortened, and deployed personnel will find it easier to adapt and, through their prior familiariza-
        tion, will be more confident in using foreign firefighting equipment.
     5.5.7. Fire Protection Communications.
        5.5.7.1. The chaotic conditions that prevail during most emergencies make it imperative that the
        communication system be well designed to provide:
           5.5.7.1.1. A fire alarm communications center staffed with qualified operators (when possi-
           ble).
           5.5.7.1.2. Immediate transmission of notifications of fire.
           5.5.7.1.3. Prompt dispatch of the proper emergency forces.
           5.5.7.1.4. Notification of supporting activities.
           5.5.7.1.5. Operational communications between elements of the emergency force and sup-
           porting activities at the emergency scene.
        5.5.7.2. During a contingency all elements of the FES communication system must function as a
        unit. Communications must be maintained between FES, EOC and DCC to ensure that fire sup-
        pression efforts are integrated into the total installation recovery effort. There must also be a
        means for communication among various FES teams. Another crucial element of the fire protec-
        tion communication system is a central alarm network capable of alerting fire station personnel of
        fires at various locations around the installation. These many communication requirements are
        met by a combination of fixed wire and radio systems. A review of the major elements will serve
        to illustrate the inherent need for a well-conceived fire protection communications network.
           5.5.7.2.1. Fire Alarm Communications Center. This center is the “heart” of the FES com-
           munication system. Staffed around the clock by qualified personnel, the center should possess
           the necessary equipment to communicate with all elements of the fire protection organization.
           The requirements of such a facility vary with the installation, and in austere locations, it may
           not be possible to satisfy each requirement. Nevertheless, every effort should be made to pro-
           vide the FACC communications capabilities listed in Table 5.4.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  87

                 The fire crash radio net is intended to provide a radio network for fire suppression
                 and rescue communications which will not be interrupted by other users. The
                 installation commander, with advice from the fire chief, will determine which
                 agencies is authorized transceiver access to the fire crash net. At least two
Fire Crash Radio
                 frequencies are required for use by the fire department. One frequency will be limited

                 operations and emergency use. Other emergency responders may be allowed
                 transceiver access on the secondary frequency only, when approved by the
                 installation commander.

                     providing a record of emergency calls. All emergency communications must be

          5.5.7.2.2. Field Operations Portable Communications. Portable field-type communica-
          tions for FES forces may be grouped into the following categories:
                5.5.7.2.2.1. Ground-to-Ground. Remote, foot-party operations in areas inaccessible to
                vehicular equipment require short-range, portable, ground-to-ground communications.
                Two-way portable radios normally satisfy this requirement.
                5.5.7.2.2.2. On-Scene Directional Communications. The fire ground command and
                control center must communicate with firefighting forces inside structures or beyond
                visual or audible voice range to exercise supervisory control of the fire situation. This con-
                tact can be maintained by remote voice transmitting devices, portable and fixed mobile
                loud-hailers, public address systems, or two-way portable radios.

                5.5.7.2.2.3. Emergency Withdrawal Alarm. Fire suppression and rescue efforts fre-
                quently involve time limits after which rapid evacuation becomes imperative. For exam-
                ple, in fires involving explosives, firefighters may only have a limited time to control the
                blaze before the risk of explosion becomes imminent. For such situations, there must be an
                audible signaling device to warn fire personnel to withdraw from the danger area.
                Repeated sounding of a siren or other warning device is the basic signal for emergency
                withdrawal.

5.6. Auxiliary Firefighting. In a conventional wartime environment, it is very plausible the primary fire-
fighters and their vehicles and equipment could be totally engaged in mission priority crash rescue and
fire suppression tasks involving aircraft and weapons systems. In such situations, lesser priority require-
ments, such as structural fires, will have to be left unattended. To prevent or at least limit the possibility of
damage to essential civil engineer installation recovery assets if such a situation should arise, each Prime
BEEF team should have its own limited internal firefighting capability. To this end, all non-fire protection
(non-AFS 3E7X1) team members must be taught basic firefighting skills that can be used in the very early
stages of a fire. Employment of these skills, however, must not constitute a safety hazard to the Prime
BEEF team members. At installation level, it is incumbent upon the fire chief to ensure that such contin-
gency-related training is provided at the proper scope and depth to all non-fire protection engineering per-
sonnel. The International Fire Service Training Association publication, Essentials of Fire Fighting, can
serve as a training guide. In most instances, the lack of technical knowledge, protective clothing, and
breathing apparatus will limit the auxiliary firefighter’s role to that of preventing the spread of an existing
fire. Regardless of the extent of involvement, however, there are two fundamentals that must be met if
auxiliary firefighters are to function effectively and safely. They are: understanding the behavior and
types of fire and knowing how to correctly use available tools and equipment in controlling and/or extin-
guishing a fire.
     5.6.1. Fire Behavior. The fire triangle (Figure 5.3.) is the best way of explaining the three elements
     essential for any fire to occur—fuel, oxygen, and heat. Fire can be extinguished by removing any one
     of these three elements. In other words, a fire can be put out by simply reducing the temperature of the
     fuel below that needed to support combustion, eliminating the source of fuel, or withdrawing the oxy-
     gen supply.

Figure 5.3. Fire Triangle.




        5.6.1.1. Heat. One of the most common methods employed to extinguish a fire is to cool it with
        water. This approach is predicated upon reducing the temperatures of the fuel until it does not pro-
        duce enough vapor to continue burning.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               89


     5.6.1.2. Fuel. In some instances, it is easier to extinguish a fire by removing its source of fuel,
     which, for example, is the intent of making fire breaks when there is a forest fire. This approach
     would also apply where liquid or gaseous fuel is involved, particularly when it is being sourced
     from a pipe line. A good example of this technique took place in Kuwait after the 1991 Iraq war
     when hundreds of oil wells were ablaze. Early in the recovery effort, a number of the fires were
     quenched by simply shutting off the flow of crude oil.
     5.6.1.3. Oxygen. In certain situations, it is more advisable to extinguish a fire by reducing the
     oxygen concentration. This can be accomplished by introducing an inert gas (such as Halon) or by
     separating the oxygen from the fuel. Many fire extinguishers work on this principle.
  5.6.2. Types of Fires. All fires fall into one of three categories or types: those involving ordinary
  combustible materials; ones sourced from flammable liquids, greases, and gases; and fires involving
  energized electrical equipment.
     5.6.2.1. Ordinary Combustible Materials. The preferred method for extinguishing fires involv-
     ing ordinary combustion materials involves using water to reduce the temperature of the burning
     material (fuel) below its ignition temperature.
     5.6.2.2. Flammable Liquids, Greases, and Gases. For fires involving flammable liquids,
     greases, and gases, the removal of oxygen or interruption in the chemical chain reaction is the
     most effective means of extinguishment.
     5.6.2.3. Energized Electrical Equipment. As a general practice, always de-energize the circuits
     first before attempting to extinguish a fire involving electrical equipment. Afterwards, treat the
     remaining flame as a structural or flammable liquid fire, depending upon the fuel that is involved.
  5.6.3. Fire Extinguishers. The primary use of portable fire extinguishers is as a first line of defense
  for small fires. Pressurized fire extinguishers can usually be found in most base facilities.
     5.6.3.1. Portable fire extinguishers are classified according to their intended use on different
     classes of fires. Be sure the extinguisher used is intended for the type of fire that is being fought.
         5.6.3.1.1. Class "A" Fire: Involves ordinary combustibles such as wood, cloth, paper, rub-
         ber, plastics, and other common material that burn easily.
         5.6.3.1.2. Class "B" Fire: Entails flammable liquids such as gasoline, certain oils, grease,
         tar, oil based paint, lacquer, and flammable gas.
         5.6.3.1.3. Class "C" Fire: Comprises electrical equipment including wiring, fuse boxes, cir-
         cuit breakers, machinery, and appliances.
     5.6.3.2. The newer types of fire extinguishers have labels that identify the class of fire(s) they
     should and should not be used on. Figure 5.4. is an example of a label indicating the extinguisher
     can be used on both Class A and B fires, but must not be used to fight a Class C (electrical) fire.

     5.6.4. Heat and Smoke Ventilation. An auxiliary firefighter’s primary objective is to properly deal
     with small fires in their early stages. This will include locating the fire source, when possible rescuing
     trapped victims, and extinguishing or containing the fire until professional help arrives. Proper venti-
     lation during firefighting aids in meeting these objectives.
        5.6.4.1. Ventilation is the systematic removal of heated air, smoke, and gases from a structure, fol-
        lowed by its replacement with cooler air. The need to ventilate depends on the amount of smoke,
        heat, and gases within a structure. But, in general, proper ventilation provides the following sup-
        port during a firefighting effort. (a) It can remove toxic fumes that could jeopardize both rescue
        and general firefighting efforts. (b) By removing smoke buildup, a clearer view of the situation at
        hand is normally presented, thereby providing firefighters the opportunity to combat the fire in the
        most effective manner.
        5.6.4.2. From an auxiliary firefighting perspective, the first consideration must always be the
        safety of the building occupants and rescuers. In many structural fires, a large number of fatalities
        are directly attributed to asphyxiation caused by the fumes. Thick smoke can also cause people
        who are caught in the structure to become disoriented and panicky, making their rescue much
        more difficult. As such, the overall goal is to clear as much of the toxic smoke from the facility as
        possible to allow rescue and firefighting activities to commence in relative safety.
        5.6.4.3. If ventilation is not accomplished correctly and at the right time, however, it can prove to
        be very counterproductive. Ventilation procedures are to be used only in the very early stages of a
        fire. If arriving at the fire scene any later than the early stage, the auxiliary firefighter’s role should
        be one of containment only, ensuring that the fire cannot spread to other facilities. Since venting
        does increase the amount of oxygen in the fire area, when not conducted properly, it can notice-
        ably add to the intensity of the fire. This is particularly so if the facility is ventilated before the
        extent and location of the fire are determined, because there is a distinct possibility that the fire
        might spread to other parts of the building that may have otherwise not been involved. If it is
        determined that ventilation is appropriate, due to equipment limitations, the auxiliary firefighter’s
        involvement should be limited to horizontal ventilation through natural openings, such as doors
        and windows. As a norm, good cross ventilation is obtained by opening the upper part of the win-
        dows on the leeward side of the room and the lower portion of the windows on the windward side
        (Figure 5.5.).

Figure 5.5. Proper Venting Procedures.




   5.6.5. Firefighting Techniques. The success or failure of an auxiliary firefighting team can in large
   measure be directly attributed to the skill and knowledge of the personnel involved. Most fires are
   controlled in the early stages with immediate and proper application of water. Conversely, fires
   involving extensive damage are all too often the result of poorly selected or improperly applied fire-
   fighting techniques. A well-trained auxiliary firefighting team with an attack plan and an adequate
   amount of water should be able to either extinguish or contain most small fires. However, the need for
   safety is of utmost importance. The lack of protective clothing and breathing apparatus makes it dou-
   bly important for auxiliary firefighters to work in pairs while performing all firefighting operations. In
   all likelihood, auxiliary firefighting operations will be most prevalent immediately following an
   installation attack or natural disaster. In the period between the all clear notification and the assign-
   ment of installation recovery taskings, engineering personnel must survey their immediate areas for
   local fires, the presence of unexploded explosive ordnance, the amount of damage sustained, and the
   status of recovery vehicles, equipment, and supplies. Those personnel that are not required for damage
   assessment, recovery asset reconnaissance, and local command and control should be prepared to per-
   form auxiliary firefighting tasks until ordered to commence more pressing installation recovery
   efforts. In this regard, it is wise to include a few lengths of hose and a couple of nozzles in your Prime
   BEEF team kit so your troops will have a few assets to work with. Supervisory personnel have a dual
   role during this period. They must ensure needed assets are not unnecessarily lost due to fires and
   simultaneously confirm that all necessary actions are taken to ready personnel and equipment for
   repair and recovery taskings.
      5.6.5.1. Team Composition and Duties. An auxiliary firefighting team has no set number of per-
      sonnel. When the need arises, usually every Prime BEEF team member not engaged in other
      higher priority activities will be used as auxiliary firefighters. The ranking person will assume the
      responsibility of team chief. Team assignments will depend on the number of firefighters and the
      mission. However, basic auxiliary firefighter duties include but are not limited to:
          5.6.5.1.1. Deploying and operating hose lines.
          5.6.5.1.2. Carrying and operating other tools and equipment.
          5.6.5.1.3. Performing rescues.
          5.6.5.1.4. Assisting other team members as required.

     5.6.5.2. Coordination. A fire attack must be fully coordinated to be successful. Firefighters
     should follow the team chief’s directions precisely—deviations could not only be counterproduc-
     tive but also disastrous. For example, as was brought out earlier, ventilating a fire before its loca-
     tion is identified and hoselines have been made ready may result in expanding the fire.
     Conversely, when properly performed, ventilation can be a boon to the firefighting effort. In any
     event, do not lose sight of the fact that the auxiliary firefighting role is a very restricted one. With
     the limited training and access to few professional firefighting tools, the auxiliary firefighting role
     must be confined to only coping with small fires in their earliest stages of development.
     5.6.5.3. Structural Fires. Teams advancing hoselines should not enter a burning building with-
     out being instructed to do so by the team chief. Once inside a building, team members must always
     stay within voice contact of each other at all times. The most effective use of water on free burning
     fires is a direct attack with a stream of penetrating fog directed at the base of the fire (Figure 5.6.).
     When using this approach, water should be applied in short bursts. In situations where a building
     cannot be entered and the direct approach cannot be used, an indirect water attack, such as through
     a window, can be attempted (Figure 5.7.). With this technique, the hose nozzle setting should
     range between penetrating and a moderate angle fog and the water stream should be directed at the
     gases at ceiling level, rather than the base of the fire. In addition, the water should be played back
     and forth to ensure good coverage. Once the fire is under control, the hoseline can be advanced to
     extinguish any remaining hot spots with the direct attack approach discussed previously. When
     fighting a structural fire, all team members must be ever watchful for potential hazards such as:
         5.6.5.3.1. Possible building collapse.
         5.6.5.3.2. Fire moving in behind, below, or above the hoseline.
         5.6.5.3.3. Kinks in or obstructions to the hoseline.
         5.6.5.3.4. Holes or trip hazards.
         5.6.5.3.5. Hazardous or highly flammable liquids in the area.
         5.6.5.3.6. Electrical hazards.
         5.6.5.3.7. Overexertion.

Figure 5.7. Indirect Firefighting Attack.




       5.6.5.4. Vehicle Fires. Auxiliary firefighters can also expect to encounter vehicle fires after an
       attack. The scope of their actions, however, would be generally limited to smaller, passenger- type
       vehicles rather than large pieces of equipment such as tank trucks or tractor trailers. This scope is
       based on equipment and training limitations. In a small vehicle fire, a fuel ignition can usually be
       extinguished easily by using a portable fire extinguisher. If the fuel tank has been ruptured, a water
       fog may be used to put out the fire and keep the fuel tank cool to avoid further combustion. Burn-
       ing fuel leaking from the vehicle should be flushed clear of the area with water and extinguished
       with a portable extinguisher or sand. Once the fuel portion of the fire is out, the remaining flames
       can be handled as a structural fire. At times during vehicle accidents that involve fire, occupants
       become trapped in the wreck. In such situations, it may be necessary to protect trapped passengers
       from the flames by using water in a fog pattern until they can be rescued by firefighters having the
       appropriate tools and equipment.
       5.6.5.5. Fires Involving Utilities. For obvious safety purposes, auxiliary firefighters must be
       able to isolate the utility supply (electricity and gas) to a facility.
94                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


          5.6.5.5.1. Electrical Fires. In a structural fire, from a safety standpoint, power should nor-
          mally remain on as long as possible to provide lighting and ventilation for firefighting and res-
          cue operations. When the building becomes damaged to the point that electrical hazards exist,
          the power should be immediately shut off by throwing the main switch or disconnecting a fuse
          at the main service box. Fires in electrical equipment can be handled with relative ease once
          they are de-energized. As mentioned earlier, once the power has been eliminated, electrical
          fires are usually treated in the same fashion as a structural fire.
          5.6.5.5.2. Gas Utilities. Facilities with gas utilities should have the gas turned off as soon as
          possible. The meter and cutoff valve are usually located outside the building. The flow of gas
          into the building may be stopped by turning the cutoff valve to the closed position, which will
          be at a right angle to the pipe, as shown in Figure 5.8. Gas fires should not be extinguished
          until gas flow can be shut off.

Figure 5.8. Typical Gas Shutoff Valve.




      5.6.5.6. Bare Base Fires. The basic principles of firefighting used for modern, built-up installa-
      tions also apply to beddown locations. However, the type of construction and primitive living con-
      ditions of a bare base environment make the possibility of fire more pronounced. Most tents burn
      more readily than standard construction; consequently, a fire is prone to spread at an alarming
      speed in a tent city. An adequate water supply could also be a problem—a bare base water system
      may not be sufficient to support a sustained firefighting effort. By the time an alternative water
      source is obtained, the entire compound could be engulfed in flames. The best course of action in
      a bare base fire may be to simply stop the fire from spreading to unaffected assets. One quick way
      of accomplishing this is to drop all tentage near the tent that is on fire. Another effective course of
      action, assuming water is available, is to hose down the other tents in the area.
      5.6.5.7. Ground Cover Fires. Ground cover fires include fires in weeds, grass, brush, and simi-
      lar vegetation. Fighting a ground cover fire can be a very dangerous undertaking. Many firefight-
      ers have lost their lives or been seriously injured while trying to control this type of fire. As with
      all firefighting efforts, thoroughly consider the situation before implementing a combative tactic,
      particularly when it is a ground cover fire. Remember, regardless of the firefighting technique
      being employed, always make the safety of personnel a prime concern. Once a ground cover fire
      starts, it may burn rapidly. There are three main factors that affect ground cover fires: types of fuel,
      weather, and terrain. Attacking a ground fire is based on perimeter control. The control line can be
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 95


      either established at the edge of the fire for a direct attack or at varying distances from the fire to
      form an indirect attack.
          5.6.5.7.1. Direct Attack. The direct attack is action taken directly against the flames. If a
          water source is available, hose lines can be used in conjunction with backpack water extin-
          guishers to extinguish the fire. Hand tools can also be used to throw soil on the fire, to beat the
          fire out, and to cut down or remove fuel in the fire’s potential path.
          5.6.5.7.2. Indirect Attack. The indirect attack is taken at varying distances from the fire. This
          method is used when the fire is too hot, too big, or moving too fast to use a direct attack. With
          this approach, the idea is to stop the fire by removing fuel from its path. This is accomplished
          by cutting fire breaks with hand tools or heavy equipment (Figure 5.9.). Natural fire breaks
          such as roads and streams should also be considered and used when appropriate.

Figure 5.9. Cutting a Fire Break With Heavy Equipment.




   5.6.6. Rescue Techniques. In an attack recovery environment, with burning and collapsed buildings,
   downed electrical power lines, and damaged vehicles, there could be an urgent need for widespread
   rescue operations. This need must be tempered with consideration of the personal protection of auxil-
   iary firefighter personnel. Protective gear for use by auxiliary firefighters during rescue operations is
   extremely limited. The basic combat helmet, flak vest, work gloves, and boots used by most civil
   engineer personnel will provide some limited measure of protection, but are far from effective against
   the excessive heat and toxic gases produced by an intense fire. For this reason, each potential rescue
   situation must be carefully evaluated in terms of the probability of making a safe and successful res-
   cue before engineer personnel are committed to such an activity.
      5.6.6.1. Building Rescues. Probably the most hazardous duty an auxiliary firefighter may have to
      perform is to rescue individuals from a burning building. When entering a burning building to per-
      form rescue work, each auxiliary firefighter must first consider personal safety and the safety of
      team members. As a general rule, a building should not be entered except in the very early stages
      of a fire. If a building is entered, a hose team must always be available to provide water stream
      protection for both the rescuer and victim. However, under no conditions should an auxiliary fire-
      fighter attempt a rescue in a burning building above the ground floor.
          5.6.6.1.1. Rescues in Collapsed Buildings. The difficulty in rescuing people from bombed
          or collapsed structures depends to a large degree on where they are located. During war, the
          situation may be aggravated by the possible presence of unexploded explosive ordnance in the
          rubble. Again, unnecessary chances should not be taken. The situation may dictate that rescue
96                                                                  AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


     efforts be limited to helping only those victims that are readily accessible or who are slightly
     trapped.
     5.6.6.1.2. Rescues From Electrical Contact. To reach a victim who is touching electrically
     energized wires or equipment, an auxiliary firefighter must take every precaution to protect
     himself and others. It is essential that all electrical wires and conductors be treated as if they
     were energized. If the wire is not entangled with the victim’s body, a wooden pole with a hook
     on the end should be used to drag the victim clear of the wire. Under no circumstances should
     the rescuer allow himself or his clothing to touch the wire or victim during the rescue opera-
     tion. Sometimes it is more practical to remove the cable from the victim. This can be done by
     throwing one end of a rope over the line. Both ends of the rope are then tied together and the
     wire is carefully pulled away.
     5.6.6.1.3. Vehicle Extrications. Vehicle extrication is a complex and demanding task. Auxil-
     iary firefighters must be mentally prepared for the psychological trauma of facing victims who
     are burned, seriously injured, or hysterical. Power tools normally available to firefighters for
     extracting victims from vehicles, such as the power cutter shown in Figure 5.10., will not usu-
     ally be available to auxiliary firefighters. As is the case in most rescue operations, safety in a
     vehicle extrication is essential. If safety is disregarded, both the victim and the rescuer may be
     placed in further danger. The first action that should be accomplished in a vehicle rescue is to
     stabilize the vehicle. If a vehicle is found on its side or upside down, it should be stabilized by
     placing wedge boards, rocks, or other debris under the vehicle. If no material for this purpose
     is readily available, improvised methods can be tried such as using bumper jacks and ropes, or
     opening the trunk and hood. After the vehicle is stabilized, the easiest way to enter the vehicle
     must be chosen. Doors are the first choice. If they are jammed, a window may have to be used.
     If a window must be broken, start with the rear one. This gives a larger opening and glass will
     not fall on the victim. The primary objective is to gain access to the victim and stabilize and
     protect this individual until extrication is possible. If the victim is trapped in the vehicle by the
     steering wheel, seats, or dashboard, stabilize the person until professional help (medical or
     FES personnel) arrives. If the victim is conscious, coherent, and not completely entangled in
     the vehicle, removal operations can start. First, wounds should be bandaged, fractures splinted,
     and the body immobilized to reduce the possibility of further injury. Once the victim has been
     properly prepared for removal, any sharp edges in the vehicle should be covered and the open-
     ing through which the victim will be moved should be padded with blankets or similar materi-
     als. When removing the victim, travel as smoothly as possible and try to avoid any jerking or
     sudden movements.

5.7. Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations. Search and rescue operations are a crucial function during
contingencies. Whether the emergency is a major aircraft accident, a natural disaster, or an enemy attack,
there may be scores of injured personnel who must be located, treated, and evacuated. Search and rescue
missions must be carried out promptly by well-trained personnel with the proper equipment, or it is highly
probable that disaster casualties will increase dramatically. In the aftermath of a disaster or attack, fire-
fighting and crash rescue personnel, augmented by personnel from other sections of the civil engineer
force, must be constantly ready to participate in search and rescue operations (Figure 5.11.).

Figure 5.11. Firefighters Performing Rescue.




   5.7.1. Civil Engineer Involvement in Search and Rescue. Civil engineers may be involved in
   search and rescue operations in several ways. Depending on the type and extent of the emergency,
   civil engineer search and rescue support may range from minimal to very extensive. FES personnel
   would undoubtedly be very involved in the rescue of survivors from an aircraft crash or other major
   accident on the installation, but would provide little, if any, search and rescue support for a group of
   campers lost in a nearby forest. The rescue of the campers would probably be handled by a local
   agency and civil engineers would provide support only if requested and authorized. The following
   areas outline possible civil engineer responses to search and rescue requirements.
       5.7.1.1. Firefighters/Crash Rescue Personnel. The highly trained personnel who serve in the
       FES flight are the most qualified to conduct search and rescue operations. Not only do most of
       them have first aid training and the skills and equipment to rescue persons trapped as a result of a
       disaster, but also they will always be the first to respond to a major aircraft accident on the instal-
98                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      lation. Once at the scene, they will use all of their resources to control fires and extract survivors
      from the aircraft (Figure 5.12.).

Figure 5.12. Aircrew Extraction.




      5.7.1.2. Augmentees. In an attack recovery environment, the installation will be faced with
      numerous fires, extensive damage, and injured personnel requiring emergency rescue and medical
      care. Getting to fires and rescue locations will be complicated by the presence of unexploded
      explosive ordnance, craters, pavement damage, and scattered debris caused by bombs and other
      ordnance. Firefighting and rescue must be accomplished with fixed numbers of professional fire-
      fighters, equipment, and materials. Attrition can be expected to steadily decrease the availability
      of professional firefighters, fire vehicles, and rescue capabilities. The FES flight will not have the
      resources to simultaneously respond to and extinguish all of these fires, respond to all rescue situ-
      ations, and support all aircraft incidents. Commanders must decide which fire to fight, which fires
      to let burn, which people to rescue and which people to leave to buddy care. These and other deci-
      sions will affect the launch and recovery of aircraft, the response to returning battle-damaged air-
      craft, and the operation of both fixed and mobile aircraft arresting systems. Augmentees may be
      needed to perform those search and rescue operations that the professional firefighters are unable
      to attend. Therefore, civil engineer personnel, along with all other combat support forces, must
      possess the basic knowledge and skills to help save lives and mitigate human suffering (Figure
      5.13.). The severity of the emergency will dictate the number of persons required, but efforts
      should be made to select individuals with some of the following qualifications:
          5.7.1.2.1. Good physical condition. The physical demands of the search and rescue operation
          are likely to be great.
          5.7.1.2.2. First aid training. Survivors may require immediate first aid to prevent serious com-
          plications.
          5.7.1.2.3. Advanced emergency medical care training.
          5.7.1.2.4. Specialized rescue equipment experience.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              99


          5.7.1.2.5. Familiarity with the geography of the search and rescue area.
          5.7.1.2.6. Knowledge of survivor extrication methods.
          5.7.1.2.7. Knowledge of area search methods.

Figure 5.13. Personnel Performing Buddy Care.




   5.7.2. Site Access Support. Civil engineer heavy equipment and operators’ skills can be invaluable
   in clearing access to the site of a major disaster. When rescue vehicles are unable to reach and remove
   the survivors of an aircraft crash in a heavily wooded area, civil engineer earth moving equipment can
   clear a road or create a path to the crash site. Following an earthquake, an engineer crane could be
   used to remove the fallen beams of a collapsed building, allowing rescuers to reach survivors trapped
   beneath the rubble.
   5.7.3. Rescue Equipment. The type of equipment employed by a SAR team will depend on the type
   of emergency and the location of the rescue effort. Medical equipment and supplies are normally car-
   ried in fire rescue vehicles or ambulances to aid the injured during an on-base disaster and to an air-
   craft accident in a remote region. However, if an off-base area precludes vehicular travel, the medical
   supplies must be carried in by SAR personnel or delivered by air. A team going into a wilderness area
   would also require navigational aids, food, water, portable shelters, and other items to operate in an
   inhospitable environment. The following general categories of equipment should be considered in
   equipping a SAR team for missions:
      5.7.3.1. Communications. Portable hand-held or backpack-type transceivers should be used for
      radio communications between team members, SAR aircraft, and the staging installation, when
      one is established (Figure 5.14.).
100                                                                  AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 5.14. Radio Communications.




      5.7.3.2. Navigation Equipment. Detailed maps of the search area showing all terrain features,
      landmarks, and water sources are a necessity. A global positioning system, reliable compasses or
      other direction-finding equipment are required for rescue operations in remote areas.
      5.7.3.3. Operational Equipment. Select equipment appropriate for the type of SAR operation
      the team is expected to accomplish. A SAR operation centered on an area of demolished structures
      on the installation requires crowbars, shovels, rope, and similar items to assist in freeing people
      entrapped in the debris. Conversely, if the operation’s goal is to reach a downed aircraft in a
      snow-covered mountain area, snowshoes, mountaineering equipment, and portable litters should
      be among the team’s equipment.
      5.7.3.4. Food and Water. Food and water will only be carried by teams operating in off-base
      remote areas. Teams should carry adequate quantities to sustain an operation lasting 48 to 72
      hours. If the mission goes beyond these limits, the team should be resupplied.
      5.7.3.5. Photographic Equipment. A simple, reliable camera is needed for missions involving
      aircraft crashes. Photographic evidence of aircraft wreckage, instrument panels, aircraft controls,
      and terrain disfigurations is useful for accident analysis. On-base disasters requiring photography
      should be provided by installation photographers.
      5.7.3.6. Loud Hailer (Bullhorn or Portable Loudspeaker). This item is used for coordinating
      team actions at the rescue scene.
      5.7.3.7. Survivor Extraction Equipment. Metal cutters, ax, knife, body splint, litter, prybar, and
      a hydraulic rescue kit are typical items used by FES for situations involving extraction of survi-
      vors from downed aircraft (Figure 5.15.).
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                101


Figure 5.15. Examples of Survivor Extraction Equipment.




   5.7.4. Search and Rescue Operations. Search and rescue operations can be limited in scope, involv-
   ing small search parties which cover the area on foot, or a massive effort covering thousands of square
   miles of land or sea and involving ships, aircraft, and personnel of other services and governmental
   agencies. Engineer SAR operations will generally be limited to installation disaster response and,
   when required, operations support in the local community.
      5.7.4.1. Installation Search and Rescue. Probably the most common SAR operation on the
      installation involves a major aircraft accident. In such a situation, firefighters/rescue personnel are
      responsible for containing any resulting fire and must promptly remove survivors from the wreck-
      age (Figure 5.16.). A systematic search of the surrounding area may also be required to locate per-
      sons thrown from the wreckage by the impact. In most aircraft accidents on an installation, the
      crash site will be defined and team efforts will concentrate on the immediate rescue of personnel
      rather than search of the surrounding area. Other installation SAR operations result from earth-
      quake, flood, hurricane, or enemy attack. Under these conditions, several search teams must be
      assigned to search the installation for survivors. Searches of this type require precise coordination
      and require that all teams be thoroughly briefed on designated search areas, techniques, rescue
      procedures, communications protocol, reporting requirements, and availability of medical support
      for survivors. The SAR operation must ensure that the entire disaster area is covered with no
      duplication of effort which could result in delays in reaching survivors.

Figure 5.16. FES Forces Respond to Aircraft Crash On Air Force Installation.




      5.7.4.2. Off-Installation Search and Rescue. Civil engineer involvement in off-installation
      SAR efforts will probably be limited to heavy equipment support for access to a disaster site and
      augmentation of search teams. Civil engineer resources should not participate in off-installation
      operations if there is a high probability that they will be needed for installation recovery or rescue
      operations.
      5.7.4.3. Operations Stage. Regardless of the location of the SAR effort, basic operations are gen-
      erally the same and follow the sequence in Figure 5.17. below.

Figure 5.17. SAR Sequence of Operations.




      5.7.4.4. Search and Rescue Debriefing. The debriefing should occur as soon as the SAR team
      returns from the search area to determine if the team has information effecting the outcome of the
      SAR mission. This is particularly important for teams assigned to a mission still in progress. In
      addition to providing first-hand information about the results of the SAR mission, the debriefing
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 103


      can supply knowledge of support requirements to other SAR teams and suggestions for improve-
      ments to the ongoing effort.

5.8. Summary.
   5.8.1. FES personnel have crucial taskings and responsibilities to perform during disaster recovery
   situations. These include rescue, fire containment, and fire extinguishment. Under wartime condi-
   tions, FES organizations may be all military, all civilian, or a military/civilian mix, depending upon
   location. Peacetime training programs must take these potential organizational arrangements into
   account. FES supervisory personnel can expect to face both airfield and structural firefighting require-
   ments during the disaster recovery period. Specific procedures and response times are associated with
   both types of requirements, and fire protection command and control elements must be familiar with
   these parameters. Fire protection personnel can also expect to face shortages of supplies and equip-
   ment, longer working hours, and austere conditions during wartime, particularly at deployed loca-
   tions.
   5.8.2. Because FES personnel will be heavily tasked for response to priority facilities and aircraft
   assets immediately following an attack on the installation, other civil engineer forces must serve as
   auxiliary firefighters to protect other installation facilities and recovery assets. Auxiliary firefighters
   must be able to respond to smaller structural, vehicle, and ground cover fires with the intent of stop-
   ping such fires in their early stages of development. Auxiliary firefighters must also be capable of per-
   forming limited personnel rescue activities. Whether accomplishing firefighting or rescue taskings,
   however, auxiliary firefighters must make safety one of their primary considerations.
   5.8.3. The civil engineer’s primary involvement in search and rescue operations is in response to
   life-threatening situations on the installation. FES personnel have the major role in this activity. Sup-
   port of more extensive off-installation search and rescue efforts is generally limited to the equipment
   and personnel necessary to gain access to the search area. Supervisors should be aware of the person-
   nel skills and equipment required for the search and rescue effort.

                               DAMAGE AND HAZARD ASSESSMENT

6.1. Introduction. Damage and hazard assessment activities may be separated into two distinct areas—
airfield damage assessment and facility and utility damage assessment. Airfield damage assessment
involves the appraisal of damage to runway surfaces, taxiway surfaces, and other facilities which directly
support aircraft operations. Facility damage assessment includes evaluation of damage to all other instal-
lation facilities and utility systems (Figure 6.1.). Resources permitting, both assessments should be con-
ducted simultaneously and, depending on the situation, may be of equal importance.

Figure 6.1. Installation Facility Damage.




6.2. Overview. This chapter will focus on facility and utility damage assessment operations under war-
time conditions; airfield damage assessments are addressed in Volume 4 of this publication series and will
not be discussed here. This chapter begins with a review of damage assessment team organization, includ-
ing team composition, leadership, and equipment requirements. It follows with a brief discussion of
assessment techniques and damage recording and reporting.

6.3. Damage Assessment and Response Team (DART) Operations. Facility and utility damage
assessment is the first step toward restoring critical facilities back into service after an attack. This assess-
ment is performed by specialized groups called damage assessment and response teams (DARTs). Con-
trolled by the damage control center (DCC), DARTs determine the location, types, and quantities of UXO
and the location, type, and extent of damage to installation facilities and utility systems. They also have
the responsibility to isolate damaged utility systems whenever practicable and prudent. Damage assess-
ment reports from the DARTs are forwarded to the DCC where they are analyzed and prioritized in accor-
dance with the installation recovery strategy developed by the emergency operations center (EOC).
Again, speed and accuracy are critical during this damage assessment process since, in many cases, facil-
ity and utility support is essential for immediate as well as sustained aircraft operations.

6.4. Team Composition and Leadership. The number of DARTs to be established is variable, depend-
ing for the most part on the size of the installation to be surveyed. Three teams should probably be suffi-
cient for an average size installation. Manpower assets from Prime BEEF teams configured in a
warfighting force posture can support this three-team requirement.
   6.4.1. The basic configuration of each DART is reflected in Table 6.1. Don’t hesitate to tailor the skill
   mix to the installation’s facility and utility situation. For example, if the installation has a large POL
   complex and tank farm, consider substituting a liquid fuels person on one of the teams. If a civilian
   work force is available, field more teams. See Volume 1 in this publication series for more information
   on the composition of emergency teams.

   6.4.2. Each DART is usually led by a senior non-commissioned officer who is responsible for com-
   municating assessment information back to the DCC, making the decision on whether to enter a
   known UXO area for survey purposes or altering the assessment route, and deciding on the appropri-
   ateness of isolating portions of damaged utility systems. Ideally, individuals chosen to head the
   DARTs should be knowledgeable of the type of damage to be assessed; e.g., electrical, mechanical,
   and structural.

6.5. Equipment. Equipment requirements for the DARTs will depend on the means by which they will
conduct damage assessment. Dedicated vehicle support for DART operations is virtually mandatory;
however, the possibility exists that assessment may have to be accomplished on foot if many vehicles are
destroyed or roads are seriously blocked. In such a case, the teams will be severely limited in what they
can perform in the way of utility isolation, and their assessment time will be greatly lengthened. The
equipment listed in Table 6.2. is recommended for DART support (should be assembled during the attack
preparedness phase).

        and first aid kit.

6.6. Assessment Technique. DARTs begin attack recovery assessments upon declaration of Alarm
Black conditions when directed by the commander. DART operations are generally conducted in two
phases—initial reconnaissance and detailed damage assessment. In Phase I, an initial gross assessment of
the installation is made to quickly locate areas of UXO and major facility and utility damage. The results
of this preliminary survey are used to update the preplanned DART damage assessment routes and obtain
a general idea of overall installation damage. In detailed damage assessment (Phase II), the DARTs follow
DCC-directed travel routes from their shelter locations to various critical facilities and utilities throughout
the installation. The DART reports the levels of damage along these routes and, in particular, at these pre-
determined facilities. Detailed damage assessment requires more accurate location and description of
problems than initial reconnaissance since these reports will form the basis of repair crew sizing, material
and vehicle allocation, damage repair cost estimates, and, to some degree, prioritization of efforts.

6.7. Initial Reconnaissance (Phase I). The purpose of Phase I is to quickly assess the recovery environ-
ment to identify areas of major utility and facility disruption. Exact damage descriptions and measure-
ments are not expected during Phase I reporting. Preselected observation posts will provide information
on visible facility and utility damages using expedient modes of communication; i.e., radio/telephone
contact with unit control centers and the EOC. This installation-wide assessment will probably consist of
reports and inputs from personnel who are not trained or familiar with damage assessment reporting
requirements. Much of the information received will be sketchy and inaccurate; therefore, DCC personnel
will have to be prepared to ask the right questions and clarify any contradictory inputs. Expect to receive
damage inputs from all types of communications modes—runners, the installation telephone system,
other command and control centers, and the EOC. With respect to UXO, expect many confusing inputs.
Many personnel do not have explosive ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) background or experience. Most
inputs will probably be in terms of generalities, and close questioning will have to be done to ascertain the
type of munitions that will be encountered. From the data obtained during the Phase I initial reconnais-
sance, the DCC will alter the DART assessment routes as appropriate. Afterwards, Phase II assessments
begin.

6.8. Detailed Assessment (Phase II). Phase II damage assessment will be highly dangerous and perhaps
time-consuming, depending upon the extent of damage and size of the installation. In the attack recovery
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  107


environment, the DARTs serve as the eyes and ears of the DCC. The interface between these two func-
tions must be close since the entire installation recovery effort from a facilities and utilities aspect hinges
on their efficiency and effectiveness. The typical sequence of DART actions following an attack is as fol-
lows:
   6.8.1. The DCC gathers initial damage reports and annotates appropriate information on grid maps.
   Based on these initial reports, DCC personnel make a preliminary analysis of where major utility and
   facility damage has been inflicted. Tentative utility cutoff locations are also identified.
   6.8.2. The DCC updates previously developed damage assessment routes, if necessary, and assigns
   routes to the appropriate DARTs, keeping in mind the technical expertise resident on each team.
   6.8.3. The DCC directs the DARTs to assemble and proceed to the DCC. The DART team chiefs pick
   up their assigned damage assessment routes and receive an overview of present conditions from the
   DCC staff to include the status of chemical warfare agent presence, route updates, and information
   relative to probable utility shutoff requirements.
   6.8.4. DART team chiefs then brief their teams on assessment routes and known hazards or problems
   and begin their damage assessment activities. A communications check is made prior to leaving the
   DCC area. When the DARTs are dispatched, the DCC notifies the engineering representatives in the
   EOC of this action.
   6.8.5. DARTs report major problems and hazards (UXO fields, major utility breaks, fires, etc.) as they
   travel their routes. These major items are also plotted on the installation grid maps carried by the
   DARTs. Radio discipline is critical and must be maintained—report only the necessary information
   back to the DCC—do not report trivial items. Remember, several DARTs are in operation concur-
   rently plus the DCC is also monitoring airfield damage repair and firefighting operations—the infor-
   mation flow into the DCC will be staggering. It is also highly likely that DARTs will encounter
   casualties while performing their damage assessment activities. The buddy care and first aid training
   learned during peacetime becomes important here. To the extent practicable, DARTs should provide
   assistance to wounded personnel and accomplish rescue actions if within the capability of their teams.
   If possible, casualties should be turned over to their units for transport to the nearest installation casu-
   alty collection point. If this cannot be done, the DCC should be informed of the casualty’s location so
   the appropriate unit can be contacted through installation command and control channels. While dam-
   age assessment is the DARTs’ primary task, they cannot ignore giving aid to others—DART team
   chiefs are responsible for making all decisions with regard to keeping the balance between life-saving
   actions and rescue and damage assessment responsibilities.
   6.8.6. DARTs assess each designated critical facility/utility along their routes. At those locations
   where damage is found, repair/demolition estimates are developed. Estimates are transmitted back to
   the DCC for each critical facility/utility visited, and hard copies of estimates are also made. Data radi-
   oed back to the DCC contain only the most important information; i.e., type and extent of damage,
   major materials and equipment needed, crew size and most critical AFSs, time for repair/demolition,
   and obvious safety hazards. The written copy covers more detail such as additional materials needed
   and further scope of damage. If a critical facility or utility has suffered little or no damage, this infor-
   mation should also be transmitted to the DCC. The DCC, in turn, must inform the engineering repre-
   sentatives in the EOC of all major damage assessment results as they are reported.
   6.8.7. At those locations where damaged utilities are found, DART members attempt to isolate the
   problem but only if it can be done safely and is within the technical expertise of the team. Once a util-
108                                                                          AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      ity has been isolated, it is reported to the DCC. If a serious utility problem cannot be isolated, it is also
      reported to the DCC so a specialized team can be assigned the task. Remember, these specialized
      teams, primarily the electrical career fields, are few in number and will spend most of their time after
      an attack attending emergency generator problems. Therefore, the DARTs should make every reason-
      able effort to handle such situations without assistance.
      6.8.8. At those locations where UXOs are found, DARTs should perform the standard EOR func-
      tion—locate the munitions, identify the type, report findings back to the DCC, and mark the area with
      ropes and appropriate signs. Under no circumstances should DART members attempt to move a UXO
      even if it interferes with utility isolation or facility damage assessment. The DCC will submit the
      UXO finding data to the EOC that will, in turn, arrange for EOD support. Once the munitions are
      reported and roped off, the DARTs should continue on with their assessment run. When the munitions
      are eventually cleared, the DCC will make the determination if and when DARTs will be sent back to
      assess damage to the affected facility or utility system.
      6.8.9. As each damage assessment route is completed, DARTs report back to the DCC, handing in
      their hard copy assessment reports and awaiting further taskings. If follow-on attacks are unlikely, the
      DCC at this time normally has three options to consider pertaining to DART use. It can assign addi-
      tional damage assessment actions predicated on the most recent damage inputs from other installation
      personnel, task DART members to coordinate on-scene recovery efforts, or assign team members to
      specific repair crews for emergency repair activities.
      6.8.10. If follow-on attacks are about to occur, DART members should report to their original shelters
      and reestablish team integrity. DART vehicles are again dispersed and “resupplied” with any equip-
      ment, tools, or materials that may have been expended during earlier assessment runs. The DCC
      updates the DART damage assessment routes and grid maps with all known damage and danger areas
      so that duplicate reports are not received during subsequent damage assessment runs and the DARTs
      are knowledgeable of all known problem areas prior to their next assessment tasking.

6.9. Damage Recording and Reporting. Once damage is assessed, it must be recorded and immediately
transmitted back to the DCC for plotting, repair prioritization, and repair team selection. The speed of
reporting depends on the complete understanding of the information being relayed and adherence to
proper radio discipline by DART and DCC personnel. Communications operators and plotters in the DCC
should be personnel with engineering backgrounds if at all possible. This lessens the chance of miscom-
munication and saves time in perhaps the most demanding and hectic period of the installation recovery
process.
      6.9.1. Priorities. The routes DARTs take during damage assessment cannot be haphazardly deter-
      mined. They should be planned in advance with the highest priority areas looked at first.
          6.9.1.1. The facility priority list contained in the CE Contingency Response Plan should be used
          as a guide. In this way, the key facilities and systems on the installation will be checked and dam-
          age that has been previously unreported will be found. If a wartime location does not have a pre-
          determined facility priority list, the following can be used as a starting point.
              6.9.1.1.1. Installation C2 node and other C2 facilities directly related to combat flying squad-
              rons; e.g., squadron operations building.
              6.9.1.1.2. Communications facilities.
              6.9.1.1.3. POL/munitions facilities.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               109


         6.9.1.1.4. Fire stations.
         6.9.1.1.5. Medical facilities.
         6.9.1.1.6. Utility plants and distribution stations.
     6.9.1.2. Although these damage assessment routes are determined in advance, this does not mean
     they cannot be altered to meet the real-world situation. They should be updated from the data
     received from initial damage reports. For example, if debris or a UXO field is blocking an access
     route, simply change the access route. Once the routes have been determined and updated, they are
     assigned to specific DARTs. Common sense and a bit of quick analysis are required here. Routes
     with known power outages and major electrical damages should be assigned to the DART contain-
     ing an electrical engineer and electrical systems NCO. A route with known POL problems should
     be assigned to the team containing a POL specialist if one has been placed on a team. The basic
     thrust is to match the specific skills contained on a particular DART with the types of damages
     expected to be encountered along the assessment route.
  6.9.2. Damage Assessment Reports. There is much more to damage reporting than just calling in
  the visual battle damage inflicted upon a facility or utility. Several other factors must be addressed by
  DART members. For example, DARTs must make a determination of repair feasibility. This is an ini-
  tial decision on whether a facility or utility component can realistically be repaired. If the damage is
  so great that repairs cannot be made quickly or without huge expenditures of manpower and material,
  the facility or utility will normally be abandoned or demolished. The choice between abandoning or
  demolishing will usually be made based on safety. If the condition of the facility or utility poses a
  major hazard, demolition would be called for; if a serious hazard does not exist, abandon the facility
  or utility component in place and attend to it after installation recovery has been accomplished.
  Remember, the safety hazard determination must be based on its effect on the primary installation
  mission. For example, a structurally unstable open storage shed in the back of the supply yard, while
  posing a serious hazard to anyone entering it, would have little effect on the flying mission; therefore,
  abandon it for now. On the other hand, a structurally unstable maintenance shop adjacent to an aircraft
  fuel cell maintenance area and major taxiway should be torn down and a demolition estimate from the
  DART would be needed. If, however, the decision is made that a facility or utility component is
  repairable, a repair estimate must be made in terms of time, materials, personnel, and equipment.
     6.9.2.1. In developing damage repair estimates, DART members must be aware of the following
     factors:
         6.9.2.1.1. Repair times are critical. The quickest and least work; least material-intensive
         repair should be identified. Workarounds are totally acceptable if a facility/utility can be satis-
         factorily put back in service via such methods. Remember, the goal is to make the facility or
         utility usable once again, not to put a “peacetime” fix on it. After the threat of further attack is
         over, more permanent repairs can be made if necessary.
         6.9.2.1.2. Accuracy is important. DARTs are purposely configured with experienced per-
         sonnel with varied expertise. This expertise must be used in determining what has to be done.
         Any safety hazards that may have to be contended with during repair must be highlighted by
         the DARTs in their reports.
         6.9.2.1.3. Familiarity with available equipment and materials is necessary. Repair esti-
         mates must be made considering what resources are readily available—it cannot be assumed
         that resources can be immediately obtained through supply or contracting channels. Besides
110                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


             knowing the going-in position on equipment and materials, DARTs must also maintain a
             real-time awareness of the status of major equipment and material items. This information
             comes from the battle staff at the DCC and is important in terms of developing solutions to
             repair problems involving workarounds and quick fixes. In a wartime situation, it is prudent to
             rely only on what materials and equipment are known to be readily available on the installa-
             tion—chances are other sources of supply will not be available, much less very responsive
             during those first few hours after an attack.
             6.9.2.1.4. Knowledge of AFS capabilities is required. Repair estimates must also include
             an indication of work crew size. DART members must be familiar with the task capabilities of
             the various engineering AFSs, the multi-skilling aspects of engineer AFSs, and the general
             nature of the repairs to be accomplished. Specific repair taskings cannot be overmanned—
             manpower in a wartime situation is a precious resource.
         6.9.2.2. In those cases where repair of damaged facilities or utilities is not feasible and a demoli-
         tion action is called for, demolition estimates are then required. DART members must consider the
         following when preparing such estimates:
             6.9.2.2.1. Safety is paramount. The reason for the demolition action in the first place is to alle-
             viate a serious safety hazard—this hazard must be made perfectly clear in the estimate so per-
             sonnel are not placed in any more danger than they are already facing in doing the job.
             6.9.2.2.2. Demolition actions need only be carried out to the point where the safety hazard no
             longer exists—final cleanup can wait. Do not worry about what the work site looks like, instal-
             lation beautification does not exist in wartime.
             6.9.2.2.3. Since demolition activities are normally foreign to engineer troops, DART members
             must indicate any special equipment needs and personnel expertise in their estimates. Of par-
             ticular importance is identification of what utilities need to be isolated prior to start of demoli-
             tion.
             6.9.2.2.4. Crew size and time required for the task must be realistic and reasonably accurate.
             Again, like the repair estimate, the demolition task must not be overmanned. Use the
             multi-skilling features of engineer forces—lots of people can drive a dump truck.
      6.9.3. Higher Headquarters Reports. Certain events must be reported to higher Air Force head-
      quarters. These reports are generally completed and forwarded by the appropriate installation C2
      node, but the nature of the reports will sometimes require input from the civil engineer force during its
      damage assessment activities. A detailed discussion of each report is not necessary in this publication.
      An overview of the types of information supplied by the damage assessment team is sufficient. More
      detailed information regarding the completion of these reports is contained in AFI 10-206, Opera-
      tional Reporting.
         6.9.3.1. Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3). This report uses installation C2 node channels to
         immediately notify commanders of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of MAJ-
         COM, HQ USAF, or DOD interests. The report is submitted in accordance with AFI 10-206 to the
         Air Force Operations Center in the Pentagon and other addressees, depending on the category of
         the report. Typical incidents that could trigger an OPREP-3 report include major fire, installation
         attack, major natural disaster, terrorist attack, and major environmental contamination. The range
         of information that could be included in the OPREP-3 is extensive. However, for those events
         which result in significant damage to USAF installations, the items in Table 6.3. should provide

      adequate information from civil engineers. The DARTs are not responsible for supplying all of the
      information listed, but familiarization with the data that the BCE may have to supply for this
      report will facilitate the collection of essential information during assessment activities. The DCC
      will provide specific instructions to the DARTs if it requires information beyond a team’s normal
      report.

      and address only major engineer problems/shortfalls. Reports generated at unit level are sent to the
      major command and the parent joint command.
      6.9.3.3. Bulk Petroleum Contingency Report (REPOL). This report is submitted in accor-
      dance with AFI 10-206 by units to highlight damage and deficiencies which affect bulk petroleum
      supplies, storage, and distribution systems. Engineer input will be necessary to define system
      damage and estimated repair times. Normally generated by supply personnel, the report is for-
      warded through logistics channels to the major command.
   6.9.4. Contract Repair Documentation. Major commands play a key role in recovery activities—
   they seek and provide the funding support needed for restoration actions (normally accomplished by
   contract). To support this effort, unit-level engineers must be responsive in gathering and forwarding
   damage and requirements information. Initial damage information is provided via OPREP-3 reporting
   and perhaps telephonically. The level of detail here, however, provides a broader picture of the instal-
   lation’s condition and is meant only to be an initial assessment. Once the immediacy of the natural
   disaster or attack situation has passed (i.e., fires extinguished, personnel rescued, and basic mission
   restored), there will be a demand for comprehensive information upon which to base major recovery
112                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      and restoration planning and budgeting. Use the documentation (annotated maps, written reports, and
      notes) obtained during DART operations as a starting point. In most cases, a second visit to the dam-
      aged facility or utility will be necessary to properly assess the true extent of damage. Photographic
      documentation is an especially good method of recording the extent of damage for justification of
      future repairs. For example, photographs can be very important to show damage to structural addi-
      tions that may not have been added to original building plans. It is wise to develop an informal
      in-house capability for photographic support so you do not have to depend on others for assistance.
      The important point is to start your detailed damage assessment and requirements up-channeling
      early—a day or two after the disaster or attack. Do not wait a week or so to start passing comprehen-
      sive repair information up through command engineer channels.

6.10. Summary. Damage assessment forms the foundation for prompt and effective installation recovery
actions. Two primary types of teams that involve civil engineers are used in this activity. Damage assess-
ment teams (DAT) concentrate on airfield pavement damage assessment, whereas damage assessment and
response teams (DART) respond to assessment requirements associated with installation facilities and
utilities. DARTs initially follow predetermined routes to survey damage at mission-essential facilities and
utility nodes. If damage is found, repair or demolition estimates are developed and transmitted to the
DCC. These DART inputs provide the baseline data needed for assembling and tasking engineer facility
and utility repair crews. DARTs must be comprised of qualified, experienced personnel; be provided ade-
quate communications, transport, and protective equipment; and be completely knowledgeable of damage
assessment procedures. To round out the damage assessment process, engineers serving in installation
command and control centers must be aware of and participate in the preparation of the electronic reports
to higher headquarters.

                 UNEXPLODED EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE (UXO) OPERATIONS

7.1. Introduction. Unexploded explosive ordnance is a consequence of warfare. These UXOs are a dan-
gerous threat to mobility, personnel, equipment, and facilities. During an installation attack, the enemy
could use a combination of munitions; some that detonate on impact, others with delay-fuzes, and possi-
bly anti-personnel/material devices. The enemy’s use of these methods could drastically hinder aircraft
launch and recovery efforts by blocking rapid access of surviving aircraft to usable aircraft pavements,
impeding the movement of recovery crews to their equipment and materials, interfering with the response
of repair and rescue crews to damage sites, and instilling fear and hesitation into all installation personnel
due to the inherent danger of random or inadvertent munitions detonations. Rapid and accurate explosive
ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) becomes critical under such situations so that explosive ordnance dis-
posal (EOD) personnel can prioritize their efforts and can determine areas of the installation that may be
relatively safe to traverse. Since civil engineer recovery tasks require access to virtually all areas of the
installation, our forces must be capable of identifying, reporting, and marking UXO properly so that we
can quickly make our way to the job site and ensure our EOD personnel respond to the highest priority
needs first.

7.2. Overview. This chapter serves as a guide to all non-EOD civil engineer personnel pertaining to their
actions with respect to UXOs (Figure 7.1.). It will discuss the more common types of explosive ordnance
that may be expected, evidence usually seen if unexploded munitions are present, and the engineer’s role
in EOR. To a lesser extent, this chapter will also address the clearance of UXOs. For additional UXO
information beyond what is addressed in this volume, refer to AFTTP (I) 3-2.12, Multi-Service Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures For Unexploded Explosive Ordnance Operations, AFTTP (I) 3-2.32,

ment, and AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual.

7.3. Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR). The initial step in dealing with UXOs is reconnais-
sance. EOR involves investigating, diagnosing, locating, marking, and reporting suspected explosive ord-
nance in order to determine the need for further action (Figure 7.2.). Civil engineer personnel are in a
114                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


position to accomplish much of the EOR effort during the initial damage assessment of the installation.
The following detailed discussion of EOR activities will ensure that civil engineer personnel are well
informed about their responsibilities to this vital part of the installation recovery mission.

Figure 7.2. Personnel Use Quick Reference Guide to Identify Suspect UXOs.




      7.3.1. Engineer Involvement in EOR. Engineer forces are in a unique position to assist in EOR. In
      many cases, engineer damage assessment and emergency repair teams are the first on the scene of an
      enemy attack and are able to provide first-hand information on the presence of UXOs.
      7.3.2. Problems Associated With EOR. It should go without saying that EOR exposes engineer
      forces to a very hazardous situation. Add a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN)
      environment and the EOR task becomes even more formidable. Adding to the growing list of com-
      plexities involved with EOR, the prudent BCE should expect some misidentification of UXOs by per-
      sonnel with limited ordnance recognition experience and should make an allowance for the difficulty
      of locating and identifying buried or hidden ordnance. It should also be expected that the same item of
      ordnance will be reported by different crews or people multiple times.
      7.3.3. UXO General Precautions. Observe (with binoculars if necessary) all ordnance from the saf-
      est distance that still allows the gathering of required reporting information. Be sure to keep adequate
      frontal and overhead protection. If an item is discovered that is believed to be a UXO, additional
      reconnaissance for the sole purpose of a complete report is not performed until EOD has arrived.
      Other precautions include the following:
         7.3.3.1. Protection. Personnel performing EOR duties on foot should wear protective body armor
         if available. If EOR operations are performed from a vehicle, it should provide reasonable protec-
         tion to the occupants. This protection could be provided by a special protective vehicle, such as an
         Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (UA-HMMWV) commonly referred
         to as a HUMVEE (Figure 7.3.), or a conventional vehicle could be modified with protective
         armor. For example, a truck may be fitted with steel plates around the cab area to provide protec-
         tion for the occupants. Other precautions include the following:
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             115


Figure 7.3. Up-Armored HUMVEE.




      7.3.3.2. Disturbances. Do not touch or disturb the UXO or associated components (Figure 7.4.),
      including loose wires or parachutes. Disturbances, either mechanical or otherwise, may cause the
      item to detonate.

Figure 7.4. Do Not Touch UXO—Leave It to the EOD Experts.




      7.3.3.3. Chemical/Biological Hazards. Assume the presence of chemical agents when there is
      the presence of liquid droplets, dead animals, dissolved paint, or peculiar odors. Put on protective
      equipment immediately.
      7.3.3.4. Radio Transmit Hazard. If reporting by radio, transmit from a minimum safe distance
      of 25 ft (8 m) for handheld or 100 ft (30 m) for vehicle radios; otherwise the signals may cause
      some UXOs to detonate (Figure 7.5.).
116                                                                 AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 7.5. Maintain Safe Distance to Prevent UXO Detonation From Radio Signals.




      7.3.3.5. Evacuate. Upon identification of the UXO, retire to a safe distance and enforce evacua-
      tion measures, when possible. Do not remain in the immediate danger area any longer than abso-
      lutely necessary. Evacuate all personnel and equipment. After evacuating all personnel and
      equipment, allow movement within the area only for essential operations. See Table 7.1. for evac-
      uation distances.

      7.3.3.6. Isolate. Sometimes, for mission-related, operational, or other reasons, personnel and/or
      equipment cannot be evacuated or you cannot leave a particular area. When this happens, isolate
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             117


      either your assets (personnel, equipment, and operations) from the UXO or isolate the UXO from
      your assets. Establish safe areas and limit exposure within the hazard area.
      7.3.3.7. Barricade. Personnel and equipment that cannot be moved can sometimes be protected
      with barricades. A barricade is an artificial barrier that provides limited protection by channeling
      the blast and fragmentation away from the threatened area. “Suppressive” barricades are con-
      structed to isolate an explosion; to deflect the thermal/shock wave, and absorb low-angle,
      high-speed fragments (Figure 7.6.). “Protective” barricades are constructed around exposed
      resources to shelter from overpressure and impact of high-angle, low-speed fragments, which can
      escape over the top of “suppressive” barricades (Figure 7.7.). Natural terrain features can provide
      adequate frontal and overhead protection. If natural barricades are judged inadequate, construct
      artificial barriers (see paragraphs 7.4.3.3.1 through 7.4.3.3.3 below). Constructing barricades is
      very time-consuming and requires a large number of sandbags or earth-moving equipment. While
      building barricades, personnel should not disturb the UXO and should wear all protective equip-
      ment (to include Kevlar helmets and vests). Depending on the size of the UXO, build suppressive
      barricades around the UXO to protect the entire area, or build protective barricades next to
      non-evacuated personnel or equipment to shelter from overpressure and impact of high-angle,
      low-speed fragments of exploding ordnance. Priority should be given to evacuation of resources
      and building protective barricading.

Figure 7.6. Suppressive Barrier Around Small-Yield UXO.




         7.3.3.7.1. Small-Yield UXO. For small-yield UXOs, generally less than 3 inches in diameter,
         a double-wall thickness of sandbags should surround the area of the UXO. Stack the sandbags
         to at least 3 feet high and thick enough (minimum 2 sandbags deep) to protect personnel and
         equipment from the blast and fragmentation.
         7.3.3.7.2. Medium-Yield UXO. For medium-yield UXOs, generally from 3 inches to 10
         inches in diameter, a wall thickness of four or five sandbags within 5 to 7 feet should surround
         the area of the UXO. Stack the sandbags to a height of at least 5 feet to protect assets.

Figure 7.7. Protective Barrier Around Equipment (for Medium-Yield UXO).




          7.3.3.7.3. Large-Yield UXO. UXOs over 10 inches in diameter are generally too large to
          build effective barricades around them. In these cases, barricade the equipment and personnel
          activity areas.
      7.3.3.8. Trenching and Facility Reinforcement. Additional precautions which can increase
      facility survivability are trenching and reinforcement of adjacent facilities in proximity to UXOs.
      Trenching is useful for mitigating the ground shock wave produced by UXO (Figure 7.8.). Facil-
      ity reinforcement also helps to protect buildings from blast pressure and earth shock waves from
      UXO (Figure 7.9.).

   7.3.4. EOR Equipment. The equipment used by personnel performing EOR depends on the severity
   of the attack and the availability of materials. As a minimum, the equipment in Table 7.2. is sug-
   gested:

Table 7.2. Suggested EOR Equipment.
                                          EOR Equipment
              Installation layout maps (or geospatial site-mapping information and
              services)
              UXO/hazard markers
              Radios
              Binoculars
              Body armor
              Hardened vehicle (protective armor)
              Filled sandbags
              Flashlight and batteries

   7.3.5. Types of Explosive Ordnance. Weapons manufacturers are constantly making numerous
   types of explosive ordnance in all shapes, sizes, and lethality. Knowing the type of munitions that
   could be encountered during EOR is essential to individual safety and accurate reporting of UXOs.
   According to AFTTP (I) 3-2.12, explosive ordnance is generally grouped into four main types:
   dropped, projected, thrown, and placed.
       7.3.5.1. Dropped Ordnance. Regardless of its type or purpose, dropped ordnance is dispensed
       from an aircraft. There are three subgroups of dropped ordnance: bombs, dispensers, and submu-
       nitions (mines, bomblets, and grenades). Consider all bombs and submunitions to have magnetic/
       seismic or anti-disturbance fuzing. Simply stated, this means approaching them could detonate the
       ordnance.
120                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


         7.3.5.2. Projected Ordnance. Projected ordnance can be projectiles, mortars, rockets, rifle gre-
         nades, or guided missiles.
         7.3.5.3. Thrown Ordnance. Commonly known as hand grenades, classification of thrown ord-
         nance is by use as follows: fragmentation (also called defensive), antitank, smoke, and illumina-
         tion. Moving, jarring, or otherwise disturbing this ordnance may cause it to explode. Never pick
         up or disturb a hand grenade, even if the spoon and safety pin are still attached. Consider all gre-
         nades to have anti-disturbance or anti-removal devices.
         7.3.5.4. Placed Ordnance. Placed ordnance is commonly referred to as land mines. Land mines
         are hidden, buried, or placed on the surface, and often cannot be seen. Visual detection of land
         mines is often difficult. Consider all mines to have anti-disturbance or anti-removal devices.
         Mines equipped with magnetic or seismic influence fuzes may detonate when disturbed. Conduct
         all observation of this ordnance with binoculars at the greatest distance that still allows gathering
         of required information. Placed land mines destroy vehicles and inflict casualties on personnel
         who step on or drive across them. There are three basic types of land mines: antitank, antiperson-
         nel, and chemical.
      7.3.6. UXO Recognition and Reporting. The recognition of a UXO hazard is the initial and most
      important step in reacting to a UXO hazard. United States (US) personnel have been killed or injured
      by UXO in virtually every conflict or contingency in which the US has participated. This can be
      attributed primarily to unfamiliarity with UXO countermeasures and avoidance procedures. Personnel
      operating in a contingency environment should be able to recognize and react safely to UXO hazards.
      The hallmark of good EOR is proper identification, marking, and reporting of suspected UXO (Table
      7.3.).

Table 7.3. Recognition and Reporting Steps.
                                     IDENTIFY—MARK—REPORT
                          Recognize the UXO hazard
                          Take immediate action (mark and evaluate)
                          Report the UXO hazard
                          DO NOT TOUCH IT!
                          Do not move closer to it
                          Mark it from where you are (make sure the marker is
                          visible from all directions and at night)
                          Use protective measures to include evacuation, isolation,
                          and barricades
                          Report it by class and number

         7.3.6.1. Identification. Proper identification of UXOs when reporting assists EOD in understand-
         ing the hazard in order to provide the commander with the best course of action to mitigate the
         threat.
             7.3.6.1.1. Evidence of UXO. Following an enemy attack, UXO is likely at any location on
             the installation. However, if UXO exists, it may be concentrated in those areas of the installa-
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                         121


        tion heaviest hit by attacking forces. The general search area for UXOs and the possible type
        of UXO in the area can be determined from the effects of the munitions which did explode.
        The extent of damage to the area or facility can give personnel performing EOR an indication
        of the size and type of munitions used and provide valuable clues regarding the identification
        of UXO. The following factors can be used to gain clues to possible types of UXOs present
        and the potential damage or injury that could occur if the ordnance detonated.
           7.3.6.1.1.1. Blast Effects. The visible blast effects from ordnance that exploded in the
           area can be a relatively accurate prediction of damage which could occur to adjacent facil-
           ities if accidental detonation of the UXO occurred.
           7.3.6.1.1.2. Fragmentation. An examination of fragments in a destruction zone should
           indicate the type UXO that should be searched for. The presence of fragments from clus-
           ter-type bombs should alert the team to smaller explosive devices which may have been
           widely scattered from the initial point of impact.
           7.3.6.1.1.3. Incendiary. Incendiary ordnance can be especially destructive because it
           feeds fires and compounds initial damage. Evidence of incendiary ordnance should be
           included in the EOR report to the EOC so fire protection support can be positioned to con-
           tain the flames if incendiary UXO detonates.
           7.3.6.1.1.4. Craters. The size of bomb craters is a good indication of the size ordnance
           involved and is an indication of the radius of damage to be expected if UXO of the same
           type detonates.
           7.3.6.1.1.5. Camouflets. The camouflet is the result of an underground burst of a bomb
           (Figure 7.10.). In areas where camouflets are numerous, personnel performing EOR
           should be especially observant for evidence of buried UXO. Camouflets can collapse and
           are full of poisonous gases, void of oxygen.
           7.3.6.1.1.6. Buried UXO. Aircraft-delivered ordnance which does not explode is likely to
           be completely or partially buried due to its impact force with the surface. Personnel con-
           ducting EOR must be familiar with the visible evidence of buried UXO as well as the
           methods for locating and identifying the ordnance. The most common evidence of buried
           UXO is the entry hole. An entry hole with the absence of a camouflet, crater, or related
           damage is a good indication that buried UXO may be present. When such evidence is
           found, calculate the approximate size and location of the ordnance based upon the size of
           the entry hole. Table 7.4. provides information for making these approximations. A more
           specific location of buried UXOs may be determined by the use of mine or metal detectors
           by qualified EOD technicians.

      7.3.6.2. Marking. All UXO discovered by personnel conducting EOR should be clearly marked
      as hazardous areas. Use the standard UXO marker identified in Figure 7.17. This marking serves
      two purposes. First, it identifies the location of the UXO to the EOD team entering the area to dis-
      arm the UXO. Second, the marking warns other persons of the location of the UXO so that it may
      be avoided. When possible, establish a physical barrier to reduce the risk of unintentional entry
      into the hazard area. Roping off the area around the UXO ensures that persons do not wander into
      the danger zone by accident (Figure 7.18.). Table 7.5. provides guidance on roping off areas
126                                                                 AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      around various sizes of UXO. Note that these recommendations are based upon expected crater
      diameter and do not provide adequate safety from flying debris or blast effect to unshielded per-
      sonnel. Refer to Table 7.1. for adequate evacuation distances.

      7.3.6.3. Reporting. Timely and accurate UXO reporting is crucial to installation recovery after an
      attack. Paragraph 7.3.6.3.1. and Table 7.6. discuss basic UXO reporting guidelines. Paragraph
      7.3.6.3.2. highlights Explosive Hazard Spot Reports (EH SPOTREP) implemented by STANAG
      2143, which do not supersede (unless specified) specific Air Force reporting requirements.
          7.3.6.3.1. Basic UXO Reporting. Report UXO by class and number using AFVA 32-4022 or
          the UXO identification guide in the Airman’s Manual (i.e., F5 or “Foxtrot” 5 would be a gre-
          nade. The class would be Rocket Propelled Grenades and Grenades - the “5” corresponds to
          the number on the chart). Report shape, color, size, etc. If you cannot recognize it by using the
          UXO identification guide, it may be an improvised explosive device (IED).

                     Etc.
              5   Report the Condition of the UXO:
                     Is it Leaking?
                     Is it Broken?
                     Is it Intact?
                     Etc.
              6   Report any other Significant Information
      7.3.6.3.2. STANAG 2143 Explosive Hazard Spot Reports. The EH SPOTREP is a timely
      and detailed, 2-way reporting system; it clearly identifies the location of the UXO hazard,
      briefly describes the hazard, provides the priority for clearing, and identifies the unit(s)
      affected. The EH SPOTREP is the first-echelon report that is sent when an observer detects
      UXO. Units can use the report to request help in handling a UXO hazard if the unit cannot
      reduce the hazard either by using protective works or moving away from the UXO. The report
      also assists the commander in setting priorities based on the situation. The report consists of
      nine lines and is sent by the fastest means available (Table 7.7.). Refer to AFTTP (I) 3-2.12 for
      more information on EH SPOTREPs and specific routing procedures.

7.4. Explosive Ordnance Disarmament and Removal.
   7.4.1. UXO Safing. As previously discussed, non-EOD civil engineer personnel should never
   attempt to disarm unexploded explosive ordnance or to move ordnance not rendered safe by EOD per-
   sonnel. This phase of the UXO operation is only mentioned to outline the support that EOD teams
   may require. This support could take the form of constructing protective berms around the danger
   zone during disarmament operations and providing equipment support for access to or removal of the
   UXO. For example, civil engineers might be called upon to rope off the area around the UXO, provide
   protective reinforcement to adjacent structures, supply heavy equipment to remove debris for access
   to the UXO, or isolate major utilities in the area.
   7.4.2. Removal. Removal of UXO may occur under differing conditions. In certain situations when
   the UXO location is critical and time is a vital concern, EOD personnel may move the UXO without
   performing render-safe procedures. In such a case, EOD will drag the UXO to another location for
   defuzing. If time permits, EOD can disarm the ordnance before removal. Once this is accomplished,
   the ordnance can be removed by EOD personnel, other civil engineer forces, or simply left in place
   provided it does not present an obstacle to installation operations. Understanding of UXO removal
130                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      will be enhanced by a discussion of equipment requirements and actions of the ordnance removal
      teams.
      7.4.3. Equipment. As in other recovery operations, equipment requirements must be structured to
      individual circumstances, but the following items are recommended minimums.
         7.4.3.1. Towing devices. May consist of cables, ropes, chains, or similar items equipped with
         hooks and having a minimum pull capacity of at least 6,500-7,000 pounds. Several towing devices
         may be required.
         7.4.3.2. Handling bars and handling slings.
      7.4.4. Small Submunitions Procedures. The recommended clearance procedure is to push submu-
      nitions from the surface into craters or ditches using specially-equipped vehicles such as the All-Pur-
      pose Remote Transport System (ARTS) as illustrated in Figure 7.19. When craters or ditches are not
      available, use sandbags or other barriers (as addressed in paragraph 7.3.3.7.) to create a berm to limit
      damage if submunitions explode.

Figure 7.19. All-Purpose Remote Transport System (ARTS).




      7.4.5. Large Bombs. The recommended procedure for removing large bombs is to initially drag
      them from the critical area with a dump truck, snowplow, bulldozer, or similar vehicle equipped with
      a pintle hook. When time permits, the bomb should be loaded on a vehicle with a layer of sand or
      select fill and fitted with armor plating to provide fragmentation protection to the driver. A minimum
      of 200 feet of cable should be used to drag the bomb to a pre-dug hole or a bomb crater located at a
      safe distance from mission-essential areas to prevent additional damage should the bomb detonate. If
      the bomb has not been de-armed (Cat A), always disconnect the cable at the tow vehicle and abandon
      it to keep personnel exposure to a minimum. If the bomb has been de-armed, retrieve the tow line for
      future use.
      7.4.6. Buried Ordnance. The approximate location of the buried ordnance must be determined and
      marked. If the location of the ordnance cannot be determined, mark the hole of entry. Do not attempt
      immediate neutralization or removal of these bombs. Leave buried ordnance in place until conditions
      permit safe excavation.

7.5. Mass Ordnance Clearance. Earlier in this chapter small submunitions were briefly discussed and
some illustrations were presented. These types of munitions are particularly troublesome due to their
small size, large numbers, and large area coverage. Up to 2,000 of these items can be dispensed from a
single bomb or canister and can be armed to explode on contact or when disturbed by equipment or per-
sonnel. They come in various shapes and sizes and more often than not are extremely hard to detect and
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                   131


locate. We can expect to encounter these munitions in the same areas that standard bombs are dropped—
they are highly effective in hindering access to damaged areas and delaying repair efforts.
   7.5.1. The presence of submunitions has a serious impact on civil engineer efforts, particularly air-
   field damage repair (ADR) activities and damage assessment actions. These UXO will block access to
   our equipment and materials, hinder our movement to damaged areas, and interfere with progress on
   the job site. This will be a particular problem during ADR operations since relatively great distances
   are involved between dispersal areas, stockpiles, and the craters and spalls on the airfield pavements.
   Because of the distances and the wide areas our forces have to cover, our potential of encountering
   considerable UXO of this nature is great.
   7.5.2. Compounding the UXO problem is the fact that the Air Force has only a limited EOD capabil-
   ity—it is a very small career field. In wartime, it is EOD’s mission to safe and clear the massive quan-
   tities of unexploded munitions that will be present. Expect only twenty or so of these individuals at
   your wartime installation.
   7.5.3. Conceptually, after an attack some of our engineering technicians join with our EOD personnel
   to perform airfield damage assessment. ADR operations can only begin in earnest after these damage
   assessment teams have completed their airfield assessment actions and remaining EOD personnel
   have de-armed and cleared sufficient munitions to allow access to the crater damage locations. The
   scope of these efforts could include numerous unexploded bombs and several submunitions fields.
   7.5.4. Our activities relative to installation facility and utility damage repair are likewise affected by
   mass ordnance clearance requirements. Initially following an attack, EOD forces and many of our
   engineer forces will be dedicated to airfield pavement repair efforts. Engineer damage assessment and
   response teams (DARTs), however, will be required to perform assessment activities on critical instal-
   lation facilities and utilities concurrently with the ongoing ADR efforts. The DARTs will obviously
   also encounter UXO and must be extremely observant so they can complete their assigned assessment
   routes and emergency actions safely. Flexibility is the key here—the DARTs may have to alter their
   routes periodically to bypass UXO, yet still keep to a reasonable time schedule. Their EOR inputs are
   critical. These inputs will determine the priority of continued EOD mass ordnance clearance once air-
   field pavements have been completed which, in turn, will influence the priority of engineer response
   to installation facilities and utilities. In all likelihood, some damage repair to installation facilities and
   utilities can be performed by remaining engineer forces in those areas found to be free of UXO. Full
   attention to such efforts, however, cannot be properly accomplished until EOD personnel have
   checked and cleared the installation areas containing submunitions UXO fields.
   7.5.5. As stated earlier, mass ordnance clearance is an EOD responsibility in wartime. However, this
   does not necessarily mean that other engineers stand idly by waiting for EOD personnel to fully com-
   plete their activities. Keeping reasonable safety practices in mind, we must begin our wartime tasks as
   soon as we are able. For example, start repairing the first sets of craters on the runway as soon as EOD
   personnel have progressed sufficiently down the airfield. Additionally, we must be prepared to assist
   EOD personnel in mass ordnance clearance in terms of providing support for movement of de-armed
   munitions off the field or providing sandbag support for protective berms.
   7.5.6. As long as an EOD capability exists on an installation, non-EOD engineer personnel should
   under no circumstances attempt to remove or tamper with unexploded explosive ordnance that has not
   been declared safe. Doing so could cause additional facility destruction and the death or injury of
   essential civil engineers. FES personnel and vehicles should never be selected for pure EOR or UXO
132                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      removal tasks. Loss of FES resources could have catastrophic consequences on the installation recov-
      ery effort. Having said this, however, we must remember that in wartime many rules may have to be
      bent for the sake of mission accomplishment. If the EOD function becomes attrited, non-EOD civil
      engineers may have to step into the mass ordnance clearance role since there is probably no one else
      that can. Such action would naturally be limited to only those areas that most affect launch and recov-
      ery and will obviously require the utmost in flexibility and ingenuity from our forces.

7.6. Summary. This chapter has discussed the various types of unexploded explosive ordnance that may
be encountered in a wartime situation and the engineer’s role in explosive ordnance reconnaissance. It
addressed the EOR process in terms of identifying, locating, marking, and reporting UXO. Also discussed
were the role of EOD personnel in UXO clearance and the supporting actions required of non-EOD civil
engineer personnel. Performance of proper explosive ordnance reconnaissance is a necessity—it allows
EOD personnel to respond more quickly, permits other engineers to get their wartime taskings accom-
plished faster, and, perhaps most importantly, protects our equipment and the lives of our personnel.

                         EMERGENCY UTILITY AND FACILITY REPAIR

8.1. Introduction. Immediately following a disaster or an attack by hostile forces, civil engineer person-
nel must begin to repair damage and restore vital services necessary for the installation to continue its
assigned mission. The primary concern will be in repairing runway and taxiway damage which prevents
the launch and recovery of mission aircraft. Other repairs, such as those to restore critical installation
facilities and utilities, must proceed at a rate commensurate with available resources and priorities estab-
lished by the command element. It may not be feasible to delay main base repairs until all runway and
taxiway repair activities are complete. If ruptured petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) lines pose hazards
to command and control facilities, the installation population, or aircraft servicing operations, immediate
response may be required to defuse the threat. A damaged or burning facility may require immediate
assistance by civil engineer forces to extract entrapped personnel. Ideally, there would be adequate per-
sonnel and materials available to accomplish simultaneous recovery tasks. However, the more likely situ-
ation will find the base civil engineer (BCE) making some very prudent and judicious decisions to assign
repair priorities to a wide range of damaged facilities and utilities whose restoration is critical to mission
support.

8.2. Overview. This chapter will briefly examine the responsibilities, principles, and concepts of expedi-
ent utility and facility repairs during contingency operations (Figure 8.1.). Detailed procedures for per-
forming expedient utility and facility repairs are addressed in Volume 7 of this publication series and in
the AFH 10-222 series handbooks. Our discussion here will begin with an initial review of repair respon-
sibilities and continue with an examination of basic repair considerations and unique civil engineer
CONUS and theater of operations procedures.

8.3. Repair Responsibilities. Air Force engineer efforts following an emergency are limited to expedi-
ent repairs required to return the installation to an operational status. Air Force engineers will make air-
field damage repairs and minimum-essential emergency repairs to other critical installation facilities such
as command and control centers, communications centers, maintenance facilities, and POL facilities.
These repairs are normally limited to shoring weakened buildings, securing breaks in utility lines, elimi-
nating live electrical wires, rerouting utility lines aboveground, and quick-fixing roofs, walls, and floors.
Major repair and restoration beyond these efforts are generally designated to the specific construction
agent for the particular geographic area. Although upon request, the Air Force can perform unspecified
minor military construction if it has jurisdiction over the facility. Table 8.1. lists construction agents for
geographic areas outside the US.

8.4. Repair Considerations.
   8.4.1. Safety. Safety is an important consideration when accomplishing any type of repair, but it is
   especially important with regard to expedient repairs following an emergency. The very nature of the
   disaster or attack recovery environment makes repair activities inherently dangerous. Structures may
   be weakened; live electrical wires may be down; explosive gas vapors may be present; chemical, bio-
   logical, or nuclear contamination may be prevalent; and UXOs may litter the installation. Installation
   medical facilities may be crowded with casualties and civil engineer manpower may be at critical lev-
   els. These conditions will make it essential that resources are not further taxed by injuries caused
   through neglect of safety practices. It is the responsibility of every repair crew member to perform
   recovery tasks with the utmost concern for safety.
   8.4.2. Extent of Repair. The efforts of Air Force civil engineers in the period immediately following
   an emergency should be limited to minimum emergency repair of crucial facilities and utilities. All
   work should be done expediently, concentrating on functional rather than cosmetic repairs. A primary
   consideration when determining what repairs should be made is the function of the damaged facility
   or utility. Those damaged activities which are not essential to the installation mission and do not
   present a hazard should be left as they are until time and resources permit conventional repairs.
   8.4.3. Basic Guidelines for Repair Work. Repair work following a disaster or hostile attack will go
   much smoother if the following basic guidelines are remembered:
      8.4.3.1. Substitution. Under some circumstances, damaged utilities, particularly foreign systems,
      may be repaired more efficiently by modifying the original system and substituting other materials
      and equipment. For example, prime item replacement parts for foreign electrical or water systems
      may not be available but the system can be restored to operation by using approximate size or
      capacity US standard parts. The extent of damage and available local stocks of repair parts and
      materials are governing factors.
      8.4.3.2. Expedient Repair. Since time is normally a limiting factor in repairs made during instal-
      lation recovery, rapid completion of the job is more important than economy of labor, materials,
      and equipment. In making improvised repairs, any suitable material or equipment available is used
      to meet immediate needs. A repaired broken water main does not have to be leak-proof to be func-
      tional. Expedient repairs are improved as time and supplies permit.
      8.4.3.3. Cannibalization. Systems having identical or similar components may be restored by
      robbing parts from some damaged units to repair others.
      8.4.3.4. Local Materials and Supplies. Local materials should be used whenever possible to
      reserve shipping space for more essential items.
      8.4.3.5. Use of Civilians. Civilian contract assistance, if available, can be a valuable asset during
      installation recovery efforts. Military authorities should emphasize the extent of repair work to be
      done to prevent rehabilitation beyond immediate military needs. If the work is being done follow-
      ing a hostile attack, especially in overseas locations, civilians must be carefully selected to avoid
      possible sabotage.
      8.4.3.6. Use of Portable Area Lighting. The damage following any major contingency is likely
      to dictate a requirement for portable lighting. Airfield damage repair operations performed at night
      will require substantial lighting for the repair operations taking place on the minimum operating
      strip and access taxiways. Damage repair to other areas of the installation may require lighting and
136                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


         electrical power for hand tool operations. Performing many force beddown tasks during hours of
         darkness would be virtually impossible without some type of lighting. To provide lighting for
         these operations, three common options are available.
             8.4.3.6.1. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Units. At most installations, AGE lighting
             units will be used by maintenance personnel during aircraft repair and reservicing operations.
             Borrowing such units from the maintenance complex could provide lighting support for recov-
             ery situations. This option, however, should be viewed as a fallback position since there is no
             guarantee that AGE units will be immediately available to engineer forces when needed.
             8.4.3.6.2. Temporary Lighting. Using standard electrical repair materials and a small gener-
             ator such as that included in the Prime BEEF team kit, temporary lighting can be fabricated in
             the field to serve small area projects and needs.
             8.4.3.6.3. Portable Floodlight Set. The ADR equipment package and WRM force beddown
             equipment sets include portable lighting sets which are most adaptable to our recovery
             requirements (Figure 8.2.). Similar units are also part of the Prime BEEF team kit. All lights
             are fully adjustable and operate simultaneously or individually.

Figure 8.2. Portable Light Sets.




      8.4.4. Repair Priorities. Immediate repair priorities should be established following a disaster or
      hostile attack. These priorities are based on previously developed contingency response plans, as well
      as from reports on the extent of damage following the emergency and the immediate operational
      requirements facing the installation. Generally, lifesaving operations and damage repair to the runway
      and taxiway system (if the installation supports flying operations) must be considered as the most
      essential. After lifesaving operations and runway repairs, the prioritized activities listed in Table 8.2.
      should be considered for repair efforts. These priorities are not “set in concrete.” It would be impossi-
      ble for any priority listing to be inflexible considering the variations that may occur from the CONUS
      to theater operations and from disasters to enemy attacks. Look upon these priorities as general guid-
      ance, realizing that the actual contingency situation will dictate specific repair priorities.

Table 8.2. General Guidance for Repair Priority.
                                                Repair Priorities
        Navigational Aids/Runway Lighting. NAVAIDS and runway lighting are vital to the operation of
  1     aircraft in continuing the installation mission. Civil engineer efforts at these facilities will consist
        of repairs to electrical power systems, mechanical repairs, and structural repairs.
        Command and Control Facilities. The various command and control facilities coordinate
        installation flying and non-flying activities and are essential for effective operations following a
  2
        disaster or hostile attack. Civil engineer support will consist of structural and utility repairs as well
        as continued expedient maintenance to ensure that these critical facilities remain in operation.
        Communications Facilities. Reliable communications are required for coordination of rescue and
        recovery efforts following a disaster and for the effective management of combat resources after an
  3     enemy attack. In either case, the civil engineer’s function will be to provide utility and structural
        repairs to communications facilities and any assistance that might be required for the
        communications repair crews.
        POL/Munitions Facilities. Adequate supplies of POL for both aircraft and ground vehicles will
        be required during an emergency. Repairs to these facilities will generally be performed by fuel
        specialists, but the civil engineer force should be prepared to lend its expertise as required. Repair
  4
        of munitions facilities will be crucial following an enemy attack to support future combat
        operations. If these facilities are damaged during a disaster, repairs can probably be delayed unless
        absolutely essential for the installation mission.
        Fire Station. Following certain disasters or an enemy attack, there are likely to be conditions
        which will contribute to the start and spread of fires. Additionally, during any emergency, there
  5     will be requirements for the specialized rescue skills of FES personnel. Since the fire station must
        continue to function to manage these diverse activities, restoration of structural integrity and basic
        utilities will be essential.
        Medical Facilities. The numerous injuries that will occur during an emergency require that
  6
        medical facilities receive a high priority in contingency repairs.

8.5. CONUS versus Theater Repairs. The distinction between the CONUS and theater repairs may be
very slight, depending upon the nature of the disaster and the type of repairs to be accomplished. Natural
and man-caused disasters can impact both the CONUS and theater locations causing similar damage and
necessitating similar repairs. Much of the damage associated with a conventional enemy attack at a the-
ater installation could be duplicated at a CONUS location by an earthquake or terrorist attack. The follow-
ing paragraphs will highlight some common differences between the CONUS and theater repair
operations, keeping in mind that many of the basic repair techniques will be the same regardless of loca-
tion.
      8.5.1. CONUS Repair Operations. The primary advantage of conducting repair operations at a
      CONUS location is that the civil engineer repair team is generally working with American- manufac-
      tured tools, equipment, and materials. Replacement parts and materials obtained from a supplier or
      salvaged from damaged facilities will likely be a standard size and require less field modification to
      complete an expedient repair. Manpower support is also much more reliable. A core of civil service
      employees with years of experience and know-how is normally available at each installation for disas-
      ter response activities. Experience has also shown that contractors working on an installation will
138                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      oftentimes unhesitatingly assist in disaster response measures. Lastly, support from off-base sources,
      both with respect to manpower and materials, is likely to be more readily available than in certain the-
      ater locations.
      8.5.2. Theater Repair Operations.
         8.5.2.1. Repairs at a theater installation following a disaster can be more complex than the same
         repairs at a CONUS location. Metric sizing of various components is common in overseas areas,
         and the repair team’s tools may not be ideally suited for every piece of equipment. Building mate-
         rials and other supplies obtained from local vendors may be of non-standard sizes or of different
         qualities than those available in the United States. Electrical systems at theater installations are a
         major area requiring adjustment of repair methods. Although power systems should always be
         checked to determine voltages, 220 voltage, 50-cycle current is common throughout the world
         with a few exceptions such as the United States and Saudi Arabia.
         8.5.2.2. The differences that may exist between the CONUS and theater systems should not deter
         the theater civil engineer personnel in their repair efforts. Even the most diverse systems or mate-
         rials can be made to work together through the use of innovative field expedient methods. For
         example, American-made and European-made pipe of slightly different sizes could be connected
         by welding, with makeshift rubber gaskets fitted to ensure a tight seal. As another illustration,
         damaged components of an older European heating system, requiring custom-made replacement
         parts, could be repaired by using field-fabricated components or parts cannibalized from a similar
         system.
         8.5.2.3. The degree of host nation support at theater locations also impacts the ability to perform
         emergency repair taskings. At some locations, host nation support will be plentiful, equaling the
         capabilities of CONUS locations. At other sites, host nation support may be essentially non-exis-
         tent. Host nation support for expedient repair activities could range from provision of well- trained
         military units and contractors with substantial amounts of materials and equipment to supply of
         only the bare essentials in the way of basic construction materials and unskilled labor. The differ-
         ences in host nation support capabilities make every theater installation a unique operating loca-
         tion in terms of expedient facility and utility repair.

8.6. Summary. Expedient methods will be required to repair installation damage resulting from a natural
disaster or enemy attack. Considerations include extent of damage, principles of repair, and priorities of
repair following an emergency condition. Air Force engineers have the responsibility for emergency
repairs using expedient methods on USAF installations. The DOD construction agent for the area nor-
mally has responsibility for major restoration and emergency repairs beyond Air Force organic capability.
In this regard, however, the DOD construction agent may not have forces immediately available; there-
fore, the BCE must plan accordingly. The CONUS and theater expedient repair techniques may differ
substantially due to the local environment, availability of resources, and the types of systems needing
repair.
      8.6.1. If expedient repairs are to be accomplished in a timely manner following a catastrophe, it is
      important that the recovery effort be well organized and coordinated. Starting with initial damage
      assessment, all activities are structured to reflect the existing situation. DARTs are manned with per-
      sonnel having experience in the major structural- and utility-related engineering trades and are
      instructed on the type of information needed for repair planning and response. The DCC uses the dam-
      age assessment inputs from the assessment teams to build an installation recovery strategy. As dam-
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             139


  aged areas are identified, expedient repair efforts are organized to restore vital installation
  infrastructure. Repairs are concentrated on three major areas: runway ancillary equipment, crucial
  installation utility systems, and key installation structures.
     8.6.1.1. Runway ancillary equipment includes aircraft arresting systems, airfield lighting, naviga-
     tional aids, and supporting utilities. These systems are critical to the launch and recovery of com-
     bat aircraft and therefore receive high priority for repair efforts.
     8.6.1.2. Installation utility systems include electrical, water, POL, natural gas, HVAC, sewer, and
     drainage. Expedient repairs to these systems generally include isolation of the systems or quick
     fixes such as clamps and splices, but in some cases, a new source of the utility must also be pro-
     vided. Installation of mobile generators and construction of shallow wells with the accompanying
     water treatment equipment may be necessary.
     8.6.1.3. Expedient repair of mission-critical structures is generally limited to shoring and patching
     activities. In some situations, however, demolition is required to eliminate major safety hazards.
  8.6.2. Expedient repairs are generally considered complete when major damage has been eliminated
  and most systems are capable of performing their basic functions. Civil engineer forces now turn their
  efforts to a more permanent upgrade of these makeshift remedies and the organization of resources for
  the continuing operations and maintenance required to sustain the installation mission.

           OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) AND FOLLOW-ON REPAIR

9.1. Introduction. Expedient repairs are completed, and the threat of continued enemy activity or a
recurrence of the natural phenomenon that caused the disaster is minimal. This is not the time, however,
to stop and rest. The BCE must now shift efforts from the expedient mode to a more deliberate mode of
operation and maintenance (O&M) as well as taking action to facilitate improved repairs. Using informa-
tion from early damage assessment, follow-on visits to damage locations, and knowledge of the installa-
tion mission, a work plan must be developed. This plan defines what work needs to be done and when,
and suggests methods of accomplishment. Safe, alternate transportation routes must be established,
diminished supplies must be replenished, and remote stockpiling must be considered.

9.2. Overview. After expedient repairs are made, the installation shifts to an O&M mode for continued
operation. The focus then changes to upgrading previous makeshift repairs to allow for extended opera-
tions and the maintenance of sustained flying operations (Figure 9.1.). As in the initial recovery phase,
identification of required work is essential. This chapter outlines general procedures for identifying and
documenting follow-on work requirements. Information is also included which outlines civil engineer
options for accomplishment of this work. For tasks within the capability of in-house forces, guidance is
provided on making repairs which are more durable and better support the installation’s mission. Later
sections of the chapter deal with alternate transportation routes for use during and after emergencies.
Maintenance and repair of existing routes are emphasized with design and construction of new routes cov-
ered briefly as a last resort measure. Finally, resupply of diminished stocks needed for operations, mainte-
nance, and upgrade of repairs is addressed. Consideration for dispersed stockpiling of materials is also
included.

9.3. O&M Considerations.
   9.3.1. Safety. Even though the urgency of the immediate disaster recovery phase has passed, safety is
   still a critical consideration. Personnel will experience a state of mental and physical exhaustion
   unlike any other previously experienced. Safety is everyone’s concern, but supervisors should be
   especially observant and cautious. Watch for signs of excessive fatigue, and do not allow personnel to
   overextend themselves. Carelessness usually accompanies fatigue. Shortcuts taken when people are
   tired and not thinking clearly can have disastrous results.
   9.3.2. Repair Responsibilities. If the BCE is to make the most effective use of all resources during
   the follow-on damage repair period, a complete understanding of agreements between other DOD
   engineering forces and Air Force units regarding the degree of support which will be provided on
   these occasions is important.
   9.3.3. The O&M Concept. The concept of O&M is a process for accomplishing work. It is a familiar
   theme for Air Force civil engineer units in that their peacetime responsibilities are centered around the
   procedures and requirements associated with O&M taskings. Many similarities exist in the O&M con-
   cepts for both peacetime and wartime or contingency disaster recovery situations; however, several
   differences are also present. We will look at these differences as the steps for accomplishing O&M
   work are discussed.
      9.3.3.1. Concept Steps. For the purpose of this discussion, the O&M concept will be addressed
      according to the six basic steps listed in Table 9.1.

Table 9.1. Operation and Maintenance Concept.
                                             O&M Concept
  Step 1    Identify the work that needs to be done.
            Estimate the work requirements. Each job must be quantified in terms of man-hours,
  Step 2
            materials, and equipment necessary.
  Step 3    Assign work priorities. These priorities will aid in developing a work strategy.
            Develop a work plan or strategy capable of sustaining the sortie rate necessary for combat
  Step 4
            operations.
  Step 5    Assemble resources. Action must be taken to acquire the resources estimated in Step 2.
  Step 6    Accomplish the work. The final and most important step is to complete the work identified.

      9.3.3.2. Work Identification (Step 1). Since the emphasis of this chapter is on O&M during the
      recovery phase, we will address a more deliberate disaster recovery process. According to Chap-
      ter 5, DARTs are dispatched during the initial recovery phase to identify and quantify damage.
      Due to the urgency of immediate repair response after a disaster, assessments were necessarily
      limited to those requirements which most impacted launch and recovery of combat mission air-
      craft. Some damages were repaired during this initial recovery period using expedient methods,
      others were isolated, and others were ignored. In the disaster recovery O&M period, it is time to
      identify all repair requirements, irrespective of scope and importance to the primary installation
      combat mission (Figure 9.2.). Expedient repairs must be replaced with permanent fixes, isolated
      utilities should be reinstated, and problem areas that were originally put aside must be corrected.
      Regardless of what repair actions were taken during the immediate aftermath of a disaster, all fol-
142                                                                    AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      low-on work must be identified in enough detail to convey the specific requirements of the job.
      For example, a general statement of work to repair the electrical service to a building is not
      enough information to allow a repair crew to effectively accomplish the job. Details such as
      replace 25 kVA transformer and replace the service drop to the facility must be provided. A
      detailed description of work will ease detailed estimating and possibly save valuable repair time.
      Personnel chosen to perform the work identification should also be capable of determining, at
      least in a preliminary sense, how the work will be accomplished; i.e., by in-house forces, by con-
      tract, by Army engineers, etc. This will aid in the performance of the next step, work estimating,
      in that different levels of detail are required for the different methods of accomplishment.

Figure 9.2. Identify All Work Requirements During O&M Period.




      9.3.3.3. Estimate Work (Step 2). Estimating work is quantifying work in terms of the man-
      power, materials, and special equipment required. For in-house work, rough man-hour estimates
      are provided for each craft required on a particular repair. Materials are specified by description,
      quantity, and if in stock, by the stock location. Special equipment should be addressed, particularly
      if its requirement is not made obvious by reading the work description. This is most helpful when
      equipment must be rented or acquired from another agency. For non-in-house work, initial esti-
      mating must be of sufficient scope to allow contract programmers to produce costing and pro-
      gramming documents. Major commands must also be informed of the fiscal requirements and
      work scopes so contract monies and interservice support can be obtained.
      9.3.3.4. Assign Work Priority (Step 3). At this stage of the disaster recovery effort, the assign-
      ment of work priorities is crucial to generating and maintaining a sortie rate adequate to sustain the
      combat mission. Similarly, prudent appropriation of available manpower and resources is the key
      to the expeditious recovery of the installation and the resumption of the full flying mission. All
      work will fall into one of the categories used for peacetime O&M purposes. As compared to
      peacetime operations, however, more priority ones and twos will probably be identified since
      facility, utility, and airfield pavement damages will cause many mission hindrances, safety haz-
      ards, and perhaps even health hazards. Expect to see work that is normally a low priority in peace-
      time become a higher priority in the disaster recovery period. Drainage work is a prime example.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              143


      In peacetime such activity is usually a routine maintenance function but in the disaster recovery
      environment, if flight line area flooding is caused by drainage system blockage, repairs will rap-
      idly become critical. Also be sure to maintain a combat mission mindset when assigning work pri-
      orities. What are considered safety deficiencies in peacetime may well be acceptable risks in the
      disaster recovery period. Furthermore, be wary of assigning too high a priority to quality of life
      features at the expense of direct mission support requirements. The pressure will be on to do this,
      and therefore it is imperative to maintain a balanced perspective. The work priorities listed in
      Table 9.2. will be used in the disaster recovery timeframe:

Table 9.2. Disaster Recovery Work Priorities.
                                            Work Priorities
          Priority I     Work done in direct support of the mission.
          Priority II    Work done to provide adequate security or to eliminate hazards.
          Priority III   Work done to prevent a breakdown of essential operations and
                         services.
          Priority IV    Work not qualifying for a higher priority.

      9.3.3.5. Develop a Work Plan (Step 4). Now that the first three steps in the preparation phase
      are completed, the transition from preparation to execution can begin. So far the requirements
      have been identified, labor and materials estimated, and a rough priority listing established. Now
      the task calls for arranging the work by order of importance and making the final determination of
      how it is to be accomplished (in-house or otherwise). Several factors influence the development of
      a disaster recovery work plan, and many of them interact with each other. Only after each of these
      factors has been considered can a work plan be deemed complete.
          9.3.3.5.1. Scope of Work. The scope of the identified work requirements must be closely
          considered to preclude overloading various trades. Such action causes a bottleneck in task
          accomplishment and subsequent slippages in work completions. Look closely at contract sup-
          port for tasks that are large in scope, require unique skills or expertise not normally available
          in a typical military engineer unit, or require many man-hours of a particular trade as com-
          pared to others.
          9.3.3.5.2. Material Availability. To a large extent, the availability of materials will determine
          which of the highest priority tasks will be performed first. Maximize use of whatever special
          levels and war reserve materials are remaining; contingency and wartime situations are what
          they are there for (Figure 9.3.). Materials being held for peacetime O&M requirements are
          also another source of supply support. Cannibalization from lower priority damaged facilities
          or utilities should likewise be considered, particularly for items which traditionally have long
          lead times. Put higher priority systems back into full service this way and let lower priority
          systems wait for the supply system to provide the necessary materials. Do not overlook the
          value of local purchase for repair materials. In many cases, much of an engineer unit’s peace-
          time supply overseas comes from local sources. Any standing contracts or purchase orders
          from local vendors should be increased to obtain as much material as possible.
144                                                                    AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 9.3. Withdraw WRM and O&M Assets From Storage When Needed.




         9.3.3.5.3. Manpower Availability. The majority of disaster recovery O&M actions will be
         accomplished by in-house forces simply due to their immediate availability. If engineer units
         from other services are in place, however, they should be incorporated into the disaster recov-
         ery O&M work strategy as well. Use these units wisely. Assign major restoration tasks associ-
         ated with critical facility and utility requirements to these units. Do not waste their talents on
         low- priority jobs or tasks that do not utilize their full engineer capability. At some locations,
         the local economy may be able to furnish contractor support for O&M requirements. Work
         with installation contracting personnel to line this support up for tasks that do not require a
         detailed design effort. Another avenue of manpower support that should be investigated is that
         of local civilian overhires. Historically, much of the civil engineer’s wartime and contingency
         labor support has come from this source. Not only will in-house skilled personnel be freed up
         for more technical tasks, but the potential also exists for adding additional semi-skilled person-
         nel to the O&M workforce. Lastly, remember that some of your work force will be required to
         provide day-to-day operations support and will not be fully available for repair taskings.
         Account for this in your planning but do not over-man this area—go with a minimum manning
         concept.
         9.3.3.5.4. Timing Constraints. Disaster recovery O&M efforts will be greatly affected by
         timing constraints which, in turn, steer the development of the overall work schedule. Mission
         support is the driver for work scheduling, and all activities should be aimed at satisfying these
         taskings first. Use the multiple skills of in-house forces to advantage; e.g., do not let a critical
         POL repair project slip due to shortages in the liquid fuels maintenance trade—use utility sys-
         tems personnel to augment. Additionally, do not be hesitant to mix in-house forces with con-
         tractors or other engineer units. Work your manpower assets together toward a common goal
         of bringing the most critical portions of the installation back up to standard.
         9.3.3.5.5. Funds Availability. Keep your MAJCOM informed of your funding requirements
         for supply, civilian pay, and contract support. To some extent, each installation can keep the
         supply lines flowing by reallocation of local O&M funds, but few installations will have the
         ability to fund any sizable contract support or civilian pay increases. As disaster recovery
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  145


           O&M efforts progress, the need for additional funding will increase since requirements will
           become more defined.
       9.3.3.6. Assemble Resources (Step 5). Gathering of work materials and equipment and assign-
       ing manpower to the various tasks are the first steps in the execution phase of the disaster recovery
       O&M effort. Follow your work plan priorities as closely as possible and exploit the various ave-
       nues of supply and manpower support mentioned earlier to build your O&M capability.
       9.3.3.7. Accomplish Work (Step 6). Accomplishing the work is the final and most important
       step in the execution phase and the O&M concept. This final step brings civil engineers closer to
       fully recovering the installation and sustaining the flying mission. As more and more repairs are
       made to installation facilities and utilities, be prepared to transition an increased portion of your
       work force to an operations mode.

9.4. Airfield Ancillary Equipment O&M. Operations and maintenance of ancillary airfield equipment
are critical to the operation of the airfield. Items such as aircraft arresting systems, airfield lighting, and
navigational aids, which were expediently repaired immediately following the emergency, must now be
maintained to support continuing aircraft operations. Any upgrade repairs that can be made to these sys-
tems without degrading the operational capability of the installation should be attempted at this time.
   9.4.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
       9.4.1.1. In a wartime situation where only a minimum operating strip has been made available for
       aircraft launch and recovery, a mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS) has most likely been
       installed (Figure 9.4.). Routine servicing and inspection of the system must be maintained
       throughout its period of use. In all likelihood, however, once the threat of re-attack is over, efforts
       will intensify to bring the full runway surface back into operation. This, in turn, will permit perma-
       nently installed arresting systems to be reinstated into service. Once such permanent barriers are
       put into use, servicing and inspection efforts should be devoted to these systems. The mobile sys-
       tem then should be removed, reconditioned as necessary, and placed back into standby storage.
146                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 9.4. Installing a MAAS System at Tallil Air Base, Iraq.




         9.4.1.2. In the event that airfield damages were such that the permanently installed systems could
         still be used during the disaster recovery period, particular attention must be paid to any expedient
         repairs that were made on the systems. All repairs made by substitution must be identified. A list-
         ing of the materials required to restore the system to full operational capability and alleviate the
         parts substitution condition should be developed. These materials should be immediately ordered
         and installed once they are received. Additionally, any stockpiled replacement parts which were
         expended during repair efforts should also be replenished. Repairs beyond component replace-
         ment are usually beyond the capability of the in-house work force and should be identified to the
         parent major command so that appropriate repair support can be arranged.
      9.4.2. Airfield Lighting System.
         9.4.2.1. If a minimum operating strip was established, an emergency airfield lighting system
         (EALS) was probably installed to support night and adverse weather flying requirements (Figure
         9.5.). A daily inspection of such a system is mandatory. As repairs to runway pavement surfaces
         are being made, concurrent repairs to the permanently installed airfield lighting system should be
         accomplished with the intent of having the system completely operational when the full runway is
         brought back into service.
         9.4.2.2. If damage conditions permitted the permanently installed airfield lighting system to be
         used in lieu of a mobile system, it is still likely that some expedient repairs had to be made imme-
         diately after the attack or disaster ended. The objective now during the O&M phase of recovery
         operations is to upgrade these repairs to meet normal standards as quickly as possible and perform
         the maintenance necessary to keep the system fully operational.
             9.4.2.2.1. If the power supply to the airfield lighting vault has been interrupted, restoration of
             this primary power must receive emphasis. Repair crews will have two major taskings:
                9.4.2.2.1.1. Operate and maintain the backup generator. Increased running time requires
                more frequent inspection and maintenance.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             147


              9.4.2.2.1.2. Pursue actions necessary to restore primary power to the airfield lighting
              vault. This could mean running new underground cabling to the vault or permanently
              repairing previously made expedient connections.

Figure 9.5. Installing EALS at Airfield in Kandahar, Afghanistan.




          9.4.2.2.2. If the problem is with the underground system supplying each lighting circuit, it can
          be corrected by merely replacing damaged sections of underground direct burial cable (Figure
          9.6.) or by repairs of a duct system. Replacement of direct burial cables is a simple task that
          can be accomplished by in-house forces if materials are available. Before a decision is made to
          make a repair in-house, first consider the impact the work will have on available resources and
          how it affects your capability to do other work.
          9.4.2.2.3. As a minimum, in-house forces should make daily inspections of the lighting sys-
          tems. Check for inoperative lights, damaged splices, and damaged surface run cables. Daily
          tasks include replacing burned out lights and damaged fixtures and repairing or replacing dam-
          aged splices.
   9.4.3. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS). The type and number of navigational aids and the support
   given these aids by civil engineers will vary. You may be required to repair the metal frame for the
   wind sock or perform daily operational checks of the generator providing power to the Tactical Air
   Navigation (TACAN) facility. Any facility or utility damage that directly impacts the operation of a
   critical NAVAID must be repaired immediately. Likewise, the identification and completion of repairs
   required to restore the facility or supporting utility system carry a high priority.
148                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 9.6. Replacing Damaged Sections of Airfield Power Cable.




9.5. Utility Repairs. The early expedient repair of utility systems is critical to preserve life, eliminate
hazards, and support the operational mission. It pays dividends to upgrade the expedient repair to a more
permanent repair as soon as possible. Expedient repairs are temporary at best; the longer they are left
without upgrade, the greater the chances for repeated breakdown and failure. Increased incidence of fail-
ure drains resources and degrades the mission capability of the installation. The BCE must identify, quan-
tify, and set the priority for all repair requirements. A course of action must be selected; that is, will the
work be done in-house, by contract, or by some type of work force augmentation.
      9.5.1. Electrical System. All damage as well as all expedient repairs should have been documented
      during initial recovery phases. Use this information as a departure point to determine required actions.
      Still another, perhaps more comprehensive damage survey should be made to identify the total scope
      of needed repairs. Discussing repair requirements with electrical and power production personnel will
      further clarify and quantify the repair effort. During the survey and especially during follow-on repair
      efforts, remember, the dangers associated with working on the electrical system make it imperative
      that the techniques and procedures outlined in AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, be applied at
      all times.
         9.5.1.1. Power Generation Plants. If moderate to heavy damage to power production plants has
         been sustained, it is likely that expedient repairs will not have been possible. Major restoration
         efforts will be necessary, and contract action is probably the only answer. If damages were only
         slight, however, repairs to electrical production systems will have initially included maximum
         cannibalization and the use of spare parts to get all possible units back on line and in full produc-
         tion. In some cases, wrecking and shoring actions may have been taken to make the facility hous-
         ing the power production units structurally safe. Automatic control and monitoring systems that
         could not be repaired may have been bypassed and replaced with whatever was available for a
         “makeshift” manual operation. Now is the time to determine to what extent upgrade repairs can be
         made and what maintenance operations are required.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             149


          9.5.1.1.1. Where makeshift manual controls are in use, ensure that all equipment is operating
          within the correct tolerances and that the appropriate output is being achieved. Otherwise, fur-
          ther damage to production equipment can occur or, in the case of incorrect output, the result
          can be damaged distribution equipment or worse. Ensure that replacement control panels are
          requisitioned.
          9.5.1.1.2. Check and monitor fuel lines supplying the generators for serious leakage. Arrange
          for permanent repairs to be made thereby eliminating any potential fire or safety hazards.
          9.5.1.1.3. Make any facility repairs that are needed to permanently weatherproof the power
          units and switchgear.
      9.5.1.2. Individual and Mobile Power Units. In most situations, individual or mobile genera-
      tors were expediently repaired either through cannibalization/spare part use or by total replace-
      ment if damaged beyond immediate repair. Repair upgrade actions should be relatively minimal
      with the exception, perhaps, of repair of splinter protection features. Of more importance is the
      O&M of these units, and a dedicated effort will be necessary (Figure 9.7.). These generators must
      be checked at least daily and refueled as required. Fuel consumption data and the size of the tank
      should give an indication of how often a unit must be refueled. A refueling and services inspection
      schedule should be developed and strictly followed.

Figure 9.7. Maintenance of Mobile Power Units Is Vital to Disaster Recovery.




      9.5.1.3. Distribution System. Depending upon the nature of the disaster, repairs to the distribu-
      tion systems may vary from simple to very complex. If manpower and needed materials are avail-
      able, most installations have the technical capability to make permanent repairs to the overhead
      distribution system. Some repairs, such as straightening leaning poles and adjusting line sag, will
      require no materials at all. However, the electrical distribution system at most installations is at
      least partially underground, and survey of such a system is a more difficult task. The underground
      system supports critical operations and is usually located in operational flying areas around the
      flight line. All manholes should be checked for structural damage as well as damage to the distri-
      bution system. Extreme caution must be exercised when entering or working on underground sys-
150                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


         tems. Manholes can become settling points for combustible and/or extremely noxious gases. Most
         installations have the capability to check for potential line insulation breakdown. This should be
         done so that lines can be replaced before a failure occurs that could be detrimental to the installa-
         tion mission.
             9.5.1.3.1. If damage to the distribution system is heavy, it is likely that the distribution system
             off the installation has also sustained damage. In this situation, the local power company can-
             not be relied upon for assistance. This is the point where disaster planning efforts start to pay
             dividends. If there are electrical contractors in the local area that are capable of delivering the
             assistance needed, they were identified in local contingency response plans. The value of
             negotiating a requirements (on-call) contract during the contingency planning phase becomes
             evident now in the form of a critical time savings.
             9.5.1.3.2. Typical electrical distribution system upgrades and repair actions to be taken during
             the operation and maintenance phase of installation recovery include the activities in Table
             9.3.

Table 9.3. Typical Electrical Distribution Upgrade and Repairs.
                                          Upgrade/Repair Actions
Replacement of temporary ground-level distribution lines with permanent lines either above ground
level or below ground as appropriate
Installation of new service drops to repaired facilities
Replacement of damaged power poles
Repair of structural damage to vaults, switching stations, and security fencing
Repair of damaged transformer banks

      9.5.2. Water System. The water system is extremely important. It is needed not only for consump-
      tion, but also for firefighting, food preparation and hygiene, decontamination, and a great many other
      uses. System components are normally categorized as source, treatment, storage, and distribution.
         9.5.2.1. Source. If the source has remained intact or has been repaired, determine whether it is
         still adequate to meet current needs. This determination will be based upon quantity and usability.
         The quantity can be calculated based on number of personnel, firefighting requirements, and any
         other special considerations resulting from the contingency and recovery effort. Usability means
         potability. For firefighting and many other uses, this is not so critical. The source should be treated
         periodically to ensure that it is free of contaminants. If the source is not adequate and supplemen-
         tary wells have been developed, they must be inspected daily to ensure a sufficient water level for
         the installation can be maintained. Pumps also must be checked and serviced to ensure proper run-
         ning conditions.
         9.5.2.2. Treatment.
             9.5.2.2.1. If water treatment facilities were only lightly damaged by the attack or disaster and
             expedient repairs subsequently made, initial efforts should be concentrated on bringing the
             plants back up to the standards they were at before the disaster. Typical O&M phase taskings
             would include:
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               151


            9.5.2.2.1.1. Replacement of automatic controls and monitoring systems that was initially
            damaged and bypassed.
            9.5.2.2.1.2. Repair of structural components to ensure weather protection and security.
            9.5.2.2.1.3. Repair of any piping that was bypassed in an attempt to keep at least a portion
            of a plant operating.
            9.5.2.2.1.4. Replacement of any auxiliary or backup pumps and motors that were dam-
            aged.
        9.5.2.2.2. If, on the other hand, treatment facilities were heavily damaged, chances are repairs
        will be of the magnitude that a contract or construction battalion effort would be required.
        Water treatment in such a situation would have to be provided through the use of several
        mobile water purification units. Such units require considerably more operating attention than
        a normal water treatment plant; therefore, an engineer squadron having to contend with this
        type of operation will have to expect an additional demand on available manpower.
     9.5.2.3. Storage. Loss of storage capacity will place an additional demand on production of
     water. This would be a particularly severe problem if the installation developed a critical shortage
     in firefighting requirements. If an installation has lost a sizable portion of its water storage capac-
     ity, one of the initial tasks once aircraft launch and recovery have been established must be to
     locate and develop an alternate source of non-potable water for firefighting resupply.
        9.5.2.3.1. Heavily damaged water storage tanks, reservoirs, etc., will most likely be beyond
        repair or at least beyond the in-house repair capability of the typical base civil engineer unit.
        Restoration of such facilities will have to be a contract effort. As an interim measure, consider
        the use of flexible storage bladders positioned at critical locations around the installation. Tank
        trucks are another alternative.
        9.5.2.3.2. Minor damage to water storage structures can usually be repaired by draining the
        tanks and patching any punctures that have been sustained and replacing the necessary compo-
        nents of any measuring gauges that may have been damaged. Ground-level and above
        ground-level tanks should be checked daily to verify structural soundness. Damaging effects
        from blast pressures and ground shock may not show up immediately.
     9.5.2.4. Distribution System. In all probability, the bulk of civil engineer water system repair
     taskings after an attack or disaster will be associated with the distribution system. This is due to
     the widespread nature of the piping network and its subsequent vulnerability to collateral damage.
     During the O&M phase of the installation recovery effort, the amount of damage received on the
     distribution system will dictate the repair methodology. If heavy damages were incurred, contract
     and/or construction battalion support will definitely be required. In fact, even if damages initially
     appear light, some outside support will probably be necessary since water distribution systems are
     extremely fragile and problems tend to continually surface long after the threat of attack or natural
     disaster has passed. On the other hand, the importance of the water distribution system for main-
     taining and sustaining overall installation operations will mean that some in-house repair efforts
     will always be needed. Typical repair tasks that can be expected for in-house accomplishment
     include the activities listed in Table 9.4.
152                                                                      AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008

         9.5.2.5. Safety and Hygiene. As permanent repairs and upgrades are being accomplished, engi-
         neer personnel must be conscious of standard safety and health practices. Ground conditions are
         less stable after an attack or natural disaster due to such physical effects as shock propagation and
         soil saturation. It is likely that shoring for deeper excavations will be necessary and many more
         barricades and similar marking devices will be required due to the greater than average numbers
         of line breaks incurred. Special attention must be paid to water quality. Many underground distri-
         bution system problems will initially remain hidden, and the potential for external contamination
         of water supplies through these undiscovered line breaks is great. For this reason, the importance
         of disinfecting water systems before returning them to service cannot be overemphasized. Further-
         more, once the distribution system is generally operational, water quality checks should be taken
         at various points on the installation on a scheduled basis to ensure purity standards are maintained.
      9.5.3. Sewage System. It will be during the O&M phase of the installation recovery operation that
      the majority of repairs to the sewage treatment and distribution system will be accomplished. As with
      the other utility systems, surveys should be made to identify what expedient repairs were made fol-
      lowing the disaster and what permanent upgrade and replacement actions should be undertaken.
      While repairs to the sewage system are ongoing, care must be taken to ensure that expedient repairs or
      other workarounds are kept serviceable. Pumps and flexible lines being used as lift station or blocked
      main bypasses must be frequently checked and serviced as needed. If porta-potties, chemical toilets,
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               153


  or other self-contained sanitary facilities are used, provisions must be made to collect, transport, and
  properly dispose of the human wastes.
     9.5.3.1. Treatment Plants. Sewage treatment plants do not lend themselves very well to expedi-
     ent repair. Such repairs would be generally limited to minor piping repairs, control system bypass-
     ing, and patching of berms around ponds and lagoons. If a treatment plant was damaged
     sufficiently enough to take it completely out of service, it is probable that a contract effort would
     be required for restoration purposes. Although a vulnerable facility, it is unlikely such a facility
     would be a primary target, and its normally remote location decreases its chances of receiving col-
     lateral damage.
     9.5.3.2. Distribution Systems. O&M efforts with regard to distribution systems usually involve
     repairs to distribution mains and valves, manholes, and lift stations.
         9.5.3.2.1. Repairs to sewer mains are needed when they are fractured, collapsed, or blocked.
         Stoppages are normally obvious and may be corrected by routine maintenance procedures.
         Hidden fractures can go unnoticed for some time. Fractures or stoppages caused by collapsed
         mains will require excavation so the damaged main section can be replaced. Valve repairs are
         normally accomplished by replacing the entire valve assembly.
         9.5.3.2.2. Besides pipe collapse, stoppages to sewer lines can also be caused by structural
         damage to manholes. Repair of manhole damage can vary from merely clearing debris from
         the hole to replacing the entire structure. Replacing the manhole may be beyond the capability
         of in-house forces; therefore, be prepared to ask for contract or construction battalion support.
         On the other hand, clearing debris is relatively easy, requiring a minimal demand on resources.
         Once debris has been cleared, remember to mark off or barricade the manhole area as a safety
         precaution.
         9.5.3.2.3. If a lift station has received sufficient damage so as to put it out of service, a porta-
         ble pump and flexible bypass hoses are normally used as an expedient repair measure. Because
         of the importance of lift stations in moving sewage away from inhabited areas, a permanent fix
         by in-house forces is usually called for. Such a fix would entail total replacement of pumps,
         repair of associated piping, and repair of any structural damage to the lift station facility.
  9.5.4. Heating Systems. The need to upgrade heating system repairs depends largely on prevailing
  weather conditions. A large central heating system, like the electrical system, can sustain a range of
  damage varying from simple to complex.
     9.5.4.1. Major Plants.
         9.5.4.1.1. Expedient repairs to a heat production plant will initially include repairs to support-
         ing utilities such as electrical and water service. During expedient repair operations, damaged
         automatic controls may have been bypassed with manual controls. Parts may have been canni-
         balized to get as many boilers operating as possible, and some wrecking and shoring may have
         been done. These repairs may be well documented, but the plant will probably have to be sur-
         veyed again to determine the total scope of what is needed to attain a fully operational status.
         Discussion with plant operators will help clarify repair needs.
         9.5.4.1.2. Where automatic controls and monitoring systems have been bypassed and manual
         controls substituted, care must be taken to ensure that all equipment is operating within safe
         ranges. If this is not done, damage to the heat-generating equipment is likely to occur and per-
154                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


             sonnel could be severely injured. Any feasible permanent repairs of these components should
             be accomplished.
             9.5.4.1.3. Expedient repairs to the distribution system will probably have been limited due to
             the operating limits required for distribution. Now is the time to attempt repairs that will return
             the distribution system to its original configuration. Fractures are relatively easy to locate by
             the obvious venting of steam. Steam pits should be surveyed for structural damage as well as
             for mechanical damage to piping and valves. Local construction contractors may be an excel-
             lent source for not only renting excavation equipment but also providing additional skilled
             labor for repairing underground distribution system breaks.
         9.5.4.2. Individual Facility Systems. Many installation facilities will have individual heating
         systems or package units installed. Like major plants, initial repairs to these smaller systems will
         usually involve restoration of supporting utilities (electrical and water). Other repairs would
         include replacement of damaged major components obtained either through special level support
         or cannibalization of similar units. In the case of damage to individual heating systems serving
         high-priority facilities, the quickest expedient fix would have been to install a mobile heating sys-
         tem attached to the building using flexible ductwork. From an O&M viewpoint, personnel will
         have to be assigned the task of periodically checking, servicing, and refueling these units. From a
         practical perspective, it is unlikely that a building will suffer major damage to the individual heat-
         ing system without also suffering serious damage to other utilities and the structural components
         of the facility. In this case, repairs most likely will have to be accomplished as part of a facility
         repair or restoration project.
      9.5.5. Gas System. Hidden gas leaks may occur underground and flow undetected until a thorough
      survey of the system is conducted.
         9.5.5.1. Expedient repairs have a tendency to require additional repairs. Where service was
         rerouted to provide gas to a critical facility, that service should be checked periodically for damage
         or leaks until permanent repairs can be made. If portable sources (bottled) are used, they must be
         refilled periodically.
         9.5.5.2. Repairs should never be attempted until the gas supply has been turned off. Be sure to
         allow gas to dissipate to safe levels before attempting excavation or repairs. Upgrading of repairs
         varies from the simple task of installing a clamp on a low-pressure line to replacing medium-pres-
         sure valves and pipe sections. Regardless of how complex or simple the job, safety is paramount.
         Good planning and a thorough survey of the gas system are needed to identify and quantify repairs
         that must be made.
      9.5.6. POL Systems. POL storage and distribution systems could be prime targets for potential
      attackers. The systems can also be severely damaged by natural disasters such as earthquakes or col-
      lateral effects occurring from attacks on other facilities. Any damage to the POL system will be com-
      pounded by the volatile nature of the system contents. The combustion of fuels leaking from a fracture
      in a pipe, valve, or tank can cause irreparable damage and devastation to the surrounding area. POL
      systems are critical to the recovery and continued operation of the installation because the POL
      resources are necessary for the operation of aircraft and ground support vehicles.
         9.5.6.1. Many POL systems are constructed with a certain amount of redundancy. If part of the
         POL system is left undamaged, isolation and valving may result in a partially operational system
         that can be used to support the flying mission. Additionally, the rapid utility repair kit (RURK) for
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                155


       POL systems (availability limited to Pacific theater installations) provides a means of quickly
       repairing valve and line failures resulting from an attack or disaster. Whether isolation or expedi-
       ent repair methods have been used, it is critical that frequent checks of the system be made to
       ensure continued system operability. This includes inspections of isolation points, temporary
       repairs, and the remaining serviceable portions of the system.
       9.5.6.2. A physical survey is required to identify all work required for permanent repairs. Due to
       the exacting nature and critical skills needed for POL system permanent repair, plan in advance to
       acquire at least partial contract support. Any major amount of damage to the POL system will
       quickly outstrip the capabilities of in-house forces.

9.6. Facilities and Services. Upgrading of expedient repairs to critical facilities and expanding the level
of required services are main features of the BCE’s O&M effort after an attack or natural disaster. Because
of the potentially large scope of these efforts, count on using contract and construction battalion support
for at least a portion of this requirement.
   9.6.1. Facilities. Recovery actions on facilities are done according to the priority of the facility.
   Efforts are directed towards upgrading expedient repairs and demolishing buildings presenting a dan-
   ger to personnel.
       9.6.1.1. The BCE’s efforts regarding facility repair must begin with a thorough inspection of facil-
       ities so that the scope and depth of needed repairs can be determined. Use the CE Contingency
       Response Plan and Facility Priority List as guides to the inspection order and check those other
       facilities that are known to have sustained damage. Minor permanent repair actions should be
       identified for in-house accomplishment. Facility restoration beyond in-house capabilities must
       also be identified and forwarded to the major command for allocation to contract or troop con-
       struction efforts.
       9.6.1.2. Typical tasks that in-house forces should be prepared to accomplish during the disaster
       recovery O&M phase include the items listed in Table 9.5.

Table 9.5. Typical In-House Disaster Recovery O&M Tasks.

      9.6.2. Garbage and Refuse Disposal. Regardless of disaster recovery conditions, garbage and
      refuse will continue to accumulate, and methods for handling these items must be devised. Unfortu-
      nately, damage to collection equipment or incinerating equipment may temporarily impair or halt col-
      lection and disposal efforts. Garbage and refuse are usually disposed of by sanitary fills, incineration,
      sale, or contract. In most cases a contract service is used. It is likely that such service will be inter-
      rupted after a disaster has occurred, particularly an installation attack. During this period, in-house
      forces will have to perform the task. Once contract support has been reestablished, a joint effort may
      still be necessary. Although additional costs may be incurred, contractors should be instructed to use
      all available transportation for collection and disposal and to assist in removal of installation-wide
      debris. If off-base disposal sites are out of service or inaccessible, on-base locations must be identi-
      fied. At these sites, garbage, refuse and debris can either be buried, burned, or a combination of both.
      In areas of higher population density, such as base housing, occupants can burn or bury their own
      refuse until adequate disposal facilities are made available. Common burial pits can be established for
      this purpose. Plan on closely monitoring this type of “self-help” operation—uncontrolled refuse dis-
      posal can lead to serious fire and sanitation hazards. If on-base locations are created for garbage and
      refuse disposal, ensure that a stringent pest control program is instituted to alleviate the danger of dis-
      ease spread.
      9.6.3. Snow Removal and Ice Control. Removing snow and ice from airfield pavements is as
      important as repairing damaged airfield pavements. In the disaster recovery environment, however,
      more care must be taken in some areas. For example, standard snow removal techniques may not work
      on repaired runway areas. It is likely that plow blades will catch the edges of anchored fiberglass mats
      and perhaps other temporary repairs, thereby damaging the repair and probably the plow as well. A lot
      of hand work and a carefully operated front-end loader may be necessary to clear crater repair areas.
      Additionally, snow removal equipment operators will have to be observant of the mobile arresting
      system location since it will likely be positioned differently than the permanently installed barriers. If
      the runway has not been totally opened and a minimum operating strip is still in use, the situation is
      even more complicated. Equipment operators will also have to avoid the temporary airfield lighting
      and edge markers around the operating strip.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                157


       9.6.3.1. At the onset of heavy snow conditions and the ceasing of flying operations, it may be
       advisable to further mark the boundaries of the operating strip with flags or cones so that its out-
       line is discernible once snow removal operations begin. If this is not feasible due to weather con-
       ditions, it may be necessary to identify the edges of the operating strip immediately prior to rolling
       the snow removal equipment to the airfield. It would also be advisable to mark the boundaries of
       any repaired areas since even a little snowfall will mask their locations.
       9.6.3.2. At most locations, snow and ice removal will occur simultaneously on the airfield and
       installation thoroughfares. The following is a general list of the more important areas requiring
       snow and ice removal in an attack recovery environment:
           9.6.3.2.1. Runway, primary taxiways, and alert parking areas.
           9.6.3.2.2. Aircraft parking areas and shelter entrances.
           9.6.3.2.3. Access route to aircraft maintenance hangars.
           9.6.3.2.4. Access roads to munitions storage areas.
           9.6.3.2.5. Fire routes to mission-critical facilities.
           9.6.3.2.6. Access routes to POL dispensing points.
           9.6.3.2.7. Primary installation thoroughfares.

9.7. Alternate Transportation Routes. Refueling and rearming of aircraft, evacuation of personnel, and
other emergency responses require usable travel routes. The BCE is responsible for maintenance and
repair of all traffic routes, including making alternate routes available. Alternate routes are needed when
the primary route has been interdicted or travel on the primary route would be hazardous (e.g., downwind
of a toxic substance source).
   9.7.1. Alternate Route Development. Air Force installations are normally constructed with an ade-
   quate network of roads affording ample opportunity for development of alternate routes. If all possible
   access routes have been damaged, the first option is to go around the damage by removing surface
   obstacles such as curbing, directing traffic onto the unpaved area around the damaged portion of the
   street, and then back onto the street once the damage has been cleared. If possible, try to tie parking
   lots into the diversion route since this will provide at least a partially paved surface. Also be aware of
   overhead clearances. Building overhangs, electric and telephone lines, and tree limbs can quickly
   hinder traffic flow. Check that utilities, especially water, gas, and sewer, are not running close to the
   surface in the diversion route area. If they are, choose another location for the route or ensure that a
   hard surface such as AM-2 matting is placed over the lines to better distribute vehicle weights. When
   supplies are readily available, cover the diversion route with crushed rock or similar material to pro-
   duce a better, weather- resistant travel surface (Figure 9.10.).
158                                                                        AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 9.10. Using Crushed Rock to Improve Travel Surface.




      9.7.2. Transportation Route Repair. If going around the damage is not possible, the only other
      option is to repair the damage. This can be done expediently in a manner similar to airfield damage
      repair. Expedient road repair consists of removing debris, backfilling the crater and compacting the
      fill. Difficult repairs, like shoring up a bridge superstructure or applying a surface coarse, should be
      avoided. Rely on contractors or other troop construction units to accomplish this type of work. Perma-
      nent road repairs should not be attempted until the crisis is past and permanent recovery actions are
      well under way.

9.8. Resupply and Stockpiling. By now much, if not all, of your stockpiled materials have been used up,
damaged, or destroyed. To upgrade repairs and continue operation, steps must be taken for resupply and
possible stockpiling of essential materials.
      9.8.1. Any preplanning efforts that have been taken pay off now since it is not necessary to “build
      from scratch” a listing of needed materials. Many have already been identified during the preplanning
      process. This compilation, coupled with bench stock lists, shop stocks, special levels, WRM, and
      material identified as a result of damage assessment surveys, will produce a pretty large shopping list.
      9.8.2. Once a materials requirements’ listing is assembled, the acquisition process begins, normally
      through base supply and the installation contracting office. Contingency and wartime resupply usually
      comes from two sources—the CONUS and the local economy. The CONUS effort oftentimes is initi-
      ated via a “push” system where materials are shipped prior to actual ordering by units in the field. The
      items shipped are common materials that traditionally have been needed for engineer support during
      wartime. In this way, the materials identification and ordering time delay is eliminated at least for the
      initial resupply action. Follow-on stocks based on requisitions from the field flow later. For planning
      purposes assume, a 60-day transit time for both initial resupply and the follow-on stocks. This essen-
      tially means you will have to rely on whatever you have on hand and the local economy to support
      your efforts for at least the 60-day period following the start of hostilities.
      9.8.3. Exploit the local economy as much as possible as a source of supply. One of your initial tasks
      upon arrival at your beddown location should be to identify local contractors and material vendors.
      Visit their locations and see what is available both in terms of scope of items carried and quantities
      normally in stock. Provide this source information to base supply and contracting when you place
      orders. If worst comes to worst, also arrange for transportation of materials if this is posing a problem.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             159


  9.8.4. As materials are received, every effort must be made to control and track use of the materials.
  This will be particularly difficult in the chaotic recovery environment. As materials are used and
  stocks dwindle, material control must take action to replenish stocks on a regular basis. The goal
  should be to develop a supply flow that meets recovery needs and avoids excessive delays while at the
  same time does not flood the installation with more materials than will ever be required. Particular
  care must be taken to order only what is needed and not grossly inflate requirements. On the other
  hand, ensure that emergency stocks such as special levels that have been depleted are also replenished.
  Even though such stocks may not be immediately needed, it is only prudent to rebuild on-hand mate-
  rial quantities to levels existing prior to the disaster. Do not forget to incorporate “lessons learned”
  into your stockage requirements. If additional critical items are necessary to support disaster recovery
  conditions, add them to your emergency stockage lists.
  9.8.5. Because the quantity of resupply material may be greater than available warehouse space, it
  could become necessary to stockpile material elsewhere. Remote stockpiling of resources (Figure
  9.11.) at or near a proposed job site can increase efficiency through reduction of waste and material
  handling time. Additionally, such stockpiling serves as a dispersal measure thereby affording some
  added protection from the effects of potential future attacks. Open and dispersed storage of materials
  has drawbacks, however, which must be countered. Adequate security for these resources is a primary
  consideration to prevent weather damage, pilfering, or vandalism. This will present the need to inspect
  and segregate materials as they arrive. Items that are weather sensitive must be stored under cover
  (Figure 9.12.). Materials that have high value such as copper wire should likewise be secured under
  cover. Items that are good “trading stock” such as plywood and lumber should be at least fenced in
  with concertina wire.

9.9. Summary. It is important to make a smooth transition from the expedient repair mode to a more sus-
tained mode of O&M accompanied by permanent repair upgrades. Although the conditions of the emer-
gency may have subsided somewhat, the installation is still in a recovery mode and emergency action is
still the method of operation. Carefully consider your options concerning specific repairs and the O&M
requirements for various installation utility systems and facilities. Develop a restoration plan that includes
total requirements, considers priorities, and assesses avenues available (work agencies) to effect repairs.
Do not forget to include essential services such as refuse disposal and snow and ice control and make pro-
visions for an effective resupply program. Maintenance and repair of transportation routes will play a key
role in enhancing other repair operations. Be aware that a clear differentiation is established between
Army and Air Force responsibilities in regard to the attack recovery and restoration effort. However, dif-
ferentiation on paper does not mean anything if those forces are not available when needed. Bottom line,
be flexible and ensure effective employment of those resources you control.

                      WORK PARTY DEFENSE AND CONVOY SECURITY

10.1. Introduction. Civil engineers routinely perform tasks that are important to successful installation
operations—these tasks become more vital after an attack or disaster. As an additional challenge, they
must also be capable of accomplishing these tasks in a hostile environment. Therefore, civil engineers
have to implement security and defensive measures that protect their work party or convoy from enemy
acts that could impair their effectiveness or affect the success of their operations.

10.2. Overview. This chapter will briefly examine CE work party defense and convoy security concepts
and operations (Figure 10.1.). Initially some basic combat skills and concepts associated with personal
security will be presented. This will be followed by information on securing the work site utilizing defen-
sive sectors, listening posts, fighting positions, and recognition codes. Communications, weapons
accountability, and small group movements will also be addressed. Lastly, some fundamental information
on convoy security will be provided.

10.3. Personal Security. Personal security involves an understanding of several basic concepts and pro-
cedures which work together, providing an individual with a better chance of survival in a hostile situation
while, at the same time, ensuring task accomplishment and air base survival.
   10.3.1. Cover, Concealment, and Camouflage. If the enemy can see you, they can hit you with fire.
   So you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from enemy fire. When the terrain
   does not provide natural cover and concealment, prepare your cover and use natural and man-made
   materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your position.
162                                                                 AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      10.3.1.1. Cover. Cover gives protection from bullets, fragments, and some NBC agents. Cover,
      which can be natural or man-made, can also conceal you from enemy observation. Natural cover
      includes things such as logs, trees, stumps, ravines, and hollows (Figure 10.2.). Man-made cover
      includes such things as fighting positions, trenches, walls, rubble, and craters (Figure 10.3.).
      When in a defensive posture, a fighting position is normally constructed using natural cover from
      the surrounding terrain. To get protection from enemy fire when moving, use routes that put cover
      between you and the places where the enemy is known or thought to be. Use ravines, gullies, hills,
      wooded areas, and walls to keep the enemy from seeing and firing at you. Avoid open areas, and
      do not skyline yourself on hilltops and ridges.

Figure 10.2. Natural Cover Provides Hasty Protection From the Enemy.




Figure 10.3. Man-Made Cover Used as Defensive Fighting Position.




      10.3.1.2. Concealment. Concealment is anything that hides you from enemy observation. It does
      not protect you from enemy fire, however. Like cover, concealment can be natural or man-made.
      Natural concealment includes items such as bushes, trees, grass, and shadows. Man-made con-
      cealment includes battle dress uniforms, camouflage nets, face paint, and natural material that
      have been moved from its original location. To be effective, man-made concealment must blend
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              163


     into the natural concealment offered by the terrain. Contributing to concealment are three other
     factors that should be considered—light discipline, noise discipline, and movement discipline.
        10.3.1.2.1. Light discipline is controlling the use of lights at night such as not smoking in the
        open, not walking around with a flashlight on, and not using vehicle headlights.
        10.3.1.2.2. Noise discipline is taking action to deflect sounds generated by your unit (such as
        operating equipment) away from the enemy and, when possible, using methods to communi-
        cate that do not generate sounds (arm and hand signals).
        10.3.1.2.3. Movement discipline includes such things as not moving about fighting positions
        unless necessary, and not moving on routes that lack cover and concealment. Movement draws
        attention. When you give arm and hand signals or walk about your position, your movement
        can be seen by the naked eye from long distances. When in a defensive posture, stay low and
        move only when necessary. If movement is a must, do so only on covered and concealed
        routes. A note of caution—darkness alone cannot hide you from enemy observation. Night
        vision devices will detect you in darkness.
     10.3.1.3. Camouflage. Camouflage is anything used to keep yourself, your equipment, and your
     position from looking like what they are. Both natural and man-made material can be used for
     camouflage. When natural material is used, over time it will often die, fade, or otherwise lose its
     effectiveness and should be changed frequently. Likewise, man-made material may wear off or
     fade. When this happens, you and your equipment or position may no longer blend with the sur-
     roundings—making it easy for the enemy to spot. Some camouflage considerations include the
     following:
        10.3.1.3.1. Shine. Shine may attract the enemy’s attention. In darkness, it may be a light such
        as a burning cigarette or flashlight. In daylight, it can be the reflection from a polished surface
        such as shiny mess gear, a worn helmet, a windshield, a watch crystal or even exposed skin. To
        reduce shine, cover your skin with clothing and face paint. Also dull the surfaces of equipment
        and vehicles with paint, mud, or camouflage material.
        10.3.1.3.2. Shape. Shape results from an object’s outline or form. The shape of a helmet and
        human body are easily distinguishable. Use camouflage and concealment to break up shapes
        and blend them with their surroundings—be careful not to overdo it.
        10.3.1.3.3. Colors. Colors can also be a “dead giveaway.” The colors of your skin, uniform,
        and equipment may help the enemy detect you if they contrast with the background. For exam-
        ple, a green uniform will contrast with snow-covered terrain. Camouflage yourself and your
        equipment to blend with the surroundings (Figure 10.4.).
        10.3.1.3.4. Dispersion. Dispersion is the spreading of personnel, vehicles, and equipment
        over a wide area. It is usually easier for the enemy to detect individuals when they are
        bunched—so, spread out. The distance between you and another person will vary with the ter-
        rain, degree of visibility, and enemy situation.

      10.3.2. Movement Techniques. In the event of a confrontation with an opposing force, individuals
      will normally be required to move to obtain cover. Use the following techniques and precautions for
      movement prior to and during an encounter with an enemy force:
         10.3.2.1. Camouflage yourself and your equipment.
         10.3.2.2. Wear soft, well-fitting clothes.
         10.3.2.3. Tape your dog tags together and to the chain so they cannot slide or rattle. Tape or pad
         the parts of your weapon and equipment that rattle or are so loose that they may snag (the tape or
         padding must not interfere with the operation of the weapon or equipment). When taping is com-
         pleted, test for noise by shaking.
         10.3.2.4. Do not carry unnecessary equipment. Move from cover position to cover position (tak-
         ing no longer than 3 to 5 seconds between positions).
         10.3.2.5. Stop, look, and listen before moving. Look for the next position before leaving a posi-
         tion.
         10.3.2.6. Look for covered and concealed routes on which to move.
         10.3.2.7. Change directions slightly from time to time when moving through tall grass.
         10.3.2.8. Cross roads and trails at places that have the most cover and concealment (large culverts,
         low spots, curves, or bridges).
         10.3.2.9. Avoid steep slopes and places with loose dirt or stones.
         10.3.2.10. Avoid cleared, open areas and tops of hills and ridges.
         10.3.2.11. If you alarm birds or animals, remain in position and observe briefly.
         10.3.2.12. Take advantage of distractions provided by noise.
      10.3.3. Methods of Movement. In addition to walking, you may move in one of four other meth-
      ods—low crawl, high crawl, rush, and spider crawl. Bear in mind, these movement methods are meant
      to be used to keep you out of enemy contact, allow you to reach a covered, concealed position, or
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                            165


   withdraw from an area safely. There is no intent to have engineer personnel move toward an enemy
   force for the purpose of offensive maneuvers or actions.
      10.3.3.1. Low Crawl. The low crawl (Figure 10.5.) provides the lowest silhouette. Use it to cross
      places where the concealment is very low and enemy fire or observation prevents you from rising
      from the prone position. Keep your body flat against the ground. With your firing hand, grasp your
      weapon sling at the upper sling swivel. Let the front hand-guard rest on your forearm (keeping the
      muzzle off of the ground), and let the weapon butt drag on the ground. To move, push your arms
      forward and pull your firing side leg forward. Then pull with your arms and push with your leg.
      Continue this action throughout the move.

Figure 10.5. Low Crawl Provides the Lowest Silhouette.




      10.3.3.2. High Crawl. The high crawl (Figure 10.6.) lets you move faster than the low crawl and
      still gives you a low silhouette. Use this crawl when there is good concealment but enemy fire pre-
      vents you from moving in an upright posture. Keep your body off of the ground and resting on
      your forearms and lower legs. Cradle your weapon in your arms and keep its muzzle off the
      ground. Keep your knees well behind your buttocks so your body will stay low. To move, alter-
      nately advance your right elbow and left knee, then your left elbow and right knee.

Figure 10.6. High Crawl Permits Faster Movement and Low Silhouette.




      10.3.3.3. Short Rush. The short rush is the fastest way to move from one position to another.
      Each rush should last from 3 to 5 seconds. Rushes are kept short to keep enemy machine gunners
      or riflemen from tracking you. However, do not stop and hit the ground in the open just because 5
      seconds have passed. Always try to hit the ground behind cover. Before moving, pick out your
166                                                                   AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      next cover and concealed position and the best route to it. Make your move from the prone posi-
      tion as explained in Table 10.1. and illustrated in Figure 10.7.

Table 10.1. Short Rush Procedures.
                                         Short Rush Movement
           Slowly raise your head and pick your next position and the route to it
           Slowly lower your head
           Draw your arms into your body (keeping your elbows in)
           Pull your right leg forward
           Raise your body by straightening your arms
           Get up quickly
           Run to the next position
           When you are ready to stop moving, plant both of your feet
           Drop to your knees (at the same time slide a hand to the butt of your weapon)
           Fall forward, breaking the fall with the butt of the weapon
           Go to a prone firing position

Figure 10.7. The Short Rush Method.




      10.3.3.4. Spider Crawl. At times it may become necessary to descend to the ground quickly from
      an elevated position or to move over an obstacle. To jump to the ground may cause injury due to
      an unfamiliarity with the terrain or height of the obstacle. The “spider crawl” is used in these cir-
      cumstances to avoid injury and to reduce your silhouette while going over an object. Perform the
      “spider crawl” as explained in Table 10.2. and illustrated in Figure 10.8.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                167


Table 10.2. The “Spider Crawl” Technique.
                                               Spider Crawl
            As you move along the obstacle or structure, you must maintain a low profile to
            reduce the silhouette; place your weapon in your lead hand
            Your leading hand and foot are extended over the edge of the obstacle in a
            “spread eagle” position while your trailing hand and foot are pressed firmly
            against the top of the obstacle
            Your lead hand and foot are slowly extended down the vertical face of the
            obstacle until only your trail hand and foot are on the top
            Your trail foot is released, closely followed by your trail hand using your lead
            hand as a pivot to control the drop
            You should land on the balls of your feet, with your legs spread approximately
            shoulder width; your knees should be flexed and your body should be in a
            slightly crouched position hugging the obstacle
            The “spider crawl” should be practiced for both right-handed, as well as
            left-handed descent. The placement of your lead hand will determine which
            direction you will be facing once you hit the ground

Figure 10.8. “Spider Crawl” Movement.




10.4. Work Party Security. Work party security is typically provided by two or three individuals posted
on the perimeter of the work area to provide early warning of any impending hostile action. If the work
party is fired upon, these individuals will determine the direction of fire; estimate the type, size, and
apparent intent of the hostile force; direct the work party to take defensive cover, and call security forces
(an armed reaction force) for assistance. Defensive cover, as used in this context, means the occupation of
168                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


either hasty or deliberate (prepared in advance) defensive fighting positions that take maximum advan-
tage of the terrain at or in the vicinity.
      10.4.1. Defense Sectors. Upon arriving at a work site, establishing proper security requires more
      than just posting guards at arbitrarily selected locations. To best defend the entire work site, defense
      sectors should be established. This task requires several actions to be taken. The first action is to
      establish the exact boundary of the work site. Once this is done, the work party leader/commander and
      personnel who will be serving as sector commanders walk the perimeter of the work site and establish
      sector boundaries. Normally the number of sectors is kept between three and five and the sectors need
      not be all the same size. The size of the sector will depend on the terrain and what resources are within
      the sector. The important thing to be sure of when setting up sectors is that the boundaries between
      sectors are well defined. This allows personnel defending a sector to know exactly where their terrain
      defense responsibilities start and end. Once sector locations and boundaries are determined, sector
      commanders site fighting positions in locations that have clear lines of fire toward the work area
      perimeter. These positions should be at least the equivalent of a hasty fighting position. If the work
      site will be occupied continuously for several days or longer, consideration should be given to con-
      structing deliberate positions. Manning of the sector fighting positions should be by pre-established
      fire teams if possible—this maintains team integrity and pre-identifies a leader “in the trenches.”
      10.4.2. Listening Posts. The purpose of going to a work site is to accomplish an engineer construc-
      tion task of some sort. Security, while obviously important, cannot be allowed to consume most of
      your resources all the time. Normally, a small number of troops are placed on security duty while the
      remainder perform the engineering task. These security troops will not be sufficient to man all the
      fighting positions, but a “trip wire” system of listening posts can be used. These listening posts are
      positioned outside the work site perimeter but close enough to allow individuals to quickly return
      (Figure 10.9.). If an enemy force is encountered, the troops manning the listening posts bring the
      information back to the work site, fighting positions are manned, and security forces support is imme-
      diately requested.

Figure 10.9. Sectors, Fighting Positions, and Listening Posts.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              169


  10.4.3. Fighting Position Construction. When providing defense, personnel need cover from fire
  and concealment from observation. Cover and concealment are best provided by some type of fighting
  position. This may be an existing hole, a hastily dug prone shelter, or a well-prepared position with
  overhead cover. The time available for preparation determines how well you build your position. The
  basic requirements of a fighting position are that it must allow you to fire and protect you from obser-
  vation and direct and indirect fire. For detailed information on the construction of defensive fighting
  positions, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 14, Guide to Fighting Positions, Obstacles, and Revetments,
  and the Joint Forward Operations Base (JFOB) Force Protection Handbook (to be replaced by UFC
  4-027-01, Design of Deployed Operational Bases to Mitigate Terrorist Attacks).
  10.4.4. Recognition Code Systems. A system of constantly changing passwords, number codes, and
  duress words is an essential part of the security of any military activity during periods of conflict.
  Code systems afford guards a quick means of identifying both friendly and enemy personnel, even
  when restrictions prevent visual confirmation. In addition, codes can be used as a spontaneous alerting
  signal.
     10.4.4.1. Passwords. There are codes which aid a sentry by ensuring no unauthorized person
     infiltrates the work area perimeter. Passwords are normally given in two parts and changed daily,
     usually at 1200 hours. They take the form of a challenge (e.g., Papa November) and a counter sign
     (e.g., Papa Tango). The use of letters from the phonetic alphabet as challenges and counter signs is
     an agreed NATO procedure and may be used when forces of two or more nations are in the same
     formation.
     10.4.4.2. Number Codes. Number codes are often used in place of passwords. They are normally
     less than 20 to make response easier and faster. For example if the number code is 15, a challenge
     could be 9 with a counter sign of the number 6. The challenge and counter sign may be spoken,
     written, or transmitted visually using hand signals. You may want to avoid using numbers that are
     half the challenge number because an enemy could simply mimic your gesture or number and be
     accurate.
     10.4.4.3. Duress Words. A duress word is one word used to alert a friendly listener that the trans-
     mitting party is in duress. When selecting and using such a code, consider the following:
         10.4.4.3.1. Select a word which is not subject to routine use, yet is also not exotic. The words
         chow and serendipitous are either too commonplace or exotic to be effective. Whereas the
         words boot or brogan may well prove effective.
         10.4.4.3.2. Use the word in casual dialog so it is not obvious; this allows the listener to take
         action without alerting the enemy.
  10.4.5. Radio Communication. Radios are the most frequently used means of communication. They
  are particularly suited for use when you are on the move and need a means of maintaining command
  and control. Small handheld or backpacked radios that communicate for short distances are ideal for
  small unit use. As the need grows to talk over longer distances and to more units, the size and com-
  plexity of radios increase. To put radios to good use, first look at some of the things that affect radio
  communications.
     10.4.5.1. To communicate with each other, radios must have a common frequency. They must also
     be able to transmit and receive the same type of signal. Most Prime BEEF radios are FM and will
     not communicate with AM units. Squelch settings on radios must also be set correctly.
170                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


         10.4.5.2. Factors that affect the range of radio equipment are weather, terrain, antenna, power, and
         the location of the unit itself. Trying to communicate near man-made objects such as bridges and
         buildings may also affect radio transmissions. Interference in the form of static often occurs when
         you use radios near power lines or electrical generators. Interference may also come from other
         radio stations, bad weather, or enemy jamming. Many of the things that cause poor radio commu-
         nications can be corrected by using common sense. Such things as making sure that you are not
         trying to broadcast from under a steel bridge or near generators and power lines, using the best
         available antenna, and selecting the proper site will help ensure more reliable communications.
         10.4.5.3. Communications security denies or delays unauthorized personnel from gaining infor-
         mation of value from telecommunications. Table 10.3. lists some common communications secu-
         rity practices.

Table 10.3. Common Communication Security Practices.
                                          Communication Security
              Use authentication to ensure the other communications station is a friendly one
              Designate periods when all radio equipment is to be turned off
              Restrict the use of radio transmitters (monitoring radio receivers/listening
              silence)
              Enforce net discipline and radio procedures
              Use proper site selection, minimum power, and minimum transmission times
              Use directional antennas when possible

      10.4.6. Visual Communications. Recent radio jamming enhancement development is causing more
      emphasis to be placed on visual communication for command and control. Visual signals include arm
      and hand signals, pyrotechnics, smoke, flashing lights, and panel markers. Obviously, the effective-
      ness of any signal will depend upon a set of prearranged meanings. You assign prearranged meanings
      to visual signals to the individual sending the signal and the person seeing the signal so both have the
      same understanding of what that particular signal means. Generally, a listing of prearranged messages
      using these signals is included in a unit’s operating instructions. Visual signals, however, have some
      shortcomings that limit their use. For example, visual signals can be easily misunderstood, limited by
      poor visibility such as night or in dense terrain, and can be intercepted by the enemy and reused to cre-
      ate confusion.
      10.4.7. Sound Communications. Sound signals, like visual signals, depend upon a set of prear-
      ranged meanings. Sound signals include the use of the voice, whistles, horns, weapons, and other
      noise-making devices to transmit simple messages over short distances. Also, like visual signals,
      sound signals are vulnerable to enemy interception and use and susceptible to misinterpretation. Their
      best application is as installation C2 warning alarms. The prearranged meanings for sound signals are
      usually established by local commanders and are listed in the unit operating instructions.
      10.4.8. Wire Communications. Wire communication will not often be used during a work party
      undertaking. However, since it does have an application with other Prime BEEF activities such as
      beddown, it will be briefly addressed here. Wire is another type of communication used during ground
      operations. Although installing a wire network takes more time than installing a radio, wire lines are

  usually more secure. And in general, it gives better communication because it is less subject to inter-
  ference from weather, terrain, and man-made obstacles. Wire lines also protect you from enemy elec-
  tronic warfare actions such as jamming. However, wire lines are subject to breakage by vehicular
  traffic or enemy offensive action—a major drawback.
  10.4.9. Messenger Communications. Unlike other field communications, messengers are a means
  of transmitting large and bulky items such as maps and documents as well as oral and written corre-
  spondence. Messengers are the most secure means of communications, but there are also negative
  aspects with using messengers. Specifically, they are subject to enemy action, require more time than
  radio or wire communications, and do not afford “real time” writer-to reader exchanges. If messengers
  are used routinely, don’t forget to vary their movement schedules and routes periodically.
  10.4.10. Weapons Accountability. Firearms are prone to theft. Certain military-unique types,
  because of their great casualty potential and their non-availability in commercial markets, are particu-
  larly susceptible. Recognizing this, the Department of Defense has established precise and exacting
  standards for protecting firearms against pilferage.
     10.4.10.1. Protection Philosophy. All commanders and supervisors must give continuing special
     attention and emphasis to protecting firearms. Weapons must only be removed from a designated
     storage area for as short a time as possible and in as small a quantity as is needed to support spe-
     cific missions or projects. Other requirements include:
         10.4.10.1.1. Only government-owned facilities will be used to store government-owned fire-
         arms.
         10.4.10.1.2. The Security Forces chief provides staff supervision over the firearms protection
         program.
         10.4.10.1.3. All firearms must be continuously attended or guarded when they are removed
         from approved storage areas. Persons issued or in the possession of arms, ammunition, and
         explosives are responsible for protecting their items while entrusted with their care. They must
         make sure that all items are under positive control at all times.
         10.4.10.1.4. Mobility weapons in storage should be placed in containers configured and
         clearly identified by a Prime BEEF team to allow ease of issuance. Be sure proper numbers of
         supplementary items such as cleaning kits and holsters are appropriately packed with the
         weapons. When weapons are in transit, stored in depots or warehouses, or held for contingen-
         cies, the containers must be banded or locked and sealed.
  10.4.11. Protecting Firearms off the Military Installation or Under Field Conditions. W h e n
  deployed in the field for actual or exercise purposes, firearms must be under continuous positive con-
  trol. Depending on the threat situation in the immediate area, commanders may elect to consolidate
  firearms in a central location to make surveillance easier. Weapons are never left unattended or unse-
  cured. Personnel charged with custody of stored weapons should be armed and must have the capabil-
  ity to sound an alarm if a forceful theft is attempted. An armed response force must be established
  with the capability of responding within a reasonable time (normally 15 minutes). When traveling off
  the installation with weapons during deployments (ground transport in secure area) or when obtaining
  commercial air transportation, weapons must be placed in locked, banded, or sealed containers.
  Ammunition must not be placed in the same containers as weapons, and the outside of the containers
  must not indicate contents.
172                                                                       AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      10.4.12. Small Group Movement. For those occasions when engineer personnel may have to move
      into an unsecured or potentially hostile area remote from the main installation or at a location off the
      installation, small group movement techniques may be necessary. In such situations, personnel are
      organized into fire team formations. Fire teams normally consist of four-man groups. Each team mem-
      ber is identified by number (1, 2, 3, and 4)—for our purposes all members are riflemen with the num-
      ber four man being the team leader.
         10.4.12.1. The wedge (Figure 10.10.) is the basic formation for a fire team. The interval between
         personnel is normally 10 meters. The wedge expands and contracts depending on the terrain.
         When rough terrain, poor visibility, or other factors make control of the wedge difficult, fire teams
         modify the wedge. The sides of the wedge can contract to the point where the wedge resembles a
         single file formation (Figure 10.11.). When moving in less rugged terrain, where control is easier,
         personnel expand or resume their original positions.

Figure 10.10. Wedge Formation.




Figure 10.11. File Formation.




         10.4.12.2. If two or more fire teams are to be traveling together, the wedge or file formations are
         again used (Figure 10.12. and Figure 10.13.). Usually an element leader is also present. A
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                           173


      20-meter separation between the element leader and the second fire team is normally maintained
      if contact with an enemy force is not likely. If contact with an enemy force is possible, however,
      the formation is altered somewhat. The element leader and the second fire team fall back to a
      50-meter separation from the lead fire team (Figure 10.14.). This formation is called traveling
      overwatch.

      techniques used for positioning a wedge formation to respond to attacks from the flanks.

10.5. Convoy Security. Moving personnel and equipment from one place to another is a necessity in
most peacetime and wartime military operations (Figure 10.17.). Troops and goods must get to the right
place, at the right time, and arrive in good condition. Frequently, road travel in the form of a convoy is the
most desirable method of movement. As can be expected, a convoy is always organized for a specific pur-
pose and according to a specific plan. But the general approach to convoy use during peace and war is
somewhat different.

Figure 10.17. Air Force Engineers on a Convoy Mission in Iraq.




   10.5.1. Peacetime Operations. During times of peace, convoys serve as an efficient way to control
   the movement of items in mass from one point to another. Logically, in this situation little regard is
   given to defensive tactics. Things such as keeping the convoy intact, under positive control, and on
   schedule are at the forefront of concern.
   10.5.2. Wartime Operations. During periods of conflict, the convoy continues to be an efficient way
   to move items. Some common Air Force applications may include transporting items from installa-
   tions to airports of embarkation and moving war reserve materiel from prepositioned sites within a
176                                                                     AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008


      theater to an installation of intended use. Probably a less common use, the convoy may be the logical
      way to move resources and personnel as part of a base denial effort. Additionally, Air Force personnel
      often participate in convoy operations with other services. Regardless of the reason for the convoy
      movement, wartime military operations expose our convoys to increasing types of threats, including
      roadside improvised explosive devices (IEDs), vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices
      (VBIEDs), small arms fire (SAF), rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), sniper attacks, ambushes, and
      other threats. In this type of threat environment, convoy operations are virtually synonymous with
      combat operations. Therefore, personnel assigned to convoy duty must be able to respond appropri-
      ately to these threats. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.58, Tactical Convoy Operations, for specific information
      on convoy tactics, techniques, and procedures. In addition, a review of current Air Force lessons
      learned at https://lessonslearned.langley.af.mil/afcks/ may provide up-to-date information on con-
      voy procedures in ongoing expeditionary operations.

Figure 10.18. Air Force Engineers Practice Convoy Defensive Tactics.




10.6. Summary. Throughout history, convoys have notoriously been targets of choice for enemy
ambush; therefore, defensive tactics do become an item of keen concern (Figure 10.18.). Admittedly, if
dedicated air cover is available, the possibility of ambush is markedly reduced—but even then not entirely
eliminated. In today’s expeditionary battlefield environment, dedicated air cover does not negate the
deadly effectiveness of an enemy’s use of IEDs or VBIEDs to disrupt convoys. These threats make it
essential to utilize and practice current, battlefield-tested convoy defensive tactics—it can mean the dif-
ference between success and failure.

Terms
Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)—A field operating agency (FOA) located at
Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Readiness Support Directorate (HQ AFCESA/CEX) acts as the Air
Force program manager for base civil engineer (BCE) contingency response planning.
Aqueous Film-Forming Foam—A firefighting agent mixed under pressure with water to form foam
which is sprayed over a fire. It is most often used to control an exterior aircraft fire.
Area of Operations—An operational area defined by the joint force commander for land and naval
forces. Areas of operation do not typically encompass the entire operational area of the joint force
commander, but should be large enough for component commanders to accomplish their missions and
protect their forces.
AFPAM10-219V3 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              185


Base Denial—The destruction or denial of vital installation resources so the enemy cannot use them
against friendly forces or for his benefit.
Beddown—The act of providing facilities, utilities, services, construction, and operation and
maintenance support to a deployed force with the overall intent of establishing a basic mission capability.
Camouflet—The resulting cavity in a deep underground burst when there is no rupture of the surface.

procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and
operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters,
located within North America between Canada and Mexico.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists, or
subversives or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies
require plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel,
installations, and equipment.
Contingency Plan—A plan for major contingencies that can reasonably be anticipated in the principal
geographic subareas of the command.
Contingency Response Plan—A base civil engineer plan of action developed in anticipation of all types
of contingencies, emergencies, and disasters.
Conventional Weapons—Weapons which are neither nuclear, biological, nor chemical.
Convoy—A group of vehicles organized for the purpose of control and orderly movement with or without
escort protection.
Damage Control Center—A command and control node for engineer forces at unit level which controls
the disaster and attack recovery activities of the engineer work force.
Decontamination—The process of making any person, object, or area safe by absorbing, destroying,
neutralizing, making harmless, or removing chemical or biological agents or by removing radioactive
material clinging to or around it.
Defensive Fighting Positions—Fortifications constructed at various locations around an installation to
assist in base defense operations. These positions can vary from hastily built bunkers to elevated,
hardened towers. Usually constructed to support security forces requirements, fighting positions can also
be built for work party security purposes or specific point defense needs.
Deploy—To relocate a unit, or an element thereof, to a desired area of operations or to a staging area.
Deployment will be accomplished with all required personnel and equipment. Deployment begins when
the first aircraft, personnel, or item of equipment leaves the home base. The force is deployed when the
