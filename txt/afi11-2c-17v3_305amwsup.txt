1.4.2. 4 (Added) The 305th or 514th Operations Group Commander is the waiver authority for
AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, McGuire AFB Supplement. Submit changes to this supplement via
AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 305th Operations Group
Standardization/Evaluation Division (305 OG/OGV).
1.11. (Added) OGV Assistance. When OGV assistance is required, aircrews should contact 87
Air Base Wing Command Post (87 ABW/CP) to establish a phone patch with the applicable on
call OGV representative.
2.3.2.1. (Added) If a scheduled activity cancels during local training missions, the Pilot-in-
Command (PIC) does not require OG/CC approval to conduct transition training in lieu of that
event. Events that are not scheduled, planned, briefed and approved by the OG/CC are
considered "bootleg" and will not be accomplished. Aircrews requesting approval for schedule
deviations must contact command post and specifically request OG/CC approval for the re-
planned sortie profile.
2.5.12. (Added) Communication with 87 ABW/CP.
2.5.12.1. (Added) For each aircraft departure, crews will follow the sequence of events
published in the 305/514 AMW Wing Operations Plan (WOP). Relay any deviations from the
launch sequence with explanations. Report “block-out”, “airborne”, “on the deck”, and “block-
in”.
2.5.12.2. (Added) At least one crewmember will monitor the Command Post frequency while
within range of McGuire AFB. The volume may be turned down during critical phases of flight.
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                            3


2.6.1.4. (Added) Mission Commanders (MCs) will ensure adequate time is provided for mission
planning to include route study, threat analysis, weather factors, and mission requirements. The
designated MC will attend all formal briefings.
2.6.2. (Added) MCs will also be designated when required by mission cut, Operation Order
(OPORD), or squadron leadership. For added mission flexibility, the MC should be designated
in the remarks of the mission cut. A copy of the flight authorization orders will be required for
the MC to continue the mission with a new aircrew, if applicable.
2.11. (Added) TACC/XOCL has overall responsibility for the recovery of Non Mission Capable
(NMC) aircraft from the time of notification until the aircraft is Fully Mission Capable (FMC) or
Partially Mission Capable (PMC). Therefore, aircrews must keep XOCL informed on all matters
regarding maintenance status, recovery options, and actions. Ensure that XOCL has the
opportunity to aid in resolving the problem.
2.12.     (Added) Flight Authorizations. Once the flight authorization is completed and
authenticated, any authenticating official may make changes. The authenticating official
authorizing the change must initial all changes. EXCEPTION: When time and circumstances
dictate, the designated PIC may make short notice changes to a flight authorization. For changes
on local missions, PICs will receive verbal approval from the squadron Director of Operations or
other designated orders authenticating official.
2.13. (Added) Changes or Cancellations.
2.13.1.    (Added) Coordinate with Command Post (CP) for itinerary changes, early
departure/landing, and landing time or block-in time extensions for any training flight or
mission. Before an aircraft commander cancels a local training flight and/or releases a crew,
he/she will obtain approval through 87 ABW/CP from: 305 OG/CC, 732 AS/DO, or 57
WPS/DO, as applicable.
2.13.2. (Added) If canceling an off-station training reservation (i.e., Lakehurst NAES,
Blackstone AAF, North Field, or Fort Drum transition), specifically request that CP relay the
information to the applicable agency.
2.13.3. (Added) Coordination with 87 ABW/CP is required for early/late landings and/or block-
in time extensions on local training sorties. “On-time” landings are within +/- 15 minutes of the
GDSS scheduled land time. If anticipating a landing outside of this window, AC’s are required
to relay a new land time from CP. If landing late, call at least one hour prior to the original
Global Decision Support System (GDSS) land time to request and reset the arrival time. If
landing early, approval is not required; call one hour prior to the proposed early land time. In
both cases, CP will use the new land time +/- 15 minutes for “on-time” tracking. Maintenance
expects aircrew to taxi without delay to parking upon landing for an “on-time” block-in. If
ground training is to be accomplished after landing (combat offload, wingtip clearance training,
etc), ACs are required to provide an expected block-in time to CP during the required 30 minute
out call and update it as necessary.
2.14. (Added) Incident Reporting. In addition to notifying command and control, crews should
report any unusual circumstances to home station leadership (on-call 24 hours a day through 87
ABW Command Post). Such incidences may include, but are not limited to: damage to aircraft
or airport, significant crew issues, any reportable incident (e.g., Safety, Intel, police, etc.), and
media exposure. When operating out of or transiting through a deployed location with deployed
 4                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


leadership, crews should report via deployed channels. When in doubt, always keep home
station leadership informed.
3.10.6.1. (Added) Include Flying Crew Chiefs (FCCs) in the work-rest plan and allow them to
use in-flight crew rest facilities when necessary. During aircraft debrief, the PIC will coordinate
with the FCC and maintenance supervision on how long the FCC can safely work. This is
especially important for augmented duty days or crew-staged operations. Rest periods may only
be interrupted for necessary questions concerning the airplane maintenance history.
4.4. (Added) During non-duty hours, contact standby OGV personnel through 87 ABW/CP.
When beyond command and control capability, the Aircraft Commander (AC) retains ultimate
authority and responsibility. In these cases, contact OGV as soon as practical after the flight.
McGuire crews should request technical support and additional assistance from home unit or the
appropriate A3 or A4 agency. Work Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance requests through the
Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) to the maximum extent possible.
5.4.5. (Added) Landings in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) (305 AMW only). In a combat
zone, First Pilots (FPs) will not land on runways less than 120’ wide. EXCEPTION: FPs may
land on runways less than 120’ wide provided that they are accomplishing Aircraft Commander
upgrade/certification and under the direct supervision of an Instructor Pilot (IP)/Examiner Pilot
(EP).
5.15.3.1.2. (Added) Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) landings may be accomplished with one or
more thrust reversers pinned or brakes capped provided the Mission Computer (MC) Takeoff
and Landing Data (TOLD) provide adequate ground roll distance. Pilots will ensure the MC
non-standard TOLD pages reflect the proper aircraft configuration.
5.15.3.3.1. (Added) Mission Planning. Before departure, ensure the aircraft is prepared for
Semi-Prepared Runway Operations (SPRO) by maintenance personnel. Ensure turn-around
areas at the assigned airfield are adequately marked to allow the aircrew to easily identify
useable surfaces.
5.15.3.3.2. (Added) Takeoff. For cement-capped runways, use a Runway Friction Factor (RFF)
of two (2) for takeoff data calculations. For other than cement-capped, use the reported RFF
from the special tactics team. Selecting “EOCS-YES” on the non-standard TOLD page may be
required to correct VMCG problems.
5.15.3.3.3. (Added) Taxi. Use differential braking with caution. Loadmaster will monitor the
landing gear on the inside of the turn through an open paratroop door and notify the pilot if the
wheels become locked or begin plowing the soil.
5.15.3.3.4. (Added) Aircraft Backing. Only use backing when necessary for mission
accomplishment. The loadmaster may be positioned in the paratroop door when backing the
aircraft on dirt surfaces (use of the cargo door and ramp may allow dust into the cargo area
setting off the smoke alarms). During dusty conditions, the loadmaster should wear eye
protection to protect from blowing debris. Avoid backing up on sloping terrain if possible. Plan
ground operations to avoid star turns. Expect significant surface damage if star turns are
performed.
5.15.3.3.5. (Added) Engine Running On/Offload (ERO). If reverse idle causes vortex
ingestion, terminate ERO procedures and position the throttles to forward idle after all ground
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                           5


personnel are clear of the area behind the aircraft. Based on ground and wind conditions, engine
shutdown may be required.
5.16.2.1. (Added) At McGuire AFB, do not block-in without a marshaller to ensure the aircraft
is parked in the correct position. EXCEPTION: a marshaller is not required for Engine Running
Crew Change (ERCC) operations in designated ERCC spots.
5.16.2.2. (Added) When not using marshallers, do not taxi through McGuire parking spots
without prior coordination with the Command Post and Ground Control, to verify the spot is
cleared of all obstacles.
5.18.4.1. (Added) Pilots will proceed to the selected fuel jettison area with approval from Air
Traffic Control (ATC) and determine if the airspace below is clear of traffic. When jettisoning
fuel, aircrews must comply with any additional ATC restrictions.
5.18.4.2. (Added) The airborne fuel dump area is located at the PREPI intersection (RBV
122/62). Hold east using 7NM legs with right turns in between 5000-17,000’ MSL. Based on
the intentions of the pilot, this area shall be used to the maximum extent possible for all fuel
dumping in the McGuire Radar Approach area, except when the delay incurred going to the area
or altitude would compromise flying safety. Higher altitudes are coordinated with ATC as
needed.
5.20.1. (Added) In the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) terminal area, McGuire or
Lakehurst tower will issue the Bird Watch Condition (BWC) for their respective airfield. If bird
activity is observed by aircrew, contact the control tower, command post, range control, or base
operations to pass pertinent information. Include your call sign, location, altitude, time of
sighting, type of birds (if known), approximate number of birds, and behavior of birds (e.g.
soaring, flying, flock movement, etc). When BWC is elevated, ATC and Command Post, in
coordination with Airfield Management, will advise aircraft on the anticipated delay, if known,
for bird dispersal or a return to a Low BWC.
5.20.1.1. (Added) BWC Low. Birds present a minimal hazard. No restrictions to flying
operations. Transition training is only allowed during BWC Low.
5.20.1.2. (Added) BWC Moderate. Birds present an increased hazard to flying operations.
Restrictions: No transition training and only initial takeoffs and full stop landings are permitted.
Training crews must either hold until ATC changes the BWC back to Low, or crews can
coordinate with CP to depart to an alternate training airfield.
5.20.1.3. (Added) BWC Severe. Birds present an extreme hazard to flying operations.
Restrictions: Takeoffs and landings are prohibited without 305 OG/CC (or higher) approval for
both local sorties and Air Mobility Command (AMC) missions. Airborne aircraft will divert or
hold. Use 87 ABW/CP to assist in coordination and determination of alternate airfields for
transition work or full stop landings, as required.
5.20.2.1. (Added) Bird/Wildlife Airstrike Hazard (BASH) Phase I. Migratory bird activity is
low, normally from December through August.
5.20.2.2. (Added) BASH Phase II (BASH window). Migratory bird activity is high; normally
from September through November. BASH Phase II Operations are subject to the following
guidance:
 6                                         AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


5.20.2.2.1. (Added) The BASH window is defined as +/- 1 hour from sunrise and sunset and
applies to the following areas: McGuire, Lakehurst, Atlantic City, Slow Route (SR)800, SR846,
and Visual Route (VR)1709. Takeoffs, landings, and transition for missions/locals are not
authorized during the BASH window unless 305 OG/CC approval is obtained. Missions
delaying into the BASH window, or attempting to go early, which were not scheduled for takeoff
or landing during the BASH window, must coordinate for approval from the 305 OG/CC. If
mission requirements dictate a departure during the BASH window and 305 OG/CC approval is
granted, ACs, based on advisories from tower, must ensure the runway and arrival or departure
corridors are clear of birds. Anytime the airfield is experiencing less than Visual Metrological
Conditions (VMC) at McGuire, Airfield Management will do the visual clearing of the runway.
Direct any BASH Phase II questions to the specific Airfield Operations or Wing Safety Office.
5.20.2.2.2. (Added) Home station departures and local training missions will be scheduled
outside of the BASH window to the maximum extent possible. Training missions, to include air
refueling locals and Night Vision Goggle (NVG) locals, which must depart during the BASH
window to complete the mission, will be approved by the 305 OG/CC on a case-by-case basis.
5.20.2.2.3. (Added) Training sorties flying transition at any other AMC base during their
respective BASH window (at that base) must adhere to established guidelines and in addition, be
approved by 305 OG/CC. Current Operations will make every effort to avoid scheduling
transition training during those established BASH windows. For planned transition at non-AMC
airfields not mentioned in 5.20.2.2.1., aircrews will refer to paragraph 5.20.6
5.20.4.1. (Added) The Aviation Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) is operational for the entire
Continental US (CONUS). AHAS has a dynamic Bird Avoidance Model (BAM), which uses
historical data to predict bird activity. The AHAS model takes current and forecast weather
conditions, as well as near-real time NEXRAD radar data, to further refine the bird prediction.
Tests show that AHAS can predict bird conditions 24 hours in advance (for predictions in excess
of 24 hours, the AHAS and BAM models are the same). Reference AHAS data at:
http://www.usahas.com.
5.20.5.1. (Added) Any aircraft experiencing/suspecting a bird strike will land as soon as
practical to have maintenance inspect the aircraft. If training, the sortie may be continued at the
PIC’s discretion after maintenance determines the aircraft is airworthy. If a bird strike occurs at
Lakehurst, Atlantic City, or on local low levels and the aircraft is still airborne, at PIC discretion,
the aircraft may divert to McGuire for inspection. If the bird strike occurs outside of those areas,
consider using a closer qualified maintenance facility, if practical. If the full stop is conducted at
a non-qualified maintenance location, the PIC will contact command and control (C2) for
coordination with maintenance. Relay the extent of damage and have C2 relay the approved
course of action.
5.20.5.2. (Added) Enter all suspected or confirmed bird strikes in the AFTO 781A,
Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, complete an AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife
Strike Report, and AMC Form 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence
Worksheet. These forms will be sent to home station wing safety as soon as practical within 24
hours via debrief, squadron safety, or FAX to DSN 650-BASH (2274). If practical, collect
remains from all bird strikes. Turn in remains to the local Wing Safety, Airfield Operations, or
Maintenance (MX) QualityAssurance (QA).
5.20.6. (Added) Aircrew mission planning guidance (Phase I and Phase II).
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                          7


5.20.6.1. (Added) Prior to conducting transition at airfields without a BASH program, planners
and/or aircrews will obtain any available bird activity information prior to and during operations
at the airfield. Upon arrival at the airfield, the PIC must recheck the condition by any means
possible. Aircrews experiencing high bird activity at these locations will advise the controllers
of the bird activity so they can announce this information to other aircrews and update the
Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS) if necessary. After the mission, aircrews
should notify their respective safety office BASH representative concerning any high bird
activity.
5.20.6.2. (Added) Regardless of BASH Phase I or BASH Phase II operations, all low levels and
military transition airfields will be assessed by AHAS prior to mission execution. AHAS should
be used in mission planning to select a training location that will allow for safe mission
execution. In an effort to reduce the bird strike hazard along low-level routes, crews will observe
the following restrictions on training missions:
5.20.6.2.1. (Added) Transition training procedures. Crews will check AHAS for planned
military transition airfields. If any proposed training airfield is AHAS Moderate or Severe, the
crew may proceed to that location and obtain the airfield’s updated/real-time bird condition. If
the actual bird condition is Low, the crew may continue training.
5.20.6.2.2. (Added) AHAS Bird Condition LOW: No low level or transition restrictions.
5.20.6.2.3. (Added) AHAS Bird Condition MODERATE: Crews will fly no faster than 250
knots on affected route segments.
5.20.6.2.4. (Added) AHAS Bird Condition SEVERE: 305 OG/CC approval is required prior to
commencing any flight on affected low level route segments (USAF Weapons School
Commandant approval required for 57 WPS outside of McGuire AOR). If approved, crews will
fly no faster than 250 knots and no lower than 1000 feet AGL (3000 feet AGL at night) on
affected route segments.
5.20.7. (Added) For information on BASH, see McGuire AFB SPLAN 91-212, Bird Aircraft
Strike Hazard (BASH) Program.
5.21.2. (Added) McGuire aircrews are not normally qualified or allowed to perform Functional
Check Flights (FCFs). The procedures below will be followed at McGuire AFB when an FCF is
requested:
5.21.2.1. (Added) Aircrews or squadrons will contact 305/514 OG/OGV if requested to perform
an FCF by an outside agency. OG/OGV will work with the C-17 Sustainment Group at Warner-
Robbins and the local McGuire Boeing Site Manager to schedule a C-17 FCF under the Boeing
Sustainment contract, if able. Otherwise, see restrictions in paragraph 5.21.1
5.22.1. (Added) 305 or 514 OSS/OSO (USAF Weapons School Commandant for 57 WPS) is
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for coordination of airshow demonstrations/flyovers
with the user(s) and HHQ. Aircrews participating in these events will work closely with the
mission scheduler. Aircraft commanders will receive a briefing from Current Operations on
event requirements.
5.22.2. (Added) Aerial reviews and fly-by events are not intended to demonstrate the
performance limits of the aircraft. Aircraft commanders will operate the aircraft IAW flight
manual procedures. In no case will an aircraft commander respond to an impromptu request for
 8                                        AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


changes to the program which would result in the execution of maneuvers not previously
approved by the OG/CC.
5.22.3. (Added) ONLY certified aircrews will fly aerial demonstrations and practices.
EXCEPTION: OG/CC approved upgrade training. Crewmembers will reference the 305/514
OG/OGV Certification Program guides for guidance. Certified Aircraft Commanders may
perform Pilot Flying (PF), or Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties. Certified Pilots may only perform
PM duties. Safety observers and loadmasters do not require any certification.
5.22.4. (Added) Demonstration/practice crews are only permitted to fly AMC approved
demonstration profiles found at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1075662991/
Files/editorial/C-17%20Standard%20Profiles.pdf?channelPageId=s6925EC1341A60FB5
E044080020E329A9&programId=t6925EC2D6C900FB5E044080020E329A9.
5.22.5. (Added) Additional Aerial Demo Guidance
5.22.5.1. (Added) Comply with procedures and restrictions published in AFI 11-209, Aerial
Event Policy and Procedures, its AMC supplement, as well as AFI 11-246 V6, Air Force
Aircraft Demonstrations.
5.22.5.2. (Added) OG/CC is the approval authority for all demo upgrade training and practices
by McGuire aircrews. If upgrading/practicing at McGuire, a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) will
be issued stating the time(s) and altitude block requirements for the duration of the event.
Additional coordination with Airfield Operations and Fort Dix is required to close R-5001.
Demonstration upgrade/practice flights at other airfields may require additional
approval/coordination with the host location.
5.22.5.3. (Added) The selected airshow crew must conduct a practice demonstration within 30
days of participating in the event. Upgrade training on this flight is only permitted for the safety
observer and loadmaster positions.

5.37.1. (Added) The McGuire AFB Base Weather Station will issue thunderstorm and lightning
activity weather information through CP, tower, ATIS, and the Airfield Operational Risk
Management (ORM) Assessment. A weather “Watch” for lightning is issued 30 minutes prior to
expected thunderstorm activity. A weather “Warning” for lightning is issued when lightning is
observed within 5 NM of McGuire AFB.
5.37.2. (Added) During a weather “Warning,” personnel in affected locations will cease all
outside activities and seek shelter. Enclosed aircraft, buses and other vehicles with metal tops
and bodies are considered suitable shelter during thunderstorm activity. Wheel wells are
extremely hazardous during thunderstorms and should be avoided.
5.37.3. (Added) When lightning is observed within 5 NM (“Warning”) and/or announced,
maintenance/fuel/oxygen service will stop all flight line operations and evacuate the flight line
until the termination of the lightning hazard. The following procedures will be adhered to by all

6.2.13. (Added) Tape measure, calculator, and work gloves for loadmasters.
6.2.14. (Added) When required to carry Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE), the
squadron will fax a copy of crew orders to Aircrew Life Support after the crew list is established.
Squadrons should specify whether mini or full D-Bags are required.
6.3.3.1. (Added) Review the Special Pilot in Command Airports and Airport Qualification
Program (AQP) as defined in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR).
6.3.9.1.   (Added) Missions planned to operate in the CONUS-only do not require
Communication Security (COMSEC) materials unless required for mission accomplishment or if
an overseas tasking appears likely. However, crews are always required to use appropriate IFF
Mode 2 codes on locals and missions. These can be reviewed at combat crew comm.
6.3.9.2. (Added) Crews will be issued COMSEC documents and Simple Key Loader (SKL) as
shown in Table 6.4. COMSEC kits are prepared in advance of crew show time automatically
using GDSS II for “RCH” and “HUNT” call signs. All other call signs requiring COMSEC must
request a kit at least one duty day prior. If additional items are specified in an OPORD, Air
Tasking Order (ATO), Special Instructions (SPINS), or Rules of Engagement (ROE), crews will
coordinate for those additional requirements. The Crew Communications office (754-2937) is
located in Base Operations and normal duty hours are from 0500-1900L M-F (on-call at all
times). During these hours, crews will pick up their COMSEC directly from the Crew
Communications office. Outside these duty hours, the COMSEC kits will be available at the
Base Operations counter. Either way, crewmembers require ID card and flight orders during
pickup.

6.3.16. (Added) For all missions and local departing McGuire, PICs will provide the 87
ABW/CP with a copy of their aircrew flight orders in person or via fax (x2810). For local
sorties, the orders may be attached to the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, and given to Base
Operations personnel for CP filing.
6.4.1. (Added) Crews are required to carry an electronic publications (ePubs) Consolidated Trip
Kit (CTK) designated in the 305/514 OGV Publications and Manuals Program Guide on board
the aircraft for all missions and locals. The CTK contains all of the publications required in [NO
LABEL MAPPING for "Table"! 6.1 as well as a government laptop computer for electronic
publications. EXCEPTION: individual crew member checklists are not included in the CTK.
Crewmembers must carry the “required” checklists and inserts. Pilots are required to carry the
McGuire AFB Tactical Flimsy on local training missions only. The PIC or designated
representative, normally the primary loadmaster, will ensure the CTK is inventoried and onboard
the aircraft.
6.6.1. (Added) Schedule pre-mission briefings at least 48 hours prior to launch by calling 754-
2449/8152 (514 OG call 754-6538). Intel hours of operation are 0730-1630 (Local), Monday
thru Friday. Intel provides the 87 ABW/CP an afterhour’s on-call list.
6.6.2. (Added) Aircrew members are required to have a current Isolated Personnel Report
(ISOPREP) on file and review it per guidance in AFI 11-2C-17V1, C-17 Aircrew Training, prior
to entering the CENTCOM AOR, and prior to each combat mission. At McGuire, contact Intel
for assistance in ISOPREP creation/updating between 0800-1600 (Local), Monday thru Friday.
6.6.3. (Added) Tactics Binders for Home Station Departure.
6.6.3.1. (Added) Crews departing on missions which will/may enter or overfly a combat
designated area will receive tactics binders from home station and will receive updates from the
various staged tactics locations (if applicable).
6.6.3.2.   (Added) Binder Issuing Procedures. PICs or squadron representatives should
coordinate binder requirements at least one duty day prior to departure. As a minimum, tactics
requires 2-3 hours notice prior to giving a mission tactics brief and crews will contact them to
 12                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


schedule accordingly. After receiving the briefing, the tactics binder will be delivered by tactics
to Crew Comm for inclusion into the Crew Comm bag.
6.6.3.3. (Added) Enroute Procedures. The tactics binder contains classified material and will be
stored IAW with standard classified security procedures.6.6.3.4.          (Added) Returning
Procedures. PICs will return the binders to the respective squadron Tactics Office (normal duty
hours) or Crew Comm/Command Post (after normal duty hours) upon mission completion.
Binders must be sealed and hand receipted when signing over to CP.
6.11.4. (Added) Crew Communications maintains local and global navigation kits. Kits may be
picked up from the lockers beside the Base Operations desk. Return navigation kits to the
“return” section in the same condition that they were received. Missing/outdated publications
will be obtained/replaced by crewmembers by accessing the shelves behind the Base Operations
desk. Obtain approval before entering this area. Current and new World-wide Navigation
Database (WWNDB) CDs are located inside the kits.
6.12.4.6. (Added) McGuire AFB Weather Flight Procedures. For home-station crews,
OSS/OSO will automatically request canned GDSS II weather per the itinerary for all locals,
non-flight managed missions (first leg), and off-station trainers (first leg). Refer to Flight Crew
Bulletin (FCB) or Flight Crew Information Files (FCIFs) for current in-depth procedures. Flight
managed missions will receive weather via the Integrated Flight Management (IFM) package.
6.12.7.1. (Added) IFM products do not contain secure information from the ATO or SPINS.
Tactical routings and threats must be reviewed prior to departure. Crews will contact
Intel/Tactics prior to departure as required.
6.12.7.2. (Added) Aircraft commanders will have an active GDSS II account (obtain account
through squadron UPAM account manager), with "aircrew" role access.
6.12.7.3. (Added) At locations where a local agency is not specified to provide IFM support,
aircraft commanders will use their GDSS II account (web-based address:
https://gdss2.c2.amc.af.mil/gdss2web/) to access and print their mission materials. Alternate
transmission methods coordinated by the crew (e-mail or fax) will be used to deliver the mission
materials at locations where access to non-.mil internet is unavailable or impractical.
6.13.1.1. (Added) McGuire AFB unit static call sign prefixes are as identified in the WOP
Summary and GDSS II.
6.23.1.1. (Added) In addition to reviewing the AFTO Forms 781, Maintenance Discrepancy
and Work Document, the crew will determine if the aircraft is configured properly in regards to
aircraft configuration, fuel, oxygen, and fleet requirements. Crews will promptly notify
Command Post of any problems that require assistance to preclude a delay in the launch
sequence.
6.26.5. (Added) Helmets, oxygen masks, and NVGs.
6.26.5.1. (Added) The equipment inspection date should be checked to ensure it will not expire
prior to mission completion. Component malfunctions will be reported to OSL upon return.
Helmets, oxygen masks, and NVGs will be returned immediately to OSL after mission
termination.
6.26.5.2. (Added) Helmet bags will be used to transport helmets and oxygen masks. The
helmet, mask, visor and flight gloves are the only items authorized to be stored inside helmet
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                        13


bags. The outside pockets may be used to store personal items. NVG’s will be transported in the
assigned hard case to/from aircraft to protect against damage.
6.26.5.3. (Added) Only trained personnel may sign out NVGs. Crews will preflight NVGs
prior to use by means of an ANV-20/20 tester or eye lane.
6.26.5.4. (Added) Emergency Passenger Oxygen System. The EPOS units will remain stored in
the pouches under the sidewall seats until needed. EPOS for the centerline seats will be kept in
the storage locker until needed. EPOS or life preserver bags should not be stored on the main
floor because they can be mistaken for passenger bags. (35,000’ is the maximum cruise altitude
if EPOS is used as a primary emergency oxygen source.)
6.43.1.1. (Added) The tactical situation and pilot experience level drive the type of approach
and landing. Prior to descent, the pilot shall thoroughly brief all crewmembers on specific duties
to include emphasis of aircraft weight, pressure altitude, winds and their effect on the landing
phase of the approach.
6.43.4. (Added) C-17 NVG operations will be conducted to runways marked IAW AFI 13-217,
Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. Prior to initial departure, Aircraft Commanders shall
determine what lighting scheme they can expect at planned destination. Do not land on Airfield
Marking Pattern (AMP) 4 marked runways.
6.45.3. (Added) Debrief Process. Upon landing, the PIC will report to Maintenance Debrief
(N/A for 57 WPS flying non-McGuire aircraft). Debrief will initial and make a maintenance
copy of the AFTO Form(s) 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, for their use.
The original 781 will be turned in by the aircrew to Squadron Aviation Resource Management
(SARM) office for hours tracking. NOTE: When the crew flies an airplane assigned to any
other wing than 305 AMW (typically, stage operations), leave the original AFTO Form(s) 781 in
the aircraft forms. The PIC shall ensure that an extract (identical copy) has been created, and
that block 43 is filled out and signed by the PIC for turn-in at the home squadron SARMS.
NOTE: Aircrews flying home station aircraft will keep the original AFTO 781 and submit them
to their unit with all post mission documentation. The aircrew will ensure enroute maintenance
personnel receive a copy of the AFTO 781 for input into G081.
6.57.1.1. (Added) Do not place the aircraft in a congested area. Coordinate with Tower and
Ground Control for approved deplaning area. At McGuire, the expected procedure is to land on
6/24 and exit at Alpha or Foxtrot taxiways. If possible, maintain a 600-foot separation from
buildings and other aircraft.
6.57.2.1. (Added) When inspecting for hung flares, avoid the path at which a dispensed flare
will travel.
6.57.3.1. (Added) If there is evidence of a hung flare, notify tower/ground control, the fire
department, and call for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Shut down the engines using
normal checklists, and deplane the passengers/crew using exits away from the hung flare. Report
the following information:
6.57.3.1.1. (Added) Aircraft location.
6.57.3.1.2. (Added) Type and quantity of flares hung.
6.57.3.1.3. (Added) What Counter Measures Dispensing System (CMDS) position the hung
flares are located on, i.e., left forward, right aft, etc.
 14                                        AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


6.57.3.1.4. (Added) Type and quantity of flares on board.
6.57.3.1.5. (Added) Number of passengers/flight crew on board the aircraft.
6.57.4.1. (Added) If there is no evidence of a hung flare, board the scanner and taxi to parking.
Document any false flare CMDS inventories (dud flares) in the AFTO Form 781A. Note: A
missing weather seal from a flare is not considered hung unless a jettison signal was generated.
However, the flare with a missing weather seal must be removed and replaced prior to next flight
from a location with repair capability.
6.57.5. (Added) Oncoming crews will ensure an extremely thorough walk around is completed
on aircraft from which flares have been released. Scanners shall pay particular attention to
potential damage on the underside of the aircraft and in the wheel well and engine/pylon areas.
Crewmembers will annotate in the AFTO Form 781A any damage/burn marks noted. Any
damage noted warrants further inspection by maintenance and possible repairs prior to flight.
6.59. (Added) Aircrew Data Transfer Device (ADTD).
6.59.1. (Added) Do not make changes to any of the operating properties of the ADTD.
Installing or running programs from a CD/DVD, Floppy Disk, Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA), thumb drive, or other media, not specifically authorized in
the flight manual, is strictly prohibited.
6.59.2. (Added) The floppy disk drive on the ADTD is damaged when dust covers on floppy
disks get lodged inside. Do not use floppy disks with metal dust covers in the ADTD. Do not
insert/force any sharp object into the floppy drive. If you cannot retrieve a disk, write-up the
ADTD in the aircraft forms.
6.59.3. (Added) Do not make an AFTO 781 write-up in the aircraft forms when the anti-virus
information box appears on the ADTD stating the definition file is more than 30 days old. The
305 AMW Site Service Representatives (SSR) will update these files in conjunction with
WWNDB and Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) updates.
6.59.4. (Added) Classified material must be carefully handled in regards to the ADTD. Never
copy files from any classified external media onto the desktop or any other part of the ADTD file
structure. In addition, crews will promptly remove and properly stow any classified media after
uploading data using the ADTD.
6.60. (Added) Crew Resource Management (CRM).
6.60.1. (Added) During the mission pre-brief, aircraft commanders will appoint an individual
crewmember to assess CRM during the sortie/mission. Crews are encouraged to use the AF
Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form, as a guide to enhance their CRM
skills.
6.60.2. (Added) Aircraft commanders will conduct a formal debriefing following the
completion of each mission and local training sortie. Each crewmember should discuss and
critique crew coordination and the process used to make decisions.
6.61. (Added) Thrust Management . C-17 aircrews must use extreme caution while taxiing at
power settings above idle. Airfield operations personnel (especially at civilian Fixed-Based
Operations (FBOs)) may not be familiar with the jet blast associated with C17 aircraft taxiing.
Ensure sufficient distance is available between the aircraft and other aircraft, structures, vehicles,
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                        15


or equipment. When possible, contact the airfield manager during the planning phase to discuss
the taxi plan, parking location and jet blast hazards. If a crewmember believes a possibility of
causing jet blast damage exists, do not taxi the aircraft.
6.62. (Added) Lost Items.
6.62.1. (Added) Aircrew members will ensure positive control and accountability of personal
equipment used while performing duties on aircraft. If an item is discovered as lost/missing on
an aircraft, conduct a thorough search of the area. If the item is still determined to be lost or
missing, make an AFTO Form 781A write up describing the item and general suspected location.
6.62.2. (Added) Any item found in the aircraft by the aircrew or maintenance should be turned
into maintenance debrief. Debrief personnel will attempt to find the owner of the item by
checking for markings/names on the lost item. Any item not claimed in 30 days will be turned in
to base supply for reclamation.
7.13.1.1. (Added) When directed to arm, aircrews on missions originating from McGuire AFB
will send 2 crewmembers to the Armory to pick up weapons prior to going to the aircraft. If
arrangements have been made with Armory personnel, then one crewmember may pick up the
weapons. Aircrew will not transport government issued weapons in POVs.
7.13.7.1. (Added) If a suitable clearing barrel is not available, crews will use the safest
location/manner to load/unload/clear weapons; not on-board the aircraft.
7.13.8. (Added) Standard Anti-Hijacking: designated crewmembers are issued one magazine
with 15 rounds of hollow point ammunition. For easy identification, the butt end of hollow point
ammunition magazines should be painted red.
7.13.8.1. (Added) Hollow point ammunition can only be used for anti-hijacking purposes.
Hollow point ammunition is used on the aircraft because of its stopping power and the tendency
to travel less when it hits an object.
7.13.8.2. (Added) Once a crewmember is not protecting the aircraft from being hijacked,
hollow point ammunition is not authorized. It is a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict
(LOAC) and the Geneva Convention to use hollow point ammunition in armed conflict.
Crewmembers must change the type of ammunition when switching from an anti-hijacking role
(in and around the aircraft) to a Force Protection role (when not in the immediate vicinity of the
aircraft).
7.13.9. (Added) Force Protection. Arming will be IAW the governing OPLAN, OPORD or
Mission Directive. In addition to the required anti-hijacking ammunition, armed crewmembers
should be issued appropriate rounds of ball ammunition.              The butt end of ball
ammunitionmagazines should be unpainted or painted green.
8.4.3. (Added) Protecting Information. The AMC Form 97 is a tool used by commanders and
safety persnnel to report, investigate, and ultimately prevent mishaps. Although command and
control agencies may use basic factual details for operational reporting, the AMC Form 97 is a
limited use document and command posts and commanders must protect information contained
in the form (it may not be used for adverse action against a crew).
8.4.4. (Added) Reporting. Report mishaps as soon as possible. In all cases, retain a copy of all
relevant information and fax/email all forms to the appropriate McGuire AFB Flight Safety
Office at (609)754-BASH (2274) or 305AMW/SEF@McGuire.af.mil. Every effort should be
 16                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


made to contact McGuire safety (on-call via CP) to confirm receipt prior to departing on the next
leg of the mission. If not feasible, promptly fax/email documents at the next opportunity. Notify
TACC and Sq/DO or Sq/CC ASAP.
8.4.4.1. (Added) At airfields with an AMC flying safety officer (FSO), notify the FSO.
8.4.4.2. (Added) At stations without an AMC FSO, notify the command post duty officer or
AMC liaison officer.
8.4.4.3. (Added) At an Air Force base with no AMC function, contact base operations or the
host base safety office.
8.4.4.4. (Added) At other stations, relay necessary information to the nearest Air Force
command post.
8.4.5. (Added) Any time a McGuire crew is flying another wing’s airplane and an AMC Form
97 is required, use the notification guidelines in paragraph 8.4.4 (Added) and fax a copy of the
same information to the command post of the airplane’s assigned wing. Compliance provides
timely mishap reporting to commanders, enables 87 ABW/CP and Wing Safety to accomplish
necessary operational reporting, and initiates safety channel investigation and reporting to
prevent mishaps.
8.6.1.1. (Added) The PIC will ensure that the Multi-Service Corporation (MSC) air card is on
the aircraft (including locals) prior to takeoff. If the card is not present at home station, notify
the maintenance supervisor. You will either be provided a new card or, as a minimum, the credit
card number assigned to that aircraft.
8.6.1.2. (Added) If the card is lost en route, make a “note” entry in the AFTO Form 781A.
Include all relevant details (e.g., “BP vendor at EGPK [Mr. Driver] misplaced card. Ensuing
search failed to recover card.”). If the card is missing from an aircraft, inform maintenance and
document the missing card in the AFTO Form 781A, stating that it was missing upon your
arrival at the aircraft. If the air card is lost, misplaced or destroyed, contact the Wing Refueling
Document Control Officer (WRDCO) immediately so the old card can be locked out of the
system. In addition, call the MSC at (866) 308-3811 (US/Canada) or (913) 217-9303 (Other
Areas). A technician will give you a card number to use for the remainder of the mission. Use
the Standard Form 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, only as required at subsequent stops.
8.6.1.2.1. (Added) If you cannot obtain a card or a card number and the fuel vendor will accept
nothing else, call the McGuire WRDCO during duty hours (DSN 650-3277) or call TACC and
inform them of your situation.
8.6.3.10.1. (Added) Vendor delivery receipts alone are insufficient for payment. They must
have an air card, DD Form 1898, Jet Fuel Identaplate, receipt or an SF 44 to accompany them.
9.6.1.3.5.1. (Added) NVG touch and go landings are only allowed with an IP performing the
maneuver or in direct supervision of the pilot performing the maneuver
9.6.1.3.7. (Added) C-17 NVG operations will be conducted to runways marked IAW AFI 13-
217. Prior to initial departure, Aircraft Commanders shall determine what lighting scheme they
can expect at planned destination. Do not land on Airfield Marking Pattern AMP 4 marked
runways.
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                       17


9.6.1.3.8. (Added) NVG Training at McGuire AFB and Lakehurst NAES. McGuire AFB NVG
procedures will be in accordance with MAFBI 13-202, Base Airfield Operations Instruction, and
the McGuire AFB NVG and TAD procedures Letter of Agreement. Lakehurst NAES NVG
procedures will be in accordance with the Letter of Agreement. Include a statement in the
“Remarks” section indicating NVG training will be accomplished at whichever location and the
applicable times.
9.12. (Added) Combat Offload (COL) Training and Ground Operations.
9.12.1. (Added) COL training will normally be accomplished at McGuire AFB. The only areas
authorized for combat offloads are Romeo and X-Ray designated areas. Other areas require
OGV approval before use. Check the NOTAMs, FCIFs, FCBs, and Tactical Flimsy for latest
changes to procedures.
9.12.2. (Added) Crews will call Current Operations by 1200 the day prior if desiring combat
offload pallets for their sortie.
9.12.3. (Added) Report to McGuire Command Post 30 minutes prior to doing COL(s), upon
commencement, and upon completion with ramp location and intentions.
9.12.4. (Added) Obtain taxi clearance to and from the selected COL location from Ground
Control. Relay if planning to drop pallets and once training is complete.
9.12.5. (Added) Crews will use minimal thrust when any engine is not directly over a concrete
portion of the ramp. Ensure the area behind the combat offload area is clear of all personnel and
equipment. Multiple COLs are approved. Backing may be accomplished between offloads to
maximize the distance in front of the aircraft or for training. In accordance with T.O. guidance,
back the aircraft no closer than 25’ (using ramp as reference) from previously dropped pallets
and ensure that 1000’ of usable forward distance remains for each subsequent offloads.
9.12.6. (Added) Due to the limited life expectancy of 463L Combat Offload pallets and Aerial
Port Squadron (APS) manpower limitations, combat offloads should be limited to 1 pallet per
pass and 4 pallets per sortie. If larger combat offloads are required for training (e.g., 6
loadmasters on a single sortie, each needing a combat offload), squadrons will coordinate with
APS and Current Operations.
9.12.7. (Added) Off-station Combat Offloads will follow locally published guidance for the
location where the training is conducted. PICs must thoroughly study the procedures and
coordinate requirements at the off-station location.
9.12.8. (Added) Star turns. A star turn is a turning maneuver in which the aircraft performs a
180 degree turn within a limited amount of space. The designated area is on X-ray row between
the yellow lines (90’ wide area).
9.13. (Added) Command and Control.
9.13.1. (Added) Coordinate with Command Post for itinerary changes, early departure, and
flight time extension for any training flight or mission. Before an aircraft commander cancels a
local training flight and/or releases a crew, he/she will obtain approval through 87 ABW
Command Post from: 305 OG/CC (305th), 732 AS/DO (514th), or 57 WPS/DO (WIC), as
applicable.
 18                                      AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


9.13.2. (Added) If canceling an off-station training reservation (e.g., Lakehurst NAES,
Blackstone AAF, North Field, or Fort Drum transition), specifically request Command Post to
relay the information to the applicable agency.
9.13.3. (Added) Advise CP of any itinerary changes to the planned GDSS II locations.
Approved transition airfields are listed in paragraph 9.15 below.
9.13.4. (Added) Coordination with 87 ABW/CP is required for early/late landings and/or block-
in time extensions on local training sorties. “On-time” landings are within +/- 15 minutes of the
GDSS II scheduled land time. If anticipating a landing outside of this window, AC’s are
required to relay a new land time from CP. If landing late, call at least one hour prior to the
original GDSS land time to request and reset the arrival time. If landing early, approval is not
required; call one hour prior to the proposed early land time. In both cases, CP will use the new
land time +/- 15 minutes for “on-time” tracking. Maintenance expects aircrew to taxi without
delay to parking upon landing for an “on-time” block-in. If ground training is to be
accomplished after landing (combat offload, wingtip clearance training, etc), ACs are required to
provide an expected block-in time to CP during the required 30 minute out call and update it as
necessary.
9.14. (Added) Engine Running Crew Change.
9.14.1. (Added) During mission planning, the second half crew must relay fuel request to first
half crew as early as possible. Both ERCC crews must coordinate the rendezvous time and
location. Update 305 OSS/OSO with any changes. Both crews will be in place no later than 10
minutes prior to ERCC.
9.14.2. (Added) First Half ERCC Crew. Immediately notify CP of any discrepancy that might
prevent the airplane from being operated by the second half crew. Plan to land with the amount
of fuel requested by the second half ERCC crew. Call CP 30 minutes prior to landing with ETA,
maintenance status and estimated landing fuel. Accomplish the Operational Stop Checklist.
Stop at the ERCC designated spot (primary: R-4, secondary: behind Romeo row) or as directed
by ground control. If ERCC is in the designated spot, marshallers and/or wing walkers are not
required. If parking in other than the designated spot, coordinate with CP for a block in crew.
Loadmaster will electronically prepare the weight and balance (Form F) for the second half
ERCC loadmaster. PIC will complete all aircraft forms (e.g. 781H, 781A, 664) prior to
departing the aircraft. PIC may remove the Air Force Technical Order Form 781 and bring to
maintenance debrief (or leave on aircraft for second half crew to accomplish). Leave the
navigation kit onboard.
9.14.3. (Added) Second Half ERCC Crew. Loadmaster will take over ground duties on headset
and receive a load brief from first half loadmaster, if applicable. The new PIC assumes
command after the crew has been briefed on aircraft status, one of the second half pilots is
monitoring the brakes, and the exceptional release, if required, has been signed.
9.15. (Added) Transition Training.
9.15.1. (Added) Familiar Airfields. The following familiar airfields are available for transition
training (i.e. instrument approaches and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) patterns): Atlantic City
(KACY), Charleston AFB (KCHS), Columbia Metropolitan (KCAE), Dover AFB (KDOV),
Lakehurst NAES (KNEL), McGuire AFB (KWRI), North AF Aux (KXNO), Richmond
International (KRIC), Wheeler-Sack AAF (KGTB), Willow Grove NAS (KNXX), Wright
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                         19


Patterson AFB (KFFO), and Griffiss Airfield (KRME). The PIC will review NOTAMs, IFR
Supplement, AP/1, ASRR, and the Tactical Flimsy regarding restrictions. Some of these
airfields may require a phone call to determine pattern saturation before proceeding.
9.15.2. (Added) Tactics Approved Airfields. In order to conduct tactics maneuvers at airfields
other than McGuire AFB and Lakehurst NAES, a current/coordinated/signed Letter of
Agreement (LOA) must be available for 305/514th AMW use (N/A for 57 WPS syllabus sorties).
Exception: Standard overhead patterns may be accomplished at airfields without an established
LOA. The following additional airfields are currently available: Dover AFB (KDOV), North AF
Aux (KXNO), and Wheeler-Sack AAF (KGTB). Refer to FCIFs and FCB Vol II for additional
airfields or modifications.
11.5.1.1. (Added) Computer discs will be clearly labeled with the appropriate mission numbers
and dates. The mission computer IDENT for each mission history file will use the following
naming convention: first and last name initials of the aircraft commander followed by the three-
digit Julian day. In the event of multiple mission history download requirements during the same
Julian day, append the first IDENT with the suffix “A,” the second with “B,” the third with “C,”
and so on (i.e., CT123A, CT123B).
12.7.1. (Added) Aircrews will not refuel without direct step-by-step reference to T.O. 1C-17A-
2-12JG-28-1, Servicing Fuel Job Guide, located in the binder in the drawer below the loadmaster
station. Aircrews will be familiar with information contained in T.O. 00-25-172, Ground
Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Items of particular note contained in this
technical order include: fire protection equipment requirements (Table 3.1), fuel servicing
supervisor duties (paragraph 3.5), Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) restrictions (paragraph 4.5), and
chief servicing supervisor duties (paragraph 5.3).
12.9. (Added) Ram Air Turbine (RAT) Check Procedures.
12.9.1. (Added) Aircrew are authorized to perform the RAT extension check in accordance with
the Approach checklist portion of the Pilot-Copilot Check Flight Procedures in TO 1C-17A-6CF-
1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual. A copy of this TO is available
from DOV or OGV. The following additional restrictions apply:
12.9.2. (Added) A RAT flight check requires a current and qualified instructor pilot flying the
aircraft.
12.9.3. (Added) Do not flight check the RAT when landing crosswinds exceed 15 knots or
landing gross weight exceeds 400,000 pounds. The RAT will be extended just prior to the last
landing of the sortie. Do not conduct touch-and-go landings after extending the RAT.
13.4.2.7. (Added) Personnel will not be seated in the same position (alongside) as a logistics
pallet regardless of the spacing between passengers and cargo (i.e. 30 inch rule is only applicable
when passengers are seated forward and does not apply in this case). This change applies to all
personnel to include aircrews.
13.15. (Added) Loadmaster Ground Operations. During aircraft taxi or reverse taxi, the aircraft
loadmaster will not open the forward emergency escape exit to observe clearances. During ERO
operations, the forward emergency escape exit and crew entrance door should remain closed
unless prolonged operation of engine-powered equipment is required inside the aircraft.
13.16. (Added) Transporting Human Remains (HR).
 20                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


13.16.1. (Added) Ensure on/offload of transfer cases containing HR is accomplished discreetly
and in a dignified manner. Do not on/offload HR concurrently with passengers/patients.
13.16.2. (Added) Normally, HR will not be carried on scheduled Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
missions. However, if a unique situation occurs, the PIC in coordination with the Medical Crew
Director (MCD) must contact HQ AMC TACC Medical Cell for guidance.
13.16.3. (Added) Transfer cases containing HR will be stowed on the cargo floor/pallet in a
level position. The head will always be positioned toward the nose of the aircraft. The feet will
never be higher than the head while in the stowed position.
13.16.4. (Added) Transfer cases containing HR will be loaded on the cargo floor in a position
where they will be the last item to be jettisoned.
13.16.5. (Added) No cargo or miscellaneous items will be placed on top of transfer cases
containing HR. However, if more than one transfer case containing remains is shipped, stacking
is permitted, but should be avoided if possible.
13.16.6. (Added) United States flags will not be removed from transfer cases containing HR
unless the flag interferes with restraining the case. Transfer cases will be restrained for flight by
cargo straps fed through the transfer case handles. At the offload location, and prior to opening
the cargo doors, remove the restraint from the transfer case. If the US flag was removed from
the transfer case, unfold the US flag and position over the transfer case prior to opening any
doors. Position the field of Blue/Stars over the forward (head) end of the transfer case.
13.16.7. (Added) Dover AFB Arrival Procedures.
13.16.7.1. (Added) Dover AFB is the primary arrival point for receiving fallen service
personnel coming into the United States from overseas. Dover AFB has a “dignified transfer
process” in place to honor fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who are en route to their
final resting place. This should not be confused with an official arrival ceremony (news crews,
dignitaries, etc.). Aircrew members are part of the process and should know what to expect
when arriving at Dover.
13.16.7.2. (Added) Before departure to Dover AFB, the PIC will call the Dover Command Post
Duty Officer at DSN 445-4211 and pass all known information to include delays, computer
flight plan flying time, and concerns.
13.16.7.3. (Added) Because of the amount of coordination required, aircrews will fly the
mission cut. If arrival time differs by more than 15 minutes, notify command and control.
NOTE: The deceased may have a uniformed service representative coming from an off base
location to meet the aircraft and it is important to arrive as close as possible to the scheduled
arrival time.
13.16.7.4. (Added) Expect the following actions upon arrival. This process can take from thirty
minutes to more than an hour, dependent on the number of transfer cases on board.
13.16.7.4.1. (Added) After arrival at the designated parking location, the loadmaster will
deplane for engine shutdown. Ensure the cargo door and ramp remain closed.
13.16.7.4.2. (Added) Customs/Agriculture inspectors will meet and clear the aircraft.
13.16.7.4.3. (Added) After being cleared by customs/agriculture, a dignified transfer process
team comprised of Port Mortuary personnel will board the aircraft and prepare for transfer.
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                         21


Within 20 minutes to 1 hour, the dignified transfer team will board the aircraft and start the
transfer of the HR. The aircrew will remain in place and receive a duties briefing. Passenger
service will coordinate with the Command Post Duty Officer, and passengers should be
downloaded prior to the dignified transfer.
13.16.7.4.4. (Added) After the transfer case is prepared for offload, open the cargo door and
ramp.
13.16.7.4.5. (Added) The Honor Guard pall bearers will assume their positions around the
transfer case.
13.16.7.4.6. (Added) When directed, the aircrew will form up at the end of the aircraft ramp
allowing room for the pall bearers to maneuver. All actions by the aircrew for rendering respect
to the deceased will be commanded/directed by a member of the dignified transfer process team.
13.16.7.4.7. (Added) The dignified transfer process team member rendering honors will exit the
aircraft and take up a position off the tail of the aircraft.
13.16.7.4.8. (Added) The Honor Guard will proceed with the (offload) dignified transfer of the
human remains to waiting vehicles.
13.16.7.4.9. (Added) After the last vehicle and the remaining dignified transfer process team
members are off the flight line, aircrew members may resume normal duties (download
passenger bags, etc.).
13.16.7.4.10. (Added) Questions or comments on the proceedings should be addressed to the
senior dignified transfer process team member.
13.17. (Added) Cargo Fluid Spills/Fumes Leakage.
13.17.1. (Added) In the event of leakage/spill during flight, an entry will be made in the aircraft
forms noting type of spill and fuselage station location. An Air Mobility Command Form 9 ,
will be submitted to the Operations Center or a USAF Flying Safety Office at the next arrival
station.
13.17.2. (Added) The following information will be included in Block II of AMC Form 97:
13.17.2.1.   (Added) Equipment nomenclature, model number, and transportation control
number.
13.17.2.2. (Added) Type fuel/liquid, if identified.
13.17.2.3. (Added) What part of the unit leaked (i.e., tank, lines, box, etc.).
13.17.2.4. (Added) Adequacy of shipping documentation/certification.
13.17.2.5. (Added) Location of leaking cargo by pallet position or flight station.
13.17.2.6. (Added) Position of cargo (Facing forward or aft).
13.17.2.7. (Added) Liquid level at the time discovered, if applicable.
13.17.2.8. (Added) Estimated amount of fluid spilled.
13.17.2.9. (Added) Name, address of certifying official and emergency response telephone
number from Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods. WARNING: Any leak or spill creates
the possibility of hazardous fumes. Avoid breathing these fumes or direct contact with the fluid.
 22                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


Do not attempt to clean up these substances in flight unless a greater hazard exists to the aircraft
or its occupants. Use of supplemental oxygen and the protective clothing kit is highly
recommended.
13.18. (Added) Joint Inspection of Cargo. All cargo offered for airlift will be susceptible to
inspection by the AMC Aerial Port, Airlift Control Element (ALCE) or the aircrew loadmaster.
13.18.1. (Added) Loadmaster Inspection of Container/Shelters.
13.18.1.1. (Added) If the cargo has been properly joint inspected (JI), there is no requirement to
check containers. As always, the loadmaster has the right to inspect any container they feel was
not properly JI, however, they should have a good reason to suspect there has been a mistake. If
the container is not JI by Aerial Port, then the loadmaster should be checking them. If the
loadmaster is unsure if the item has been JI, they should be asking the Aerial Port personnel.
13.18.1.2. (Added) If hazardous cargo is inside the container, ensure access is available in-
flight. Refer to AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, or
AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Materials Handbook. During your cargo inspection
prior to loading, ask Aerial Port personnel for the combination or key to the container.
Combinations and keys will normally be provided with the cargo manifest on channel missions
or carried by the troop commander on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAMs) or Joint
Airborne/Air Transportability Trainers (JA/ATTs). Do not write the combination on the side of
the container. When the combination or key is not available, every effort should be made to
contact the owner of the container. Work with Aerial Port to accomplish this function. If you
are still unsuccessful in obtaining the key or combination, advise Aerial Port to bump the
container or cut the lock. Remember, this should be the last option after thorough coordination
with Aerial Port/shipping agency. In an effort to aid the owners of containers/shelters, document
when and where locks were cut and what efforts were made to locate the owners. Place this
information with the shipping documents on the container. Don't forget to write your name and
duty phone, along with the Aerial Port representative to answer any questions the owner may
have. This should not be construed as accountability for the lock or container, simply
professional courtesy.
13.19. (Added) Air Shipment of Liquid Oxygen/Nitrogen Tanks.
13.19.1. (Added) Prior to loading liquid oxygen units, the left aircraft vents will be inspected
for the presence of petroleum based products. If any presence of petroleum residue is detected,
the vents will be cleaned and purged. The surrounding cargo compartment floor will also be free
of petroleum-based residue.
13.19.2. (Added) Trichlorotrifluoroethane (MIL-C-81302),-TRICHLOROETHANE, is the only
authorized cleaning solution. This solution may be obtained from the base cryogenic laboratory.
13.19.3. (Added) The preparation and installation of the vent system will be accomplished by a
qualified shipper or maintenance personnel. Prior to the loading of liquid oxygen units, the Air
Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) will make arrangements for a qualified person to install the
overboard vent system at the appropriate time. Air terminal personnel and aircraft loadmasters
are not qualified to make the hookup.
13.19.4. (Added) When carrying liquid nitrogen, vents do not have to be cleaned when venting
is required.
AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011                                                       23


13.19.5. (Added) The shipper must provide specific venting instructions in the supplemental
information block of the Shippers Declaration For Dangerous Goods (unless venting procedures
are provided in a separate instruction accompanying the shipment or attached to the cargo).
Crewmembers must monitor vent valves during flight. If any of the above requirements are not
met, the liquid oxygen units will not be airlifted. (AFMAN 24-204, Attachment 6 & AMCI 24-
101 V11)
13.20. (Added) Winch Operations. All personnel, including aircrew members NOT involved
with the winching operation will clear the cargo compartment. Exception: the PIC may act as a
safety observer and needs to occasionally transit the cargo compartment for mission
requirements. Additionally, personnel will not cross the winch cable during winching while
tension is on the cable unless required. If practical, consider closing the crew entrance door
during winching operations to reduce uncontrolled access of personnel entering the cargo
compartment.
16.1.2. (Added) Local Training and JA/ATT Missions. 305 AMW crews will meet NLT the
working day prior to mission execution to accomplish mission planning. It is highly
recommended that 514 AMW and 57 WPS crews meet NLT the working day prior to mission
execution, however as a minimum the aircraft commander will accomplish mission planning
prior to mission execution following a thorough review of crew requirements. Loadmasters are
highly encouraged to attend mission planning, squadrons may direct attendance. If unable to
attend, the loadmaster will coordinate training requirements with the aircraft commander prior to
mission planning. The mission commander/PIC will release the crew(s) when planning is
complete. 305/514 AMW crews will coordinate all air refueling and ALZ scheduling/use
through 305 OSS/OSO.
16.1.3. (Added) Operational and Off-Station Training Missions. Aircraft commanders will
review mission tasking and ensure sufficient planning and coordination is accomplished prior to
entering pre-mission crew rest to complete any assigned mission regardless of complexity.
16.2.2. (Added) If the mission computer provides ground roll versus landing distance data for
the selected runway, the runway must be marked in accordance with AFI 13-217 and assault
procedures must be executed (i.e.; touching down in the specified touchdown zone and using TO
1C-17A-1 Assault Landing procedures).
16.2.3. (Added) ALZ landings may be accomplished with one or more thrust reversers pinned
or brakes capped provided the Mission Computer (MC) Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)
provide adequate ground roll distance. Pilots will ensure the MC non-standard TOLD pages
reflect the proper aircraft configuration.
16.2.4. (Added) For locals and Off-Station Trainers (OSTs), do not use assault landing zone
procedures at uncontrolled airfields. This does not preclude aircrews from flying full flap
approaches at these airfields. For missions, refer to HQ AMC guidance.
16.2.5. (Added) Aircrews should analyze objective (runway or ALZ) by using all available
resources (e.g., current Chart Updating Manual (CHUM'd) chart, satellite imagery, ASRR, and
ALZ survey) to identify terrain and other hazards within 10 NM of the arrival airfield.
16.3.1. (Added) Tactical Route Review/Approval. Coordinate with Wing Tactics prior to
planning random low-level routes. Low-level routes will be planned to make maximum use of
established Military Training Routes (MTRs). All planned low-level routes, local and off-
 24                                       AFI11-2C-17V3_305AMWSUP 28 JANUARY 2011


station, not published in Flight Information Publication (FLIP) AP/1B, will be drawn on a
sectional aeronautical chart (PFPS product suffices as long as all Airspace, Special Use Airspace
(SUAS), and MTRs are depicted) and approved by Wing Tactics personnel NLT one duty day
prior to mission departure. Missions that require Altitude Reservations (ALTRVs) and (or) a
flimsy will have low-level routes submitted to Wing Tactics NLT three duty days prior to
mission departure. A copy of the chart and computer generated Flight Logs will be given to and
maintained by Wing Tactics when the route is approved. These routes will be flown as
approved. If significant changes are required, the random low-level will be re-coordinated or
cancelled. 57 WPS random low-level routes must be approved by 57 WPS/DO.
16.6.2. (Added) Aircrews should analyze the objective (runway or ALZ) by using all available
resources (e.g.; current CHUM'd chart, satellite imagery, ASRR) to identify terrain and other
hazards within 10 NM of the arrival airfield.
17.8. (Added) Aircraft Defensive Systems.
17.8.1. (Added) Units will not transport built-up flares (magazines containing flares with squib
installed). Only the aircraft's defensive system dispensers can contain built-up flares. Transport
spare flares as hazardous cargo and process for Air Shipment in accordance with AFMAN 24-
204(I).
17.8.2. (Added) Halon, carbon dioxide, or water-type fire extinguishers will not be used on fires
involving pyrotechnics or magnesium incendiaries due to the risk of explosions.
17.8.3. (Added) Prior to arrival with a flare loaded aircraft, notify the local C2 that the aircraft
is equipped with flares. Parking restrictions vary from base to base; coordinate with local C2 to
ensure aircraft equipped with flares are parked in the appropriate spot. If flares were dispensed,
taxi clear of the runway, deplane a crewmember, and check for a hung flare. If a hung flare is
discovered follow procedures in this section.
17.8.4. (Added) Upon arrival at home station, flares are normally downloaded immediately.
Maintenance will annotate the flare download requirement in the aircraft forms.
17.8.5. (Added) Aircraft that are configured with flares for subsequent missions may be used
for local training sorties.
17.9. (Added) Flight Deck Armor . During missions not requiring armor, pieces that restrict
seat movement or interfere with rudder pedals may be removed and will be properly restrained.
