SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
publication is updated to reflect changes in mission requirements caused by manning reduction
and base consolidation efforts. The major changes include new limited duty hours for weather
flight operations; expanded weather sensitivities for newly assigned aircraft; clarification of
mission limiting weather criteria affecting air and ground operations; the addition of
supplemental and back-up observation requirements and procedures.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. Weather support to JB-MDL is currently accomplished thru units assigned to JB-
MDL and Scott Air Force Base (AFB), Illinois. The 305th Operations Support Squadron (OSS)
Weather Flight (WF) provides and/or arranges for weather support to McGuire airfield, 87
ABW, 305 AMW, 514 AMW, 108 WG and most assigned units. The 621st Contingency
Response Wing (CRW) has weather personnel assigned to each Contingency Response Group to
meet mission requirements. The 108th Contingency Response Group (CRG) has a weather
technician assigned to meet mission requirements, and the US Navy has an Aerographer’s Mate
team assigned to the Lakehurst Maxfield Field (airfield coded: KNEL), located on Lakehurst
Naval Air Engineering Station (NAES). The 15th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) at
Scott AFB provides airfield and/or resource protection in varying capacities to JB-MDL based
on local unit organization, capability and mission requirements and the support provided is
captured in Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) between the organizations involved. The
Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) at Scott AFB IL develops and provides flight weather
briefings to aircrews assigned to 305 AMW, 514 AMW 108 WG and to Air Mobility Command
(AMC) aircraft transiting JB-MDL. The WF does not have authority or control over the weather
entities assigned to JB-MDL but assumes responsibility as the weather subject matter expert and
should be considered as the focal point for all weather-related or weather support issues at JB-
MDL. This instruction establishes requirements and procedures pertaining to 305 OSS weather
support during peacetime operations. Additional information on US Navy weather support at
KNEL airfield is provided as a courtesy and will not be construed as directive in nature. This
instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as required.
1.2. Background.

     base for operations, etc).
  1.5.2. Prior to closing operations on the last duty day of the week, WF leadership or
  designated representative sends a closure Memorandum for Record (MFR) via e-mail to the
  JB MDL CP, ops controller, Command Post (CP) Duty Officer, 15 OWS B-Flight and B-
  Flight Leadership and Airfield Management org box covering recall procedures and POCs
  valid thru the last duty day of the following week, example Attachment 9. The JB MDL CP
  senior controller or Duty Officer will make the final decision to notify/recall standby
  forecasters based on the following:
     1.5.2.1. Weather Conditions warranting standby forecaster notification.
        1.5.2.1.1. Any weather watch or warning is issued or forecasted to occur and
        impacts local flying operations.
        1.5.2.1.2. Observed lightning within 10 miles of JB-MDL (OWS/Tower estimates
        lightning to be within 10 miles).
        1.5.2.1.3. Ceiling less than or equal to 500 feet is observed or forecasted to occur
        and impacts local flying.
        1.5.2.1.4. Visibility less than or equal to ¼ mile is observed or forecasted to occur

     of standby forecaster.
        1.5.2.2.1. Automated observation sensors are not viewable to Air Traffic Control
        (ATC) or 15 OWS personnel.
        1.5.2.2.2. Observations are not being transmitted to ATC or 15 OWS.
        1.5.2.2.3. GDSS 2 outage that will affect missions departing KWRI.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                  17


          1.5.2.2.4. In the opinion of ATC and/or 15 OWS personnel, the observations are not
          representative of conditions at the airfield or in the local area (i.e. PIREPS). These
          conditions must have a direct/significant impact to operations if not corrected.
      1.5.2.3. Operationally Significant Events requiring recall of standby forecaster
          1.5.2.3.1. Severe Weather Action Procedures activation
          1.5.2.3.2. Aircraft mishap
          1.5.2.3.3. Real world or exercise recall
          1.5.2.3.4. Alert missions
          1.5.2.3.5. At the direction of the 305 AMW/CC or designated representative
      1.5.2.4. The response time for the standby forecaster is 30 minutes. The recalled
      forecaster will leverage 15 OWS support to gain situational awareness as necessary and
      can recall additional WF personnel as needed.
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
   1.6.1. 15 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the MOA and/or assigned data sheets and sufficient weather intelligence will be
   available from various sources on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate facilities,
   funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support are available.
   1.6.3. WF Shortfalls: Some services may not always be available (e.g., out of station
   briefings) due to WF manning, station evacuation, or higher priority missions based on duty
   priorities.
   1.6.4. WF Limitations. The Weather flight provides weather services to JB-MDL to the
   maximum extent possible given manning, equipment and communications status.
      1.6.4.1. Short notice requests for routine weather services must be minimized, pre-
      coordination for weather services is a major factor in allowing weather flight leadership
      to de-conflict and prioritize requests based on available resources and duty priorities.
      Requests for weather support outside of the weather flight’s operational chain of
      command will be routed though OSS leadership. Requests for weather support that the
      weather flight cannot provide or arrange are routed through OSS leadership for a
      support/do not support decision.
      1.6.4.2. If the automated surface observing system is not operating, the WF will use
      manual tools and methods to determine airfield conditions. Although these tools and
      methods are proven to provide a large measure of accuracy, use of these techniques will
      result in an estimate of actual conditions.
      1.6.4.3. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor visibility.
      Thunder may not be heard because of ambient airfield noise. In these situations, the sole
      means of determining lightning strike locations is by use of a lightning detection system.
      All personnel and supervisors of personnel should exercise due personal caution when
      storms threaten the immediate area.
 18                                                            305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


1.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of an evacuation of building 1730
services will move to the AOL, Building 1608 (Remote Observing Site (ROS)). All contact
numbers remain the same as identified above with the additional numbers of 754-0033/0034.
   1.7.1. The AOL is maintained in a near active status and mirrors the capability available at
   the weather station with one exception, the unavailability of the Open Principal User
   Processor (OPUP) dedicated weather radar. WF members will follow duty specific Standard
   Operating Procedures (SOP) and Weather Flight Evacuation Checklists, including a list of
   required backup equipment and resume services at the alternate location as soon as possible.
   1.7.2. Most WF services/support will be provided, but will require a case-by-case
   assessment dependent on communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect some
   services to be degraded due to the remoteness of the facility.
   1.7.3. To ensure resource protection is maximized, the WF will not evacuate for exercises
   when severe weather is imminent or when a Hurricane Condition (HURCON) level change is
   probable within 8 hours after exercise begins.
1.8. Weather Information Operations Requirements.
   1.8.1. Using agencies should:
      1.8.1.1. Establish and coordinate all weather information requirements and procedures
      with 305 OSS/OSW. Coordination should include, as specific as possible, the action(s)
      taken upon receipt of the information. Doing so will greatly increase WF awareness of
      local service impacts and result in improved operations capability.
      1.8.1.2. Notify 305 OSS/OSW of any changes in weather information requirements.
      1.8.1.3. Coordinate with 305 OSS/OSW for any required weather information training.
   1.8.2. Unit Commanders should:
      1.8.2.1. Remain abreast of critical weather elements that adversely impact their
      operations. This can be accomplished through review of disseminated weather
      information via established communication procedures outlined within this instruction.
      1.8.2.2. Ensure procedures are established within their organization to adequately
      respond to or incorporate disseminated weather information as deemed appropriate.
      Accurate weather information inserted early into a unit’s planning process can result in
      increased operational efficiency and/or effectiveness by minimizing wasteful use of
      people and equipment.
      1.8.2.3. Review this instruction annually for any changes in support requirements and
      coordinate proposed changes with 305 OSS/OSW.
1.9. Release of Weather Information to Non-Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies and
Individuals. Requests for weather information services from non-DOD organizations must be
reviewed and approved by the 87 ABW Public Affairs (PA). The WF accepts requests for
weather information from non-DOD organizations provided the data is readably available and
retrieval time will not adversely affect on-going operations. Approved requests for weather
information by non-DOD organizations must:
   1.9.1. Not interfere with military operations activities.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                   19


   1.9.2. Not to be used in legal proceedings unless cleared by the 87 ABW/SJA.
   1.9.3. Not be in direct competition with locally available commercial weather services.
   1.9.4. Help promote local community/military good will.
   1.9.5. Be a one-time request (and each request formally made).
   1.9.6. Be related to non-commercial activities.
   1.9.7. Be on a non-retribution basis. Weather information will not be released to non-DoD
   agencies or the general public without approval from the 87 ABW/PA and Legal offices.
1.10. Media Coverage. When a Weather Flight member is interviewed for television, radio, or
print, a detailed description of the event will be forwarded by e-mail to AMC/A3W.
1.11. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 4, units that regularly
utilize weather support from the WF should provide post-mission/utilization feedback, when
possible. This information will be used to ensure products delivered to flying customers are
accurate, relevant, and timely. This feedback will form a database used to gauge accuracy of
support, identify trends, and improve the overall quality of products disseminated to customers.
   1.11.1. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
       1.11.1.1. Completing feedback form attached provided with a local Mission Execution
       Forecast (MEF) briefing and dropping that off at the forecast counter (when provided by
       the WF).
       1.11.1.2. Faxing feedback form to the WF (DSN 650-2728).
       1.11.1.3. Email and/or phone calls to the Flight Chief/Non-Commissioned Officer in
       Charge (NCOIC).
       1.11.1.4. Face to face feedback after any briefing.
       1.11.1.5. Contact 305 OSS leadership, DSN 650-2345.
   1.11.2. The WF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and gauge
   unit strengths and weaknesses.
1.12. Mishap Procedures. WF members and the 15 OWS have a role when the airfield is
advised of an emergency or mishap. In general, the WF will ensure applicable data used in the
development of any weather information, products, and/or services provided is saved for the
possibility of an impending investigation.
   1.12.1. The WF will save enough data covering weather conditions before and after the
   mishap to fully reconstruct environmental conditions. Leverage data that can be saved by the
   15 OWS.
   1.12.2. The WF will coordinate with 15 OWS to save all applicable data and products. The
   WF will specify what data they need the 15 OWS to save. If the WF used products from
   other OWSs to support missions crossing Areas of Responsibility (AOR), they must
   coordinate with all applicable OWSs to initiate a data save.
   1.12.3. If the OWS provided the flight weather MEF or other products, they will coordinate
   the data save with all AFW units involved. The WF will coordinate with Air Force Weather
   Agency (AFWA) Operations to save any applicable data and products not available locally.
20                                                   305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


  1.12.4. The WF at the departure installation and the mishap location (if on a military
  installation) will follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures in Chapter 1 of AFMAN 15-129.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                     21


                                           Chapter 2

                                 MISSION INFORMATION

2.1. General. JB-MDL has many different organizations and missions. All systems, missions,
and aircrews are limited by some weather parameters. This chapter will identify the local
weapons system, the most common missions and operating areas, and weather sensitivities
associated with the organization, weapons system, missions, and aircrews.
2.2. Serviced Organizations and Missions. 305 OSS/OSW provides weather services for the
following organizations and tailors weather information to their mission requirements based on
defined sensitivities:
   2.2.1. Both the 305 AMW (Active Duty) and 514 AMW (Reserve) maintain, train, and
   operate the KC-10A Extender and C-17A Globemaster III. These units extend America’s
   global reach by maintaining air mobility assets in a constant state of readiness to provide
   both an airlift and air refueling capability.
   2.2.2. The 108 WG (Air National Guard) maintains, trains, and operates the KC-135R
   Stratotanker and C-32. This unit extends America’s global reach by maintaining air mobility
   assets in a constant state of readiness to provide both an airlift and air refueling capability.
   2.2.3. In addition to the flying mission, each serviced wing conducts flight-line maintenance
   and aerial port ground operations which are integral to effective accomplishment of the air
   mobility mission.
2.3. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The WF provides mission-tailored weather support
for flying areas used by assigned or attached units to JB-MDL as well as base operations and
protection responsibilities. Typical training missions involve air refueling and/or low level
missions around the northeast US, however, given the global-reach mission of JB-MDL assets,
the WF maintains situational awareness of weather events across the globe.
2.4. Specific Weather Limitations. A working knowledge of aircraft sensitivities allows WF
personnel to focus effort on those weather elements that pose the greatest risk to the
accomplishment of JB-MDL’s air mobility mission.
   2.4.1. KC-10A. The Extender is a dual-role tanker and cargo aircraft designed to maximize
   global mobility and force projection. For instance, the KC-l0A can refuel deploying fighter
   aircraft while simultaneously carrying the ground crew and equipment. Weather sensitivities
   listed in Table 2.1
   2.4.2. KC-135R. The Stratotanker's principal mission is air refueling. However, this aircraft
   can also perform a dual-role mission similar to the KC10. Weather sensitivities listed in
   Table 2.2
   2.4.3. C-17A. The Globemaster III provides a rapid strategic delivery capability of all types
   of loads directly to forward bases in the deployment area. The aircraft is also capable of
   performing tactical airlift and airdrop missions within theater as required. Weather
   sensitivities listed in Table 2.3
   2.4.4. C-32. The C-32 is a specially configured version of the Boeing 757-200 commercial
   intercontinental airliner. Weather Sensitivities listed in Table 2.4
 22                                                         305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


   2.4.5. C-9B. The Skytrain II mission is the transport of personnel and cargo. Weather
   sensitivities listed in Table 2.5
   2.4.6. UH-1N. The Huey is widely used in a transport, airborne battlefield command and
   control, troop insertion/extraction, fire support coordination, medical evacuation, search and
   rescue, armed escort/visual reconnaissance or utility roles. Weather sensitivities are listed in
   Table 2.6
   2.4.7. AH-1W. The Super Cobra is a twin-engine, day/night marginal weather Marine Corps
   attack helicopter that provides en route escort for assault helicopters and their embarked
   forces. Weather sensitivities are the similar to the Huey and are listed in Table 2.6.
   2.4.8. CH-53E. The Super Stallion is the Marine Corps' heavy lift helicopter used to
   transport personnel and equipment, lift heavy loads and conduct minesweeping missions.
   Weather sensitivities are listed in Table 2.7
   2.4.9. C-12B. The Kingair is a VIP logistics cargo aircraft designed to ferry VIP passengers
   and cargo within CONUS. The C-12 is a specially configured version of the Beechcraft BE-
   20. Weather sensitivities listed in Table 2.8
   2.4.10. C-130T. The Hercules is designed for cargo and passenger transport and for support
   and utility operations from a wide variety of landing environments; from full sized runways
   to small fields and emergency airstrips. Weather sensitivities listed in Table 2.9

Table 2.1. KC-10 Weather Sensitivities.

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

3.1. General. Airfield services specified within this chapter include those actions that affect the
McGuire Field (locally defined as 5.3 miles of the airfield). Examples of airfield services
include weather observations, PMSV, and resource protection. Resource protection, while
considered an airfield services function, can impact the entire installation and is addressed in
Chapter 8. Airfield services workload varies on many factors including equipment,
communications lines status, and current/forecasted weather conditions that drive the local watch
condition.
3.2. Operational Hours. The operational hours are Monday through Friday 0600-2000L,
closed on weekends and federal holidays. Hours of operation can be adjusted to reflect seasonal
weather differences, ie evening thunderstorms. The WF maintains standby personnel during all
closure hours that can be contacted/recalled through the JB MDL Command Post. The WF also
maintains the capability to surge to 24 hour operations as needed based on weather events or
mission as directed by local command authority. Airfield Services are always be available
remotely by the 15 OWS and/or 618 TACC via phone patch. If ATC facilities are closed for
flight operations during a significant weather event, ie winter storm, the WF will continue to
provide weather services.
3.3. Observations. The FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observing System records and
disseminates an official automated weather observation taken at a minimum of one every hour.
Additional observations are made when Special (SPECI) meteorological criteria are met as
outlined in DOD FLIPS and AFMAN 15-111, see Attachment 3 for criteria. The official point
of observation for McGuire Field in automated operation is the primary sensor group and the
approach end sensor data for the active runway (I.e. Wind, Runway Visual Range
(RVR)/Visibility, Clouds) Attachment 8. Weather technicians will adhere to applicable
AFMAN guidance and locally produced SOPs while working closely with ATC under the
Cooperative Weather Watch program to ensure accurate weather observations. See Attachment
5 for assistance with decoding of observation.
   3.3.1. FMQ-19 Supplement Operations. Supplementation is a method of manually adding
   meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the
   automated observing system to detect and/or report.
       3.3.1.1. Weather technicians will supplement observations when the airfield is open and
       the weather conditions in Table 3.1 are observed.
       3.3.1.2. Weather technicians will perform a Basic Weather Watch from the observing
       location and be ready to supplement observations if the conditions in Table 3.1 are
       forecast to occur within 2 hours.
       3.3.1.3. When the Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) is activated, all supplement
       criteria with the exception of Snow Depth will be evaluated either from the Base Weather
       Station (BWS) or from the ROS/AOL. The determination will be made by the ranking
       weather person on-site. The ROS/AOL provides a more advantageous observing location
 34                                                         305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


       but the situation, manning, risk management, and time considerations will be factored
       into the decision to move observing operations from one location to the other.
       3.3.1.4. Weather personnel are required to log on to the (FMQ-19) and be prepared to
       supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic activity.
       3.3.1.5. Normally, snow depth will be evaluated at the Base Weather Station observation
       site for consistency purposes. If snow depth is measured at either observing location
       (ROS or BWS) for an event, it will be measured at that location for the duration of the
       event and/or if new snowfall occurs on top of the original snowfall. (i.e. until new
       snowfall occurs on bare ground)
       3.3.1.6. Weather technicians will only supplement for the criteria listed in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. Mandatory Supplement Criteria For McGuire Field. (Reference AFMAN 15-
111 Table 3.1. Summary Of Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions).

   3.3.2. FMQ-19 Back-up Operations. Back-up is the method of manually providing
   meteorological data and/or dissemination to an AMOS observation when the primary
   automated method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication
   failure. This does not include providing ―back-up‖ for conditions reported by the FMQ-19
   that can be attributed to the systems’ algorithms. (i.e. FMQ-19 reports SCT002 vs. human
   BKN002).
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                    35


       3.3.2.1. Weather technicians will follow duty priorities and provide back-up
       augmentation whenever any or all of the FMQ-19 provided criteria listed in Table 3.2 are
       missing, due to sensor or communication failure. (i.e. if these criteria are not showing up
       in the local or longline observation).
          3.3.2.2. There is no requirement to back-up the system/sensor when the airfield is
          closed, unless tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur, then back-up and
          supplement as necessary.

305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                   37


      3.3.2.3. When the outage is expected to be LESS than 2 hours backup the required
      weather elements from the base weather station observation site outside of bldg 1730.
      3.3.2.4. When the outage is expected to be MORE than 2 hours backup the required
      weather elements from the ROS (Bldg 1608) when operationally possible.
          3.3.2.4.1. Due to the break in service and equipment outage the weather technicians
          will complete and transmit an augmented observation within 15 minutes of arrival at
          the ROS.
      3.3.2.5. When FMQ-19 pressure sensor data is unavailable:
          3.3.2.5.1. LOCAL altimeter setting observations are taken at an interval not to
          exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more
          since the last altimeter setting (ALSTG) value. Any other required observation taken
          within the 35 minute timeframe will meet this requirement (i.e. a scheduled METAR
          or SPECI)
3.4. Observing Limitations.
   3.4.1. Airfield Weather Sensor Limitations. There are no identified limitations with the
   FMQ-19 sensor suites
   3.4.2. Location. Primary manual observing location is across the street and to the right of
   bldg 1730 across street in grass meridian. Due to the weather flight location, building 1730,
   being distanced from the airfield there are significant operational impacts due to surrounding
   buildings and obstructions. Sky condition, visibility, present weather and wind assessments
   cannot always be considered representative of airfield conditions, especially while
   performing FMQ-19 augmentation. To alleviate these limitations the weather flight will
   perform supplemental criteria actions from the alternate observing location, building 1608,
   while considering safety and the need to keep an individual at the weather station to monitor
   the OPUP radar as required; perform back up criteria actions from the alternate observing
   location if the FMQ-19 sensor or communications failure is estimated to last more than two
   hours. For outages estimated to last less than two hours back up criteria actions will be
   performed from the base weather station observing site.
   3.4.3. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor visibility.
   Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise.
   3.4.4. An automated surface observing system (ASOS) is located at the Lakehurst airfield.
   This system is currently fully automated with no augmentation capability available to Navy
   weather personnel located at Lakehurst.
      3.4.4.1. Lightning detection is limited to cloud to ground strikes.
3.5. Local Watch Conditions.
   3.5.1. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW).        The fully functioning FMQ-19 observing
   system performs an automatic CWW and is the standard local watch condition for KWRI.
   During FMQ-19 augmentation, weather personnel will perform a Basic Weather Watch when
   providing back-up due to a FMQ-19 sensor or communications failure.
 38                                                          305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


   3.5.2. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). Establishes the minimum requirements needed to
   ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained while augmenting the FMQ-19.
   Depending on the specific reason for augmentation the BWW may or may not be performed
   in tandem with the FMQ-19 automated CWW, and will be performed from building 1730
   (BWS) or the AOL building 1608 (ROS) located near the air traffic control tower.
       3.5.2.1. BWW established due to supplemental criteria/SWAP.
       3.5.2.2. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at
       intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the
       need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be
       occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
           3.5.2.2.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
           3.5.2.2.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
           3.5.2.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
           3.5.2.2.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
           3.5.2.2.5. Precipitation (any form).
           3.5.2.2.6. Thunderstorms.
           3.5.2.2.7. Fog or Mist.
       3.5.2.3. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will remain
       alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation.
       Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as
       often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect the area of responsibility.
3.6. Cooperative Weather Watch. This is a program wherein qualified non-weather personnel
assist the weather observer in monitoring the weather conditions for the occurrence of previously
unreported weather conditions which could affect flight safety or which could be critical to the
safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources.
   3.6.1. At JB-MDL, a Cooperative Weather Watch is in effect between weather flight and air
   traffic control tower personnel.
   3.6.2. Training is provided through the base weather flight office.
3.7. METWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach for weather personnel to
maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within a designated
area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and updating any forecast products
when pre-established weather conditions or unforecasted changes (timing, location, or forecast
values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site meteorological and commercial
data sources (weather satellite, weather radar, websites, NOAA weather radio, etc.) may be used
to accomplish this task.
   3.7.1. The 15 OWS will perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for JB-MDL. WF
   personnel act as the ―eyes forward‖ for the TACC and 15 OWS by providing immediate
   feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                      39


   3.7.2. 15 OWS will also perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights they
   briefed that are departing from McGuire Field.
   3.7.3. The WF will perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights departing
   McGuire Field that were briefed by WF personnel. Transient missions (cross-country, trans-
   Atlantic, etc) are not considered ―local‖ though the mission’s origins may have started/ended
   at JB-MDL.
3.8. Eyes Forward Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the WF’s role in allowing
for the integration of real-time weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection
readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather picture and
near-term forecast for the OWS.
   3.8.1. The WF provides meaningful meteorological information not contained in the coded
   observations to the TACC and/or 15 OWS at Scott AFB as an integral part of our
   METWATCH process.
   3.8.2. The WF integrates the current state of the atmosphere into an understanding of future
   impacts on forecast conditions and communicates the impacts and information to the TACC
   and/or 15 OWS.
3.9. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV radio during operating hours
on UHF frequency 239.8. Given the one-deep manning of the WF, there will be short periods of
time (physical requirements, etc) where the PMSV will not be continuously monitored.
   3.9.1. The duty forecaster will also monitor PMSV traffic whenever in station during non-
   standard duty hours.
   3.9.2. For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, the WF can provide PMSV
   support via phone patch through the JB MDL Command Post.
   3.9.3. If the PMSV radio becomes inoperable, the WF should make arrangements for
   Langley AFB weather personnel to monitor 239.8 MHz and respond to calls for McGuire
   Field (call-sign McGuire METRO).
3.10. Weather Sensors. (further defined in Chapter 10)
   3.10.1. FMQ-19 - The 87 CS Airfield Systems flight maintains the FMQ-19 at McGuire
   Field IAW applicable technical orders.
   3.10.2. The FMQ-19 observing system is equipped with:
       3.10.2.1. Visibility sensors located at take of/rolling points of runways 18/30 and 24/06
       as well as center point for 24/06.
       3.10.2.2. Temperature and Dew-point Sensor.
       3.10.2.3. Wind Monitor.
       3.10.2.4. Laser Beam Ceilometer (LBC) for cloud height detection
       3.10.2.5. Precipitation Sensor.

                                   MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each customer’s
daily mission(s). The Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) is the primary tool used to
accomplish these tasks. MEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be
anything from a web-based flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast.
Primary mission weather services for all AMC flight operations are controlled through TACC.
The WF will back-up these operations and provide or arrange for transient flight missions
through the 15 OWS as required. Any event, both flying and non-flying, that will be affected by
weather normally requires a MEF to meet the size, scope, and needs of the customer.
4.2. Lead Weather Unit (LWU). Aircrew and weather personnel should use the guidance
provided below to determine the primary weather information provider for those missions or
portions of missions that are not multi-unit tasked. Aircrew and weather personnel should use
Table 4.1 to determine the primary weather information provider of the multi-unit portion of a
particular mission.
   4.2.1. Crews Departing Home Station. These are crews assigned to the 305 AMW, 514
   AMW, and 108 WG. TACC has assumed control as the lead weather unit and provides all
   mission weather services.
   4.2.2. Crews Not Departing Home Station. While off-station (in-transit), aircrew should
   contact the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) assigned with geographic responsibility
   covering the departure location IAW Air Force Visual Aide (AFVA) 15-136, Air Force
   Operational Weather Squadron Area of Responsibility - CONUS, AFVA 15-137, Air Force
   Operational Weather Squadron Area of Responsibility - OCONUS, and the Flight
   Information Handbook Part C. An OWS desires a two-hour notice prior to brief delivery.
   4.2.3. Transient Crews Departing McGuire Field. These crews (Air Force, Army, Navy,
   guard, reserve, civil, and international) should contact the WF or 15 OWS for flight weather
   services. The 15 OWS desires a two-hour notice prior to brief delivery. The McGuire WF
   maintains a set of service instructions within a centralized service area in building 1730 to
   assist transit aircrews during non-duty hours.
   4.2.4. AMC Flight Managed Sorties. All Integrated Flight Management (IFM) sorties also
   receive flight weather information from TACC. Flight managed aircrew should work
   through their assigned flight manager (FM) to resolve weather issues and concerns. A robust
   team of experienced forecasters work directly with FMs in real time on the TACC operations
   center floor. The WF can update T/O weather and provide access to weather information
   products upon request.
  NOTE: Details regarding mission limiting weather must be worked in concert with the
  TACC.

4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). Used by
DoD and NWS weather forecasters to encode and decode forecasts. See Table 4.2 below for an
example TAF. Air Force Pamphlet 11-238, Aircrew Quick Reference to the METAR and TAF
codes, gives instructions on how to decode the TAF. Unless otherwise specified, the forecast
weather elements in the main body of the forecast text (clouds, weather, wind, etc.) apply to the
area within a five statute mile radius of the McGuire Field runway complex. Forecast elements
represent the most probable conditions expected during the forecast period. The term Vicinity
(VC) may be used and normally refers to the area between 5 and 10 statute miles from the center
of the runway.

   4.3.1. The 15 OWS, in coordination with the WF, issues the 24-hour TAF for McGuire Field
   under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier KWRI. TAFs are
   issued three (3) times daily at the following times: 0200 UTC, 1000 UTC, and 1800 UTC.
   4.3.2. TAF Amendments. The 15 OWS and McGuire WF will ensure the TAF is
   representative of expected or actual conditions and will amend the TAF for the criteria listed
   in Attachment 4.
4.4. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). MEFs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using a 12-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129, and may be provided by a
number of methods (web-based, verbally, person-to-person, etc). During this process, the WF
will fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as
information supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedules) and agencies. The end result is a
product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to
various customers by whatever means proves most effective. MEFs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by AFWA and all Operational
Weather Squadrons used to create the MEF. However, during rapidly changing conditions,
emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource protection, the WF will amend the MEF to
accurately reflect conditions and back brief the 15 OWS when time permits.
   4.4.1. Mission Planning. The WF will mount a maximum effort to fuse mission limiting
   weather information into the mission planning process. Information should be focused on
   operational risk management. Mission planners should conduct a risk mitigation evaluation
   that considers both safety and successful mission accomplishment and alter plans as
   necessary and possible to achieve maximum results. Mission weather intelligence integrated

   early into the mission generation cycle can lead to more efficient use of personnel and
   materials.
   4.4.2. Flight MEFs. TACC has the lead for all AMC flight MEFs. The WF maintains
   situational awareness of missions and is prepared to back-up operations as needed. The
   Flight MEF is a unique product incorporating requirements from all McGuire-based flying
   units into a common format in GDSS 2. Navy and Marine units on JB-MDL will leverage
   reach back support to their respective mission services section for flight weather briefing
   similar to the AF process which is through TACC.
       4.4.2.1. Flight MEFs include forecast take-off weather, winds and hazards en-route, air-
       refueling route forecasts, landing weather, and aircraft specific weather elements. In
       addition, space weather products are used to predict performance of HF, UHF, and GPS
       systems in the MEF.
       4.4.2.2. Flight MEFs are developed from information provided by local flying schedules
       (GDSS 2). The forecaster performs a MISSIONWATCH for mission limiting weather at
       McGuire Field, route weather, A/R weather and planned destinations. If weather crosses
       any threshold at any time for any mission, the TACC mission services forecaster will
       notify the crews or, if support is through the WF, the forecaster will notify the JB MDL
       CP who will in turn notify the aircraft commander.
   4.4.3. Space Weather. As provided by Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information
   Network          (JAAWIN)            Space        Weather      products         at
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/main.jsp
   4.4.4. Verbal Brief. Crew members can choose to receive mission weather information
   verbally without the use of GDSS 2, local flying MEF, or Department of Defense (DD) Form
   175-1. In such cases, the WF should maintain a log recording information passed to the crew
   as well as the brief time and crew member initials.
   4.4.5. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide or arrange for
   full flight MEFs and/or updates to traditional DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing to
   aircrews as requested following the flight’s duty priorities listed in Table 1.2 Transient
   briefings can be obtained via the 15 OWS on-line, at the weather flight, or via fax/phone.
4.5. MISSIONWATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which the WF monitors
the weather for all local customer missions. The WF maintains continuous situational awareness
of weather conditions for all AMC mission sorties being planned, executed, and recovered.
Weather conditions may change unexpectedly while sorties are in execution. The WF monitors
conditions over all areas in which their sorties are executing. Whenever conditions change for
the worse and threaten successful mission accomplishment or recovery, the WF will coordinate
with TACC, 15 OWS or local JB MDL CP to notify the affected crews or agencies.
   4.5.1. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources (weather satellite, weather
   radar, websites, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task and is the primary responsibility of
   the duty forecaster. It is through this method that MEF amendments/updates are
   accomplished.
   4.5.2. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend/update the MEF as required.
   4.5.3. Go/No-Go criteria and response actions are outline in chapter 2.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                        45


4.6. Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). The majority of the missions leaving McGuire
Field are TACC controlled Integrated Flight Management (IFM) and local sorties/missions. As
such, TACC Weather will be the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) for these missions. The WF will:
   4.6.1. Update takeoff weather on the IFM and local MEFs as needed.
   4.6.2. Notify the TACC if the takeoff update includes any of the criteria listed in Table 4.3.
   4.6.3. Consult/coordinate with TACC’s LWU as required to resolve any aircrew
   concerns/issues with the IFM Controlling MEF.
   4.6.4. Facilitate discussions between aircrew members and TACC’s LWU to elaborate on
   weather impacts and/or answer aircrew questions. The LWU is the final arbiter for weather
   issues involving IFM and local sorties/missions.

Table 4.3. Weather Criteria Requiring TACC’s LWU Notification.

  Ceiling visibility less than or equal to 200ft/1/2sm (or other published airfield limitations)
  Dry runway crosswind (predominant wind) 25 kt or greater.
  Wet runway crosswind (predominant wind) 20 kt or greater.
  Observed Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS) for all AMC aircraft.
  Predominant thunderstorms on station.
  Freezing participation.
  Moderate (or greater sensitivity) turbulence/icing.
  Forecast or observed volcanic ash or takeoff

4.7. Space Weather Forecast. The WF monitors space weather forecast information provided
by the AF Weather Agency (AFWA). The WF will incorporate space weather forecasts into
MEFs whenever the near earth environment and/or atmospheric conditions pose a mission hazard
due to degradation or loss of communication and/or navigational capability. (See Chapter 6.)

                                            Chapter 6

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations, alerts
and warnings, and products available to WF personnel.
6.2. Limitations. The WF relies on strategic center forecasts to predict space weather. No
indigenous capability exists. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence
space weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space
weather is a lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to
provide lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. JB-MDL’s missions have a wide variety of
parameters that could possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF
communication, radar, GPS Comm, etc).
   6.3.1. Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather products (graphics) are available at
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/spacePages.jsp?region=CONUS.                  These
   alerts/warnings will be provided to aircrew and staff when deemed appropriate (during flight
   briefings, etc). Most space weather products from the strategic center are ―now-casts‖ and/or
   very short-term forecasts (6-hour periods), so the duty forecaster will stay abreast of any
   changes to possible space impacts to operations. Space Weather analysis, alerts, forecasts
   and warnings are listed in Attachment 6.
   6.3.2. Bulletins            are             available             at             JAAWIN:
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/main.jsp. A sample of the daily discussion is
   provided in Figure 6.1. The WF will utilize these products to determine possible impacts to
   JB-MDL operations.

6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN (see links
above). Most Space Weather products from the strategic center are ―now-casts‖ and/or very
short-term forecasts (6-hour periods), so the duty forecaster will check for updated products
whenever preparing and updating a Flight MEF. For more information concerning these
products please contact Air Force Weather Agency Space Weather Operations Center or the WF.

7.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout JB-MDL, and verified by the WF leadership. The requirements will be
reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If the MEF, a watch, warning,
or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement, extra effort will be made
(time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the condition. In turn, the unit is
responsible for contacting the WF should their requirements change.
7.2. JB-MDL/305 AMW/514 AMW CC.
   7.2.1. WF will provide weather briefings at scheduled Senior Staff meetings upon request.

                                           Chapter 8

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 15 OWS and the WF.
The 15 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted products including weather watches and
warnings. The WF acts as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 15 OWS, and is responsible for issuing all
observed warnings and advisories. However, the WF can issue any forecasted warning if there is
an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back brief the 15 OWS
when time permits and will also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies.
Conversely, the WF will act as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The
goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to the joint base.
   8.1.1. Watch, Warning and Advisory Support to McGuire Field/Ft. Dix. The 15 OWS will
   provide watch, warning, and advisory support to McGuire/Dix to include all ranges (up to
   5.3NM). This deviates from the AFMAN 15-129 standard area of no larger than 5 nautical
   miles, due to local requirements.
8.2. Training. The WF will:
   8.2.1. Conduct and document periodic severe weather refresher training for assigned weather
   personnel. This training will leverage products organized by the 15 OWS and should target
   upcoming seasonal forecast and observation techniques, potential threats, and appropriate
   response procedures.
   8.2.2. Assist the installation commander in thoroughly educating base agencies on the
   purpose, applicability, and operating procedures of the weather watch and warning system.
8.3. Terms.
   8.3.1. Severe Thunderstorm. Storms producing tornados, funnel clouds, wind of 50KT or
   greater and/ or hail of 3/4‖ in diameter or larger.
8.4. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5.3 nm radius of the center-point of the McGuire
Field runway complex. Table 8.1. contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times for
McGuire/Dix complex.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                    53

 Moderate Snowfall (> 1/2‖ but < 4‖ in 12 hours)        As potential warrants          Y
 Blizzard                                               As potential warrants          Y
 NOTE 1: DLTs > or < standard lead-times are based on mission requirements specified in the
 unit’s weather support document.
 NOTE 2: Weather watches will not be issued if they have the same lead time as weather
 warnings.
 NOTE 3: Blizzard criteria includes duration > 3 hours, sustained winds/gusts > 30 knots,
 considerable falling and/or blowing snow, with prevailing visibility frequently < ¼ statute
 mile/0400 meters (all criteria must be met).
 NOTE 4: Normally there are two standard hail watches, one for ½ inch and the other for ¾
 inch. Locally they have been combined into one watch for hail ½ inch or greater. Standard
 watch for snowfall is normally issued for greater than 2 inches accumulation in 12-hrs.
 Locally there are no watches for sandstorms, as this phenomenon doesn’t occur locally.
 NOTE 5: SWAP personnel response time will be determined as potential warrants
8.5. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is expected to
occur. Warnings are issued for a 5.3 NM radius of the center-point of the McGuire Field runway
complex. Severe thunderstorms producing tornados, 50kt winds, or large hail will be verified if
the event occurred within 10 NM of the base. Forecasted warnings, with their desired lead-
times, are contained in Table 8.2.

NOTE 1: DLTs > or < standard lead-times are based on KWRI requirements specified in the
unit’s weather support document.
NOTE 2: Warnings/Watches for Sandstorms and Hail (> 3/4‖) are not required per KWRI
requirements.
NOTE 3: Blizzard criteria includes duration > 3 hours, sustained winds/gusts > 30 knots,
considerable falling and/or blowing snow, with prevailing visibility frequently < ¼ statute
mile/0400 meters (all criteria must be met).
NOTE 4: * Denotes change from standard weather warning criteria listed in AMCI 15-101.
Deviations are based on locally coordinated requirements. Normally there are two standard hail
warnings, one for ½ inch and the other for ¾ inch. Locally they have been combined into one
warning for hail ½ inch or greater. Standard warning for snowfall is normally issued for greater
than 2 inches accumulation in 12-hrs. Locally there are no warnings for sandstorms, as this
phenomenon doesn’t occur locally.
8.6. Observed Weather Warnings (IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66, General Industrial
Operations and 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and Activities). Lightning
warnings are only type of observed warning issued for McGuire/Ft Dix. They extend 5.3 nm in
all directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is observed,
either visually or via local lightning detection and web based systems.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                    55


   8.6.1. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred in the area for
   at least 15 minutes. For safety reasons, a lightning warning that is in effect will not be
   cancelled if a thunderstorm is still present within 5nm, as determined by the duty forecaster,
   even if lightning is not present.
   8.6.2. The WF will provide timely notification using the JET notification process to all
   supported units upon issuance and expiration of a lightning warning.
8.7. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice sent to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact operations, is occurring or
forecast to occur on McGuire Field. Weather advisories can be found in Table 8.3

Table 8.3. Weather Advisory Criteria.

8.8. Weather Support to Lakehurst. Forecast Watches and warnings are required to support
Lakehurst on a routine basis. All Watches and warnings will be issued for an area no larger than
a 5 NM radius unless otherwise documented. The 15 OWS issues all Watches and warnings for
Lakehurst Maxfield as defined in Tables 8.4 and 8.5
   8.8.1. Lakehurst Maxfield Weather Watches.

8.9. Weather Alert Processing. Watches, warnings, and advisories will be uniquely numbered.
Lightning warnings will always be issued alone and will not be included as part of another
warning. All other criteria valid at the same time will be contained within one warning or
advisory as applicable.
   8.9.1. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e. winds
   increase from 25 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
   desired lead-times specified above.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                     57


       8.9.1.1. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one time with the exception of
       lightning warnings as it will always be a stand-alone warning.
       8.9.1.2. If a warning is issued for one criterion, and it becomes necessary to warn for
       another criterion, a new warning, with a new number, will be issued immediately to
       include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each criterion, if
       necessary.
       8.9.1.3. Downgrades will follow the same rules outlined above with the exception of
       desired lead times do not apply.
   8.9.2. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
   change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
   warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
   8.9.3. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be canceled when the weather phenomena
   are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at
   the end of the valid period as specified for each criterion. Observed warnings and advisories
   will be canceled when the criteria are no longer occurring.
   8.9.4. Dissemination. The 15 OWS and/or the WF will disseminate forecast watches,
   warnings, and advisories through the JET system or by phone, when necessary, to the JB
   MDL CP and Airfield Management. Weather alerts such as warnings, watches, and
   advisories will be further disseminated by these agencies as directed by locally established
   guidance and checklists.
8.10. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during meteorological
and/or operational events critical to mission success. Criteria for SWAP are outlined in Tables
8.1., 8.2., and 8.3 It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and
advisories are disseminated to all JB-MDL agencies to mitigate risk to personnel and resources.
These procedures document a two-tier system with the WF and the 15 OWS sharing
responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
   8.10.1. WF Responsibilities. Will perform the WF SWAP responsibilities as defined in
   AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, AFMAN 10-206, 15 OWS MOA/Data Sheets, and this
   publication. More specifically, the WF will accomplish the following procedures:
       8.10.1.1. Notification. The duty forecaster will notify the Severe Weather Action Team
       (SWAT) standby member(s) according to the following guidance:
          8.10.1.1.1. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1630 local, Monday through
          Friday, except federal holidays/authorized down days) the duty forecaster will
          implement SWAP by notifying the WF Chief and/or NCOIC whenever one or more
          SWAP conditions outline above and amplified in Table 8.6 below is forecasted.
 58                                                        305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


Table 8.6. Condition Requiring SWAP Notification/Activation.

Condition:
Severe thunderstorms expected within four hours (Tornados, Hail>=1/2‖, and Winds >= 50kts)
OWS issues a severe weather watch for McGuire Field
Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issues a severe weather watch for Burlington County
National Weather Service (NWS) issues a severe weather warning for Burlington County
Notification of CAT activation
Any indication of Winter storm (freezing precipitation, moderate-heavy snow accumulation,
(blizzard)
When any adverse condition is expected to severely degrade operations
          8.10.1.1.2. Standby/Recall Procedures. After duty hours or whenever the WF Chief
          and/or NCOIC are not present in the weather station, the duty forecaster will
          implement SWAP by notifying the WF Chief and/or NCOIC by phone whenever one
          or more SWAP conditions are met to determine if the SWAT needs to be activated.
          8.10.1.1.3. WF leadership may place additional flight members into standby and
          subject to recall depending on the situation. This can occur independently of other
          directed or non-directed personnel posturing within the wing. WF leadership should
          ensure that any active unit recall roster reflects accurate contact information for all
          personnel at all times.
          8.10.1.1.4. Once activated, WF leadership determines who, when, where, and how an
          SWAT will deal with a given situation. Regardless of the approach chosen, WF
          leadership will stand ready to accomplish staff services if called upon. The SWAT
          will remain activated until released or the situation no longer warrants SWAT
          activities.
          8.10.1.1.5. Provide updates to the Crisis Action Team (CAT) as directed or needed
          given the situation.
          8.10.1.1.6. Provide forecasts for Wing/CCs or CAT Director to use when considering
          an "All Clear" once the weather threat has passed.
       8.10.1.2. Activation. The duty forecaster will discuss the meteorological situation,
       manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on standby) with
       the SWAT member.
          8.10.1.2.1. Given the manning construct within the WF, there is only one person
          available for recall, usually the WF Chief or NCOIC. If deemed necessary the SWAT
          member will report to the weather station as soon as possible after notification by the
          duty forecaster.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                  59


        8.10.1.2.2. Once the SWAT member has arrived they will assist in evaluating the
        situation, determine the need/availability to recall additional personnel, and execute
        the SWAT member/team chief duties/responsibilities IAW local procedures until the
        weather event is over.
     8.10.1.3. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREP. The WF will coordinate with the
     JB MDL CP for weather related OPREP-3s and provide the CP any pertinent weather
     information. The CP will provide, upon request, the WF with a copy of any weather
     related OPREPs. The WF will inform the 15 OWS and higher headquarters of damage
     reports and OPREP-3s as soon as possible for their review on SIPRNET SkiWeb at
     https://skiweb.stratcom.smil.mil/ski-web /.
        8.10.1.3.1. OPREP-3/Severe Weather Reporting Procedures. Following an event in
        which one of the following severe elements occurred (wind > 50 knots, hail > ½ inch,
        tornados, lightning strikes, floods, snow storms, and earthquakes) and damage was
        reported, provide information detailed in Attachment 2 to the JB MDL CP.
        8.10.1.3.2. Provide the JB MDL Command Post with the following information
        required for inclusion in any OPREP-3s produced:
            8.10.1.3.2.1. Actual severe weather experienced.
            8.10.1.3.2.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) valid at the time of
            occurrence.
            8.10.1.3.2.3. Any watches, warnings and/or advisories issued to include actual
            and desired lead-time.
            8.10.1.3.2.4. Operational status of meteorological equipment.
        8.10.1.3.3. Notify 15 OWS and AMC/A3W of the OPREP-3s and information
        submitted for inclusion.
        8.10.1.3.4. Request 15 OWS to provide required information, if needed, by
        performing a weather data save.
        8.10.1.3.5. WF will provide the 15 OWS severe weather reports not normally
        available through standard observations. Reports will be passed immediately after
        fulfilling any local distribution requirement. If this is not possible, WF will pass the
        reports as soon as possible so the 15 OWS can use the reports during post-analysis
        and verification.
  8.10.2. 15 OWS Responsibilities. 15 OWS will perform the OWS SWAP responsibilities as
  defined in 15 OWS CONUS Operations Standing Operating Procedure, Severe Weather
  Action Procedures. 15 OWS will accomplish the following procedures when severe weather
  is determined likely:
     8.10.2.1. Activate the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) to include: Floor Manager
     (FM), OPUP Operator, and other required individuals when required.
     8.10.2.2. Unless otherwise stated, have the WF SWAT recalled not later than 4 hours
     before the expected occurrence of severe weather. Be prepared to conduct a
     Meteorological Conference (METCON) with the WF SWAT members when they arrive
     at their base weather station.

      8.10.2.3. Intensify METWATCH.
      8.10.2.4. Review watch/warning criteria for JB-MDL and issue products as required.
      8.10.2.5. If the OWS is acting as the WF, they will provide data to the JB MDL
      Command Post for OPREP reporting purposes. The 15 OWS SWAT leader will perform
      a ―data save‖ and will disseminate (or direct someone to disseminate) the following
      information per AFMAN 10-206, when requested:
          8.10.2.5.1. Actual severe weather conditions experienced.
          8.10.2.5.2. Forecast valid at the time the conditions occurred to include any watches
          or warnings issued.
          8.10.2.5.3. The operational status of meteorological equipment (e.g., radar, wind
          sensors, etc.) at the time of the event.
          8.10.2.5.4. Copy of applicable watches and/or warnings valid at time of occurrence.
          8.10.2.5.5. Reports received highlighting severe weather occurrence within 20nm of
          McGuire Field.
8.11. Hurricane/Tropical Cyclone Support.
   8.11.1. The WF receives the National Hurricane Center (NHC) tropical cyclone forecasts.
   These forecasts are issued as military and public advisories, and include information
   describing the initial and forecast locations, movement, intensity, and horizontal dimensions
   of significant winds. Forecasts, which could change Hurricane Conditions, will be relayed to
   Command Post and/or the Crisis Action Team.
      8.11.1.1. The WF cannot deviate from the official NHC forecast position, track,
      movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity. However, the WF can provide tailored
      weather forecasts for McGuire Field based on the NHC forecast.
      8.11.1.2. The WF will ensure that leadership understands that the 48-hour and 72-hour
      outlooks (or longer if issued) contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning
      purposes only, and are subject to change. This notification will include the forecast error
      probability statements included in the discussion bulletins or on the forecast products.
      8.11.1.3. The tailored forecasts for McGuire Field will be collaborated with the 15 OWS
      in the form of a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product that is posted to the 15
      OWS webpage when a tropical system poses a threat to the 15 OWS AOR.
      8.11.1.4. The WF will inform Wing leadership when the following conditions exist listed
      in paragraph 8.11.2 as well as any updates to tropical cyclone forecasts.

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and advisories)
are useful only if the customers have access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of
weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most
organizations will receive this information via our primary dissemination system. Some
organizations will receive courtesy calls, however, AFIs 15-129 & 10-229 restrict the WF from
directly notifying (via telephone) more than three organizations in order to focus on incoming
weather phenomena. This chapter describes the weather dissemination systems, dissemination
procedures, and back-up systems and procedures.
9.2. Dissemination Systems and Back-ups.
   9.2.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). Currently the WF uses JET as its primary method
   of disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories. The JET system consists of a JET server
   that is accessible via the base LAN IP address. Primary access and dissemination runs
   through the CP and Airfield Management who will then notify the agencies as directed by
   locally established guidance and checklist. Agencies without JET should receive critical
   weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g. Pyramid Alert
   Recall, Unit Control Center, etc). The WF will follow locally documented backup
   dissemination procedures in the event that JET server is inoperative.
   9.2.2. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for disseminating
   web-based MEFs. Additionally, it is used as the backup system for disseminating (longline
   only) and receiving all weather information. In the event of a LAN outage, web-based MEFs
   will be faxed to requestors or may be verbally updated.
   9.2.3. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between WF and other agencies for the sole
   purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the event of
   a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the WF and the following agencies:
       9.2.3.1. JB MDL Command Post.
       9.2.3.2. Airfield Management.
       9.2.3.3. Secondary CRASH Net
   9.2.4. Climatic Data Requests. Upon request from an authorized agency (as deemed
   appropriate by flight leadership and 87 ABW/PA), provide climatology data for McGuire
   Field and other locations. Requests may be made by phone, e-mail, letter, or in person.
9.3. Dissemination and Backup Procedures.
   9.3.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Weather watches, warnings, and
   advisories will be disseminated via the JET (phone, email, and/or fax) to the JB MDL CP and
   Airfield Management where it will be disseminated. Confirmation of contact can be
   ascertained by the system and are monitored by the 15 OWS. If the JET server is out of
   service, the WF or 15 OWS will call CP and Airfield Management to pass information.
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                63


   9.3.2. The WF will provide ATC personnel ahead of all other locally identified agencies
   with a the observation if the FMQ-19 automated sensor is inoperable. ATC personnel can
   also call the automated observing system at 754-1402 in LAN capabilities prevent viewing of
   observations.
9.4. Tornado Warnings. The JB MDL CP has the primary responsibility for sounding the base
siren in the event of a tornado warning issuance.

                                          Chapter 10

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
10.2. Meteorological Equipment. The official weather observation at McGuire Field is taken
by an FMQ-19 automated observing system, Attachment 8, and augmented by a certified 305
OSS weather observers who ensures the accuracy of the observations during system outages,
failures, or extreme weather conditions outside the ability of the equipment to report. The WF
uses the FMQ-19, Automated Observing System, as the primary system to determine the current
state of the atmosphere. This critical system is used continuously to provide customers the most
timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible. The following is a list of the
meteorological sensors used by the WF:
   10.2.1. FMQ-19. The following is a breakdown of the sensors on the FMQ-19:
       10.2.1.1. FMQ-19 - Visibility Sensor. McGuire’s runways are equipped with visibility
       instruments that determine a prevailing visibility in statute miles for the airfield and
       Runway Visual Range (RVR) value in hundreds of feet at the touchdown, center-line,
       and rollout points of runway 24/06 as well as the touchdown and rollout ends of runway
       18/36. Readings are available once each minute. A ten-minute average value is used for
       each METAR or SPECI report. The backup for visibility is a set of predetermined
       distance markers that can be visibly spotted from the ROS.
       NOTE: There is no backup for RVR. Technicians encode RVRNO on surface weather
       observations to indicate when the transmissometers are not operating.
       10.2.1.2. FMQ-19, Temperature and Dew-point Sensor. The operating range for this
       system is -40°C to +60°C (-40°F to +140°F); 0 to 100% relative humidity. Temperature
       and dew point readings are available every minute. In actuality, dew point is not sensed.
       The system uses relative humidity to compute a dew point. The backup for this sensor is
       an AF approved hand-held digital thermometer.
       10.2.1.3. FMQ-19, Wind Monitor. Anemometers with a survivable range up to 220mph
       are located on 10M poles at the touchdown and rollout ends of each runway. A two-
       minute average wind direction and wind speed value are calculated every 5 seconds to
       indicate the mean wind character. Backup for this instrument is an AF approved hand-
       held anemometer.
       NOTE: Whenever the handheld anemometer is used, wind readings will be reported as
       estimated.
       10.2.1.4. FMQ-19, Laser Beam Ceilometer (LBC). Sensor readings are processed into a
       single estimate of cloud height and amount. Samples are taken every 30 seconds. Each
       minute the readings over the last 30 minutes get tabulated. The greatest weight is placed
       on those readings taken in the last 30 minutes. The LBC then produces readouts for
       cloud base height and the amount of sky cover for up to three detected layers. The
       operating range is up to 25,000 feet. This sensor produces different results for sky cover
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                   65


      than a human observer. The ceilometer time-averages clouds overhead the sensor. The
      human observer can assess from horizon to horizon at one viewing. Thin cloud layers
      may fail to return the laser beam and not be detected. The backup for the LBC is a hand-
      held laser range finder (LRF). Weather technicians should coordinate with McGuire
      ATC agencies prior each operation of this device.
      10.2.1.5. FMQ-19, Precipitation Sensor. The precipitation sensor can detect and report
      liquid, freezing, and frozen precipitation. The sensor melts any freezing or frozen
      precipitation to determine the actual accumulation of water. To ensure accurate
      measurements of freezing or frozen events, weather technicians must request that system
      maintainers remove the protective screen over the collector cup prior to event start. The
      backup for this sensor is the Rain Gauge located near Bldg. 1730 and 1608.
      10.2.1.6. FMQ-19, Pressure Sensor. The pressure sensor measures and records
      atmospheric pressure and pressure change tendency. Results are given for altimeter
      setting, pressure altitude, and sea level pressure. Backup for this instrument is an AF
      approved hand-held barometer.
      NOTE: Whenever the handheld barometer is used, pressure readings are reported as
      estimated.
      10.2.1.7. FMQ-19, Lightning Detection System (LDS).            The LDS detects and
      differentiates between cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning out to a range of
      30NM. Strikes are displayed over a horizon circle and color coded to represent age of the
      strike out to 30 minutes. The backup to this system is Web-based lightning detection
      produced by AFWA. While using this backup, only cloud-to-ground strikes may be
      detected.
   10.2.2. Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D). The National network of
   WSR-88D’s, also known as NEXRAD, is operated under a tri-agency agreement between the
   Departments of Commerce, Defense and Transportation. The local WSR-88D acquisition
   unit (antenna) is located 8 miles southeast of McGuire proper on Ft Dix. Data from the
   network of WSR-88D’s can be manipulated and displayed within building 1730 on a
   dedicated user processor or from any location using the Web. Manipulation of information
   via the Web is limited. Additionally, all radars suffer from a ―cone of silence‖ near the
   antenna. Within this zone, the mechanical working of the antenna does not allow for full
   coverage which results in an inability to detect targets.
   10.2.3. Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR). The SODAR is located near building 1608
   on the airfield complex. This device provides a vertical reading of winds over the airfield in
   50M increments up to a height of 500M. WF personnel can use the SODAR display
   whenever low level wind shear is occurring or expected to occur. At times, ambient airfield
   noise or very strong wind noise will degrade SODAR’s vertical range.
10.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment,
communications equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the right customer.
The following systems are the backbone of the WF communications network.
   10.3.1. JET. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is our primary system for disseminating
   warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup for key agencies.
 66                                                         305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011


   10.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (239.8 MHz) allows the WF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying. If the PMSV is out of service
   aircrews can contact the 15 OWS via phone patch (where possible), the WF via phone patch,
   and/or the following locations:
   10.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as backup system as well as
   for passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
   10.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the local area network to improve the timeliness and
   accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. Much information can be obtained
   through other methods (e.g. satellite imagery, lightning data, etc.) but is far less efficient.
10.4. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance. Table 10.1 outlines
organizations that provide preventive maintenance/repair of weather and communications
equipment:

87 CS (Help Desk 754-2666)                               LAN/Internet Connectivity
10.5. Restoring Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in the
event natural disasters, or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact systems base-wide.
Significant indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative while minimal
means the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in
Table 10.2 below (priorities may be adjusted based on incoming weather).

10.6. Building Power. Bldg 1730 and the AOL bldg 1608 are equipped with back-up
generators. The generator is expected to restore power instantaneously in the event commercial
power is lost. CE performs quarterly tests to ensure the generator is working properly.
10.7. Outages. Notify ATC first then maintenance immediately should an outage occur. For
outages of all primary fixed equipment (e.g. PMSV, etc.), a NOTAM (Notice To Airman) will be
issued through airfield management for all outages expected to last greater than 2 hours.

                                          Chapter 11

                               OWS/WF BACK-UP SUPPORT

11.1. 15 OWS Outages. The 15 OWS is heavily dependent upon communication and
communication equipment; therefore, the 15 OWS is susceptible to a multitude of system
outages that could cause a wide range of changes in mission capability. The 15 OWS has
established back-up procedures that are flexible and designed to meet the requirements identified
in AFMAN 15-129.
11.2. Three-Tier Back-Up Support. IAW AFMAN 15-129 the 15 OWS will back-up the
following products and services in prioritized order: Tier 1. Wartime, Contingencies, Military
Operations Other Than War and Force Protection; Tier 2. Peacetime and Exercise Operations;
and Tier 3. Mission Planning, products and services.
   11.2.1. Minimum Planned Actions for Each Tier (All Tiers 1-3). The 15 OWS will ensure
   contact with all WFs, primarily via telephone.
       11.2.1.1. The 15 OWS will hand-off TAF, watch, warning, and advisory support and
       Flight Weather Briefing responsibilities (including transient crews at that location) to
       supported WFs.
       11.2.1.2. The 15 OWS forecasters will maintain close coordination with WFs via
       telephone, when feasible and when weather information is available, to aid in TAF
       METWATCH, WW/WA and Flight Weather Briefing support.
   11.2.2. Short-term/Long-term outages. For outages less than 72 hours, the WF and/or
   AFWA will temporarily assume the responsibility of NE CONUS support. For outages less
   than 72 hours, the 25 OWS and 26 OWS will temporarily assume the responsibility of NE
   CONUS Points locations. For outages greater than 72 hours, the 15 OWS will deploy
   personnel to a designated 1st Weather Group location to begin limited operations/support to
   include graphics products, Senior Duty Officer analyses/bulletins, DD Form 175-1, Flight
   Weather Briefings and assume NE CONUS Points locations support.
11.3. Alternate Sources of Weather Information. The 15 OWS has established a back up
support agreement with all 1st Weather Group CONUS OWSs. Alternate 15 OWS websites,
which         contain       a      select     package      of        key       products:
(https://25ows.dm.af.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=main&UID=&BW=H&UF=M&AOR=2&U
SEHF=1). Additionally, supported units may access JAAWIN or the National Weather Service
websites for weather products.
11.4. Contact with WFs. When the 15 OWS implements back-up procedures due to mission
capability loss/degradation, it will contact each WFs primary 24-hour POC or alternate if
necessary and provide a brief description of the problem(s) and impacts. The 15 OWS will also
notify WFs when mission capability is restored.
11.5. Outages at the WF. When an outage in weather operations occurs, the WF will notify the
15 OWS. The WF will request backup support as needed to meet mission requirements.
   11.5.1. Alternate Operating Location. The WF will notify the 15 OWS in case of
   evacuation/relocation to an AOL and again immediately upon arrival at the AOL. The WF
305AMWI15-101 4 AUGUST 2011                                                                 69


  will also identify any changes to the watch, warning, and advisory dissemination procedures.
  The WF AOL is located in building 1608 on McGuire proper. The AOL phone number is
  DSN 650-0033/0034 and fax is DSN 650-1469.
  11.5.2. Operational Impacts at AOL. Expect services to be somewhat degraded (weather
  products, pilot briefings, etc) due to remoteness of the AOL facilities and loss of dedicated
  radar data services. The WF will have access to JET and Local Area Network at the AOL,
  allowing the WF to issue any required watches, warnings, and advisories and also limited
  web-based access the local radar. In the interest of flight safety, the WF will not evacuate
  building 1730 for extended periods during exercises and simulations while flight operations
  are occurring.

while another is in progress (e.g., snow changing to rain or snow).
A3.2. LOCAL criteria.
    A3.2.1. When FMQ-19 pressure sensor data is unavailable a LOCAL altimeter setting
    observations are taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change
    of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG value. Any other required
    observation taken within the 35 minute timeframe will meet this requirement (i.e. a
    scheduled METAR or SPECI)

             FORECAST SPECIFICATION AND AMENDMENT CRITERIA

A4.1. TAF Amendment and Specification.
   A4.1.1. Individual elements in the TAF will be forecast as accurately as the state of the art
   allows. As a minimum, TAFs (scheduled or amended) will specify time of occurrence to the
   nearest hour (and minute as appropriate), the duration, and intensity of the standard criteria
   listed in Table 4.1
   A4.1.2. TAF-coded forecast products will be amended for the standard criteria and
   conditions listed in Table 4.1
   A4.1.3. Currently only McGuire Field has a TAF being produced. See Attachment 6 for
   assistance understanding TAF code.

                                       NOTES:
                                       1. Forecast category is determined by the lower ceiling or
                                       visibility value.
                                       2. Use surface visibility to determine forecast category.
                                       3. Substitute the lowest published airfield minimum for
                                       Ceiling/Visibility category A.
Surface Winds                          Wind Speed: The difference between the predominant
                                       wind speed (or gust) and the forecast wind speed (or gust)
                                       is 10 knots or more.
                                       Wind Direction: a change > 30 degrees when the
                                       predominant wind speed or gusts are expected to be over 15
                                       knots.

 SAMPLE WEATHER PRODUCT DISSEMINATION FORMAT/INTERPRETATION

A5.1. Observations.
   A5.1.1. Station identifier – also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
   observation (in this case KWRI for Joint Base McGuire-Dix and KNEL for Lakehurst).
   A5.1.2. Type of observation. There are three types of observations as described below:
      A5.1.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). An observation taken each
      hour, between H+55 and H+59.
      A5.1.2.2. Special Observation (SPECI). An observation taken as a result of one of the
      special criteria (listed in attachment 3) being met.
      A5.1.2.3. Local Observation (LOCAL). An observation taken as a result of one of the
      local weather criteria (listed in Attachment 3) being met.
   A5.1.3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, or GMT, that the last element of the observation
   was observed.
   A5.1.4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers,
   VRB for variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind
   gusts (any numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot
   equals 1.14 miles per hour.
   A5.1.5. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) that
   can be seen from the airfield, reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported
   is 7 miles.
   A5.1.6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
   mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A5.1 below lists the present
   weather codes.

A5.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   A5.2.1. The forecast follows the same general format as the observation with the following
   exceptions:
      A5.2.1.1. Valid Date/Time. Forecasts are generally valid for a 24-hour period. In this
      example the forecast is valid from the 24st at 1400 Zulu (or GMT) until the 25d at 1000
      Z.
      A5.2.1.2. Max Temp/Min Temp. TXX/XXZ group indicates a maximum temperature of
      22 in degrees Celsius to occur at 20Z. The second TXX/XXZ group indicates a
      minimum temperature of -1 in degrees Celsius to occur at 09Z. Note: M indicates a
      minus sign in front of the number: M01 = -1 C).
      A5.2.1.3. BECMG – This is a code to indicate that the predominant condition of the sky
      will change to (or become) the conditions listed in that line of the forecast. The
      conditions will change during the time period that follows the BECMG code (1600 to
      1700 Z or 1900 to 2000Z in the example).
      A5.2.1.4. TEMPO – This code means that the conditions listed on that line may occur for
      periods of an hour or less (an hour and 15 minutes or less for thunderstorms) anytime
      between the time frame following the TEMPO code (2000Z to 2200Z in this example).
