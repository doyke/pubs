1.2. 59 MDW Provider Prescriptions. IAW AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, and
local policy, authorized providers must use electronic order entry for prescriptions whenever
available, regardless of their WHASC duty location. AF Form 781, Multiple Item Prescription
using blue or black ink, should be used when requesting non-formulary medications or during
times when electronic systems are unavailable/down. When using AF Form 781, the practitioner
shall complete patient information, such as patient’s full name and date of birth, family member
 6                                                       59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


prefix (FMP), sponsor’s social security number (SSN), and the provider’s stamped or printed
information. Providers line through unused areas of the prescription form to discourage
alterations. Providers do not rewrite prescriptions from civilian providers without first
evaluating the patient to determine if the requested medication is medically required. IAW AFI
44-102 providers may NOT prescribe any medications for themselves or controlled substances
for family members.
     1.2.1. Not processed or (NP) labels from the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service are usually
     created when one of the following problems exist: invalid or incorrect national drug code
     number; invalid or incorrect provider identification (ID) number; or invalid or incorrect
     cardholder ID. When a “NP” label is printed in an outpatient pharmacy, the pharmacy will
     try to ascertain and correct the problem and re-send. If the patient is ineligible based on
     Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System check, the patient will be referred to the
     Military Personnel Flight. Clinical or drug therapy questions will be referred to the provider
     or pharmacist on duty. Patients not usually eligible for care (i.e. treated under a
     memorandum of understanding or civilian emergency) will have prescriptions filled with
     labels identified as “NP”. Generally, refills for these patients are not authorized.
1.3. Civilian Provider Prescriptions. Pharmacy recommends patients request prescriptions be
written for generic drugs or have the practitioner sign the prescription above the "Product
Selection Permitted" line. When practitioners write “brand necessary” or “brand medically
necessary” we cannot fill the prescription if a generic is available.
1.4. Veterans Administration (VA) Prescriptions. VA prescription forms identified as “to be
filled at VA facility only” are accepted from DoD eligible patients.
1.5. Prescription Transfers. Prescriptions from other MTFs may be transferred in accordance
with the guidelines in AFI 44-102, chapter 9 and applicable federal and state laws. Patients
should be informed transfers may take up to 72 hours to complete and the prescription will be
cancelled at the location from which it was transferred. Controlled medication prescriptions may
be transferred once from another MTF before the expiration of the prescription.
1.6. Veterinary Prescriptions. Limited to military working dogs only.
1.7. Pre-packaged After Hours Dispensing. Pre-Packaged after hours dispensing is limited to
Trainee Health Clinic, Camp Bullis dispensary drug cabinets, the Urgent Care Clinic, and the
559th Aeromedical Staging Facility. Pre-packaged drugs are labeled to identify the drug,
strength, quantity, pre-pack lot number and expiration date with needed auxiliary labels. Blanks
on the labels must be filled in to give the patient with provider names and dosage instructions.
Dispensing is always done by a privileged provider or IDMT, and includes patient counseling.
The provider will use CHCS POE to document prescribing and profile review before dispensing,
for each medication issued to a patient.
1.8. Prescription Quantities. Prescriptions for all categories of drugs may be written for up to
a 90-day supply. Refills for non-controlled drugs are normally allowed up to one year;
controlled drugs are refillable to the full extent allowed by federal law. In accordance with AFI
44-102 active duty military members may receive the amount needed for the duration of the
deployment, plus transit time, unless there are unusual bulk or storage requirements. Schedule II
medication limits will not be changed by this policy and will be filled according to federal laws.
Deploying members should be educated that during extended deployments of greater than 180
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                     7


days, re-supply of these medications should be obtained via the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy
program (more information is available at http://www.express-scripts.com/). Refills may not
be available through in-theater pharmacy assets.
1.9. Patient Representatives. Prescriptions are generally not released to individuals
representing the patient unless specific conditions are met. IAW AFI 44-102, chapter 9,
paragraph 9.4.2, patients may authorize adult third parties to pick up prescriptions on their behalf
if the patient has identified, either verbally or in writing, a family member, other relative,
personal friend or any other person authorized to pick up prescriptions OR the patient is not
present to give consent and the health care provider uses his/her professional judgment to
determine if it is in the patient’s best interest to provide the prescription to the patient’s
representative. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations also permit the
conveyance of limited protected health information to the patient’s representative (such as taking
the medication on an empty stomach but not disclosing that the medication is for the treatment of
a particular condition).
1.10. Refills. 59 MDW personnel shall refer patients to the automated pharmacy call-in system
to obtain prescription refills. Patients requiring refills should use the automated call-in refill
system by calling 292-9995 locally, or 1-800-460-7170 if outside the local calling area. Patients
may also utilize the TRICARE online pharmacy refill service available from within the
TRICARE Online (TOL) website. TOL provides secure, real-time, web-based access 24/7 to the
MHS prescription refill system.
   1.10.1. When a patient does not have a current refill, they will be directed to their primary
   care manager (PCM) or the clinic that prescribed the medication and not the UCC.
       1.10.1.1. TRICARE Enrolled Patients. For patients enrolled to an MTF in the greater
       San Antonio area, direct the patient to schedule an appointment with their PCM or the
       prescribing provider/clinic through the central appointment management office (CAMO)
       appointment line at 210-916-9900. When a prescription renewal is needed before an
       appointment is available (i.e. the patient will run out of medication), instruct patients to
       call the CAMO line and leave a message. The provider should then input a prescription
       into CHCS to supply the drug until either an appointment is available or the appropriate
       routine follow-up is indicated.
           1.10.1.1.1. For TRICARE enrollees from MTFs outside of San Antonio or with a
           civilian PCM where the prescription is from their PCM, direct them to contact their
           PCM for renewal procedures. If they received the prescription from a specialty clinic
           at WHASC, have them follow the procedure described above in section 1.10.1.1.
       1.10.1.2. Non-enrolled Patients. If the patient received the prescription from a specialty
       clinic at WHASC, have them follow the procedure outlined in section 1.10.1.1. Primary
       care appointments are NOT available for non-enrolled patients. They should be directed
       to the Beneficiary Counselors located at 1E14 to review their options.
       1.10.1.3. Refills through the UCC. When patients determine their refill needs constitute
       an emergency, they have the option of going to the UCC or to a civilian provider. Use of
       the UCC is clearly not the correct method of obtaining routine refills, and patients should
       not be automatically directed to the UCC. When a patient presents to the UCC for refills,
       they are evaluated the same as any other patient.
 8                                                       59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


        1.10.1.4. Pharmacist. Emergency continuation of therapy may be provided if, in the
        pharmacist’s judgment, it is deemed that an emergency situation exists or failure to refill
        the prescription might result in an interruption of a therapeutic regimen, create a negative
        health impact or patient suffering. An emergency continuation of therapy refill only
        applies to non-controlled medications.
1.11. Enteral Feeding. Outpatient enteral feeding products are food supplements, and are not
normally supplied by pharmacy. When enteral feedings are used as the primary source of
nutrition, TRICARE and Medicare may cost-share medically necessary supplies and products.
Reference the TRICARE Policy Manual 6010.54-M, chapter 8, section 7.1, available online at
http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/. The process to request and order this service is outlined in
section 1.11.1 below. Providers with patients with inborn errors of metabolism may request 59
MDW Pharmacy supply the food product per section 1.11.3 below. Herbal medications and
nutritional supplements are addressed in section 2.2.11.1.
     1.11.1. For TRICARE and TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, the provider will enter the
     request into the CHCS Consult Order Entry module. The consult type is durable medical
     equipment (DME). The following information is required in order to process the request:
        1.11.1.1. Diagnosis.
        1.11.1.2. Product (e.g. Ensure®, Vivonex®, Peptamen®).
        1.11.1.3. Indication (e.g. malabsorption, life sustaining, medically necessary).
        1.11.1.4. History of present illness and past medical history.
        1.11.1.5. Provider phone and/or beeper number.
        1.11.1.6. Patient/care-giver phone number.
     1.11.2. When the provider has completed the consult order, the DME consult order will be
     sent to the WHASC Consult Management Office (CMO) in-box for further processing and to
     set up the services. CMO staff may engage additional Medical Management Flight personnel
     such as case/utilization managers to assist in the arrangements and service authorization.
     Feedback to the ordering provider will be accomplished through the CHCS consult order
     module.
     1.11.3. For products that are not a TRICARE covered benefit, providers may request that the
     59 MDW Pharmacy supply the product. To further pursue obtaining the product for patients,
     include an assessment from Nutritional Medicine supporting the patient’s need for this
     particular product. Also include a letter from a social worker evaluating the financial impact
     on the family purchasing this product. Send a letter to the Chief of the Medical Staff (59
     MDW/SGH) requesting that the 59 MDW Pharmacy dispense the outpatient enteral nutrition
     product. Include the endorsements (consult, dietary support, social services support) as
     attachments. The Chief of the Medical Staff makes the final determination if 59 MDW
     provides the product. If 59 MDW/SGH approves this request, pharmacy will require a
     written prescription. Advise the patient that pharmacy logistics personnel (292-5400) need a
     minimum of three days advance notice before dispensing the product to allow logistics
     personnel to procure the item(s). If 59 MDW/SGH disapproves the request, it becomes the
     responsibility of the patient or family to obtain the enteral product(s).
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                    9


1.12. Compounded Products. Compounding is limited to agents listed in the DoD
Compounding Guide and agents for which WHASC pharmacy has a valid recipe/formulation
complete with stability and, if required, sterility data. Aseptic technique will be utilized,
depending on the product, and the accuracy of the product will be ensured by the pharmacy staff,
including a visual inspection of the medication’s integrity. Additional guidance may also be
found in AFI 44-102, Chapter 9. Formulary compounded items require 48-72 hours for
processing initial and refill prescriptions. Providers requiring specialty non-formulary
compounding should coordinate their requirements through the Clinical Support pharmacy. If
specialty compounding requires procurement through an outside source the item may not be
readily available for 5-7 days.
1.13. Treatment of Minors. In accordance with AFI 44-102 the MTF commander must comply
with local state laws governing consent for medical treatment of minors to the extent that those
laws are in compliance with applicable federal guidelines and/or case law. Treatment, which
includes prescription needs, is defined in 59 MDWI 44-121, Treatment of Minors and aligns with
Texas Family Code, Chapter 32, section 32.003. A minor permitted to consent to treatment per
59 MDWI 44-121 and Texas Family Code, section 32.003, may pick up a prescription related to
that treatment. IAW AFI 33-332 Air Force personnel may disclose the medical records of
minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable Federal laws and
guidelines. The age of majority in Texas is 18 years.
1.14. Injectable Medications. Injectable medications that require special preparation prior to
administering, have questionable stability after opening, require special education/training in
order to administer or pose considerable danger to the patient if self-administered, will not be
dispensed directly to patients. Notably, some patients are very well versed in administration (i.e.
hemophiliac patients) of special products. The decision to dispense is at the discretion of the
pharmacist in charge.
1.15. Discharge Controlled Prescriptions Returned to Pharmacy. Nurses/providers are
authorized to pick up discharge medications from the Urgent Care Pharmacy. Sometimes after
the medications are picked up, it is later decided that the patient cannot be discharged with that
medication. The nurse/provider may return the controlled medication which was provided by a
WHASC pharmacy, to the Urgent Care Pharmacy for destruction using a DD Form 1150,
Request for Issue or Turn-In. Pharmacy staff will count the returned medication in front of the
person returning it, document the count on the form and have that person sign and date the form.
Pharmacy staff will also sign and date the form and turn in for destruction. Other previously
dispensed patient medication which has left the facility may not be returned to the pharmacy.

                         AMBULATORY SURGERY PHARMACY

2.1. Scope of Service. Provides comprehensive pharmacy services in support of same day
surgery providers and nursing personnel. Provides unit-dose distribution of medications and
sterile product preparation. Prepares, distributes, and controls all drugs used in the operating
room (OR) suites and the Post Anesthesia Care Unit. Open 0600-1800 hours Monday through
Friday, closed weekends, federal and AETC designated holidays
2.2. Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy Policies.
   2.2.1. A diagnosis, condition, or indication for each as needed (PRN) should be clearly
   articulated (example: acetaminophen 325 mg every 4 to 6 hours prn pain scale 1 to 3 of 10
   and Vicodin® 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours prn pain scale 4 to 6 of 10).
       2.2.1.1. Actions will be taken to clarify orders that are incomplete, illegible, or unclear.
       As applicable, Pharmacy personnel will contact:
           2.2.1.1.1. The nurse for assistance in getting a provider’s order clarified.
           2.2.1.1.2. The ordering provider if the nurse cannot be contacted.
           2.2.1.1.3. The physician on-call for the service if the prescribing provider is
           unavailable.
           2.2.1.1.4. The attending staff physician for unresolved issues/concerns.
           2.2.1.1.5. Either a new order will be accomplished, or the procedures outlined in
           section 2.2.3 will be followed.
   2.2.2. “STAT” orders are those of sufficient criticality that a delay in receipt/administration
   of the medication would result in harm to the patient. Provider marks the order as “stat”
   using the appropriate function key in Essentris. The pharmacy gives these “stat” orders the
   highest priority.
   2.2.3. Verbal orders are only used in emergency situations. If such an emergency is the case,
   each telephone change is immediately recorded (written down), then read back to the
   provider for confirmation. When the pharmacy is using Essentris the order is annotated as a
   telephoned order and read back (documented as R.B.), electronically signed, dated and timed
   by the individual recording the order. The original corrected telephone order is stored in
   Essentris system for inclusion into the patient’s chart. Providers always sign telephoned
   orders within 24 hours. Orders written by medical residents will be countersigned by a
   licensed provider.
   2.2.4. When patients are transferred, orders must be reviewed for appropriateness and
   completely rewritten. An order to “continue all medications as previously ordered” is not
   appropriate and will not be accepted. Please refer to paragraph 2.2.12 for guidance on the
   use of the Medication Reconciliation List (MRL) during transfers. See also 59 MDWI 44-
   130, Patient Safety and AFPD 44-1, Medical Operations for additional guidance on the
   National Patient Safety Goals.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                11


  2.2.5. Range orders must specify an indication, dose, and frequency (ex. promethazine 25mg
  IM q4h prn nausea/vomiting) and may include a dosing interval range (ex. not to exceed “x”
  milligrams every 4-6 hours for fever). Generally, the lowest possible dose should be given to
  achieve the desired result. Orders will be written with only one range instead of two (i.e.
  25mg po every 4-6 hours prn pain or 50 mg every 4-6 hours prn pain instead of 25-50 mg po
  every 4-6 hours prn pain). Documentation of administration includes an assessment of the
  effect produced by the medication.
     2.2.5.1. Titration orders (orders in which the dose is progressively increased or decreased
     in response to the patient’s status) may be used. The provider will write the parameters
     by which the nurse titrates the medication to achieve the desired result (ex. pain relief).
     The nurse will document the dose actually given “at each time given” on the AF Form
     3068, PRN Medication Administration Record or AF Form 3069, Medication
     Administration Record. If the nurse determines the desired outcome cannot be achieved
     within the parameters of the given titration order, the nurse will contact the provider for
     new titration guidelines/orders.
     2.2.5.2. Taper orders (orders in which the dose is decreased by a particular amount with
     each dosing interval) may be used. The provider will write specific dose or interval
     changes in the taper order for the nurse to follow, including when the taper should be
     completed. The nurse will document the dose given on the AF Form 3069.
  2.2.6. When "Hold" is used in a medication order, the staff member administering
  medications is responsible for ensuring a clear understanding of the intent of the order. The
  hold order should clearly indicate the reason for holding the dose (ex. “NPO after midnight”
  or “hold drug A if temperature is below B degrees”) and what is to be done with that
  particular medication following the held dose (ex. “hold the next AM dose only” or “hold
  drug X until procedure Y completed). The staff member administering medications is
  responsible as well for documenting the held dose and contacting the provider for guidance if
  there are any questions.
  2.2.7. Automatic stop orders are not used within the ambulatory surgery center except when
  patients are transferred, at which time all orders are stopped.
  2.2.8. Investigational medications are addressed in section 4.6.
  2.2.9. Like other prescriptions, air evacuation prescriptions are signed by privileged
  providers and dispensed by pharmacy as outpatient prescriptions. Clinic stock drugs are not
  used for these purposes.
  2.2.10. Instructions regarding the safe and effective use of medication are documented in the
  patient's electronic chart. These instructions may be given to the patient by pharmacy,
  nursing or medical staff members.
  2.2.11. Medications brought into the facility by same-day surgery patients are not usually
  administered. When this happens, the family/escorts are informed that this practice is not
  allowed. The medications are given to the patient’s family to take home. Nurses are not
  permitted to maintain or store these items. An exception is allowed when a patient is
  admitted with a needed non-formulary drug in hand. The provider documents approval to
  use the patient’s drug supply. The provider will write an order specifying the drug, dosage,
 12                                                    59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


   route, and frequency in the electronic chart. Medications brought into the facility by
   Aeromedical Staging Facility patients are authorized if prescribed by the provider.
      2.2.11.1. Herbal medications and nutritional supplements are not stocked or dispensed
      within the ambulatory surgery center and will not be special ordered for outpatients
      [IAW AFI 44-102, paragraph 10.4.1., “Pharmacies procure, dispense, recommend or use
      only drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)”]. Enteral food
      products are addressed in Section 1.11.
   2.2.12. Medication Reconciliation List is a complete list of patient medications generated
   upon check-in to the WHASC at the beginning of each episode of care. The generation of
   the list triggers a process with the involvement of the patient and a medical staff member to
   do a comparison of the medications the organization provides to those on the list. The MRL
   should accurately and completely reconcile medications across the continuum of care.
   Medications include: prescription drugs, vitamins, nutraceuticals, herbal medications, over
   the counter (OTC)s, diagnostic and contrast agents, radioactive medications, respiratory
   therapy-related medications, parenteral nutrition, blood derivatives, intravenous solutions,
   and any product designated by the FDA as a drug.
      2.2.12.1. When checking in a patient, the staff member will query CHCS or Armed
      Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and print out a
      medication reconciliation list. With patient (or designee) input, the staff member will
      take a complete medication history to obtain and/or update medications the patient is
      currently taking including prescriptions filled off base. Attempt to obtain the name, dose,
      route, frequency, and purpose of all newly identified medications. An emphasis should
      be made to inquire about any previously prescribed medication that may still be available
      to the patient. If any are identified, the patient should be counseled to dispose of them.
      Reconcile the MRL by indicating which medications the patient is to continue taking,
      circle “yes” or “no” for each medication on MRL to indicate if the medication will be
      continued. The provider must update CHCS/AHLTA by discontinuing any medications
      they no longer want the patient using. A copy of the updated MRL must be provided to
      the patient.
      2.2.12.2. A complete list of the patient’s medications is communicated to the next
      provider of service when a patient is referred or transferred to another setting, service,
      practitioner or level of care within or outside the WHASC organization.
      2.2.12.3. Outpatient Medication Reconciliation – MTF staff members explain the
      importance of keeping their medication list current and available for any medical
      necessity. Each patient will be provided a copy of the reconciled MRL at the end of the
      episode of care IF a new medication was ordered. Medical record is not necessary for:
      routine diagnostic radiology, appointments for treatment (e.g. derm), post surgical
      follow-up, diagnostic testing, initial physical therapy, and all similar type appointments.
      Pharmacy staff members issue written medication information to every patient who
      begins a new medication.
2.3. Drug Administration.
   2.3.1. Only competency-verified personnel can administer drugs, biologicals, or blood
   products. Supervisors are responsible for accurately assessing and documenting the
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                  13


  competency of subordinate personnel prior to the member administering any medications.
  Flight commanders ensure competency certification programs are maintained.
  2.3.2. Each new drug order is carefully reviewed by pharmacy and a registered nurse
  EXCEPT when the resulting delay would harm the patient. Orders written after pharmacy
  hours will be reviewed retrospectively within 24 hours and entered into the patient
  prescription profile. Medication administration by anesthesia personnel will be conducted
  IAW anesthesia standard of care and (CDC guidelines. Review by the pharmacy verifies
  proper dosage and screens for drug-drug interactions, therapeutic duplications/overlaps, and
  drug allergies that may result in unintended effects. Patients are made aware of any
  potentially significant adverse reaction or concerns with new medications. Orders are
  determined to be appropriate based upon medical history, clinical condition, and drug
  allergies. WHASC meds should be compatible with meds on the patient’s MRL and will be
  checked for compatibility by a pharmacist. The diet compatibility and predictable adverse
  reactions must also be considered.
     2.3.2.1. Prior to administering any drug, the nurse or medical technician will verify that
     the medication is stable based on a visual examination for particulates or discoloration,
     that the medication has not expired, and that there are no contraindications.
     2.3.2.2. Personnel are not required to administer a drug they feel unqualified to
     administer, believe might be detrimental to the patient, or in situations where patient
     monitoring cannot be properly accomplished. When concerned about the administration
     of any drug, consult with a pharmacist, nurse manager, or provider for order clarification.
     Ethical concerns are addressed in 59 MDWI 44-150, Advance Directives and End of Life.
     2.3.2.3. Medications requiring specialized/intensive monitoring, or drugs with the
     potential for causing significant alterations in clinical status are administered only if
     appropriate monitoring equipment, emergency medications/reversing agents, and
     qualified nursing support are available and should be closely scrutinized before
     prescribing.
  2.3.3. Staff members authorized to administer drugs follow the “five rights of medication
  administration”: the right DRUG, at the right DOSE, given at the right TIME, by the right
  ROUTE, to the right PATIENT.
     2.3.3.1. Two patient identifiers - patient’s full name, including suffix, Jr., Sr., III, etc.
     and date of birth (DOB) are used to identify the right patient before medication
     administration. Patient’s name and DOB on wristband is matched to patient’s name and
     DOB on the electronic record or physician order. Patient should be asked to state
     patient’s full name and DOB and matched to name and DOB on electronic record. See
     59 MDWI 44-165 for complete description of patient identification requirements for
     medication administration. Note: All surgical patients must have an identification and
     allergy band, as appropriate, placed on the wrist upon arrival to the facility.
     2.3.3.2. Providers will list/annotate all known allergies and drug sensitivities for their
     patients on the check-in orders as well as subsequent transfer orders. Allergies are also
     carefully checked prior to the administration of any medication. Surgical patients with
     drug allergies are identified with an allergy band attached to the wrist. Drug and food
     allergies are documented in Essentris and on DD Form 1924, Surgical Checklist, AF
14                                                    59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


     Form 3068 and AF Form 3069. Notify the provider if a patient reports a history of an
     allergy or adverse drug reaction to a prescribed medication. Providers will update
     AHLTA database with known allergies. All personnel with access to the CHCS database
     shall obtain and input allergy information at every opportunity.
  2.3.4. Unit dosed medications remain in the original unit dose packaging until the drug
  reaches the patient. Patients are educated about the medication dose packaging system(s)
  used, such as inhalers or other unique administration devices. Drugs are labeled with name,
  strength, manufacturer, lot number, and expiration date. Intravenous fluids with drug
  additives are compounded in pharmacy and labeled with patient name, clinic, date, time
  prepared, drug name/strength, base solution, appropriate precautionary label(s), and
  administration rate/dosing interval.
  2.3.5. Pharmacy recommends standardized administration times due to facilitation of
  delivery of medications, ensure timely administration, and reduce the potential for errors.
  Clinics may adjust actual drug administration times as requirements dictate.
  2.3.6. The 59 MDW has a goal to administer new medication orders within two hours, unless
  otherwise indicated. Nurses shall contact the ordering provider for clarification of dosing
  times if greater than two-hours will elapse before giving the first dose of a “scheduled” drug
  according to the standardized administration time. In the same manner, routine medications
  should be administered between one-half hour before to one-half hour after the scheduled
  time and every effort is made to meet the administered time. ‘NOW’ order medications
  should be administered immediately upon receipt from the pharmacy (i.e. not held until next
  scheduled administration time). ‘STAT’ or emergent medications should be administered as
  soon as possible, or within 40 minutes of an order being written. Prospective pharmacy
  review of a new order is required except when the delay would result in patient harm.
  2.3.7. IV push list describe which medications can be administered via IV push and the
  conditions for doing so. Not all medications are allowed to be given via IV push in the same
  day surgery recovery areas. The IV push list will be reviewed at least annually by the P&T
  Function.
  2.3.8. The P&T Committee identifies high-alert medications to be given special
  consideration. Concentrated potassium chloride, concentrated potassium phosphates, and
  concentrated sodium chloride (concentrations above 0.9%) injections have been identified by
  pharmacy safety organizations as “high alert” medications. “High alert” medications may
  not be stocked in areas outside of pharmacy.
  2.3.9. Outpatient clinics document medication administration per their clinical guidelines.
  Documentation includes date, time, medication name, dosage, route of administration, site
  and any therapeutic effects/side effects or adverse reactions reported by the patient.
  2.3.10. Only when there is a specific order to self-administer medication(s) written by a
  provider in the electronic record or in Essentris or AF Form 3066, Doctor’s Orders
  equivalent, are patients permitted to self-administer drugs. Controlled substances are not
  usually authorized for self-administration; however the AOU/AE does allow self-
  administration of controlled substance medication.
  2.3.11. Nursing personnel document patient teaching regarding self-administration in
  Essentris. Aeromedical Staging Facility documentation can be done on AF Form 3899,
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                  15


   Aeromedical Patient Evacuation Record or AHLTA-T. Patients, or parent/guardian, sign 59
   MDW Form 5002, Patient Self-Medication Agreement.
   2.3.12. The nurse writes “Self-Medication” in the electronic form or on AF Form 3069 and
   lists all medications authorized for self-medication. Dosage forms such as ophthalmic drops,
   creams, or inhalers are dispensed as a full unit.
       2.3.12.1. The nurse documents/verifies the patient’s participation in the self-
       administration program by placing an “S” in the appropriate box. Omitted or delayed
       doses are documented in the electronic record or AF Form 3069 by placing an asterisk (*)
       in the time of administration column. Self-administration drug therapy changes are
       documented in the electronic record or AF Form 3069 and the patient is immediately
       notified.
       2.3.12.2. When a dose or frequency change of self-medication occurs, a new self-
       medication order is written.
       2.3.12.3. Adverse reactions to self-administered medications must be reported to the
       provider as soon as possible. The provider or nurse must report any adverse reaction to
       the pharmacy for review by the P&T Function.
2.4. Sterile Products.
   2.4.1. Safe Injection Practices for 59 MDW are handled IAW the CDC Safe Injection
   Practice guidelines.
       2.4.1.1. Use aseptic technique to avoid contamination of sterile injection equipment.
       2.4.1.2. Use single-dose vials for parenteral medications whenever possible.
       2.4.1.3. Do not administer medications from single-dose vials or ampules to multiple
       patients or combine leftover contents for later use.
       2.4.1.4. If multi-dose vials must be used, both the needle or cannula and syringe used to
       access the multi-dose vial must be sterile.
       2.4.1.5. Dedicate multi-dose vials to a single patient whenever possible. If multi-dose
       vials will be used for more than one patient, they should be restricted to a centralized
       medication area and should not enter the immediate patient treatment area (e.g. operating
       room, patient room/cubicle)
   2.4.1.6. The pharmacy will compound or admix all sterile products except in emergencies or
   when not feasible (for example, when product stability is short). Aseptic technique will be
   utilized and the accuracy of the product will be ensured by the pharmacy staff, including a
   visual inspection of the medication’s integrity.
   2.4.2. Sterile products are ordered as follows: IV admixture solutions are ordered via
   Essentris or AF Form 3066 equivalent. Orders include patient name, FMP/SSN, DOB,
   clinic, date and time, drug, dosage, and physician signature with stamp or printed name and
   provider code. Weights (kg) are required on pediatric orders (patients under 12 years of
   age). If not specified, the diluent, volume, concentration, and rate of infusion are at
   pharmacy discretion, based upon current literature.
 16                                                   59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


   2.4.3. When orders are discontinued, pharmacy personnel is notified through the electronic
   record.
   2.4.4. Initial sterile products are delivered to the clinic by pneumatic tube system when
   possible. High cost drugs, chemotherapy, blood products, and controlled substances are not
   delivered by the pneumatic tube system. These must be picked up in the pharmacy and hand-
   carried to the clinic.
   2.4.5. Each compounded sterile product solution is labeled for a specific patient. A sterile
   product labeled for a patient will not be administered to any other patient; to do so is a
   reportable medication occurrence.
      2.4.5.1. Nursing personnel must label all medication to be administered to patients. All
      clinic stock products should be listed on the clinic’s Authorized Drug List. Only
      pharmacy personnel may recycle or re-label products manufactured by pharmacy.
          2.4.5.1.1. Sterile product labels state the expiration date and time. Sterile products
          originating from pharmacy and not administered by the indicated time must be
          returned to pharmacy with the label marked expired, EXP.
      2.4.5.2. Flushing and the maintaining of patency of intravascular devices are detailed in
      Attachment 5 of 59MDWI 44-151, Care and Maintenance of Venous and Arterial Access
      Devices.
          2.4.5.2.1. Rate of administration of diluted IV potassium chloride – maximum
          concentrations of potassium chloride for peripheral and central lines will be 10
          mEq/50mmLl and 20 mEq/50mL, respectively. The rate of administration for
          unmonitored, partially monitored, and fully monitored patients will be 10 mEq/hour,
          15 mEq/hour, and 20 mEq/hour, respectively. No more than 50 mEq of potassium
          chloride will be placed in one IV bag. Patients requiring more than 50 mEq of
          potassium chloride will have the dose split into multiple bags.
   2.4.6. When a sterile product is suspected of being contaminated, follow these procedures:
      2.4.6.1. If an exact replacement solution is not available, administer the base solution
      with a new administration set and run at the ordered rate.
      2.4.6.2. Pharmacy personnel will hand-carry the solution and tubing to microbiology
      where it is cultured. Pharmacy personnel will complete an patient safety report to be
      given to the Risk Manager and notify the attending physician and Infection Control of the
      event.
   2.4.7. In the pharmacy, laminar flow hoods are certified Class 100, ISO 5 by an
   environmental control laboratory when moved, repaired and annually, to meet federal
   standards. A certification record is posted on each hood.
2.5. Unit Dose (UD).
   2.5.1. The UD system provides a supply of individually packaged drugs for each patient,
   with the exception of common stock items such as Tylenol®. UD drugs are labeled with
   generic name, strength, manufacturer, lot number, and expiration date. Individual patient
   specific drugs not included in floor stock (for example, antibiotic liquids, topicals,
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                    17


   ophthalmics, inhalers) are labeled for each patient. All UD medications and controlled
   substances are stored in PYXIS® Medstations.
   2.5.2. Drugs are ordered using the electronic system. Orders are sent to the ambulatory
   surgery pharmacy automatically via the electronic system. A pharmacist will type the order
   into the patient’s profile in CHCS. Once profiled, any medication not already stocked in
   PYXIS® will be sent to the floor for administration.
   2.5.3. PYXIS® Override.
      2.5.3.1. The WHASC P&T Function will determine and will routinely evaluate which
      medication(s) nurses may access prior to a pharmacist review of the order.
      2.5.3.2. Override Groups. Override groups are determined based on the patient care
      location, nursing staff training and patient acuity. Medications included on the override
      list will be driven by the patient condition and categorized as:
      2.5.3.3. Supplies: (i.e. keys, paper): No witness will be required to remove a supply item.
      2.5.3.4. Emergent Medications: No witness will be required to remove an “Emergent”
      item.
      2.5.3.5. Urgent Medications: Another nurse will be required to be a witness for the
      removal of “Urgent” medications and to verify the order prior to administration to the
      patient.
      2.5.3.6. Access to override medications will be further restricted by the user’s security
      group and privilege level (registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, medical technician,
      technician, etc.).
      2.5.3.7. The critical override feature will be utilized during prolonged CHCS downtime.
      Critical override will be executed by the ambulatory surgical pharmacy staff. Non-
      profile stations will not require critical override activation.
2.6. Labeling Medications Prepared Outside of Pharmacy.
   2.6.1. Medications prepared outside of pharmacy are for immediate use only. Areas
   such as Anesthesia, usually prepare medication for immediate use in surgery cases.
   2.6.2. Any time one or more medications is not used immediately or not maintained by the
   preparer, the medication container (e.g. plastic bag, syringe, bottle, medicine cup, basin, etc.)
   must be labeled. Labeling occurs when any medication or solution is transferred from the
   original package to another container. No more than one medication or solution is labeled at
   one time.
   2.6.3. At a minimum, all medications prepared in the facility are labeled with the following:
   drug name, strength, amount and beyond use date and time.
   2.6.4. When preparing individualized medications for multiple specific patients, or when the
   staff member preparing the individualized medications is not the staff member administering
   the medication, the label also includes the following: patient name and DOB, patient
   location, directions for use and any applicable cautionary statements either on the label or
   attached as an accessory label (e.g. “requires refrigeration”, “for IM use only”). At shift
   change or break relief, all medications and solutions both on and off the sterile field and their
18                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


  labels are reviewed by entering and exiting personnel. Any medications or solutions found
  unlabeled are immediately discarded.
  2.6.5. All medication or solution labels are verified both verbally and visually by two
  qualified individuals whenever the person preparing the medication or solution is not the
  person who will be administering it. All original containers from medications or solutions
  remain available for reference in the peri-operative or procedural area until the conclusion of
  the procedure. All labeled containers on the sterile field are discarded at the conclusion of
  the procedure.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                  19

                   DRUGS, BIOLOGICAL, AND BLOOD PRODUCTS

3.1. Storage and Accountability.
   3.1.1. Flight commanders, flight superintendents, nurse managers, and noncommissioned
   officers in charge (NCOICs) assigned to clinics must ensure drugs, biologicals, and blood
   products are properly and safely stored, secured, and within expiration dates. Pharmacy and
   nursing personnel are responsible for monitoring expiration dates in PYXIS® machines.
   Clinic leaders are responsible to ensure that their clinic stores drugs, biologicals, and blood
   products under conditions suitable for product stability. Pharmacy personnel are similarly
   responsible for their respective areas. Medications are stored according to manufacturer’s
   recommendations or in the absence of such recommendations, according to a pharmacist’s
   instructions.
   3.1.2. Medication refrigerators are appropriate to maintain product stability for some
   pharmaceuticals. Refrigeration for medication is maintained at a temperature between two
   (2) to eight (8) degrees Celsius (36 to 46 Fahrenheit). Large refrigerators containing large
   quantities of temperature sensitive medications, such as the walk-in refrigerator in the
   Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy, should be alarmed and internally as well as remotely
   monitored for immediate correction if the refrigerator temperature goes out of range. If a
   refrigerator does not have an alarm, then the department responsible for that refrigerator must
   check and record monitoring results on a temperature control log each business day.
   Refrigerators must have temperature range monitor mechanism if a clinic is unable to
   manually conduct and record a refrigerator check after business hours. The clinic must
   review the monitor’s temperature range upon arrival after closure of the clinic (after being
   closed for nights, weekends, or holidays) as it is the clinic’s responsibility to review and
   document that the temperature from the previous day and during non-duty time periods that
   the temperature was in an acceptable range.
      3.1.2.1. Medication refrigerator monitoring. If the refrigeration temperatures fall outside
      the recommended range, clinic personnel must contact WHASC facility management to
      correct the refrigeration problem(s) AND the pharmacy for information on whether the
      drugs and/or biologicals are acceptable for use. Actions taken must be documented on
      the temperature control log. If the temperature was out of range during the time the clinic
      was closed, they are to take the same steps as if they had found an abnormal temperature
      during their daily checks that are specifically outlined in 59 MDW Form 2942,
      Refrigerator/Freezer Temperature Chart, page 2, paragraph 2). Actions taken must be
      documented on the temperature control log.
      3.1.2.2. Antiseptics and drugs for external use are stored separately from internal and
      injectable drugs. Food and drinks must not be stored in cabinets, carts, or
      refrigerators where drugs are stocked or prepared.
   3.1.3. Medication Security.
      3.1.3.1. Medications shall be secured from unsupervised access by unauthorized
      individuals.
20                                                    59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


        3.1.3.1.1. Persons authorized to have access to controlled medications (Schedule II.
        III, IV, and V) include physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
        nurses, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians or other designated personnel.
        3.1.3.1.2. Persons authorized to have unsupervised access to non-controlled
        medications include those listed in 3.1.3.1.1, select medical technicians, and other
        personnel whose job description includes the transportation, dispensing,
        compounding, or administration of medications.
        3.1.3.1.3. Persons with supervised access (in the area but not necessarily direct
        observation) to medications include environmental services personnel, engineering
        personnel, materials management personnel and other employees so that they may
        perform their duties. They shall not have unsupervised access to controlled
        medications, and shall not handle medications to which they have access.
     3.1.3.2. All medications shall be securely stored throughout the 59 MDW, to include
     clinics, clinic, the operating rooms, treatment rooms, etc. Each clinic will have a
     designated storage unit capable of being secured and locked. Medication cabinets/rooms,
     if not equipped with a PYXIS® system, will be secured and locked at all times when not
     in use, with the following exceptions (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all
     possible situations that comply with this policy):
        3.1.3.2.1. Medications are in an open, continuously staffed clinic where access by
        unauthorized individuals is controlled, such as the suite of operating rooms and
        adjacent spaces during times in the operating room suite is in use and the access
        control station staffed.
        3.1.3.2.2. Medications are in or on an unlocked anesthesia cart between cases, as
        long as medications are placed in a locked cart when no more cases are scheduled for
        the procedure room in question.
        3.1.3.2.3. Medications are in a sealed crash cart under routine (not necessarily
        constant) observation by MTF personnel.
        3.1.3.2.4. Medications are in unlocked medication drawers or other locations inside a
        staffed nursing station.
     3.1.3.3. In most instances, medications are removed from stock immediately prior to
     administration to the patient. However, a department (such as respiratory therapy or
     anesthesia) may remove more than one patient’s medications from stock provided the
     following requirements are met:
        3.1.3.3.1. Safe storage: medications taken from stock will be protected from extreme
        temperature and contamination.
        3.1.3.3.2. Safe handling: All medications removed from stock shall be labeled unless
        immediately administered to a specific patient. Aseptic technique will be used while
        preparing medications for administration.
        3.1.3.3.3. Security: Medication removed from stock shall be kept under the direct
        supervision of the healthcare provider until administration to a patient, returned to
        stock, or destroyed.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                     21


     3.1.3.4. Controlled medications: Schedule II, III or IV medications will be kept in a
     substantial locked cabinet or other enclosure IAW AFI 44-102. These medications must
     be securely monitored and strict inventories maintained using the PYXIS® system,
     and/or AF Form 579, Controlled Substances Register, as appropriate.
     3.1.3.5. The following items are considered medications and must be secured as
     described in section 3.1.3.1 (1) All premixed IVs such as added potassium chloride (KCl)
     (or other electrolytes), lidocaine, epinephrine, and heparin; and (2) contrast media.
     3.1.3.6. Syringes and needles, although not medications, have a high potential for
     diversion, therefore, they must be secured and locked or within line of sight of authorized
     healthcare personnel.
  3.1.4. Crash Cart Security. Each clinic should conduct a risk assessment to ensure the crash
  cart location is not near an exit or egress but must also consider the patient population and
  the potential risk to them (i.e., pediatrics, behavioral health). Crash carts need to be in a
  monitored location where staff has active oversight of the crash cart status and be able to
  ascertain if there has been tampering with the cart. If the cart is in a location that is closed at
  night and/or on weekends, the crash cart needs to be secured in a locked area during those
  times if approved by the resuscitation committee.
     3.1.4.1. Emergency medications, to include crash cart meds and antidotes, are secured
     using a breakable, numeric lock. Each emergency medication tray stored within the crash
     carts is sealed within a plastic, tamper resistant bag with the expiration dates of the tray
     clearly visible. The expiration date of the tray is the expiration date of the medication
     dated to expire first. Before this expiration date is reached, the tray must be returned to
     pharmacy and exchanged for a tray with a new, later expiration date.
  3.1.5. When preparing reconstituted multiple-dose vials, healthcare personnel must label
  with the diluent, concentration, beyond use date, and their initials.
     3.1.5.1. All multiple-dose vials are visually inspected for contamination or deterioration
     prior to use. The person making the initial puncture will date the multi-dose vial with a
     beyond use date 28 days after the date of opening or puncture, unless the manufacturer
     specifies otherwise. All multiple dose vials are discarded or returned to the pharmacy
     upon the 28 day beyond use date. Multiple dose vials are stored as directed by the
     manufacturer and refrigerated only if specified.
     3.1.5.2. Single-dose vials are disposed of after the first use. Single-dose vials do not
     contain any preservatives and pose a potential infection risk if punctured more than one
     time. Anesthesia medication vials may be kept for monitoring or education purposes. No
     further medication will be drawn and they should be discarded at case completion. A
     drug storage area will fail inspection if there are used single dose vials in a position
     where they can be used again. Dispose of used single-dose vials immediately after
     first use. The vial will state if it is multiple-dose or single-dose. The only exception to
     this is single-dose vials may be used more than once within the IV pharmacy’s laminar
     flow hood if: 1) reconstituted aseptically, 2) stored within the hood, and 3) discarded
     within 12 hours after dilution. For controlled substances, see paragraph 3.4.8.
  3.1.6. Only drugs, biologicals, and blood products listed on the P&T Function approved
  Authorized Drug List (ADL) are stocked in clinics outside the pharmacy and then only in the
22                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


  quantities authorized. This policy also applies to all emergency drug stocks, to include crash
  carts, transport bags, and deployable medication kits. All crash cart kit changes are approved
  through the Resuscitative Services Working Group in addition to the P&T Function.
  Controlled drugs are approved for stock in any clinic based upon patient need. Clinic stock
  and emergency medications are made available in unit dose, age specific, and the most ready-
  to-use forms, whenever possible.
  3.1.7. Checking expiration dates of all clinic stock is a shared responsibility between
  pharmacy personnel and clinic staff. Pharmacy personnel, as outside inspectors, check clinic
  drug, biological, and blood product stocks (originating from pharmacy) each month. Each
  inspection is filed with the pharmacy and a copy is given to the nurse manager or clinic
  NCOIC. A summary of the inspection process is included in Attachments 5 and 6. Clinic
  staff should check their medication stock at least monthly.
     3.1.7.1. Where the expiration date is stated only in terms of month and year, it is
     intended the expiration date is the last day of the stated month (e.g. January 2013 equates
     to 31 January 2013). For medications requiring reconstitution prior to use, a suitable
     beyond use date for the reconstituted product must be placed on the labeling by the
     preparer, usually the pharmacy.
  3.1.8. Medical personnel assigned to 59 MDW and certified volunteers possessing 59 MDW
  identification, may pick up non-controlled drugs from pharmacy and transport drugs between
  clinics. Personnel authorized to pick up controlled substances include registered or licensed
  vocational nurses, physicians, dentists or other providers (with prescriptive authority) with a
  59 MDW identification badge.
  3.1.9. Clinic personnel forward outdated, deteriorated, discontinued or excessive drug stock
  to the pharmacy for processing. (Outpatient medications are NOT routinely accepted from
  patients).
  3.1.10. Guidance for WHASC pharmaceutical cytotoxic spill containment is obtained
  through the Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland Fire Department (FD) Hazardous Materials
  Team. The manufacturer of the pharmaceutical determines if the material is hazardous
  (reference the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheet) are located in the Clinical Support
  Pharmacy. If hazardous, the FD contains the spill as specified in 802 CES, Hazardous
  Materials Program, Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan 10-2, Annex 1, Tab F, Shop Level
  Spill Response. Personnel discovering the spill call 911 which in turn will contact the FD
  and Security Forces, as appropriate personnel. Pharmacy personnel can usually clean small
  spills (5mL or 5 gm) within the hood area. Large spills require the section in which the spill
  occurred to contact 802 CES/CE (671-2288) and/or the Base Hazmat Pharmacy (671-0331)
  for disposal. When in doubt about spill size, contact 802 CES/CE. If the spill is non-
  hazardous, the section in which the spill occurred contains and cleans up the
  spill. Hazardous cytotoxic waste removal is managed by housekeeping. Reference flow chart
  (Attachment 2 of 59 MDWI 32-7001, Hazardous Materials, Waste Management and Spill
  Response Program).
  3.1.11. Disposal of drugs must meet the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and
  Recovery Act, and San Antonio Water System requirements. Accordingly, it is inappropriate
  to dispose of hazardous materials through any entrance to the sewer system, to include sinks.
  Some drugs are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 261.33) as being
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                 23


   hazardous materials. In addition, any drug considered a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent
   should be treated as a hazardous material (Attachment 7).
      3.1.11.1. Small amounts of non-hazardous drugs are permitted into the sewer system.
      Such disposals must be part of normal business processes, to include the destruction of
      partial doses of controlled drugs. (The Clean Water Act permits limited chemical
      releases into the sewer system if the runoff is from day-to-day operations. The San
      Antonio Water System is aware that Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland produces medical
      type waste and additional treatment procedures are used to eliminate contamination)
   3.1.12. Clinic stock orders are limited to items and the quantities approved on the ADL.
   ADLs are reviewed and approved annually by the P&T Function. Clinic drug stock requests
   (other than for controlled substances) are ordered through CHCS. Handwritten requests are
   honored only when the CHCS system is down. For assistance with CHCS ordering contact
   the Clinical Support Pharmacy (292-6768 or 292-5478).
      3.1.12.1. Each clinic must submit their ADL to the P&T Function for review/approval
      annually. The current approved ADL is maintained in CHCS for each clinic. Submission
      of the ADL will be completed by providing the comprehensive list attached to a memo
      which states the request for review and approval. The documents will go to the Clinical
      Support pharmacy for compilation with P&T documents to be presented. If additions are
      requested and approved by P&T they will be added to the clinic ADL in CHCS and then
      the pharmacy will issue the medication to the clinic for stock. Only approved medication
      will be issued or stored in the clinics for stock use.
      3.1.12.2. A template for the ADL request for approval memo can be obtained for the
      Clinical Support Pharmacy.
3.2. Pharmacist (Pharmacy) Order Review.
   3.2.1. All prescriptions or medication orders must be reviewed for appropriateness. Before
   dispensing, removal from floor stock, or removal from an automated storage and distribution
   device, a pharmacist reviews all prescription or medication orders unless a licensed
   independent practitioner controls the ordering, preparation, and administration of the
   medication; or in urgent situations when the resulting delay would harm the patient,
   including situations in which the patient experiences a sudden change in clinical status (for
   example, new onset of nausea, severe pain). Prescriptions which are dispensed to patients
   from an after-hours medication cabinet once the pharmacy has closed, are reviewed by a
   pharmacist retrospectively within 24 hours of dispensing.
   3.2.2. All medication orders are processed through the CHCS system and screened for
   allergies, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic overlaps, and maximum dose warnings before
   dispensing.
   3.2.3. All high-risk or high-alert medications, as defined by the organization (see Visual Aid
   44-117, High-Alert Medication (HAM) List), shall require pharmacist review (i.e., in-person
   or on-call) prior to dispensing and/or administration.
   3.2.4. All paper outpatient medication prescriptions received and not entered directly into
   CHCS by a provider require real-time pharmacist review prior to dispensing.
 24                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


   3.2.5. When access to CHCS is not available (e.g., the system is down), all medication
   orders/prescriptions will be reviewed by a pharmacist (or provider) prior to dispensing. In
   settings in which real-time pharmacist review is not available, medication
   orders/prescriptions filled by a pharmacy technician will also be reviewed by another
   pharmacy technician certified to check, or a medical department officer or independent duty
   corpsmen, prior to dispensing. Retrospective review by a pharmacist of medications
   dispensed shall occur at the earliest opportunity.
   3.2.6. Level 1 and 2 clinical screening messages require provider and/or pharmacist
   documentation/override. If an interaction message is displayed for a level 1 or level 2
   severity, the pharmacist must review the interaction and document the reason for override. If
   necessary, the provider will be contacted for clarification. In the unlikely event a pharmacist
   is not available; the technician will contact the provider for clarification and document the
   interaction. If the provider chooses to proceed with a level 1 severity message, a pharmacist
   (in-person or on-call) must be contacted by the pharmacy technician to obtain concurrence
   and authorization prior to completion of the prescription entry in CHCS and dispensing of the
   medication. Documentation should be entered into CHCS to reflect this.
   3.2.7. Only physicians, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and trained volunteers working
   under the supervision of a pharmacist may dispense medications to patients. Nurses and
   other health care professionals not trained or licensed to dispense medications may NOT
   accomplish this task. When physicians dispense, they must adhere to the same standards
   required of a pharmacist or pharmacy technician with regards to labeling, counseling, drug
   interaction screening, allergy screening, double-checking, etc. No other health care
   professionals are permitted to dispense medications to patients.
   3.2.8. Independent Duty Medical Technicians may only prescribe and dispense medications
   from their ADL IAW AFI 44-103, The Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician
   Program and AFMAN 44-158.
3.3. Automated Dispensing Machines.
   3.3.1. Automated Dispensing Machines/Devices (e.g., PYXIS®) are not, in and of
   themselves, medication control systems, but rather are tools and part of a sound medication
   control system. Staff members ensure proper medication control systems (designed to
   prevent medication related sentinel events) are still in place when these machines are used.
   3.3.2. All medication use standards apply to medications obtained via an automated
   dispensing device, to the same extent as medications dispensed via the traditional unit-dose
   drug distribution system or floor stock.
   3.3.3. In situations when a pharmacist is not present to review orders, automated dispensing
   devices may be accessed only in situations in which the patient would be harmed or clinical
   care compromised if they did not receive the medication. Providers must perform standard
   medication screening of prescribed medications before dispensing. Access to machines or
   night cabinets should not be for routine new orders when administration can wait until a
   pharmacist is available for order review, without risk to the patient (e.g., a multivitamin).
   Any un-reviewed orders are sent to the pharmacy and reviewed by the pharmacist
   (retrospectively) as soon as a pharmacist is available. (See also paragraph 3.2.3.)
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                   25


   3.3.4. Pharmacy technicians may load/refill all non-controlled medications in these machines
   leaving the pharmacy for restocking. A pharmacist must double-check all medications for
   restocking prior to delivery.
      3.3.4.1. The pharmacy shares the responsibility with nursing for checking any electronic
      dispensing machines for outdated drugs. Pharmacy personnel will check for expiration
      dates when replenishing and on a monthly basis. Nursing personnel are primarily
      responsible for checking medication expiration dates before administering the drug(s) to
      a patient.
      3.3.4.2. If clinic personnel find expired non-controlled medication(s), these personnel
      should inventory the pocket containing the drug, remove all expired medications and
      adjust the inventory of that drawer. When the inventory is adjusted an electronic
      discrepancy report will be generated and a re-order will be generated in the pharmacy.
      The personnel will place the expired drug(s) in the pharmacy return bin (located in
      locked/secured area or cabinet).
3.4. Controlled Drugs.
   3.4.1. IAW AFI 44-102, chapter 1 providers are not authorized to prescribe controlled drugs
   for themselves, family members, or persons not under their direct care. Providers will not re-
   write orders from civilian providers unless they personally evaluate the patient and determine
   that the requested medication is the best suited for that particular patient. Pharmacy personnel
   will forward a list of providers prescribing controlled drugs for themselves or family
   members to the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff and Chief of the Medical Staff at
   least quarterly. The Chief of Medical Staff will notify the providers’ respective commanders
   for appropriate administrative action.
   3.4.2. Controlled drug prescriptions from local and out-of-state civilian providers are written
   and accepted IAW applicable federal law. Prescriptions, controlled or otherwise, written by
   physicians licensed outside the United States (e.g., Mexico, Canada) will NOT be honored.
   3.4.3. The clinical support pharmacy department reviews controlled substance medication
   use monthly based upon frequency of medication use, number of providers prescribing for
   the same patient, and quantity of controlled substance prescriptions. Information is provided
   to the patient’s PCM. Concerns regarding medication use are forwarded to the SGH for
   coordinated action (i.e., developing a medication management plan, referral to utilization
   management etc.). Pharmacy reports a summary of controlled substance monitoring
   quarterly at P&T.
   3.4.4. Outpatient prescriptions for Schedule II drugs may be written for up to a 90-day
   supply, but are not refillable IAW Federal law. Schedule II prescriptions are not filled later
   than 21 days after the date written.
      3.4.4.1. Each prescription for a Schedule II drug is written on a separate prescription
      form. Prescriptions for Schedule III-V drugs are written on a form separate from non-
      controlled medications.
   3.4.5. Schedule III-V prescriptions must be filled within six months of the date written. If
   authorized by the provider, schedule III-V drugs with refills are limited to a six month supply
26                                                    59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


  from the date the prescription was written. For example, schedule III-V prescriptions may be
  written for 30-day supply, with up to five refills or a 90 day supply with up to one refill.
     3.4.5.1. Nalbuphine (Nubain®), and all growth hormone products are locally controlled
     within the WHASC as controlled drugs for accounting purposes.
  3.4.6. Clinic Drug Stocks and Reordering. Clinic controlled drug stocks are stored in
  PYXIS® units, a double locked cabinet of substantial construction, or a combination safe.
  Should a PYXIS® become inoperable, clinic staff will first attempt to troubleshoot using the
  associated guide located on each PYXIS®. If still inoperable, notify pharmacy personnel for
  assistance prior to contacting PYXIS® for on-site service. Keys to access the PYXIS®
  machines are stored in the CII Safe in the Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy. ALL PYXIS®
  machines should be on emergency power (i.e., red outlets).
  3.4.7. For clinics not using PYXIS®, keys to cabinets containing controlled drugs must be
  in the possession of the nurse manager. When a nurse manager is not assigned, a responsible
  person assigned to the clinic is designated by the squadron commander in writing stating who
  will possess the keys and in what order of priority. Keys to controlled substance cabinet
  must be on the person of a medical practitioner, or other certified person, and are never
  removed from the facility. After hours, keys must be locked and secured separately from
  controlled substances.
     3.4.7.1. Deteriorated, outdated, or unused controlled drugs are removed from the clinic
     inventory and turned in to Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy personnel via the PYXIS® CII
     Safe® process. Those clinics not having this option available will turn these items into
     the pharmacy vault during normal duty hours, using DD Form 1150.
     3.4.7.2. Pharmacy personnel deliver controlled drugs daily to the PYXIS® Medstations,
     if needed.
     3.4.7.3. Pharmacy issues an AF Form 579 for controlled drugs not stored in PYXIS®
     and when clinic personnel receive controlled drug orders from the Pharmacy vault
     (BM18). Personnel authorized to pick up controlled substances include registered or
     licensed vocational nurses, physicians, and dentists with a 59 MDW identification badge.
         3.4.7.3.1. All AF Form 579s are reconciled at the beginning of each calendar year.
         All forms from the previous year are turned in to the pharmacy and new AF Form
         579s are issued for the current calendar year.
         3.4.7.3.2. Administrative documentation and inventory of controlled drugs when
         using AF Form 579s; a person administering a controlled drug to the patient makes a
         corresponding entry on AF Form 579. Entries must be in ink and erasure is not
         permitted. To correct an error, one line is drawn through the entry, the word “error”
         is written next to the line, and the person making the change initials and annotates the
         date and time of the change. A physical inventory of the prescribed drug should be
         accomplished before and after administering the drug to the patient.
  3.4.8. Waste of controlled drugs is a clinic procedure and destruction of controlled drugs is
  a pharmacy vault procedure. Waste must be documented either on the AF Form 579, within
  the Pyxies system, or described within a memorandum for record. All waste must be
  witnessed by . When clinic stock expires, or is suspected of contamination the clinic must
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                  27


  complete a DD Form 1150 and turn it in to the Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy vault for
  destruction. (Example: If a nurse has three expired 10mg morphine sulfate tubexes he/she
  CANNOT waste all three packaged units. They must be turned into the Ambulatory Surgery
  Pharmacy vault for destruction.)
     3.4.8.1. When destroying a partial or entire dose of a controlled drug, document the
     amount wasted along with a brief explanation. For clinics using AF Form 579s for
     narcotics, two sets of initials (of those authorized to administer narcotics) must be present
     to document and witness narcotic waste. For clinics with PYXIS®, narcotic waste
     should be documented in PYXIS®. Two licensed clinical staff members must input their
     access codes documenting the narcotic waste in PYXIS®.
     3.4.8.2. When a controlled drug in a tubex or blister pack is removed from the tamper
     proof packaging, it must be administered to a patient or wasted. An exception is made
     for pharmacy prepared kits (such as an anesthesia kit) where a pharmacy seal validates
     the integrity of a returned controlled tubex.
         3.4.8.2.1. Waste of a controlled drug dose is accomplished/documented at the source
         of the drug supply. If the controlled drug was stocked in a clinic, documentation
         must occur on the corresponding AF Form 579 or PYXIS® system. If the supply was
         obtained from a drug kit, then document using 59 MDW Form 3486, Anesthesia
         Narcotic Kit Register.
         3.4.8.2.2. If the supply was obtained directly from the pharmacy, and none of the
         doses were used, the doses may be returned to the pharmacy.
         3.4.8.2.3. Wasted controlled drugs are always co-signed or initialed by a second
         person with authorized access to controlled drugs. In some instances, such as for
         dental technicians, access may be restricted solely for witnessing controlled drug
         destruction.
  3.4.9. Inventory overages and shortages are reconciled using AF Form 85A, Inventory Count
  Card. Final approval authority of the AF Form 85A is the group commander.
  3.4.10. Two people certified to handle controlled drugs must inventory the controlled drug
  stock maintained in PYXIS®. Pharmacy will inventory their respective PYXIS®
  Medstations at least daily. Clinics will inventory at least weekly. Each clinic also runs
  activity reports and discrepancy reports daily. All discrepancies must be investigated,
  resolved, and cleared with documentation upon discovery, without exception. Resolution
  must be documented on an AF Form 85A when the discrepancy is other than a simple
  administrative error (i.e., when there is actual loss or overage of drug).
     3.4.10.1. The nurse manager or designee reviews the PYXIS® report for unusual
     entries, such as unknown patients or unusual quantities. Nurse managers periodically
     evaluate issues against patient records. These activities must be performed at least twice
     per month and documented. This documentation should be saved until after the monthly
     disinterested inventory even if addressed earlier. The pharmacy vault custodian runs
     reports to ensure the inventories are accomplished.
  3.4.11. Personnel certified to administer medications need to obtain an access code to enter
  the PYXIS® system from the PYXIS® Manager in Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy. The
28                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


  clinic senior officer or designee completes a PYXIS® Access Code Request Form for
  pharmacy to assign the new staff member an access code. The clinic senior officer can also
  issue a temporary access code for a 12-hour period. When personnel are reassigned or codes
  are compromised, notify pharmacy vault personnel to change the code.
  3.4.12. Controlled substances removed from PYXIS® or signed out on AF Form 579 are
  done so for a specific patient. Signing out medications for “clinic stock” is not acceptable.
  Controlled substances are maintained in PYXIS® or stored in a locked cabinet/drawer until
  time of use. Controlled substances are not to be removed from secure locations and carried
  as an as-needed supply for future patient use. MTF personnel are not authorized any
  medications, especially controlled substances, in "fanny pack" stock.
  3.4.13. When controlled substances are removed from PYXIS®, personnel removing these
  medications will use two separate patient identifiers. Personnel inputting new patients into
  the PYXIS® systems should include all the appropriate identifiers in the patient profile.
  3.4.14. The Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy’s PYXIS CII Safe® process tracks when an AF
  Form 579 is issued to a clinic and when an AF Form 579 is returned to pharmacy. Each
  month disinterested inspectors obtain an outstanding AF Form 579 list from the pharmacy
  and verify the existence/proper use in each clinic.
  3.4.15. At shift changes, the oncoming and off going nurses, verify AF Form 579 balances
  with actual controlled drug inventories, where this tracking method is used. An annotation is
  made on AF Form 578, Data Record, or equivalent authorized form, as appropriate. Clinic
  personnel do not leave until the narcotic inventories are done and verified as accurate.
  3.4.16. AF Form 579s are not transferred to another clinic or destroyed. When no longer
  required for patient care, this form is returned to the Pharmacy vault (BM 18). This is an
  accountable form for controlled substances. Should a form be lost or if an inventory
  discrepancy discovered, then AF Form 85A must be completed and routed through for the
  group commander’s approval.
  3.4.17. Patients receiving a single dose of a controlled drug in an epidural or IV infusion that
  cannot be stocked in the PYXIS® must have the medication picked up in person at the
  Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy by an authorized staff member (refer to paragraph 3.1.9) and
  will require a signature to acknowledge receipt. Providers order these products using AF
  Form 3066 or AF Form 781, as appropriate. Nurses will ensure all documentation on the
  medication flow sheet states the dose, rate, and time the drip was started. Nursing staff will
  document any and all waste on the flow sheet with two nurses initials and date.
 3.4.18. All continuous IV infusions made with controlled drugs will be made in the
 pharmacy IV room. After the original order, the infusion should be requested 1-2 hours in
 advance. The pharmacy will notify the clinic when the IV infusion is ready for pick-up
 generally by a registered nurse or licensed vocational nurse with a 59 MDW identification
 badge.
  3.4.19. Operating Room Anesthesia Stock.
     3.4.19.1. The OR drug inventory is maintained in PYXIS® Anesthesia Carts and they
     provide nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists medications, including controlled
     substances, for administration in OR suites, radiology special procedure rooms and
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                        29


     magnetic resonance imaging areas. Any and all waste is documented within the PYXIS®
     anesthesia cart system
     3.4.19.2. Wastage of opened tamper-proof containers or partial units of controlled
     substances is annotated on an AF Form 579. If the controlled drug was removed from
     PYXIS®, the documentation occurs in that system. Another person certified to
     administer or destroy controlled drugs witnesses wastage. Anesthesia personnel
     immediately correct any discrepancy(ies) and report on an AF Form 85A and route it
     appropriately to the group commander.
 30                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013

formerly Brooke Army Medical Center and other Air Force facilities in the San Antonio area.
Provides University of Texas, Texas A&M University and University of Incarnate Word, and
other Schools of Pharmacy Doctoral programs clinical rotations and coordinates an accredited
Army-Air Force post-graduate year 1 pharmacy practice residency.
   4.1.1. Educational Services.     Provide in-service educational programs designed for
   pharmacists and pharmacy technicians for continuing education requirements. Also provides
   interdisciplinary educational and training programs designed for providers, nurses, etc.
   Pharmacy staff may also present educational offerings in outpatient or community settings as
   appropriate.
4.2. Clinical Pharmacy Practice. Specific programs designed to optimize healthcare
outcomes, may include, Lipid/Cardiovascular Health, erythropoiesis stimulating agents clinic,
Tobacco Cessation clinic, nephrology and medication monitoring. Completed outpatient
encounters are documented in AHLTA as part of the clinic encounter by a credentialed
pharmacist.
4.3. Non-Formulary Special Purchase. AFI 44-102, Chapter 9, requires all providers
practicing at WHASC to preferentially use medications listed on the MTF formulary. A 59
MDW provider may request the purchase of non-formulary item(s) when formulary medications
do not or cannot reasonably meet the needs of an individual patient. Certain non-formulary
medications have specific “medical necessity” or “prior authorization” paperwork requirement as
directed by the DoD Pharmacoeconomic Center (PEC) or TRICARE Management Activity. The
forms can be found on the DoD PEC’s web site at http://pec.ha.osd.mil/nonform.php
   4.3.1. Only staff physicians and dentists are authorized to request non-formulary
   medications. Residents, interns, and other providers are required to obtain a co-signature
   from a staff physician or dentist. When a non-formulary order requires a co-signature, then
   the co-signing provider information must be supplied (signature block, contact phone or
   pager).
   4.3.2. To obtain a non-formulary item, the prescriber completes AF Form 781 with only one
   item listed per prescription form and DD Form 2081, New Drug Request. Or, as a 59 MDW
   approved alternative, the prescriber may complete the single page 59 MDW Form 5031,
   WHASC Request for Special Purchase of Non-Formulary Medication. For either approach,
   the justification for using the non-formulary medication must be stated on the order form, to
   include indication, formulary drugs and duration of therapy tried. Initial non-formulary
   requests are processed at the specialty pharmacy. All non-formulary requests require
   approval by a pharmacist prior to being filled. If a disagreement between the pharmacy and
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                    31


   the provider regarding the necessity/use/justification of a non-formulary request cannot be
   resolved, the Chief of the Medical Staff (SGH) will be consulted for a decision. Most non-
   formulary medications are not stocked at WHASC pharmacies and may require a 5-7 day
   procurement turn-around time.
   4.3.3. Some OTC drugs may be special purchased depending on the justification provided.
   4.3.4. Non-formulary/special purchase order procedures may also be used to request a
   restricted formulary drug for a use not covered by the restriction or for quantities greater than
   allowed by established policy.
4.4. Poison Information. Contact the National Poison Center Network at (800) 222-1222. This
phone number should be readily available in patient care areas. Lexicomp® Lexi-Tox is
available throughout the facility on the MTF intranet system as a toxicology resource.
Additional applications can be downloaded via the Air Force Knowledge Exchange website,
under Air Force Medical Service Virtual Library and Overview of Services.
4.5. Drug Information. The entire staff of pharmacists will respond to questions from
healthcare professionals and patients. Generally, more complex questions and inquiries (such as
requests to use drugs off-label) should be directed to the Clinical Pharmacy staff.
4.6. Investigational Drugs.
   4.6.1. All investigational drugs are received, stored, labeled and dispensed only by the
   pharmacy. All investigational drugs will be received and inspected by the pharmacist
   preferentially or by pharmacy technician staff when a pharmacist is not available. This
   includes handling unused, expired and/or contaminated investigational drugs. Investigational
   drugs are ordered on either an AF Form 781. These forms must have all pertinent
   information pre-populated and need only the specific patient information. The request will
   be documented in the patients’ CHCS drug profile as a prescription order. The prescription
   will be packaged and labeled IAW federal law and AFI 44-102, Chapter 9.
   4.6.2. All investigational drug therapy initiated at the 59 MDW must follow protocols
   approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). If the pharmacy is expected to be utilized
   in the protocol, a pharmacy letter of support must accompany the proposed protocol when it
   is presented to the IRB. IRB approval will not be obtained prior to the acquisition of a
   pharmacy letter of support. Pharmacy personnel will follow the IRB approved protocol and
   will not deviate from it unless there is an IRB approved amendment indicating changes to
   protocol.
   4.6.3. Investigational drugs are dispensed to the patient or to the principal or associate
   investigators IAW AFI 40-402, Protection of Human Subjects in Biomedical and Behavioral
   Research.
   4.6.4. Self-Medication of Investigational Drug. When a surgical patient is provided
   treatment under an investigational drug protocol from another facility, the attending
   physician maintains the patient on the drug, if appropriate. The attending physician is
   ultimately responsible for contacting the originating facility in a timely manner, to obtain
   protocol information and materials to educate the pharmacy and nursing staffs. When a
   patient maintained on an investigational drug checks in for Ambulatory Surgery, the patient
   must bring the drug to the facility and it may be administered as a self-medication drug. The
 32                                                    59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


   physician must write an order allowing the self-medication of the investigational agent(s) in
   the electronic record or on an AF Form 3066 in the patient‘s chart according to the self-
   medication guidance in this instruction, paragraph 2.3.14.
4.7. Multidisciplinary Medication Monitoring.
   4.7.1. Responsible and efficacious medication prescribing and administration is a
   collaborative process to include all medical professionals involved in patient care. Input
   from the patient and all his/her caregivers is used to evaluate, maintain, and improve the
   patient’s drug regimen.
      4.7.1.1. Providers, clinic medical personnel, and pharmacy personnel monitor the
      therapeutic response to drugs utilizing the patient’s own perception about side effects and
      perceived efficacy, when appropriate, referring to information from the patient’s medical
      record (print or electronic), relevant laboratory results, clinical response, and medication
      profile.
   4.7.2. Pharmacy & Therapeutics Function. It is the responsibility of the providers, ancillary
   staff, and pharmacy personnel to collaborate on patient drug effects; evaluate, maintain, and
   improve patient drug regimens. The P&T Function established medication utilization policy
   and monitors numerous elements of the drug therapy process.
      4.7.2.1. The P&T is an important medical staff advisory group to the Executive
      Committee of the Medical Staff. The main focus of P&T is the acquisition and use of
      drugs at WHASC and SAMMC. Our local P&T Function is combined with SAMMC to
      form the joint SAMMC P&T Function. Specific functions include those outlined AFI 44-
      102, Chapter 9.
      4.7.2.2. The P&T Function is made up of members of the medical staff responsible for
      any and all aspects of medication use within the facility to include but not limited to
      formulary management, vaccines, controlled drug prescribing/use, authorized drug lists,
      adverse drug reaction review. Additionally, the membership at WHASC must comply
      with AFI 44-102, section 9.9.1. All clinics must ensure P&T Function does a review of
      clinic-specific medication policies and procedures prior to implementation. This
      requirement ensures a comprehensive administrative and clinical review of each drug
      therapy issue.
      4.7.2.3. Monitor Current Trends in Therapy/Formulary Additions and Selections. As
      medical therapy changes, the P&T Function will review formulary additions and
      deletions to provide and ensure that effective and efficient therapy is available for use.
          4.7.2.3.1. Requests for formulary additions are made using AF Form 2081. A
          department chairman must endorse each request. The requesting provider desiring to
          add a medication to the combined formulary must submit a new drug request packet
          to the Medication Use Evaluation (MUE). The MUE recommendations are presented
          and voted upon at the P&T meetings. New drug requests will not be considered if
          they are deemed non-formulary by the DoD P&T. Paperwork must be completed and
          turned in by the 15th of the month to be presented at the following month’s MUE
          meeting. Normally, a maximum of 3 new drug requests per month will be reviewed
          on a first come first served basis. Additional new drug requests in any given month
          will be reviewed at the discretion of the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of MUE.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                               33


         The requested medication should have an advantage over existing formulary
         medications (safer, more effective, less frequent dosing, and/or less expensive) or be
         a drug in a new pharmacologic class with clinically significant advantages over
         formulary agents. The pharmacy coordinator or their representative will verify
         documents are completed and will prepare necessary supplemental information which
         may include utilization data, pricing and an economic impact estimate. The request
         will be presented by the requesting provider or a delegate at the monthly MUE
         meeting after which the request will be reviewed and recommendations forwarded to
         P&T. The requestor or delegate will also present the request at the following P&T
         meeting, where it will be voted on for formulary addition. The P&T Function also
         reviews high volume special purchase drugs for potential formulary addition, again
         with MUE recommendations.
  4.7.3. Preprinted Doctors Order Forms (Overprints). Clinics submit requests for overprinted
  order forms involving medications up their chain of command with coordination and
  approval through the 59 Pharmacy Squadron Commander or designee. These forms must be
  approved by the Medical Records Committee and a designated pharmacy representative prior
  to implementation.
  4.7.4. Emergency Kits. The P&T Function approves medications to be stocked in all
  emergency drug kits. Input from the Resuscitation Committee is required for changes to the
  crash cart drug list.
  4.7.5. Medication Use Evaluation. The MUE is a medical staff responsibility and is a
  subcommittee of the joint WHASC/SAMMC P&T. The committee serves as an advisory
  committee to the P&T and is focused on medication use and formulary management. The
  MUE will evaluate the use of drugs within this facility against established criteria.
  Established criteria are approved before the evaluation is done. These reviews may be
  conducted by specific drug, drug class, department, procedure or diagnosis. Any area of the
  medication management process may also be evaluated for appropriateness.
     4.7.5.1. Chair/Deputy Chair/Coordinators/Members: The San Antonio Military
     Healthcare Systems MUE Subcommittee is composed of a chairperson, a deputy
     chairperson, a SAMMC and a WHASC Coordinator, and group/service/department
     representatives. The chairperson and deputy chairperson are physician prescribers who
     work together in conducting monthly meetings and approving the minutes of the
     meetings. Coordinators are pharmacists who are responsible for the administrative
     aspects of the MUE process to include acting as recorder, report generators and liaisons
     between the chair/deputy chair and the MUE Subcommittee members. Representative
     makeup of the subcommittee should balance group dynamics, MTF representation, and
     task-oriented effectiveness. Consideration is given to medical, surgical, nursing, and
     pharmacy aspects of medication use.             The physician representatives of a
     group/service/department will represent SAMMC and WHASC and coordinate data
     gathering and information within their group/service/department.
     4.7.5.2. Attendance. All MUE members are asked to commit to at least one year of
     service to the MUE Subcommittee. Members are required to be present for every
     meeting or have a delegate representative. Any MUE members with a consistent lack of
     participation and/or lack of appointed delegates in their absence will be asked to resign
 34                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


       their membership in the committee and a new member will be recommended for
       selection.
       4.7.5.3. Formulary Review. MUE will complete an annual review of the entire
       combined formulary. The focus of this review is to decide whether to add or delete
       medications to/from the formulary. The MUE committee makes recommendations to the
       P&T. Subsequently, the P&T may decide if and how patients and/or providers need to be
       notified of a change in formulary status of formulary medications. MUE will ensure that
       the combined formulary reflects the recommendations set forth by the DoD PEC to
       include formulary additions and deletions. Other recommendations for formulary
       changes may be generated through other means such as non-formulary usage reviews,
       budget analysis, or safety data. Formulary review should be coordinated with the PEC
       review schedule in order to prevent medication changes at the local level that are not in
       alignment with DoD policies.
       4.7.5.4. Formulary Alignment.     MUE will attempt to align SAMMC and WHASC
       formularies.
4.8. Adverse Reactions. The Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) program reports and reviews
significant drug reactions to identify opportunities to improve drug use and reduce recurrences.
   4.8.1. An ADR is any noxious or unintended response to a medication resulting in change of
   therapy, hospital admission, increased length of stay or death (including vaccine adverse
   events). This definition shall include discontinuation of drug, additional treatment such as
   supportive therapy or antidotes, increased morbidity, death, temporary or permanent
   disability or increased length of hospitalization. Reactions not reported as ADRs include
   investigational drugs reactions (reported through the principle investigator), blood
   transfusion reactions (unless a defect in the anticoagulant substances or equipment), reactions
   to certain biologicals as monitored by United States Public Health Service, and poisonings.
   ADR reporting focuses on "unexpected" reactions, even when the reaction is not severe.
       4.8.1.1. It is the responsibility of any and all 59 MDW members to report
       ADRs. The three methods of reporting ADRs are through the ADR phone line (292-
       DRUG), by entering “adverse drug reaction” into the medication ordering field of
       AHLTA, or submitting a 59 MDW Form 2957, Adverse Drug Reaction Report via
       encrypted e-mail to the Clinical Support Pharmacy.
       4.8.1.2. Pharmacy personnel shall classify ADRs according to severity as follows: mild
       (no change in therapy, decreased dose, held or discontinued suspected drug), moderate
       (antidote or treatment required or prolonged length of stay by at least one day) and
       serious (need intensive medical care, caused permanent harm, or patient death).
       Probability is rated Highly Probable, Probable, Possible, and Doubtful. Preventability
       is rated yes or no. Reportable to FDA is rated yes or no. If an ADR is deemed
       “preventable,” recommendations are developed and corrective process(es) implemented
       to prevent or reduce the chance of future reoccurrences.
       4.8.1.3. Pharmacy personnel report significant ADRs to the FDA through the
       Medwatch® program https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/medwatch-
       online.htm. FDA reportable ADRs include serious (life threatening, permanently
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                  35


       disabling or death) reactions to drugs approved or released in the past three years, and
       reactions that are not previously described in literature.
       4.8.1.4. Pharmacy personnel ensure that copies of the ADR are disseminated for
       inclusion in the outpatient record, the dental record, the surgical record (if a surgical
       ADR), the Urgent Care Department record (if an UCC ADR), and entered in the CHCS
       system to prevent reoccurrences. Following serious ADRs, Risk Management and
       Medical Law are consulted concerning the requirement to secure patient medical records
       and take statements from involved parties.
   4.8.2. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) at (1-800-822-7967) is
   available to all professional staff. VAERS is a voluntary reporting program administered by
   the FDA. VAERS reports can be submitted by any member of the medical staff or any
   patient. VAERS reports are reported to the P&T Function, Risk Management, FDA
   (VAERS), Force Public Health (local), Air Force Medical Operations Agency, and
   AETC/SGPM (MAJCOM Clinical POC).

       4.8.2.5. 59 MDW members report adverse reactions to vaccines using the VAERS
       reporting form. Within the wing, VAERS reports are managed the same as ADRs to
       include annotation in patients’ records, the CHCS system, and P&T Function review.
       4.8.2.6. VAERS reports focus on any "unexpected" vaccine reaction. Additionally, a
       VAERS report (Form VAERS-1) is generated when vaccine reaction(s) result in
       hospitalization or when 24 hours lost duty time occurs.
4.9. Drug Recalls. Medical Materiel notifies the facility of the recall by disseminating a
Medical Material Quality Control Message via multiple routes including pharmacy logistics.
Upon receipt of the recall notice, the pharmacy staff member will obtain the drug’s identification
to include generic name, trade name, strength, dosage form, size, manufacturer, and lot number.
   4.9.1. Drug recall information is disseminated to the medical staff using e-mail and the P&T
   Quick.
 36                                                      59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


   4.9.2. Recalled items are returned to Pharmacy logistics for quarantine or destruction. A tag
   is prepared for each affected drug. The tag states the reason and authority for quarantine and
   the product remains in quarantine until disposition instructions are received.
   4.9.3. If required, pharmacy support personnel will remove the affected drug from
   dispensing stock in all pharmacies; clinics outside the pharmacy that stock the affected drug
   will be notified and instructed on how to handle the medication. If the drug's use caused or
   may cause injury or death, prescription and computer profiles must be reviewed and patients
   directed how to return the suspected drug to the pharmacy. If warranted by the drug recall,
   patients with current prescriptions on file in the pharmacy computer for the affected drug will
   be contacted and advised of the drug recall issue.
   4.9.4. Depending on the level of recall, pharmacy support personnel will contact each clinic
   stocking the drug and provide information concerning the recalled product. If manning and
   inventory permits, the pharmacy staff will conduct an exchange of good stock for the recalled
   item in each clinic. When the recall notification is after normal duty hours, weekends or
   holidays, each nursing area will be asked to return the item to the pharmacy.
4.10. Pharmaceutical Representatives/Drug Samples. Pharmaceutical representatives must
report to Medical Materiel immediately upon entering the facility. 59 MDWI 23-102, Polices for
Pharmaceutical Representatives and Commercial Vendors, details procedures for
pharmaceutical representatives and steps required to obtain a mandatory visitor badge from
Medical Materiel.
   4.10.1. Pharmaceutical representatives must sign a letter (Attachment 8) regarding detailing
   and drug samples at Pharmacy Administration where it will remain on file. If this letter is
   already on file from a previous visit, it will be regarded as a current letter.
   4.10.2. Medication samples are not authorized in the 59 MDW at any time. If a
   pharmaceutical representative offers a provider medication samples, the provider should
   report the representative to the pharmacy. Samples will not be authorized for clinic ADL or
   stock/use in any clinic. Any non-authorized medication found during pharmacy clinic
   inspection, including samples, will be returned to the pharmacy form destruction.
4.11. Medication Errors. A medication error is a situation when any drug leaves the confines
or control of the medical/professional staff bearing a mistake such that the patient, drug, dosage
form, dosage strength, or directions that are either labeled, dispensed, administered incorrectly or
omitted, regardless of potential outcome.
   4.11.1. Each medication error in which the patient actually ingested medication must be
   reported to the prescriber. Additionally, each error must be reported using the web-based
   DoD Patient Safety Reporting application which can be accessed via the 59 MDW
   SharePoint Hotlinks.
   4.11.2. Medication errors within the facility are tracked and trended by the Patient Safety
   Committee and trends reported at least quarterly to the P&T. If trends are identified,
   pharmacy will develop an action plan to prevent or reduce the likelihood of the trend
   continuing.
4.12. Drug Defect Reporting. Any MTF staff member identifying a defective drug must send
or deliver that product to the Pharmacy Clinical/Support Flight.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                    37


   4.12.1. The Pharmacy Clinical/Support Flight will complete the appropriate documentation
   which will be forwarded to the Medical Logistics Flight.
   4.12.2. The Pharmacy Clinical/Support Pharmacy will coordinate with the vendor and
   Medical Logistics Flight for quality problems and adverse medical events. The pharmacy
   officer in charge or designee will submit a report for product quality issues and/or adverse
   medical events to MEDWATCH by phone [800] FDA-1088), fax ([800] FDA-0178), mail
   (MEDWATCH, FDA, HF-2, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857), or online
   http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch .
4.13. Expired Medication. Clinic medication areas should be self-inspected for proper storage,
expiration dates, etc. at least monthly. Pharmacy will also conduct a thorough clinic inspection
every month and notify clinic personnel of outcome upon completion. see Clinic Inspection
checklist Medication may be used up to the date of expiration. Any MTF staff member
discovering expired or short dated medications (expiring within 30 days by local policy) must
separate that item away from general stock so that it will not be mistakenly given to a patient. If
the medication is not a controlled drug, it should be placed in a container (such as a zip-lock bag)
that has “EXPIRED MEDICATION” written on it, and returned (hand delivered or via the tube
system) to the Pharmacy as soon as possible. If the medication is controlled, then the procedures
in paragraph 3.4.7. must be followed.
   4.13.1. The Pharmacy Support Flight will coordinate return or destruction of expired
   medication with an authorized through reverse distribution.
4.14. Look-alike and Sound-alike Drugs. A list of these medications has been identified by
P&T. The list is available on the 59 MDW Sharepoint Homepage. Descriptions of precautions
are identified in 59 MDWI 44-130.
4.15. Pharmaceutical Waste Disposal. All pharmaceutical waste with the exception of
chemotherapeutic and radioactive agents will be considered medical hazardous waste and
disposed of in accordance with 59 MDWI 32-7001 and the Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland
Hazardous Waste Management Plan. Pharmaceutical waste is any item such as intravenous
bags, tubing sets, vials or needleless syringes that contain traces of unused medications. The
pharmaceutical waste will be placed in red bins or red trash bags with the hazardous waste
symbol. Additionally, specific pharmaceuticals which have been identified as hazardous are
disposed of in the black waste bins. The red bins or bags will be removed by Housekeeping on a
daily basis. For additional pick-up, Housekeeping should be contacted. Black bin disposal is
coordinated to be collected by Civil Engineering.

Terms

Abbreviations and Symbols—To minimize errors, the use of abbreviations is discouraged.
Providers are encouraged to write out all medication names. The 59 MDW list of “do not use”
abbreviations (DNUA) is found in 59 MDWI 44-130, as is the process to follow to clarify “do
not use” abbreviation orders.

Controlled Pharmacy Areas—The 59 MDW pharmacies are controlled areas with unescorted
access limited to pharmacy personnel. Other persons will be escorted at all times. Pharmacy
personnel allowed to deactivate the alarm systems will be identified in writing for each location.

Drug Allergy—Registration of drug allergies is required for all patients. All providers shall
document/change allergies through the AHLTA database at every opportunity.
Drugs, Biologicals, and Blood Products—Strict standards govern the control and storage of
drugs, biologicals, and blood products within operating rooms, clinics, pharmacies and
dispensaries.

Food-Drug Interactions—Policy and procedures regarding food-drug interactions are addressed
in 59MDWI 44-125, Nutrient-Drug Interactions.

Formulary—WHASC has a medication formulary or list of medications routinely available for
ordering/dispensing. WHASC providers are required by AFI 44-102 to prescribe from this list to
the maximum extent possible. This formulary is available via CHCS and in an on-line format on
the 59 MDW Intranet homepage at http://online.lexi.com/lco?siteid=59 The formulary is
reviewed at least annually, either in part or in total.

Infection Control—In an effort to minimize the risk of health care-associated infections, all
pharmacy staff will comply with current Center for Disease Control and Prevention hand
hygiene guidelines. All pharmacy staff will wash hands with an antiseptic approved by the
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                     41


infection control committee IAW 59MDWI 44-157, Infection Prevention and Control Program
or as directed by current recognized pharmacy practice standards.

Licensed Independent Practitioner—Licensed Independent Practitioners are defined as any
individual permitted by law and by the organization to provide care and services, without
direction or supervision, within the scope of the individual’s license and consistent with
individually granted clinical privileges. When standards reference the term “licensed
independent practitioner”, this language is not to be construed to limit the authority of a licensed
independent practitioner to delegate tasks to other qualified healthcare personnel (for example,
physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses) to the extent authorized by state
law or a state’s regulatory mechanism or federal guidelines and organizational policy. Further
guidance is provided in 59MDWI 44-105, 59 MDW Trainee Supervision Policy.

Metric and Apothecary Conversion—The metric system will be used for all medication orders.
Charts are available in drug preparation areas on the reverse side of the prescription pads, AF
Form 781.

Pharmacist Availability—WHASC no longer has on-call pharmacists and therefore are not
available 24/7.

Product Selection—Pharmacy routinely changes drug strength, instructions and quantities of
prescriptions without contacting the 59 MDW provider if the same dose strength (e.g.,
milligrams) is obtained by giving a multiple or divided portion, such as two tablets in place of a
single tablet.

LESSON PLAN: STERILE PRODUCT COMPOUNDING OUTSIDE LAMINAR FLOW
                 HOODS (I.E. OUTSIDE OF PHARMACY)

A4.1. General Principles of Sterile Compounding.
   A4.1.1. When an on-site, licensed pharmacy is available, only the pharmacy compounds or
   admixes all sterile medications, intravenous admixtures, or other drugs except in emergencies
   or when not feasible (for example, when the product’s stability is extremely short).
   A4.1.2. Staff uses safety materials and equipment while preparing hazardous medications.
   A4.1.3. Staff uses techniques to assure accuracy in medication preparation.
   A4.1.4. Staff members follow techniques to avoid contamination during medication
   preparation including, but not limited to the following:
       A4.1.4.1. Use clean or sterile techniques.
       A4.1.4.2. Maintain clean, uncluttered, and functionally separate areas for product
       preparation to minimize the possibility of contamination.
       A4.1.4.3. Using a laminar airflow hood or other class 100 environment while preparing
       any IV admixture in the pharmacy, any sterile product made from nonsterile ingredients,
       or any sterile product that will not be used within 24 hours
       A4.1.4.4. Visually inspect the integrity of the medications.
A4.2. There is proper ventilation, lighting, and temperature control in all pharmaceutical
preparation areas.
A4.3. When preparing IV admixtures outside the clean-air environment of a Laminar Flow
Hood, all personnel will use the following procedures.
   A4.3.1. Check all ingredients for proper dosage and incompatibilities prior to mixing.
   A4.3.2. Check with the Ambulatory Surgery Pharmacy for all compatibility questions,
   especially for IV solutions and drugs given via Volu-Trol or “Y” injection site, prior to
   mixing or adding anything to IV or parenteral admixtures previously prepared in the
   pharmacy.
   A4.3.3. Only use a designated area for IV preparation that is clear of any other items, is
   clearly marked, and is only used to make IVs.
A4.4. To aid in maintaining aseptic technique while admixing IV solutions, take the following
steps:
   A4.4.1. Clean the work area immediately prior to compounding IV in accordance with
   59MDWI 44-157, approved disinfecting agents, and keep the work area clear of patient
   specimens of any kind at all times.
   A4.4.2. Wash hands with an antiseptic approved by the Infection Control Committee or in
   accordance with 59MDWI 44-157, before each compounding session.

  A4.4.3. Check all IV containers for cracks, outside moisture and visible particulate matter.
  Solution bottles must have a vacuum present prior to the initial injection of the drug. IV bags
  must be checked for leaks by gently applying pressure.
  A4.4.4. Container drug entry ports, drug vials and ampoules will be swabbed with sterile
  isopropyl alcohol wipes.
  A4.4.5. Prepare admixtures as close to their intended administration time as possible. Check
  prepared solutions immediately for clarity, visible particulate matter, gas release
  (effervescence) and color change.
  A4.4.6. Place a “medication added” label on each admixture solution with the name and
  amount of the drug or drugs added, patient name and DOB, time and date of solution
  preparation and the initials of the person preparing the admixture. If no pre-existing
  pharmacy IV label is affixed to the container, label IAW 59MDWI 44-115, paragraph. 2.3.4.
  A4.4.7. Magic markers or ink pens must NOT be used to mark plastic IV bags because of
  the tendency of the ink to bleed through the plastic into the IV solution thereby
  contaminating it.
  A4.4.8. Do not hang IV solutions (with or without drugs added) past their beyond-use time
  or longer than 24 hours, whichever comes first.
  A4.4.9. Just prior to administration of the admixture, perform a last quality check to verify
  the physician’s order for proper ingredients and amount of each drug. Visually check the
  solution again for clarity, precipitates, color changes, etc.

               LESSON PLAN: CLINIC MEDICATION MANAGEMENT

A5.1. Drug Security.
   A5.1.1. Unit Dose. Do not leave abandoned (unlocked) unit dose carts in hallways.
   A5.1.2. Refrigerators. Check each duty day and record temperature monitoring results;
   maintain records for one full year. Clinic personnel are instructed to contact the pharmacy if
   medication refrigerator temperatures fall out of range for any period of time.
      A5.1.2.1. Refrigeration for medication is maintained at a temperature between two (2) to
      eight (8) degrees Celsius (36 to 46 Fahrenheit). If a refrigerator does not have an alarm,
      then the department must check ALL refrigerators within their section and record results
      on a temperature control log each business day.
      A5.1.2.2. For those areas that are NOT open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and store
      medication in refrigerators in their areas, ALL these refrigerators must have temperature
      range monitor mechanism if a clinc is unable to manually conduct and record a
      refrigerator check after business hours. The clinic must review the monitor’s temperature
      range upon arrival after closure of the clinic (after being closed for nights, weekends, or
      holidays) as it is the clinic’s responsibility to review and document that the temperature
      from the previous day and during non-duty time periods that the temperature was either
      in an acceptable range.
      A5.1.2.3. If the refrigeration temperatures fall outside the recommended range, clinic
      personnel must contact WHASC facility management to correct the refrigeration
      problem(s) AND the pharmacy for information on whether the drugs and/or biologicals
      are acceptable for use. Actions taken must be documented on the temperature control
      log.
      A5.1.2.4. If the temperature was out of range during the time the clinic was closed, they
      are to take the same steps as if they had found an abnormal temperature during their daily
      checks (use 59 MDW Form 2942). Actions taken must be documented on the
      temperature control log.
   A5.1.3. Code Carts. Must be secured with tamper tags (breakable lock) and inspected as
   directed in 59MDWI 44-142, Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center Code Blue
   Management.
      A5.1.3.1. Log sheets must be identical from clinic to clinic, completely filled out with
      the numbers listed on the crash cart log sheet corresponding to the number on the
      breakaway lock.
   A5.1.4. Code Cart Kits. Each kit (as discussed in 59MDWI 44-142) must have a breakable
   lock with drug expiration dates stated on the outside of the container.
      A5.1.4.1. Inspection is documented using the 59 MDW Form 2995, Daily/Monthly Code
      Cart Checklist with documentation, the same as if each kit were a crash cart (date and
      initials must be annotated on checklist).
 54                                                     59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013


      A5.1.4.2. Report drug security violations and/or concerns to any pharmacy flight
      commander.
A5.2. Authorized Drug List.
   A5.2.1. Only medications approved for stocking in a particular clinic, as listed on the ADL,
   are authorized for stock and only in the authorized quantities. All other medications must be
   returned to pharmacy. Pharmacy and Medical Logistics will not issue any medication that is
   not listed on a unit’s ADL. All controlled medication shall be issued to a clinic by the
   pharmacy as Medical Logistics is not authorized to issue schedule II-IV medications to
   anyone other than the pharmacy (AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support) with the exception
   of war reserve materiel.
   A5.2.2. Drug Kits. P&T Function must approve changes in medication stock (this includes
   the Critical Care Air Transport Team bags
   A5.2.3. Annual review of ADL by P&T Function.
   A5.2.4. Pharmacy will send ADL activity list for clinic review.
   A5.2.5. If rarely requested, a drug should be deleted from the ADL.
   A5.2.6. Concentrated KCl was removed from all clinics and will NOT be stocked on any
   clinic.
   A5.2.7. Drug samples from pharmaceutical companies are NOT authorized.
A5.3. Controlled Drug Wastage.
   A5.3.1. If a controlled drug is not used, or is only partially used, the nurse or provider must
   immediately waste the drug and clearly document the quantity wasted (see paragraph. 3.4.8.).
   A5.3.2. A second person (authorized to handle controlled drugs) must witness/annotate each
   destruction immediately, whether it be within an electronic dispensing system (i.e. PYXIS®)
   or on paper (AF Form 579).
   A5.3.3. Document wastage of complete or partial doses of controlled drug.
   A5.3.4. If drug was obtained using the PYXIS® system, may document using PYXIS®.
   A5.3.5. If PYXIS® is not available, wastage should be documented on AF Form 579 or 59
   MDW Form 3486.
   A5.3.6. Additionally, may document on any approved medication administration record
   form.
   A5.3.7. Must be witnessed by person certified able to administer or destroy controlled drugs.
A5.4. STAT Orders.
   A5.4.1. All STAT orders, once scanned or tubed to pharmacy, should immediately
   accompanied by a telephone call to the Ambulatory Surgical pharmacy to ensure the order
   was received
   A5.4.2. Ensure legibility. STAT orders are often received with illegible patient name and/or
   clinic identifiers; in such instances pharmacy personnel frequently do not know where to
   send the medication order, therefore unnecessarily delaying patient care.
59THMDWI44-115 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                    55


A5.5. Multiple Dose Vials.
   A5.5.1. Discard multi-dose vials no more than 28 days after the initial puncture (see
   paragraph 3.1.5.1) or when contamination is suspected. Label with BUD
   A5.5.2. Do not refrigerate unless indicated by manufacturer (always remember to date, time,
   and initial vials upon initial entry).
   A5.5.3. Discard single dose vials (e.g. ampicillin 1 gram vial) after removing the first dose.
A5.6. Medication Inspections.
   A5.6.1. For clinics, exam rooms, kits, trays, etc, clinic staff members are responsible for
   regular medication inspections, ensuring items are in date, usable condition and appropriately
   stored.
   A5.6.2. Pharmacy personnel serve as an additional set of eyes. Inspected clinics are
   evaluated on overall drug management/security, using the Clinic Inspection Checklist
   (Attachment 6).
   A5.6.3. First failures of any checklist items result in a clinic write-up and verbal education.
   A5.6.4. Second repeat failures result in a clinic write-up and letter to squadron commander.
   A5.6.5. Third repeat failures result in a clinic write-up and letter to group commander.

                 PHARMACEUTICAL HAZARDOUS WASTE PRODUCTS

A7.1. In addition to the following list, any drug considered to be a cytotoxic chemotherapy
agent is treated as hazardous material. Expired hazardous drugs are returned to the pharmacy,
then returned to the pharmaceutical contractor for credit or disposal. Generated hazardous drug
waste that cannot be returned to the contractor (e.g. drug that has been diluted in IV fluids,
tubing from used administration sets) is coordinated by 59 MDW Facilities Management through
802d CES/CEV (phone 671-4844 or 671-0331).

          DETAILING AND DRUG SAMPLES POLICY: PHARMACEUTICAL
                           REPRESENTATIVES

A8.1. Detailing Policies. Detailing pharmaceutical products at WHASC is a privilege. Each
pharmaceutical representative is expected to represent their company in a professional and
ethical manner, and abide by Air Force and 59 MDW policies. Representatives will inform 59
MDW pharmacy personnel in advance as to what products they will be detailing. If a product is
on the formulary, representatives are expected to detail the medication according to the
guidelines established by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Function regardless of any additional
guidelines that may be approved, or are under review, by the Food and Drug Administration.
When detailing non-formulary medications, each representative will make the provider clearly
aware of the fact that the medication is not available on the formulary. Military Medical
Treatment Facility (MTF) providers are the only individuals who may request medications be
added to the formulary. If providers have questions regarding this process, they should contact
the Pharmacy, not a pharmaceutical representative. Only personnel in Medical Logistics are
authorized to obligate government funds for purchases. Any purchase requests need to be
coordinated with both Pharmacy and Medical Logistics personnel.
A8.2. Medication Samples. Samples (Legend or OTC) will not be brought into WHASC for
any reason. Any samples found in clinics or provider offices, regardless of how they were
introduced to the MTF, will subject the provider, the representative, and the company to
penalties.
A8.3. Penalties Impacting Representatives and Companies. Failure to follow these
guidelines will result in curtailment of detailing privileges. Curtailment of privileges will result
in notifications being mailed to the representative, and District and National Federal Sales
Directors. The representative’s privileges may be curtailed for twelve months for the first
offense. A second offense may result in curtailment of all detailing privileges for all
representatives associated with the company for twelve months.

              DETAILING AND DRUG SAMPLES POLICY: PROVIDERS

A9.1. Detailing Policies. Detailing pharmaceutical products at WHASC is a privilege. Each
