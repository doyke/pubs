in 1939 as an aviator and served successive tours as a bomber pilot with 49 combat missions. He entered
the logistics and materiel management field in 1942 as project officer for B-25, B-26, B-29 and B-35
bombers. In 1962, after several command and staff tours, General Gerrity was named Deputy Chief of

ship and vision drove numerous management initiatives that ensured aircraft, missiles and support equip-
ment operated at top efficiency.

his association with the military in 1942 when he served with the U.S. Navy in various capacities as Exec-

riel in 1959. In that same year, he was appointed to the position of Secretary of the Air Force where he

ation of the Office of Missile and Satellite Systems, the forerunner of the National Reconnaissance Office.
