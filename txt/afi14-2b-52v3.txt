                        EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. Qualified external intelligence trainers (EIT), as addressed in AFI14-2B-52,
Volume 2, will conduct external intelligence training. External training includes threat
knowledge, visual recognition (VR), collection and reporting (C&R) and personnel recovery
(PR) for both conventional and nuclear-related missions under AFGSC authorities. External
training for aircrew will be coordinated through the wing/group and squadron Weapons and
Tactics Flight or Officer. The SIO may determine if other unit personnel require external
training and will modify training requirements as appropriate. (T-2)
3.2. SIO EIT Responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an external intelligence training program tailored to the unit’s mission,
   weapons system, projected tasked operations plans (OPLANs), conventional wartime/Air
   Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings, and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint, in writing, an External Intelligence Training Program Manager to oversee
   program execution. The EIT Program Manager may be the same person as the Intelligence
   Personnel Training Program Manager (see AFI 14-2B-52, Volume 1). Where assigned, the
   USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) graduate will be directly involved in
   development and execution of the external intelligence training program. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Build an effective training program with input from operational squadrons, weapons
   and tactics representatives, the Nuclear Executive Manager, Aircrew Flight Equipment
   (AFE) personnel, SF personnel, AF Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI), and Survival,
   Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
   3.2.4. Ensure only qualified EITs conduct unsupervised intelligence training events. EIT
   specialization training requirements and evaluation criteria are identified in AFI 14-2B-52,
   Volumes 1 and 2. (T-2)
   3.2.5. Coordinate the external intelligence training written guidance with the OG/CC,

   certification B-52 assigned crew three questions (if more than one crew is presented to the
   board). One question will be addressed to the pilot and copilot; one to the Electronic
   Weapons Officer, and the third to the entire crew. Questions will be based upon information
   contained in the MQF but will be phrased in order to gauge the aircrew’s comprehension and
   use of the information as it relates to mission accomplishment and survivability within the
   given scenario. Repeat until all B-52 assigned crews are queried. When the board chair
   requests EIT assessment of results, provide clear recommendations based upon the written
   test results and responses to the board questions for each B-52 assigned crew.
   Recommendations will also be recorded in a memorandum for record and maintained in the
   unit’s record management system.

3. The annual Intelligence Conventional MQF test was administered on 15 Jan 2007. All CMR
aircrew have taken the 100 question test. While not all aircrew personnel have obtained the
minimum passing score of 85 percent for conventional mission areas the first time around, all
tests have been corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 aircrew members took the test. The
initial average test score for the squadron was 95 percent.

                missed
4. The annual intelligence EWO MQF test was administered on 18 Jan 2007. All certified pilots
have taken the 50 question test. Not all pilots obtained the required 100% passing score.
However, EIT reviews on missed items and follow-on testing of missed test areas resulted in
100% passing. A total of 25 pilots took the test. The average test score before remedial training
and retest was 92%.

                missed
5. The most commonly missed questions in the conventional mission area were #5, 8, 13, 14 and
21. After further review of questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because
they were poorly worded and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-
2, SA-6, and MiG-29, respectively. The most commonly missed questions in the EWO mission
area were #5, 7, 8, 12 and 18. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-20, Kh-102, and Su-24
nuclear capabilities, respectively. Questions 12 and 18 focused on collection and reporting
procedures of nuclear-relevant events. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis
on these threat systems and procedures during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of
the test questions and how many times each question was missed.
