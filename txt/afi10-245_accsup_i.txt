                                           Chapter 1

                       AIR FORCE ANTITERRORISM PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force Antiterrorism Program. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures
for the Air Force (AF) Antiterrorism (AT) Program supporting the Department of Defense
(DOD) AT Program. The program seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts against the
AF by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating timely threat information, providing
training to all AF members, developing comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist
incidents, allocating funds and personnel and implementing AT measures.
   1.1.1. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility and must be thoroughly
   integrated into every unit mission. Commanders must continually review their AT posture to
   keep current with changing policies and threat levels. Risk management is the key when
   determining vulnerabilities and resource prioritization. Any threat or potential vulnerability
   with risk that cannot be controlled to an acceptable level must be forwarded to the next level
   in the chain of command for resolution. AT also requires every individual's participation to
   maintain awareness, practice personal security measures and report suspicious activity.
   1.1.2. Countering the Threat. Countering the terrorist threat requires a fully integrated and
   coordinated AT approach with a number of key areas that include at a minimum: Civil
   Engineers (Readiness and Emergency Management, Facilities Engineering, Explosive
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Fire Emergency Services), chemical, biological, radiological,
   nuclear and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) defense, Services (food), Public Affairs,
   Communications, Intelligence, Operations, Security Forces, Surgeon General, Judge
   Advocate, Comptroller and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). AT
   programs should be coordinated with overarching efforts to achieve protection, such as Force
   Protection (FP), critical infrastructure protection and continuity of operations, as described in
   Joint Publication (JP) 3-07.2, Antiterrorism.
   1.1.2. (ACC) Countering the Threat. The Installation Antiterrorism Officer (ATO), as the
   commander’s antiterrorism advisor, is a critical member of the aforementioned group to
   counter the threat.
   1.1.3. DOD Policy. DODD 2000.12, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Program, establishes the
   DOD policies and responsibilities for the implementation of the DOD AT Program. It
   establishes DODI 2000.16, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, and DOD O-2000.12-H,
   Antiterrorism Handbook. The DOD AT Program is a sub-element of Combating Terrorism
   (CbT). Combating Terrorism is a pillar of FP.
       1.1.3.1. An active AT program utilizes DOD AT Standards prescribed in DODI 2000.16
       as baseline standards. AF AT Standards in Chapter 2 of this document incorporate and
       supplement the DoD AT Standards and provide AF specific guidance.
          1.1.3.1.1. Geographic Combatant Commander AT policy precedence. In accordance
          with the Unified Command Plan (UCP) and DODD 2000.12, the Geographic
          Combatant Commander (GCC) AT policies take precedence over the AT policies and
          programs of any other DOD Component operating or existing in the GCC area of
          responsibility (AOR) except for those under the security responsibility of a Chief of
6                                                  AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


           Mission (CoM), to include exercising tactical control (TACON) for FP. TACON for
           FP is in addition to a Combatant Commander’s normal exercise of operation control
           (OPCON) over assigned forces. All DOD personnel traveling into a GCC’s AOR
           shall familiarize themselves and comply with all AOR-specific AT policies. AF
           Components to GCCs bridge gaps between GCC and AF policies. In the application
           of AT policy the more restrictive guidance will be applied.
    1.1.4. Non-DOD Tenants on AF Property. Commanders shall ensure that there is a host
    tenant agreement with all non-DOD tenants on AF property and that it specifically obligates
    the non-DOD tenant to comply with the AT requirements in this AFI. Non-DOD tenants on
    an AF installation, facility or other AF property will be incorporated into, comply with and
    support installation security and AT Program requirements. Non-DOD tenants on AF
    property must comply with all aspects of the AT Program addressed in this Instruction and
    other AT guidance documents unless the facility is outside of the installation controlled
    perimeter; DOD personnel occupy less than 25% of the facility’s net interior useable area in
    accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism
    Standards for Buildings; and the installation commander determines AT compliance is not
    required for that facility.
    1.1.5. Overseas Travel. All AF military personnel, civilians, dependent family members and
    contractors when supporting DOD operations in accordance with contract provisions and
    outside of the United States shall comply with theater, country and special clearance
    requirements (AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, and DOD
    4500.54-M, DOD Foreign Clearance Manual) before traveling outside the continental
    United States (OCONUS).
    1.1.5. (ACC) Overseas Travel. Commanders will ensure combatant commander and
    foreign clearance guide requirements are met, and required country travel briefs have been
    conducted and documented, when personnel are going on leave outside the continental
    United States (to include Mexico and Canada). Personnel are encouraged to complete the
    appropriate country travel briefs (website referenced in Paragraph 2.29.2.) to ensure their
    safety when travel plans have the possibility of day/short trips into a foreign county.
    1.1.6. Eagle Eyes. The Eagle Eyes program is an Air Force AT defensive program created
    to enhance the collection of threat information by educating members of the Total Force and
    off-base citizens on the nature of terrorist attack-planning activities. Eagle Eyes is a
    command responsibility and requires every individual's participation to maintain awareness,
    practice personal security measures and report suspicious behavior. Every AF installation
    will establish procedures to receive reports of suspicious behavior or indications of terrorist
    activity.
    1.1.6. (ACC) Eagle Eyes. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) will
    administer the program with assistance from security forces (SF), the ATO, and the Air
    Combat Command (ACC) Threat Information Fusion Cell (TIFC). The local AFOSI duty
    agent is the primary point of contact during off-duty hours for Eagle Eyes reporting with the
    local Base Defense Operations Center and/or Security Forces Control Center serving as
    backup if the duty agent is unavailable. Eagle Eyes notifications will be disseminated to
    AFOSI, local security forces squadron (SFS), the installation ATO, and the ACC TIFC
    (acc.tifc@langley.af.mil) to ensure information awareness.

1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. General. AF commanders or civilian equivalent directors assigned AT responsibility
   shall establish active AT programs using DOD AT Standards prescribed in DODI 2000.16 as
   baseline standards to reduce vulnerability to terrorism. AF unique requirements contained in
   this Instruction supplement DOD AT Standards.
       1.2.1.1. Major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOAs), direct
       reporting units (DRUs), AF Components to the GCC, component-numbered AFs (C-
       NAFs), numbered AFs (NAFs), wings, installation and self-supported separate facilities
       and commanders or civilian equivalent directors assigned AT responsibility shall have an
       AT program tailored to the local mission, conditions, terrorist threat and national security
       environment.
          1.2.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Geographically separated units (GSU) attached to an
          installation will comply with, and be included in the respective AT plan. Stand-alone
          GSUs will develop and maintain a viable AT program IAW AFI 10-245 as
          supplemented.
          1.2.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Numbered Air Forces (NAF)/Component-NAFs (C-NAF)
          shall have an active AT program designed to oversee subordinate installation(s) AT
          programs.
       1.2.1.2. Supplements to this instruction by AF activities, such as MAJCOM or
       installation supplements, shall identify AT specific operational responsibilities.
       Responsibilities shall include the scope of AT programs for facilities and operations that
       do not meet the legal definition of an installation, e.g. recruiting offices, Rapid Engineer
       Deployable Heavy Operations Repair Squadron (RED HORSE) at Guam and other
       geographic separated units (GSUs).
       1.2.1.3. AF activities and action to combat terrorism shall support the GCC as they
       exercise overall responsibility for AT within their respective AOR. Ensure such
       activities and actions comply with applicable status of forces agreements (SOFA) and the
       DOD Foreign Clearance Manual.
       1.2.1.4. All commanders have the authority and responsibility to enforce appropriate
       security measures to ensure the protection of DOD elements and personnel subject to
       their control while pursuing mission accomplishment and shall ensure the AT awareness
       and readiness of all DOD elements and personnel assigned or attached.
       1.2.1.5. For more effective host nation (HN) support commanders shall, as appropriate:
          1.2.1.5.1. Ensure HN and/or civil support agreements for AT mutual support are
          established and exercised with HN/civil support.
          1.2.1.5.2. If required HN/civil support agreements to support AT are not established
          and implemented, up-channel notification of the situation to MAJCOMs and/or AF
          Components to GCCs, who shall determine if the GCC has agreements established.
          If not, document the shortfall and inform the AF/A7S.
          1.2.1.5.3. Ensure procedures for information sharing are established and
          implemented within the commander’s span of control in accordance with GCC or
          CoM guidance or agreements (SOFA, Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA), etc.) and
8                                                 AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


           ensure appropriate personnel under their authority, who are responsible for supporting
           the classification and declassification of records, receive appropriate training.
           1.2.1.5.4. Adopt the following key elements to enhance HN support and ensure this
           information is in AT policy and training: HN support agreements, resources and
           benefits provided by the United States, working groups and informal outreach
           activities, training and exercises with HN officials, threat information sharing and
           positive human capital attributes of key AF personnel, such as right skills, training
           and duty tour length.
           1.2.1.5.5. For OCONUS permanent or expeditionary assignments, identify qualified
           interpreters or provide language and cultural training for those personnel filling key
           positions interacting with HN personnel; consider improving cultural training for all
           OCONUS permanent party and for pre-deployment.
    1.2.2. Financial Management (FM). The FM shall:
       1.2.2.1. Advise commanders, the AT Working Group (ATWG) and AT Executive
       Committee (ATEC) on financial processes and procedures to effectively resource AT
       program requirements through the planning, programming, budgeting and execution
       (PPB&E) and Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (CbT-RIF) processes in
       conjunction with other staff offices.
       1.2.2.2. Provide long range financial planning for the AT Program.
    1.2.3. Inspector General (IG). The Inspector General will evaluate the commander’s ability
    to execute an AT program and the overall AT program effectiveness will be recorded in

   2.3.1. The AT risk management process is modeled upon the principles described in DOD
   O-2000.12-H and Integrated Defense Risk Management described in AFPD 31-1. It should
   be applied in all aspects of AT program implementation and planning, including operational
   plans and decisions, development of risk mitigation measures and the prioritization and
   allocation of resources. The essential components of AT risk management include:
   determining the criticality of assets (criticality assessment); assessing the terrorist threats
   (threat assessment); identifying the vulnerabilities of facilities, programs and systems to an
   attack, including the use of CBRNE or similar capabilities (vulnerability assessment);
   assessing risk based on a holistic understanding of the criticality, threat and vulnerability of
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                                            15


              the asset (risk assessment); and implementing the capabilities needed to correct or mitigate
              the risk (countermeasures) and reevaluating risk after countermeasures are employed; and/or
              accepting risk.
                 2.3.1.1. The AT risk management process and procedures shall be reviewed at least
                 annually. An AT Program Review, a Higher Headquarters Assessment (HHA) or a Joint
                 Staff Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) visit satisfies this requirement.
                      2.3.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) All subject matter experts (SME) included in the AT risk
                      management process will provide data to the installation ATO for inclusion in the AT
                      plan.
                      2.3.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Wings should ensure all risk management efforts have
                      been coordinated between all affected agencies/programs (e.g. control assessment risk
                      management, continuity of operations, emergency management) to the maximum
                      extent possible.
                 2.3.1.2. AT risk management is a continuous process of conducting operations. See
                 Figure 2.1 for a graphical depiction.

   for non-mission essential assets such as high-occupancy buildings, mass gathering activities,
   energy infrastructure and any other facility, equipment, service or resource deemed important
   by the commander warranting protective measures to ensure continued efficient operation;
   protection from disruption, degradation or destruction; and timely restoration.
      2.5.1.1. Criticality assessments should be coordinated with affected Defense Critical
      Infrastructure Program (DCIP) and Air Force Critical Infrastructure Programs (AF CIP),
      which follow the principles in DODD 3020.40, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program
      (DCIP), and AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program, and identify
      defense critical infrastructure and critical assets.
   2.5.2. Criticality assessments will be updated at least annually to determine the degree of
   asset criticality based upon the following factors: relative importance, effect of loss,
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                                17


   recoverability, mission functionality, substitutability and repairability.             Criticality
   assessments shall provide the basis for identifying those assets that require specific protective
   measures and priorities for resource allocation when developing and updating AT-related
   contingency plans, e.g., AT Plan, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-
   2, Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), Integrated Defense Plan (IDP), etc.
2.6. Standard 6: Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment.
   2.6.1. Vulnerability assessment processes shall be established consistent with the principles
   described in DOD O-2000.12-H and AFPD 31-1 to provide a vulnerability-based analysis of
   personnel (mission essential, mass gatherings, etc.) and mission essential assets (energy
   infrastructure, etc.) and information that are susceptible to terrorist threats. Incorporate food
   and water vulnerabilities according to the guidance in AFI 10-246. Incorporate other
   assessments, such assessments made through the DCIP and AF CIP, or coordinate schedules
   so teams visit the installation during the same time frame to reduce the impact on operational
   units.
      2.6.1.1. AF VA benchmarks provided by the AF Vulnerability Assessment Team
      (AFVAT), which include the JSIVA benchmarks, will be used. Within 90 days of a
      completed assessment, prioritize identified vulnerabilities, develop a plan of action to
      mitigate or eliminate the vulnerabilities and/or assume risk and report assessment results
      to the first general officer, flag officer or civilian equivalent director in the chain of
      command, to include the NAF.
      2.6.1.1. (ACC) Installation commanders shall address, mitigate and correct AT/FP
      vulnerabilities identified during all vulnerability assessments, especially procedural or
      relatively inexpensive and would improve the AT/FP posture. Conversely, high cost
      improvements must be considered in context with threat and risk assessment, and if
      necessary, planned for and programmed.
      2.6.1.2. CVAMP shall be populated with assessment results, vulnerabilities as a
      minimum, within 120 days from completion of the assessment, i.e. assessment outbrief.
          2.6.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Installations will populate CVAMP within 30 days of
          receiving the higher headquarters (HHQ) vulnerability assessment (VA) out brief or
          completing a local assessment. NOTE: The VA out-brief may be used initially to
          begin analysis/mitigation process, but CVAMP shall be fully populated upon receipt
          of the final report.
          2.6.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Data entry into CVAMP may initially be loaded as
          ―Procedural,‖ in order to timely input data into CVAMP. Strict follow-up must be
          maintained to ensure the appropriate installation-level review (TWG and/or ATWG)
          is conducted to address the vulnerabilities initially entered as ―Procedural.‖ A change
          to ―Programmatic‖ (if required), project numbers, and funding information must be
          entered as soon as possible, following installation review.
          2.6.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) Programmatic vulnerability/concern observations and their
          respective unfunded requests (UFR) shall be ―released‖ to NAF/HHQ within 120
          calendar days of receiving the final report to gain HHQ visibility, and possible
          funding opportunities. Programmatic observations not able to be populated with
          funding request data and released to HHQ within 120 calendar days will have

        corrective action status updated with the limiting factors and estimated date of
        completion. Use Paragraph 2.6.1.2.6 of this supplement as a guide. NOTE:
        Incomplete UFRs will be returned to the unit and not be considered for funding.
        2.6.1.2.4. (Added-ACC) NAF/HHQ shall take action (release or return) appropriate
        observations/UFRs within 30 days of installation submittal.
        2.6.1.2.5. (Added-ACC) All procedural observations will be mitigated and closed in
        CVAMP within 120 calendar days of a completed assessment. Procedural
        observations not able to be closed within 120 calendar days will have corrective
        action status updated with the limiting factors and estimated date of completion. Use
        Para 2.6.1.2.6 of this supplement as a guide.
        2.6.1.2.6. (Added-ACC) CVAMP data shall be completely reviewed and updated
        within the first ten (10) workdays of each calendar year quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct),
        as a minimum. Annotate and update CVAMP data corrective action status for open
        observations by performing the following actions.
           2.6.1.2.6.1. (Added-ACC) Each open observation corrective action status shall
           be updated using the ―Corrective Action Information‖ option within the
           observation.
           2.6.1.2.6.2. (Added-ACC) Within the ―Corrective Action Information‖ screen
           select the ―Review/Edit‖ button. Update/review all the data associated with the
           observation corrective action. Select appropriate ―Status Update/Action Taken to
           Close This Observation‖ category, and add a comment to the action taken. Use
           the ―Status Update‖ category when updating the status and not closing the
           observation. Don’t forget to select the ―Add‖ button after entering comments and
           then the ―Validate & Save‖ button before closing the observation window.
           2.6.1.2.6.3. (Added-ACC) Corrective Action comments shall include the reason
           for the observation to remain open, limiting factors for incomplete funding
           request data, and estimated completion date (if applicable).
        2.6.1.2.7. (Added-ACC) Installation commanders may authorize installation ATO's
        "Commanders Privileges" within CVAMP to aid in the database upkeep. However,
        this does not relieve the commander from having situational awareness of the data.
        Authorization will be included on the ATO appointment letter.
        2.6.1.2.8. (Added-ACC) The ACC Security Forces Division (HQ ACC/A7S) shall
        report CVAMP Vulnerability/Concern/UFR status and command observation trend
        analysis on a semi-annual basis, as a minimum.
     2.6.1.3. A VA will be conducted at least annually or more frequently if the VA or
     mission requirements dictate. The VA will be conducted by a HHA team at least
     triennially. VAs shall be conducted at a minimum for, but not limited to:

   af61a/afrims/afrims/.
2.7. Standard 7: AT Plan.
   2.7.1. Commanders will develop and maintain a comprehensive AT plan for all DOD
   elements and personnel that the AF has AT responsibility. Use of the Joint Antiterrorism
   (JAT) Guide, when used in its entirety, satisfies all minimum planning elements prescribed in
   this instruction. These AT plans will not be considered complete unless signed by the
   commander and exercised. If applicable, synchronize the AT Plan with any existing CEMP
 20                                                AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


     and IDP. At a minimum, AT plans shall be developed at the installation and separate or

     events, and special events.
        2.7.1.1. (Added-ACC) Installation commanders will document a review of the
        Installation AT Plan on an annual basis and within 60 calendar days of assuming
        command. Installation ATO must maintain the commander’s review with the AT Plan.
        ATO’s will maintain a 2-year history of AT plan reviews.
        2.7.1.2. (Added-ACC) Installation AT plans must be comprehensive, executable and
        cross-referencing to/with other plans. It can be an annex to the local installation defense
        plan/integrated defense plan (typically local OPLAN 31) to ensure a truly integrated
        defense plan and avoid conflicting requirements across multiple plans. This annex/plan
        can also serve as the installation supplement to this instruction. An example of a plan is
        provided in Attachment 6 of this supplement. The AT plan should integrate all base and
        community actions to deter, detect, defend, and respond to terrorist actions. Relevant
        portions of existing plans may be annexed into the installation AT plan.
        2.7.1.3. (Added-ACC) Each unit (e.g. detachment, squadron, group/wing staff,
        MAJCOM directorate, etc.) will create a checklist with specific unit measures designed to
        support the base AT program, including random and force protection condition
        implementation. The installation ATO will maintain/file appropriate checklists.
     2.7.2. AT principles are incorporated into all operational plans and risk decisions using the
     standards prescribed by this instruction as a baseline to develop and implement AT policies
     in support of the AF’s unique roles and mission requirements. Table 2.1. incorporates the
     Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 8, National Preparedness. The OPR will
     recommend the appropriate planning parameters regarding the scale for AF operations and
     civil support operations based on the threat. Where A7C (CE) is designated the OPR, refer to
     AFI 10-2501.

   2.7.4. GCCs provide AT planning information (e.g., airfield, port and movement route
   information and criticality, threat and VA data) to deploying DOD units; and, directs the
   execution of advance site reviews to facilitate the AT planning process in areas where the
   assessed TTL is SIGNIFICANT or HIGH or where a specific Terrorism Warning is in effect.
      2.7.4.1. At the discretion of the GCC, such security efforts may be waived for
      deployments or visits to controlled locations such as existing military installations.
      Augmentation of assessment personnel may be necessary to enable subordinate AF
      Component commanders to discharge their responsibility to provide security, surveys,
      assessments, CI and countersurveillance support, and to act as the liaison with the
      country team, host-nation security force, contractors and port authority.
   2.7.5. In countries where available, AFOSI special agents are assigned to FP Detachments
   (FPD) and provide FP and CI services to in-transit DOD personnel. FPDs are mandated to
   provide surveys, assessments, CI and countersurveillance support, and act as the liaison with
   the country team, host-nation security forces, contractors and port authority.
   2.7.6. Coordinate AFOSI support for large exercises, contingencies and special events in
   foreign countries.
   2.7.7. Ensure plans include procedures to expedite off-base first and emergency responders
   onto the installation during increased FPCON.
2.8. Standard 8: AT Program Coordination.
   2.8.1. GCCs coordinate AT and security matters with the appropriate CoM and host-nation
   authorities for countries within their AOR and with the Heads of the other DOD Components
   whose personnel are stationed in or transit the respective GCC AOR.
   2.8.2. AF Component commanders of personnel who will be stationed in or transit the AOR
   of a GCC shall:
      2.8.2.1. Initiate coordination of AT matters with the appropriate GCC pursuant to the
      requirements established by DODD 2000.12. The senior deployed commander with AT
      responsibility will designate an ATO in writing to coordinate with the AF Component to
      the GCC and provide this information through the Unit Deployment Centers with Unit
      Type Codes (UTCs) assigned for the deployment. AF elements of in-transit forces with
      less than 300 personnel and not deploying as a larger troop movement will comply with
      the GCC operation order (OPORD) and file an in-transit AT plan. File in-transit AT
      plans with their ATO and commander for approval. Coordinate with AF Components to
      GCCs or MAJCOMs to determine in-transit AT plan filing requirements. The plan will
      cover travel from permanent station to the initial assembly or embarkation point, where it
      becomes the responsibility of the senior officer of a larger movement, such as a troop
      commander. If the movement does not join a larger force where AT responsibility is
      transferred, the AT plan must include transit to the deployed location where a commander
      is designated as having AT responsibility by orders. For countries where the AF will be
      performing temporary duty, commanders will immediately contact the AFOSI unit or
      ATO responsible for that AOR. AFOSI will provide a specific, tailored threat briefing
      prior to departure.

   separate facilities and AF tenant units on installations or self-supported separate facilities
   shall coordinate AT program and plan requirements with the host installation or self-
   supported separate facility commander or civilian equivalent director. Tenant units shall
   participate fully in installation and self-supported separate facility AT programs. At
   locations where there are multiple DOD components, such as DOD-leased facilities or other
   facilities where DOD occupies space, the designated senior DOD Component, unless
   otherwise stipulated by the applicable GCC, shall be responsible for integrating and
   coordinating individual DOD component security plans into a comprehensive installation,
   self-supported separate facility or area-wide AT program.
2.9. Standard 9: AT Officer (ATO).
   2.9.1. Commanders will designate ATOs in writing (see Standard 26 for certification
   criteria). The ATO is the commander’s military or civilian advisor charged with managing
   the AT Program. The ATO advisory role does not replace a functional manager’s or
   commander’s responsibility to execute programs in support of the operational commander’s
   mission. Security clearance requirements will be established by the commander. ATOs shall
   be assigned to:
      2.9.1.1. Installations or self-supported separate facilities with inherent responsibility for
      emergency response functions.
      2.9.1.2. Wings and higher.

     2.9.3.3. Ensure CVAMP is used to identify and track AT resourcing actions and
     appropriate vulnerabilities are submitted to the GCCs for funding assistance.
     2.9.3.4. Ensure CVAMP is populated with AT-related assessment vulnerabilities in
     accordance with this instruction. Additional functional databases may be used for
     follow-on project information and tracking, but a reference note must be documented in
     the vulnerability observation within CVAMP. Coordinate with functional commanders
     to ensure AT-related vulnerabilities are entered in and decisions or actions are tracked in
     CVAMP. Note: Other databases may be used to manage the follow up action(s), but the
     initial vulnerability and the project identification code or numbers must be recorded and
     tracked in CVAMP.

      ACC TWG for action/awareness and/or disseminated to subordinate units throughout the
      command.
   2.11.3. Based on threat information, appropriate SMEs shall be assembled to provide
   information needed to develop predictive intelligence and recommend COA to counter
   threats or otherwise reduce risk. If resources are available, especially at high threat locations
   or at MAJCOM or higher levels, members of the TWG may be further organized to form the
   basis of an Intelligence Fusion Cell as described in AFTTP 3-10.2, Integrated Base Defense
   Command and Control.
2.12. Standard 12: AT Executive Committee (ATEC).
   2.12.1. An AT executive-level committee or similarly structured corporate body will be
   established at the installation and self-supported separate facility level and higher (stationary
   or deployed) that meets at least semi-annually. ATECs develop and refine AT program
   guidance, policy and standards; act upon recommendations of the ATWG and TWG; and
   determine resource allocation priorities to mitigate or eliminate terrorism-related
   vulnerabilities. The chair and mandatory members of the ATEC will be designated in

   responsibilities and minimum functional and SME participation.
   2.12.2. AF/A7S chairs the HAF FP Steering Group.
2.13. Standard 13: AT Physical Security Measure.
   2.13.1. Principles of AFTTP 3-10.1, Integrated Base Defense, AFI 31-101 and DOD
   5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, are applied and fully integrated into AT plans to
   ensure employment of a holistic security system to counter terrorist capabilities. Well-
   designed physical security measures are multi-layered and include the integration and
   synchronization of the following essential elements, as further described in DOD AT
   Standard 13: detection, assessment, delay or denial, communication and response. The
   development of comprehensive physical security measures requires the integration of
   facilities, physical security equipment, trained personnel, biometrics entry control equipment,
   when established, and procedures oriented at a minimum in support of perimeter and area
   security, access and egress control, protection against CBRNE attacks (including those using
   the postal system), HRP protection, barrier plans and facility standoff distances.
   2.13.2. AOR or other mission-specific security policies are developed to guide subordinate
   development of local physical security systems and the purchase of physical security
   equipment.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                              29


   2.13.3. Tenant command and unit security plans and measures are coordinated and
   integrated into the AT Plan.
   2.13.3. (ACC) Where possible, installations are encouraged to cross reference between
   existing wing plans to eliminate conflicts of various functional responsibilities. DOD
   standards are compliance directives and are not waiver able.
   2.13.4. Ensure barrier plans include measures to prevent reverse entry though exit lanes.
   Ensure the barrier plan affords personnel time to recognize a possible threat and employ the
   final barrier(s) while minimizing risk to vehicle occupants, e.g. placing a serpentine between
   the integrated defense (ID) check point and the final denial barrier. The purpose of the final
   denial barrier is to prevent an attack but planners must factor that most instances requiring
   barrier employment are because of mistakes in judgment by vehicle operators.
      2.13.4.1. Barrier plans should protect facilities listed in the AT plan from vehicle attacks.
      Installations will ensure proper standoff through UFC and DOD O-2000.12-H
      recommended passive barriers. Barriers plans should also identify owner/users tasked
      with erecting barriers and specified time periods. See JP 3-07.02 for additional guidance
      on establishing barriers plans.
          2.13.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Barrier plans will be detailed to protect critical facilities
          from stationary vehicle attacks. The barrier plan critical facility list must be created
          from the criticality assessment. The UFC is the minimum baseline used for standoff
          to include barrier planning. Ensure documented design basis threat is utilized for any
          modifications.
          2.13.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) CE is the OPR for the barrier plan, with SF and the
          installation ATO as office of collateral responsibility when establishing a barrier plan.
          Barrier plans, using UFC and traffic engineering standards, should be formally
          reviewed by the base Installation Security Council and/or the AT Working Group to
          ensure effectiveness, rapid deployment and where necessary, proper traffic
          redirection is needed.
          2.13.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Barrier plans will be referenced in the installation’s AT
          plan.
   2.13.5. (Added-ACC) CE flights will assist security forces and the installation ATO in
   providing programming and landscape support to place permanent barriers/standoff all the
   time, to minimize implementation time as threat increases.                    All new military
   construction/refurbishing of facilities will incorporate in-place barrier planning techniques.
2.14. Standard 14: Random Antiterrorism Measure.
   2.14.1. The RAM program is developed and implemented as an integral component of the
   overall AT program and guided by the principles outlined in DOD O-2000.12-H. To
   maximize the effectiveness and deterrence value, RAMs should be implemented without a
   set pattern, either in terms of the measure selected, time, place or other variables. Lessons
   learned have highlighted unpredictability in security activities as one of the best and most
   cost effective deterrents available to a commander. Randomly changing AT TTPs enable
   integrated defenses to appear formidable and prevent threats from easily discerning and
   predicting patterns or routines that are vulnerable to attack. RAMs, at a minimum, shall
 30                                               AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


   consist of the random implementation of higher FPCON measures, to include MAJCOM or
   locally developed site-specific measures, in consideration of the local terrorist capabilities.
   Random use of other security measures should be used to supplement FPCON measures.
   The RAM program shall be included in AT plans.
      2.14.1.1. (Added-ACC) Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM) shall employ
      elements of information warfare, as required, to support Air Force antiterrorism
      measures. If military deception and/or operations security are deemed necessary, contact
      the host unit’s military deception office and the OPSEC office for assistance in
      development of tactical deception and OPSEC measures.
      2.14.1.2. (Added-ACC) The installation ATO is responsible for managing the RAM
      program.
   2.14.2. When developing and implementing an effective installation RAM process:
      2.14.2.1. Include tenant units and tenant commands.
      2.14.2.2. Implement daily RAMs to include weekends and holidays. The frequency will
      be increased as the threat increases. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs
      are required daily.
      2.14.2.3. Use RAMs to mitigate vulnerabilities impacting facilities and nearby areas.
      2.14.2.4. RAM implementation should be compatible and coordinated with ongoing law
      enforcement or CI surveillance detection and ID measures.
      2.14.2.5. Consider methods to make RAMs visible to confuse or expose surveillance
      attempts and preoperational planning.
      2.14.2.6. Implement dynamic and proactive RAMs to communicate unit resolve to
      detect, deter, prepare for and counter threats.
      2.14.2.7. Make efforts to include, as appropriate local, State, Federal and host nation law
      enforcement patrols and first responders.
      2.14.2.8. Implement RAMs installation wide or target specific types of facilities,
      functions or activities.
      2.14.2.9. RAM implementation efforts shall be monitored, tracked and analyzed.
      2.14.2.9. (ACC) RAM tracking documentation will be maintained for a minimum of
      one (1) year.
2.15. Standard 15: AT Measures for AF Off-Installation Facilities, Housing and Activities.
   2.15.1. For AF owned or leased off-installation facilities, housing, transportation services,
   daycare centers and other activities used by or involving a mass-gathering of DOD personnel
   and their family members, specific AT measures shall be developed in overall AT programs.
   At locations where there are multiple DOD components or locations, AT measures shall be
   coordinated with the designated senior DOD Component with AT responsibility.
      2.15.1.1. Risk mitigation measures shall include, but are not limited to: emergency
      notification and recall procedures, guidance for selection of off-installation housing,
      temporary billeting and other facility use (including compliance with UFC 4-010-01 for

   31-101, AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFH 32-1084, Facility
   Requirements, for additional information. Proper facility project planning, programming and
   design must be done in concert with the ATO, installation intelligence and security personnel
   to adequately address site specific threats. Ensure restoration and modernization projects
   which include security and AT Standards compliance upgrades do not exceed 70 percent cost
   versus new facility standard.
      2.17.1.1. The installation commander or the senior Civil Engineer on the commander’s
      behalf will certify that new facility or renovation projects of 50 percent or more of
      replacement cost comply with standards as listed in paragraph 2.17.1. The ATO will
      work with the engineering staff from design inception to project completion, ensuring
      requirements are met. The ATO should be part of the coordination prior to certification.
      The senior Civil Engineer will report discrepancies to the appropriate MAJCOM for
      determination/action.
      2.17.1.1. (ACC) The installation ATO will be part of the coordination prior to
      certification to ensure compliance with appropriate UFC and security engineering
      requirements.
      2.17.1.2. (Added-ACC) In addition to UFC 4-010-01, all new construction and
      renovations, regardless of the funding source, that exceed 50 percent of the replacement
      cost or change the use of the facility must comply with UFC 4-020-01, DOD Security
      Engineering Facilities Planning Manual, and UFC 4-010-02, DOD Minimum
      Antiterrorism Standoff Distances for Buildings.
   2.17.2. Ensure the A7 (CE) and ATO develop a prioritized list of risk mitigation measures
   (reference DOD O-2000.12-H, UFCs and AFI 31-101) for use by site selection teams. These
   criteria shall be used to determine if facilities either currently occupied or being considered
   for occupancy provide adequate protection for DOD personnel against the effects of a
   terrorist attack. Circumstances may require the movement of DOD personnel or assets to
   facilities the U.S. Government had not previously used or surveyed. AT Standards shall be a
   key consideration in evaluating the suitability of facilities that were previously not used or
   surveyed.
   2.17.3. The A7 (CE) will ensure at least one engineer at each installation has completed the
   Security Engineering and Design Course to review, document and track construction projects
   for compliance with UFCs and AT Standards.
   2.17.3. (ACC) Installation ATOs will attend the Security Engineering Design course and
   include the date of attendance (or scheduled date) on the appointment letter.
2.18. Standard 18: AT Measures for Logistics and Other Contracting.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                            33


   2.18.1. AT measures shall be incorporated into the logistics and contracting processes
   (requirements development, vendor selection, award, execution and evaluation) when the
   provisions of the contract or services provided affect the security of DOD elements,
   personnel, mission-essential cargo, equipment, assets or services. When commensurate with
   risk, consider AT performance as an evaluation factor for contract award (past performance
   and proposed performance under the instant contract) and as a performance metric under the
   resultant contract.
   2.18.2. A verification process, whether through background checks or other similar
   processes shall be implemented to enable the U.S. Government to attest to the
   trustworthiness of DOD contractors and sub-contractors (U.S. citizens, host-nation and third
   country personnel) to the greatest extent possible, including those personnel having direct or
   indirect involvement in the delivery or provision of services. Priority will go to service
   provisioning related to mail and food, water or other materiel intended for consumption by
   DOD personnel. This vetting of trustworthiness shall include agents and crews on contracted
   ships, planes, trains and overland vehicles. Refer to AFI 31-101.
      2.18.2.1. (Added-ACC) Installations should refer to DTM (I) 09-012 (DOD Physical
      Access Control) and DOD 5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, for types of check to
      be conducted.
      2.18.2.2. (Added-ACC) The base contracting officer shall ensure criminal background
      checks, as appropriate, are accomplished prior to employment. Incorporate Air Force
      Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5352.242-9000, Contractor
      Access to Air Force Installations, into local contracts. Contracting will ensure statements
      of work include security and force protection provisions designed to ensure contractor
      compliance with the implementation of higher FPCONs, including subcontractor
      compliance.
   2.18.3. Site-specific risk mitigation measures are developed and implemented to maintain
   positive control of DOD contractor and sub-contractor access to and movement within
   installations, sensitive facilities and classified areas.
   2.18.4. Site-specific risk mitigation measures are developed and implemented to screen
   contractor or sub-contractor transportation conveyances for CBRNE hazards before entry
   into or adjacent to areas with DOD personnel and mission-essential assets.
   2.18.5. Contracts will comply with the AT provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition
   Regulation.
   2.18.6. Contracts shall incorporate Level I - AT Awareness Training requirements. See
   Standard 25.
2.19. Standard 19: AT Measures for Critical Asset Security.
   2.19.1. Risk management measures shall be developed to reduce the vulnerabilities of DOD
   assets assessed as critical in STANDARD 5, to include distributive information or computer-
   based systems and networks. Integrate these measures into overall AT program efforts.

2.20. Standard 20: Terrorism Incident Response Measures.
   2.20.1. Incident response measures shall be developed consistent with the principles outlined
   in DOD 5200.08-R and AFI 10-2501 and included in the overall AT plan. These measures
   shall include procedures for determining the nature and scope of incident response (including
   incidents with a CBRNE component); procedures for coordinating security, fire, medical,
   hazardous material and other emergency responder capabilities; and steps to recover from the
   incident while continuing essential operations.
   2.20.1. (ACC) Ensure all wing plans are consistent with all applicable DOD standards i.e.;
   AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations;
   AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection; and AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense;
   and the medical community instructions.
   2.20.2. AF Components to GCC or GCCs prepare incident response measures for their AOR.
   AFOSI and Force Protection Detachments should be included in contingency planning for in-
   transit units.
2.21. Standard 21: Terrorism Consequence Management Measures.
   2.21.1. Consequence management, CBRNE and public health emergency preparedness and
   emergency response measures are included as an adjunct to the overall AT Plan or
   installation emergency management plans. For the AF these measures are found in the
   CEMP 10-2, MCRP, AT Plan and the IDP. The contents of all plans may be referenced in
   the AT Plan. These measures shall focus on mitigating vulnerabilities of personnel, families,
   facilities and materiel to terrorist use of WMD and CBRNE weapons, as well as overall
   disaster planning and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack. These measures shall
   include integration with DOD emergency responder guidelines provided in AFI 10-2501;
   mass notification system standards under UFC 4-021-01; establishment of medical
   surveillance systems consistent with DODD 6490.02E, Comprehensive Health Surveillance,
   and AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance; deployment of CBRNE sensors
   and detectors; providing collective protection; and providing personal protective equipment
   (PPE) or individual protective equipment (IPE) in the following priority and in accordance
   with AFI 10-2501. The contract Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement must
   specify if PPE will be government or contractor provided:
      2.21.1.1. First Responders and Emergency Responders. Personnel who work closest to
      known or suspected CBRNE hazards (e.g., emergency responders) should be provided
      protection needed to perform their duties in an unknown hazard environment.
      Responders should use the maximum possible protection until determined otherwise by
      competent authority.
      2.21.1.2. Critical Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of critical
      military missions (whether military, civilian, contractor, host-nation personnel or third
      country nationals), such as critical personnel assigned to mission essential functions
      (MEFs) described in AFI 10-208, Continuity of Operations Program (COOP), should be
      provided an appropriate level of protection to support continuity of those critical military
      missions. Since critical missions should be continued without interruption, collective or
      individual protection may be necessary to sustain them.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                              35


      2.21.1.3. Essential Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of
      essential military operations (whether military, civilian, contractor, host-nation personnel
      or third country nationals) should be provided an appropriate level of protection to
      support near continuity for those essential military operations. Since essential operations
      may be interrupted for relatively short periods (e.g., hours to days), escape protection
      may be necessary to sustain essential operations (i.e., escape, survive and restore essential
      operations).
      2.21.1.4. Other Personnel. For all other persons not in the above categories, the
      objective will be to provide the procedures or protection necessary to safely survive an
      incident, e.g. shelter-in-place or evacuation procedures may fulfill this requirement.
      2.21.1.5. Included as part of the above categories are those who work or live on DOD
      installations worldwide, family members authorized overseas and DOD contractors if
      designated in contract agreements and designated as essential to perform critical DOD
      missions.
   2.21.2. Site-specific CBRNE preparedness and emergency response measures are developed
   and coordinated through the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. These measures
   are implemented and synchronized with a corresponding FPCON measure.
   2.21.3. Mutual Aid Agreements or other similarly constructed protocols will be established
   with the appropriate local, State, Federal or host-nation authorities to support AT Plan
   execution and augment incident response and post-incident consequence management
   activities.
   2.21.3. (ACC) Installation ATO will ensure functional compliance for all appropriate
   memorandums of agreement/understanding.
   2.21.4. The installation should be able to warn its resident population in affected areas of
   possible or confirmed CBRNE hazards immediately, utilizing the Air Force Installation
   Notification and Warning System (INWS). The warning must include instructions to shelter
   in place or evacuate.
   2.21.5. Installation public health emergency response measures that are synchronized with
   FPCON levels shall be developed and implemented.
   2.21.6. (Added-ACC) Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) detection strategies should be
   multi-functional in approach. CE Readiness and Emergency Management and Explosives
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) will be the OPR for developing criteria for the selection of WMD
   detection equipment, including developing maintenance, training, and employment plans. As
   the incident dictates, the installation ATO should be included in the Crisis Action Team
   (CAT) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) functions as an advisor to the commander.
2.22. Standard 22: Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Measures.
   2.22.1. The GCC is responsible for establishing the baseline FPCON for their AOR and
   procedures to ensure that FPCON measures are uniformly disseminated and implemented.
   The AF Component to the GCC is typically delegated to manage this task for the GCC. See
   Attachment 2 for detailed listing of FPCON measures.
   2.22.2. Installation commanders with AT responsibility and higher shall:
36                                                AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


     2.22.2.1. Determine an appropriate FPCON level for those personnel and assets for
     which they have AT responsibility. Subordinate commanders may raise a higher-level
     commander’s FPCON level, but they shall not lower the FPCON level without the
     higher-level commander’s written concurrence.
         2.22.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Installation command posts will ensure proper OPREP-3
         reporting procedures [and will info Air Forces North Security Forces Division
         (AFNORTH A7S OMB)] reporting of any FPCON changes.
         2.22.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) FPCON Measure Deviations. The inability to meet
         minimum DOD and Air Force installation antiterrorism requirements results in a
         higher force protection program risk. If it is determined certain mandated FPCON
         measures are inappropriate for current operations or negatively impact threat
         mitigation efforts, installation commanders may request a waiver in writing through
         their respective chain of command to the respective FPCON declaring authority. The
         waiver request will address the specific FPCON measure in question, the proposed
         action, efforts to mitigate related vulnerabilities, and plans for the installation to come
         into compliance with the mandated FPCON measure. Ensure proper classification
         requirements are met. Approval can only be granted by the declaration authority.
         Deviations must be staffed through HQ ACC/A7S.
     2.22.2.2. Classify site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to an
     FPCON as ―CONFIDENTIAL‖. When separated from the AT Plan, specific AT
     measures linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to
     ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,‖ in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R, Information
     Security Program.
     2.22.2.2. (ACC) Non-ACC tenant organizations on ACC installations must comply with
     local AT programs.
  2.22.3. A review mechanism is established to ensure FPCON levels are commensurate with
  changing threats and the principles of risk management. This is essential because
  implementation of FPCON measures at elevated FPCON levels for an extended duration can
  be counterproductive to effective security and overall mission accomplishment. In some
  circumstances, based upon local conditions and the threat environment, commanders should
  consider implementing a lower-level FPCON and supplement with other local security
  measures and RAMs as an effective alternative to executing the higher-level FPCON
  measures.
  2.22.4. Site-specific FPCON measures are developed and implemented for stationary and in-
  transit forces to supplement the FPCON measures and actions enumerated for each FPCON
  level. The development of site-specific FPCON measures must permit sufficient time and
  space to determine hostile intent, while fully considering constraints imposed by standing
  rules of engagement in CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules For
  the Use of Force For U.S. Forces, and rules of force under AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
  Force by Air Force Personnel. Organic intelligence, CI and law enforcement resources,
  institutional knowledge of the area and comprehensive understanding of organic capabilities,
  supported by national and AOR assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON
  measures to be implemented at specific sites for both stationary and in-transit forces.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                               37


2.23. Standard 23: AT Training and Exercises.
   2.23.1. AT training and exercises shall integrate with physical security and relevant elements
   of AT, EM, FHP and ID and are afforded the same emphasis as combat task training and
   executed with the intent to identify shortfalls affecting the protection of personnel, assets and
   information against terrorist attack and subsequent AT consequence management efforts.
   2.23.2. AT and AOR specific training, particularly pre-deployment training, is supported by
   measurable standards, including credible deterrence and response standards, deterrence-
   specific TTPs and lessons learned. AT training shall also be incorporated into unit-level
   training plans and pre-deployment exercises. Pre-deployment training shall also include
   terrorism or similarly designed scenarios and hostile intent decision making. Joint operations
   and exercises shall incorporate AT training and planning for forces involved.
   2.23.3. At least annually, comprehensive field and staff training, including deploying
   squadrons and higher, are conducted to exercise AT plans. Annual AT exercises shall
   encompass all aspects of AT, physical security and emergency management plans.
   Additionally, current baseline FPCON through FPCON CHARLIE measures shall be
   exercised annually at installations and self-supported separate facilities.
   2.23.3. (ACC) AT exercises will have maximum participation by all base units, including
   tenant units, with a minimum of simulation. Wings should make every effort to use local
   community first responders for this exercise. AT exercise scenarios may be held in
   conjunction with other Air Force required exercises (e.g., HAZMAT, Force-on-Force, Mass
   Casualty, etc.) to meet various Air Force instruction requirements. Each AT exercise will be
   documented by the base exercise evaluation team, providing a critique with findings,
   observations, and lessons learned.
   2.23.4. Maintain AT exercise documentation for no less than 2 years to ensure incorporation
   of lessons learned.
   2.23.5. AT lessons learned are submitted through the AF Lessons Learned program and,
   when appropriate, through the Joint Lessons Learned program.
   2.23.5. (ACC) AT lessons learned are submitted through the Air Force Lessons Learned
   program at https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/.
   2.23.6. ATOs in coordination with the Wing EET shall develop a comprehensive annual
   training and exercise program to provide the necessary individual and collective training to
   prepare for an annual exercise.
2.24. Standard 24: Formal AT Training.
   2.24.1. The AF’s formal AT Training Program shall consist of Level 1 - AT Awareness
   Training (Standard 25), Level II - ATO Training (Standard 26), Level III - Pre-command AT
   Training (Standard 27), Level IV - AT Executive Seminar (Standard 28), AOR-specific
   training (Standard 29) and HRP AT training (Standard 16).
   2.24.2. AT training shall be integrated into officer, NCO and civilian training as required by

contested area or position to the enemy.
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions
of the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources and (3) continue, sustain and restore combat and combat support operational capability
 54                                                AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil support
operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is managed by the
Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces.
Assessment—Analysis of the security, effectiveness and potential of an existing or planned
intelligence activity. (JP 1-02) [The evaluation of progress toward the creation of effects and the
achievement of objectives and end state conditions.][AFDD 2-1.9]{Words in brackets apply only
to the Air Force and are offered for clarity.}

for subordinates. An AT plan contains command-specific guidance for the establishment of an
AT program and the implementation of the AT Standards.
AT Program—One of several security-related programs that fall under the overarching
combating terrorism and FP programs. The AT program is a collective, proactive effort focused
on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DOD personnel and their families,
facilities, installations and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment as well as the
preparation to defend against and planning for the response to the consequences of terrorist
incidents. Although not elements of AT, plans for terrorism consequence management
preparedness and response measures as well as plans for continuing essential military operations
are important adjuncts to an effective AT program. The minimum elements of an AT program
are AT risk management, planning, training and exercises, resource application and a program
review.
AT Program Review—The process of developing specific guidelines used to evaluate the AT
Program in order to assess satisfactorily and evaluate the effectiveness and adequacy of the AT
Program.
AT Resource Application—The process of applying risk management to vulnerabilities and
where the resultant risk is not acceptable after applying mitigation measures, elevate the
vulnerability with a resource request using the existing PPB&E system, the CbT-RIF, the
Physical Security Program and other funding mechanisms. Central to success in resource
application is tracking and ensuring sufficient funding for identified AT program life-cycle costs
and assessed shortfalls to mitigate risk associated with terrorist capabilities.
AT Risk Management—The process of systematically identifying, assessing and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance possible adverse
outcomes with mission benefits. The end products of the AT program risk management process
shall be the identification of DOD elements and personnel that are vulnerable to the identified

threat attack means. From the assessment of risk based upon the three critical components of AT
risk management (threat assessment, criticality assessment and vulnerability assessment), the
commander must determine which DOD elements and personnel are at greatest risk and how best
to employ given resources and FP measures to deter, mitigate or prepare for a terrorist incident.
AT Training and Exercises—The process of developing individual, leader and collective skills
and of conducting comprehensive exercises to validate plans for AT incident response,
consequence management and continuity of essential military operations.
Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT)—Biological agents and toxins that present a high
bioterrorism risk to national security and have the greatest potential for adverse public health
impact with mass casualties of humans and/or animals or that pose a severe threat to plant health
or to plant products. The lists are reviewed and updated by HHS/CDC and USDA/APHIS.

apply an operational decision on how to best guard against the terrorist threat. The protective
measures identified in the FPCON System assist commanders in reducing the risks of terrorist
attacks and other security threats to DOD personnel, units and activities. The measures below
are derived from DOD AT Standard 22 and include AF modifications. Commanders will ensure
these measures and developed measures address local and operational risks. Commanders must
consider GCC policies, local laws, mutual support agreements and/or the SOFA. Air Force
commanders are responsible for implementing FPCON measures.
   A2.1.1. Commanders shall ensure the following when implementing FPCON measures:
       A2.1.1.1. Ensure there is an effective AT plan and the plan is widely known and
       practiced in order to use ―every airman as a sensor‖.
       A2.1.1.2. Analyze the threat and plan courses of action to defeat those threats. Detailed
       planning against plausible enemy courses of action will often point to vulnerabilities
       which can be mitigated through adjustments to TTPs and further mitigated through
       innovation and programming.
       A2.1.1.3. Consider force on force or intruder play to test COAs. Development and
       implementation of effective friendly COAs to counter known threats offers a reasonable
       deterrent effect and the opportunity for long-term success against terrorist attack.
       A2.1.1.4. Ensure personnel assigned tasks directed by FPCON measures are properly
       trained and available to carry out the task.
       A2.1.1.5. Based on the threat, employ sufficient patrols to deter enemy action, disrupt
       terrorist planning and respond to incidents or attacks against the installation. Patrols
       should focus protection on critical operational assets, mission support infrastructure and
       mass gathering locations.
       A2.1.1.6. Consider placing barriers around identified critical assets, facilities with
       BSAT, restricted areas, high occupancy facilities, flight line entry points and high value
       resource areas to create standoff.
       A2.1.1.7. Review and be familiar with mutual aid and host tenant support agreements.
       Keep law enforcement agencies (federal, state and local) appraised of the current
       situation and threat to determine the level of incident support the installation provides or
       receives.
       A2.1.1.8. Ensure the installation Disaster Response Force and its sub elements are
       trained and available for response as described in AFI 10-2501.
   A2.1.2. The DOD FPCON System consists of five progressive levels of increasing AT
   protective measures.
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                          63


   A2.1.3. Site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to an FPCON, shall
   be classified ―CONFIDENTIAL.‖ When separated from the AT Plan, specific AT measures
   linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to ―FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY,‖ if appropriate.
   A2.1.4. Upon declaration of an FPCON level, all listed security measures for that FPCON
   level shall be implemented immediately unless waived in writing by the appropriate GCC or
   delegated representative. In non-DOD controlled facilities housing DOD occupants, DOD
   organizations shall implement applicable FPCON measures in space directly controlled by
   DOD to the extent possible. The supplementing RAMs and command-unique or site-specific
   measures should also be implemented to complicate a terrorist group’s operational planning
   and targeting.
   A2.1.5. AF installations and separate facilities shall supplement each FPCON measure in
   this instruction with site-specific details describing how the measure is to be implemented
   locally, to include responsibilities assigned to subordinate units and organizations.
   A2.1.6. Airfield-specific measures are for installations and facilities with a permanently
   functioning airfield. Installations and facilities with an emergency helicopter pad should
   review and implement any applicable airfield-specific measures when they anticipate air
   operations.
   A2.1.7. The CBRN related FPCON measures contained in this publication are not all
   inclusive. Additional CBRN FPCON measures are in the AF Civil Engineer Support Agency
   (AFCESA) Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 template. Each
   MAJCOM and installation should also develop additional CBRN FPCON measures
   applicable to their location.
A2.2. FPCON NORMAL. This condition applies when a general global threat of possible
terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control
will be conducted at all DOD installations and facilities.
   A2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 1: Secure and randomly inspect buildings, rooms and storage
   areas not in regular use.
   A2.2.2. Measure NORMAL 2 (AF Modified): Conduct random security checks of vehicles
   and persons entering facilities under the jurisdiction of the United States.
       A2.2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 2.1 (AF Added): Conduct random vehicle inspections at
       installation entry points in addition to base entry point checks (BEPC) as directed by
       installation commanders. Implement 100% inspection of large commercial vehicles.
       MAJCOM and local planners should define large commercial vehicles in integrated
       defense plans based on geographical location, character of local transport and threat.
       Conduct random vehicle inspections at entrances to restricted areas beyond inspection
       requirements listed in AFI 31-101.
   A2.2.3. Measure NORMAL 3: Limit access points for vehicles and personnel commensurate
   with a reasonable flow of traffic.
   A2.2.4. Measure NORMAL 4 (AF Modified): Identify defense critical infrastructure and
   critical assets, facilities with BSAT and high occupancy buildings.

                              TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A3.1. General. The standardized DOD methodology that describes the terrorist threat to DOD
personnel, facilities and interests shall be used to determine Terrorism Threat Levels (TTL). The
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DOD TTL for all countries. Terrorism threat levels
are established as the result of all-source analysis and incorporation of GCC and Military
Department input. The JITF-CT coordinates country TTLs with appropriate GCCs, Services and
Defense Attaches.
   A3.1.1. DIA and the responsible GCC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
   This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn
   from available information. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in
   determining the appropriate FPCON level and measures. FPCON level declarations remain
   the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat levels are not tied to FPCON levels in
   any way and should not be confused. National-level DOD organizations cannot provide all
   intelligence that might be needed to make FPCON level determinations. Information from
   regional and tactical intelligence and local law enforcement authorities must also be
   considered.
   A3.1.2. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DOD-designated high physical threat
   countries. DOD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DOD
   Travel Security Policy.
A3.2. Terrorist Threat Levels. In assessing the terrorist threat to U.S. personnel and interests,
DOD intelligence agencies use a four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. The
following lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine
the level:
   A3.2.1. HIGH: Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and use large casualty-
   producing attacks as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DOD
   presence and the operating environment favors the terrorist.
   A3.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their
   preferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks as their
   preferred method, but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
   A3.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present, but there are no indications of anti-US
   activity. The operating environment favors the Host Nation/US.
   A3.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.
A3.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors.
   A3.3.1. Operational Capability. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the
   group and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and
   ingenious use of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and
   willingness to conduct large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb
   containing thousand of kilograms of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at
   the target. Groups that selectively assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings
72                                                 AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


  causing limited property damage pose a decreasing threat. The ability to operate on a
  regional or transnational basis and the overall professionalism of the group is also assessed.
  A3.3.2. Intentions. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against U.S.
  interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the
  conduct of operations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is
  especially true if the intentions are anti-DOD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the
  group is more focused on the host nation rather than U.S. interests is the other key
  component. Whether the group will react to high profile U.S. led international events, such
  as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
  A3.3.3. Activity. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and
  whether that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is
  credible indications of U.S. targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final
  intelligence collection and movement of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening
  actions are contingency planning, training and logistical support. Activities that would make
  the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund raising or effective safe haven are
  considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by arrests or strikes on training
  camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
  A3.3.4. Operating Environment. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
  the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DOD interests in a given location. An
  important element of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to
  combat terrorism, its degree of cooperation with the U.S. and the quality of the reporting on
  terrorist groups in the country. A key element is whether there is a DOD presence and if so
  the type, size, location, political sensitivity and if temporary, its duration. It is also important
  to consider if the group is focused on DOD as its primary target for anti-US attacks. Another
  part of this factor is the overall political, economic and military stability of the country and
  its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

                RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCING PROCESSES

A4.1. Overview. The commander has an inherent command responsibility to reduce risks that
threaten the mission with available resources. Risk management described in AFPD 31-1, aids
the commander in assessing risk. If the commander cannot internally correct, mitigate or assume
risk, they must elevate these vulnerabilities and associated risk(s) through CVAMP. CVAMP
will forward the vulnerability through the chain of command to the GCC, who will decide if the
vulnerability will be reported higher.
A4.2. Resourcing. Emphasis should be placed on acquiring resources to detect, assess, warn,
defend or recover in order to prevent hostile acts or mitigate the effects. It is inherent upon the
organization to assess the resource requirement against other organizational unfunded or funded
requirements and determine if an internal reallocation of funding is appropriate and possible.
CVAMP is used to collate and track AT vulnerabilities and resourcing. The status of
vulnerabilities entered into CVAMP should be documented in CVAMP.
A4.3. AF Funding Sources.
   A4.3.1. Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPB&E). The PPB&E process
   includes requests considered during the POM funding cycle. This program is for long term
   planning and the funds will not be available for two to five years. Information on the
   PPB&E process can be found in the DOD Management Initiative Decision 913.
   A4.3.2. Installation and MAJCOM budget process and commander’s discretionary funds.
   A4.3.3. Many PEC and/or funding appropriations (AT, Physical Security, EM, Medical,
   Construction, Base Defense, Base Operating Support, Communications, Weapons of Mass
   Destruction Threat Response; Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Program; Fire
   Emergency Services; Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (SRM) and military
   construction (MILCON), etc.) may be used to fund AT resourcing activities. Commanders
   will consider all PEC and Funding Appropriation sources as authorized by law and AF policy
   and guidance.
   A4.3.4. Use Antiterrorism Program Element 28047F as the primary funding source for
   manpower authorizations, antiterrorism equipment, procurement, military construction and
   the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to those resources and activities
   associated with the Air Force AT Program.
   A4.3.4. (ACC) AT funds (PEC 28047) will be dispersed to primarily mitigate or correct
   vulnerabilities/concerns identified during VA’s and loaded in CVAMP. CVAMP UFR
   submissions will be the primary source for funding data calls. CVAMP administrators shall
   ensure UFRs are correctly inputted, monitored, and updated at least quarterly.
   A4.3.5. Specialized funds designed for AT and the war on terrorism.
A4.4. Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (CbT-RIF). This program was
established by Congress and is managed by the Joint Staff (J-3). It provides funds for emergency
or unforeseen (emergent) high priority force protection projects or equipment. It is designed for
requirements that need to be funded in the current fiscal year and provides a means for the GCC
to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in a terrorist threat, threat levels, force
 74                                                AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010


protection doctrine/standards, as well as unanticipated requirements identified as a result of VAs,
tactical operations and exercising AT Plans. If maintenance funds for CbT-RIF projects are not
programmed and provided from the parent Service, CbT-RIF can be used to fund maintenance
costs for those CbT-RIF-funded items during the year of purchase and the subsequent year as a
temporary measure to permit the Service adequate time to program life-cycle costs. The fund is
not intended to subsidize ongoing projects, supplement budget shortfalls, or support routine
activities, which are a Service responsibility. Requests must be submitted through the
responsible MAJCOM and GCC, per GCC policies, to the Joint Staff. Submission instructions
are outlined in CJCSI 5261.01E, Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund.
   A4.4.1. Emergency CbT-RIF Requirement. An unanticipated requirement created by a
   combination of circumstances or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent,
   deter, or respond to a terrorist act.
   A4.4.2. Emergent CbT-RIF Requirement. A newly formed, unexpected requirement
   resulting from a logical consequence of unforeseen circumstances calling for prompt action.
   A4.4.3. GCCs must submit requests for CbT-RIF funds through CVAMP.
   A4.4.4. Emergent requirements should be less than 2 years old. The requestor must have an
   approved, executable and exercised AT Plan.
A4.5. Effectively Managing the Resource Allocation Process.
   A4.5.1. Ensure you plan for training and maintenance costs into the out years.
   A4.5.2. The ATO needs to work closely with affected functional areas, installation financial
   advisors/comptroller and contracting from the beginning to address requirements. This will
   assist in identifying the appropriation sources and funding amounts.
   A4.5.3. Adequately articulating and justifying requirements is crucial.
   A4.5.4. Determine all appropriate potential funding sources and submit requests through the
   various channels. Once a requirement is funded by a source, cancel the other requests. Note:
   The Joint Staff does not allow the same request to be submitted through both the PPB&E and
   CbT-RIF process.
   A4.5.5. There are organizations that can aid the commander in identifying technology to
   satisfy requirements: Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG), Technical
   Support Working Group (TSWG), AFSFC Concepts Division, Joint Requirement Office for
   Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) and the Joint Non-
   Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). These organizations are separately funded to provide
   COTS information, rapid prototyping and research and development and/or evaluation of
   solutions for units in the field. They can provide information and research on technology and
   equipment evaluated and deemed suitable for your purpose. Additionally, they can provide
   field assessments to assist in identifying the optimal solutions to meet your requirements.

Task Organization: [Include all agencies/personnel (base and civilian) responsible to
implement the plan. Include as a separate Annex.] See Annex A (Task Organization).
Maps/Charts: (List all applicable maps or charts. Include enough data to insure personnel are
using the right year/edition/version of the subject material.)
Time Zone: (Enter the time zone of the installation. Indicate the number of hours to calculate
ZULU time.)
Ref: (Enter the compilation of pertinent publications, references, MOU/MOA/MAA. This list
may be included in a separate Annex.) See Annex Q (References).
1. SITUATION:
     a. General. (This plan applies to all personnel assigned or attached to the installation.
Describe the political/military environment in sufficient detail for subordinate commanders,
staffs, and units to understand their role in the installation AT operations.)
    b. Enemy. (The enemy is any adversary capable of threatening the installation's personnel,
facilities and equipment. Enter the general threat of terrorism, including transnational, to this
installation including; the intentions and capabilities, identification, composition, disposition,
location, and estimated strengths of hostile forces. Include the general threat of terrorist use of
WMD against this installation. This information should remain unclassified when possible. See
Paragraph 1f, Intelligence, on identifying specific threats. This information may be included as a
separate Annex.) See Annex B (Intelligence).
    c. Friendly. (Enter the forces available, both military and civilian, to respond to a terrorist
attack. Include the next higher headquarters and adjacent installations, and any
units/organizations that are not under installation command, but may be required to respond to
such an incident. These units/organizations may include HN and US military police forces, fire
and emergency services, medical, federal/state and local agencies, special operations forces,

engineers, WMD detection, EOD, and decontamination. Include MOAs/MOUs and any other
special arrangements that will improve forces available to support the plan.) (If CONUS, the
Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), is responsible for coordinating all
federal agencies and DOD forces assisting in the resolution of a terrorist incident. If OCONUS,
the Department of State is the lead agency.) This information can be included as a separate
Annex(s). See Annex A (Task Organization) and Annex J (Command Relationships).
    d. Attachments/Detachments. (Enter base/civilian agencies not normally assigned to the
base that will be needed to support this plan. Explain interagency relationships and
interoperability issues. List appropriate MOAs as necessary.) This can be listed in other
Annex(s). See Annex A (Task Organization) and Annex J (Command Relationships).
    e. Assumptions. (Enter all critical planning and execution assumptions used as a basis for
this plan. Assumptions are those factors that are unlikely to change during the implementation of
the AT installation plan. Put another way, those factors that you must address to allow you to
continue to plan. They may range from troop strength on base, major political/social
environment in the surrounding area, or terrorists acquiring shoulder fired antiaircraft missiles.)
Examples follow:
       (1) The installation is vulnerable to theft, pilferage, sabotage, and other threats.
      (2) An act of terrorism involving WMD can produce major consequences that will
overwhelm almost immediately the capabilities of the installation.
        (3) Security personnel, both military and civilian, may be insufficient to provide total
protection of all installation resources. Therefore, the principal owner or user of a facility,
resource, or personnel must develop adequate unit awareness and safeguard measures.
     (4) No single unit on the installation possesses the expertise to act unilaterally in response
to WMD attacks.
       (5) If protective equipment is not available, responders will not put their own lives at risk.
       (6) Local, nonmilitary response forces will arrive within (time) of notification.
       (7) Units specializing in WMD response will arrive on-site within (number of hours
based on installation location) of notification.
    f. Intelligence. (Enter the person, staff, or unit responsible for intelligence collection and
dissemination. The installation commander must have a system in place to access current
intelligence. The installation should have a process in place for developing the installation's
tailored threat assessment or "local threat picture." The installation's tailored threat assessment
should be continuously evaluated, updated, and disseminated as appropriate, and as directed by
the installation commander. The commander should determine the frequency and the means of
dissemination of the installation’s tailored AT product.) This can be included in Annex B
(Intelligence).
2. MISSION. (Enter a clear, concise statement of the command's mission and the AT purpose
or goal statement supporting the mission. The primary purpose of the AT installation plan is to
safeguard personnel, property, and resources during normal operations. It is also designed to
deter a terrorist threat; to enhance security and AT awareness; and to assign AT responsibilities
for all installation personnel.)
AFI10-245_ACCSUP_I 12 JANUARY 2010                                                                79


3. EXECUTION:
    a. Commander's Intent. (Commander's vision on how he/she sees the execution of the
unit's AT program.)
     b. Concept of Operations. (Enter how the overall AT operation should progress. This plan
stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive and response measures common to
all combatant commands and services. During day-to-day operations, the installation should
stress continuous AT planning and passive, defensive operations. This paragraph should provide
subordinates sufficient guidance to act upon if contact or communications with the installation
chain of command is lost or disrupted.)
        (1) The installation's AT concept of operations should be phased in relation to pre-
incident actions and post-incident actions utilizing the FPCON levels as a means of ramping the
installation up from FPCON NORMAL through consequence management actions. AT planning
and execution requires that staff elements work with a much greater degree of cohesiveness and
unity of mission than that required during the conduct of normal base sustainment operations.
The AT mission, and the unpredictability of its execution, requires very specific "how to"
implementation instructions of DOD FPCON measures and in what manner these actions must
be coordinated. The implementation instructions are put into the form of action sets and can be
displayed in the form of an execution matrix Pre-Incident Action Set Matrix).
        (2) In Post-Incident planning, the installation should focus on its response and
reconstitution responsibilities upon notification of a terrorist incident and the procedures for
obtaining technical assistance/augmentation if the incident exceeds the installation's organic
capabilities. National level responders (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Red
Cross, and FBI) may not be immediately accessible or available to respond to an installation's
needs. Therefore, each installation must plan for the worst-case scenario by planning its
response based on its organic resources and available local support through MOA/MOUs.
        (3) The situation may dictate that the installation not only conduct the initial response,
but also sustain response operations. This paragraph will include specific implementation
instructions for all functional areas of responsibility and the manner in which these actions must
be coordinated. The implementation instructions will be put in the form of action sets and
displayed in the form of a synchronization matrix broken down by FPCONs. The
synchronization matrix format must clearly describe relationships between activities, units,
supporting functions, and key events which must be carefully synchronized to minimize loss of
life and to contain the effects of a potential terrorist incident.
    c. Tasks. (Enter the specific tasks for each subordinate unit or element listed in the Task
Organization paragraph. Key members of the installation have responsibilities that are AT
and/or WMD specific. The commander should ensure that a specific individual/unit/element
within the installation is responsible for each action identified in this plan. Each
individual/unit/element must know the tasks and responsibilities, what these responsibilities
entail, and how these will be implemented. The AT Planning and Response Elements will be
delineated in the Pre- and Post-incident Action Set Matrices. It is recommended that the
installation commander identify/designate the primary lead for each element and enter that
information in this paragraph.)

    d. Coordinating Instructions. (This paragraph should include AT specific coordinating
instructions and subparagraphs, as the commander deems appropriate. In addition, this section of
the AT plan outlines aspects of the installation's AT posture that require particular attention to
guarantee the most effective and efficient implementation of the AT plan. For the purposes of
this plan, there are five basic coordinating instructions (1) AT Planning and Response Elements,
(2) Procedural; (3) Security Posture; (4) Threat Specific Responsibilities and (5) Special
Installation Areas. The sections listed below are representative, and may not be all-inclusive.)
         (1) AT Planning and Response. For instructional purposes, this section provides an
overview of AT Planning and Response Elements on the installation that is required to respond
to a terrorist/WMD incident. Initial and sustained response to an attack must be a coordinated
effort between the many AT Planning and Response Elements organic to the installation, based
on the installation's organic capabilities. As the situation exceeds the installation's capabilities, it
must activate MOAs/MOUs with the local/state/federal agencies. For the purposes of this plan,
an installation's capability is divided into AT Planning and Response Elements. These tailored
installation-level elements parallel the national-level FEMA elements and Defense Threat
Reduction Agency's Joint Staff Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) response criteria.
They may be used in conjunction with FPCON measures as appropriate. The AT Planning and
Response Elements that need to be addressed are:

requirements to support the AT plan, which should include enough information to make clear the
basic concept for planned logistics support. Ensure the staff conducts logistical planning for
both pre- and post-incident addressing; as an example, the following considerations: vehicle
support to security forces, locations of consolidated WMD defense equipment, expedient
decontamination supplies, Individual Protective Equipment exchange points, special
contamination control requirements, retrograde contamination monitoring sites, WMD
equipment/supply controlled supply rates and pre-stockage points, and procedures for chemical

defense equipment "push" packages. Specific logistics and administrative requirements will
emerge throughout the planning process outlined in the concept of operations, specifically when
developing the action sets. In summary, any logistical action to support the AT/FP plan from
pre-incident through incident recovery should be addressed.)
