This instruction implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs, and provides procedures for the
storage, handling, and transportation of Tier I, peacetime, explosive items for the purpose of
mobility processing during peacetime operations through the joint mobility complex (JMC),
Building 15510, and is designed to assist commanders, and Air Force and Army personnel at
Elmendorf AFB in developing and managing a unit level Explosive Safety Mishap Prevention
Program. All commanders should ensure each subordinate commander, staff officer, supervisor
and individual with operations involving explosives continuously reviews, recognizes, and
enforces mishap prevention techniques, procedures, and requirements. It also outlines
requirements for Explosive Site Plan 00-S02. These procedures are mandatory and deviations
will not be permitted. This instruction is not intended to be an all-encompassing text to take the
place of Air Force manuals, Army manuals, instructions, or technical orders. However, it should
serve as a guide and a ready reference for basic information to develop, direct, and enhance your
explosive safety program. Copies of the Explosive Operation Pre-Task Safety Briefing, Site
Plan and associated maps are available through the 3rd Wing Weapons Safety office. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR (see Attachment 1)

1. General Policy and Responsibility.
    1.1. Explosive safety standards are an extension of the will of CONGRESS and have the
    power of law. The Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) establishes
    explosives safety policy through DoD 6055.9, DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and
    DoD Component Explosives Safety Responsibility.
    1.2. The Air Force provides explosives safety guidance in AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety
    Standards. This manual is an extension of DoD 6055.9 and provides further guidance for Air
    Force-specific explosive safety issues.
    1.3. The 3 WG/CC is responsible for ensuring all known rules are followed within his/her
    command. The 3rd Wing Weapons Safety office assists him/her in these endeavors and must
    ensure compliance with all known explosive safety standards.
2. Operating Procedures. All personnel involved with the processing of explosives are
responsible for understanding and strictly observing all safety standards, requirements, and
precautions for the safe handling of explosives. Supervisors will act positively to eliminate any
potential accident hazards existing in the operation.
3. Explosive Limits, Hazard Class/Division.
    3.1. Building 15510 (JMC) is sited for 5,000 pounds Hazard Class/Division (HC/D) 1.3 and
    operational quantities of HC/D 1.4. The Hardstands 26, 26A, and 27 are sited for 10,000
    pounds 1.3 and operation quantities of 1.4. Inhabited building distance (IBD) is 115 feet for
    5,000 pounds of 1.3 and 150 feet for 10,000 pounds of 1.3. See maps (3 WG/SEW) for
    proper placement of explosives. The combined explosive weight of Building 15510 and
    Hardstands 26, 26A, and 27 cannot exceed 10,000 of 1.3 explosives.
    3.2. Refer to explosive site plan (ESP) 00-S02 for Air Force and Army use.
4. Personnel Limits. The cardinal rule for explosive safety is to expose the minimum amount
of people, to the minimum amount of explosives, for the minimum amount of time. The
explosive site plan (00-S02) identifies 45 people as assigned to run the facility and a maximum
of 800 personnel present during exercise/contingency mobility processing. Personnel should be
kept to a minimum to accomplish the mission. Visitors are nonessential personnel with limited
access. Explosive operations must stop when visitors are present. Casuals are persons not
normally part of an explosives operation, but have duties that require their presence, such as
quality assurance, safety or inspection personnel.
5. Operating Locations. West part of Building 15510, Hardstands 26, 26A, 27.
6. Safety Requirements.
    6.1. Ensure two each 2A:10BC fire extinguishers are readily available and serviceable.
    6.2. Remove rings, watches, and jewelry in accordance with AFOSH 91-66, General
    Industrial Operations, and 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground operations and Activities,
    and in accordance with AFMAN 91-201/ PACAF Sup 1, paragraph 2.4.4.
    6.3. No smoking or flammable materials within 50 feet of explosives.
    6.4. Vehicles/aerospace ground equipment cannot be parked within 100 feet of explosives,
    unless loading or unloading.
