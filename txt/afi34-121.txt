     2.2.2. Current and projected membership.
     2.2.3. Future capital expenditures.
2.3. Sales Policy. Clubs may sell goods and services related to the purpose and function of the
club, when the installation commander determines Army and Air Force Exchange Service

Exchange Service General Operations).
     2.3.1. Sales are limited to authorized club members (see AFI 34-262).

     first-come, first-served basis.

201. Employees must be properly trained in safe food handling, preparation, and storage
procedures and equipment cleaned and inspected. Work with other Force Support personnel,
with the necessary expertise, to ensure food safety. If alcoholic beverages are sold, the staff
must be trained in Dram Shop Theory. See AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program, for other

parachute, yacht, and riding clubs. Any club operating the same type of program or facility
covered by AFI 34-110 must follow that same guidance. For example, recreational club operated
shooting ranges must also have a lead shot harvest plan.
2.6. Serious Incident Reporting for Force Support Activities. In addition to any local
reporting procedures and notification through the chain of command (OPREP, beeline, etc.), FSS
Commanders or Directors must notify AF/A1S simultaneously (within four hours or as soon as
possible) of all serious incidents via https://www.usafservices.com/SIR/SIR.aspx. Incidents
that must be reported include:
   2.6.1. Major property damage or theft (fire, natural disaster, aero club or vehicle accident,
   etc.).
