This instruction implements AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and System Surety. It defines
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor Nuclear Certified
Equipment (NCE) and establishes local procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies
(flagword) “DULL SWORD” to the Wing Safety office. It applies to all military and civilian
personnel in units that handle or maintain NCE. It does not apply to 21st or 425th Fighter
Squadron equipment or personnel. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) Units. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes to this publication are administrative only to realign with the formatting in accordance
with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management guidelines.
1. General. Reinvigoration of the Air Force nuclear mission is a high priority. Reporting
malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities involving Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) in use at
 2                                                            LUKEAFBI91-101 24 JULY 2012


non-nuclear units is one aspect of the nuclear reinvigoration effort. The DULL SWORD nuclear
deficiency report provides a means of trend analysis to identify issues that could affect the safety
and reliability of an NCE asset for use in nuclear operations. This instruction serves to define
responsibilities and establishes local procedures to identify and monitor NCE, as well as
procedures for reporting suspected NCE deficiencies to the Wing Safety office for investigation
and up-channel reporting as warranted. Furthermore, when a product quality deficiency report is
submitted involving a nuclear certified asset, the unit will also complete a Luke AFB Form 327,
56 FW DULL SWORD Worksheet. The 56th Fighter Wing Safety office will determine if the
product quality deficiency also warrants DULL SWORD reporting.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Wing Weapons Safety Manager will:
        2.1.1. Serve as the installation DULL SWORD program manager.
        2.1.2. Provide training to unit NCE monitors and perform staff assistance visits as
        requested.
        2.1.3. Verify unit NCE listings are validated semi-annually.
        2.1.4. Conduct inspection of unit NCE program in conjunction with annual safety
        inspection.
        2.1.5. Investigate and submit reportable NCE malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities to
        the Air Force Safety Center through the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS).
     2.2. Unit commanders with Nuclear Certified Equipment assigned will:
        2.2.1. Appoint primary and alternate unit NCE monitors possessing at least a 5-skill level
        to serve as liaisons to the Wing Weapons Safety office. Personnel serving as Unit
        Weapons Safety Representatives may also be designated NCE monitors at the
        commanders’ discretion.
        2.2.2. Appointees will be replaced 30 days prior to separation, PCS, or deployment in
        excess of 30 days.
        2.2.3. Ensure appointees receive initial NCE monitor training from the Wing Weapons
        Safety office within 30 days of appointment.
        2.2.4. Certify semi-annual unit NCE verification listing (Attachment 2).
        2.2.5. Squadrons under the command of a group in which multiple squadrons have NCE
        assigned (i.e., MXG) may consolidate NCE into a single listing for certification by the
        Group Commander.
     2.3. Unit Nuclear Certified Equipment Monitors will:
        2.3.1. Identify all NCE assigned to their unit utilizing the Master Nuclear Certified
        Listing         (MNCL).                   Listing         is        located         at
        https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/index.cfm.
        2.3.2. Compile unit NCE listing and submit to the owning commander for certification.
        Unit listings will be revalidated semiannually. A copy will be submitted to Wing Safety.

     2.3.3. Report all NCE malfunctions, failures, and abnormalities meeting criteria outlined
     in section 3 to Wing Safety utilizing the Luke AFB Form 327, 56 FW DULL SWORD
     Worksheet (Attachment 2).
3. DULL SWORD Conditions.
  3.1. Refer to AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports for complete
  criteria.
     3.1.1. Malfunction, failure, or anomaly during operations or testing, potentially resulting
     in a safety or coded device to arm or be left in an unsafe condition (e.g., Safe and Arm
     devices).
     3.1.2. Stability, steering, or brake system problems that affect the safe steering, stopping,
     towing, or holding in park of a tow or transport vehicle (cargo, loading, or lifting). Do

     from fair wear and tear.
     3.1.3. Defects or failures in vehicle structural members (including the pintle hooks and
     mounting structure, fifth wheels) that support the load or transmit the towing or braking
     force.
     3.1.4. Inadequate restraint of loads attributed to trailer tie down points or tie down
     patterns.
     3.1.5. Unsafe condition or improper operation of the hydraulic, mechanical, and
     structural components of lift vehicles (e.g., forklifts and K-loaders) resulting in
     unresponsive operation, uncontrolled raising or lowering, or improper cargo restraint.
     3.1.6. Exceeding the rated load-capacity of any equipment/vehicle listed in the MNCL.
     3.1.7. Damage, malfunction, failure, or anomaly involving test equipment listed in the
     MNCL.
     3.1.8. Recognizable failure modes where specific diagnostic and corrective actions are
     outlined in current technical data, including fair wear and tear, are not reportable.
