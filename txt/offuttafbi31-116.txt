                                    DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
     2.1.1. Driving on Offutt AFB is a privilege granted by the installation commander. Motor
     vehicle operators will comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle
     operation and registration on the installation. Failure to comply with the laws and
     instructions can result in administrative action, punitive action or both.
     2.1.2. Persons who accept the privilege must:
        2.1.2.1. Lawfully be licensed to operate motor vehicles in appropriate classifications and
        not be under suspension or revocation in any State.
        2.1.2.2. Possess, while operating a motor vehicle, and produce on request by law
        enforcement personnel, the following:
            2.1.2.2.1. Proof of vehicle ownership, or State registration if required by the issuing
            State. All vehicles being operated on Offutt AFB will display license plates in
            accordance with the requirements of the state where the vehicle is licensed.
                2.1.2.2.1.1. Under the Service Members Civil Relief Act of 2003, military
                members may retain their original state of residency throughout their service,
                despite living in various states solely by reason of their military service. The Act,
                by implication, allows military members to register their vehicles in one of two
                places, either their state of residence or the state in which they are currently
                living. Military members stationed at Offutt AFB and living in Nebraska or Iowa
                have only two options for registering their vehicles, their state or Nebraska/Iowa
                as applicable.
            2.1.2.2.2. A valid State or international driver’s license (with appropriate
            classifications, as applicable to the class vehicle to be operated) and a valid access
            credential (i.e. Common Access Card, AF Form 75, Visitor Pass) when on Offutt
            AFB.
                2.1.2.2.2.1. Acceptable identification media for escorted/unescorted entry to the
                installation is identified in the Installation Defense Plan. International driver’s
                licenses are valid up to 30 days upon arrival at the installation, after which only
                valid State licenses are permitted. For a complete explanation of available
                licenses or permits, see Nebraska Statutes, Chapter 60, section 60-480. Operators’
                Licenses: classification. A valid state operator’s permit or international driver’s
                license is required to operate any motor vehicle and must be in the physical
                possession of the operator.
                2.1.2.2.2.2. Security Forces may conduct a National Crime Information Center
                (NCIC) check to verify the status of an individual’s driver’s license.
                   2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Individuals who have been issued a valid State or international
                   driver’s license (verified through NCIC at the time of the vehicle stop) but not
                   in possession of the license at the time of the vehicle stop, will be cited for
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                9


                  driving without a valid operator’s license. The individual must report to the
                  Reports and Analysis section (55 SFS/S-5R) with the valid license within 72
                  hours in order to have the citation voided. Failure to comply will result in the
                  citation being processed to the unit for command action, and/or possible
                  suspension/revocation of installation driving privileges.
                  2.1.2.2.2.2.2. Individuals without a valid State or international driver’s
                  license at the time of the stop will be cited for driving without a license and
                  there are no provisions to have these citations voided.
              2.1.2.2.2.3. Persons who knowingly allow an unlicensed driver to operate a motor
              vehicle are subject to a one-year revocation of their installation driving privileges.
              2.1.2.2.2.4. If a person is driving on Offutt AFB with a learner’s permit, the
              passenger in the vehicle must be twenty-one years of age and must also possess a
              valid operator’s license.
          2.1.2.2.3. Valid proof of insurance. Proof of insurance consists of an insurance card,
          or other documents issued by the insurance company, that has a policy effective date
          and an expiration date. Vehicle operators must maintain the minimum levels of
          insurance required by law. Operating or allowing the operation of a motor vehicle
          not insured to the minimum requirements of the state of registration will result in a 1-
          year revocation of the vehicle owner’s installation driving privileges.
              2.1.2.2.3.1. Proof of Financial Responsibility/Evidence of Insurance.             An
              individual cited for failure to provide proof of financial responsibility or evidence
              of insurance must provide proof the next duty day (72 hours if cited during the
              weekend) after being cited for driving without insurance to the 55 SFS/S-5R
              section.
              2.1.2.2.3.2. Failure to provide valid proof of insurance within the prescribed time
              frame will result in the initiation of a one year revocation of base driving
              privileges. Individual’s driving without insurance at the time of the violation will
              have their base driving privileges revoked for a period of one year.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. Defense forces will conduct random installation entry/exit vehicle checks (RIEVCs)
   as directed by the Installation Commander or delegated authority. The intent is to protect the
   security of the command and to protect government property. RIEVCs are not conducted
   merely to establish probable cause; inspections ensure the security, military fitness, and good
   order and discipline of the command, and may include an examination to locate and
   confiscate unlawful weapons and other contraband. The Installation Commander has
   delegated the authority to determine when, where and how to implement the checks to the 55
   MSG/CC. Specific procedures for RIEVCs are contained in the Installation Defense Plan.
   2.2.2. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted area
   Entry Control Points [ECPs]) of POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to
   believe it is necessary to enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal
   activity.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests
for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting
installation driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or
cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor
vehicle on Offutt AFB.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of
their POV if their POV is: 1) illegally parked for more than 7 consecutive days; 2) interferes with
traffic operations; 3) creates a safety hazard; 4) is disabled by accident or incident; 5) left
unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area; 6) abandoned; or 7)
involved in a suspected intoxicated driving incident. Drivers also agree to reimburse an
authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise
to remove or impound their motor vehicle because of a situation described above. Refer to
Chapter 6 for specific information on vehicle towing and impoundment.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges.
   2.5.1. 55 MSG/CC is designated as the suspension/revocation authority for all traffic actions
   and violations to include restoration of driving privileges and granting of restricted driving
   privileges. The Installation Commander further designates the 55 MSG/CC as the
   administrative hearing authority. The DFC is the point of contact for matters concerning
   traffic citation rebuttals and has the authority to void any issued citation.
   2.5.2. Suspensions.
       2.5.2.1. The Installation Commander or designee has discretionary authority and may
       withdraw anyone's authorization to operate a vehicle on the installation.
       2.5.2.2. Driving privileges can be suspended for serious violations or when lesser
       measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The Installation Commander or
       designee may also suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually
       violates installation parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered
       non-moving in nature.
       2.5.2.3. Installation GOV or POV driving privileges will be immediately suspended for
       any driver suspected of an intoxicated driving incident pending resolution of the
       intoxicated driving incident. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an
       intoxicated driving incident.
       2.5.2.4. Suspected intoxicated driving incidents include:
           2.5.2.4.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine
           Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) or Breath Alcohol Content (BrAC) for alcohol or other
           drugs.
           2.5.2.4.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.08 percent by volume
           or higher. Offutt AFB assimilates the standard utilized by the State of Nebraska (i.e.,
           0.08 percent).
           2.5.2.4.3. Persons under the age of 21 operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or
           BrAC level standard of .01 or higher.

     authorities after being arrested, detained or held in custody by civilian authorities.” First
     Sergeants (for enlisted personnel) or commanders (for officers) will ensure military
     members are escorted to Bldg. 160/Security Forces HQ for issuance of a suspension
     letter:
12                                             OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013


         2.5.2.5.1. During non-duty hours: Report to Bldg. 160/Security Forces HQ and
         contact the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) to be issued a notice of

         the 55 SFS/S-5R section to be issued a notice of suspension of installation driving
         privileges.
     2.5.2.6. Once an individual has completed initial civil court proceedings, it is the
     offender’s responsibility to provide their unit First Sergeant or civilian equivalent with
     documentation on the outcome of the initial proceedings. The unit First Sergeant or
     civilian equivalent is responsible for providing a copy of this documentation to 55 SFS/S-
     5R, which will be added to the offender’s case file. This allows 55 WG/JA and the 55
     MSG/CC the opportunity to make an informed decision concerning the final revocation
     of the offender’s base driving privileges.
         2.5.2.6.1. Unreported DUIs/DWIs. Government civilian personnel who work on the
         installation and active duty military personnel are required to report the event to 55
         SFS/S-5R for processing of suspension/revocation of base driving privileges.
  2.5.3. Revocations.
     2.5.3.1. The Installation Commander or designee will revoke driving privileges for a
     period of not less than one year in the following circumstances:
         2.5.3.1.1. In the event a vehicle operator refuses (for on- and off-base offenses) to
         submit to a chemical test of their breath, blood or urine for the presence of alcohol or
         drugs, the driver’s 1-year revocation is effective immediately. If the vehicle operator
         is currently already under installation suspension/ revocation, the revocation will be
         added onto the existing base suspension/ revocation.
         2.5.3.1.2. A conviction, non-judicial punishment, or a military or civilian
         administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for

         2.5.3.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the
         Installation Commander or designee determines immediate revocation of driving
         privileges is required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline on the
         installation.
     2.5.3.2. Revocations under paragraphs 2.5.3.1.1. and 2.5.3.1.2. will normally be 1-year in
     duration; however, the individual whose driving privileges have been revoked may
     request permission to install and have monitored, at their own volition and expense, an
     ignition interlock device for the duration of the time their driving privileges would have
     been revoked. The Installation Commander or designee may, in their sole discretion,
     approve or disapprove such a request. For the request format use Attachment 8.
  2.5.4. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, the revocation period will
  be computed from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full
  driving privileges were restored pending resolution of charges.
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            13


   2.5.5. Multiple suspensions will run consecutively unless otherwise determined by the
   revoking authority.
   2.5.6. Squadron commanders may recommend suspension/revocation of on-base driving
   privileges of a military member or civilian employee assigned to their unit to 55 MSG/CC.
   2.5.7. Personnel apprehended/detained for DUI/DWI or operating a vehicle while under
   suspension/revocation are subject to having the vehicle impounded and towed.
   2.5.8. The DFC will forward revocation, suspension, and driving records to gaining
   commanders and initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar records from losing
   commanders of inbound personnel.
      2.5.8.1. The 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section is responsible for administration of
      reports of moving traffic violations, suspensions, and revocations between military and
      state law enforcement authorities. Once command action is completed on each case file,
      the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) (currently linked to
      MILPDS) will automatically transfer the individual history record to the Reports and
      Analysis section of the gaining installation. A hard copy of all active suspension and
      revocation case files are forwarded via certified mail to the gaining servicing security
      forces unit. Upon receipt of gaining individual history, 55 SFS/S-5R will send an
      electronic copy of the history to the individual’s gaining commander through the unit
      First Sergeant if it contains unfavorable information.
      2.5.8.2. If a newly assigned individual is identified as having a current suspension or
      revocation, the 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section will request a hard copy of the case
      file from the previous servicing security forces unit and the person’s information will be
      added to the base suspension/ revocation/barment/warrant (SRBW) list pending review
      by the 55 MSG/CC and 55 WG/JA.
          2.5.8.2.1. The 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section will staff the newly assigned
          individual’s case history to the 55 MSG/CC through 55 WG/JA for a final decision.
          While Offutt AFB will honor revocations issued by other installation commanders
          regardless of service component affiliation, suspensions will be handled on a case-by-
          case basis (see paragraph 2.6./Reciprocal Procedures). The individual involved will
          be advised of the final 55 MSG/CC decision concerning the suspension or revocation
          through his/her first sergeant and will acknowledge receipt of the suspension or
          revocation (if applicable) in writing.
          2.5.8.2.2. The 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section will add the suspension or
          revocation to the SRBW list. Questions concerning the SRBW list can be directed to
          55 SFS/S-5R at extension 294-3185. The 55 SFS Installation Security Section (55
          SFS/S-5IF) will maintain a current SRBW listing at each installation ECP.
2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.6.1. Reciprocal Military Procedures. Offutt AFB will honor revocations issued by other
   installation commanders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in
   effect during reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation prior to the
   reassignment. The Installation Commander or designee may honor suspensions as
 14                                               OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013


   determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or revocated privileges may
   petition the installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.
   2.6.2. Reciprocal State-Military Action. Offutt AFB will honor revocations and suspensions
   issued by state driver-licensing authorities for suspension and revocation of driving
   privileges. Additionally, the 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section will notify the licensing
   authority of the State where a license is issued when a person’s installation driving privileges
   are revoked following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to
   submit to a BAC/BrAC test.
      2.6.2.1. The notification will include the basis for revocation and the BAC/BrAC level.
      2.6.2.2. Notification will be made via US Postal Service Certified Mail. On receipt of
      written notice, the State may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or
      incidents occurred within its own jurisdiction.
      2.6.2.3. Personnel who receive a suspension or revocation of a State-issued driver’s
      license will report to the 55 SFS/S-5R the next duty day to advise the Reports and
      Analysis technician of the suspension or revocation of State-issued driver’s license and
      provide pertinent information concerning the suspension/revocation to the Reports and
      Analysis technician.
          2.6.2.3.1. S-5R will notify 55 WG/JA for a recommendation and request a
          suspension or revocation decision (as applicable) from the 55 MSG/CC.
          2.6.2.3.2. Personnel will acknowledge receipt of the suspension or revocation of their
          on-base driving privileges with their signature, as witnessed by the Reports and
          Analysis technician or another individual assigned to the 55 SFS serving the memo.
          2.6.2.3.3. Unit vehicle control officers/NCOs will ensure the individual’s AF Form
          293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card is confiscated and
          forwarded to 55 LRS/LGRV for disposition.
2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, the person
   will be notified in writing on what action is being considered and the reason for it. This
   notice is coordinated with 55 WG/JA.
   2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined under paragraphs 2.5.2.3. through 2.5.2.4.6., do not
   suspend or revoke a person's driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts
   made) and offered an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. Only in unusual

   alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor vehicle/traffic incidents or
   misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is reasonable suspicion
   of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing. Commanders are also
   encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) is taken as soon after the incident as
   possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement.
   2.9.2. The commander will ensure military personnel convicted of, or receiving an official
   administrative action for, intoxicated (drug or alcohol related) motor vehicle are referred for
   alcohol and drug abuse evaluation. The provisions of this paragraph do not limit the
   commander’s prerogatives concerning other actions that may be taken against an offender
   under separate Service/agency polices.
   2.9.3. Commanders are responsible for referring military personnel involved in any
   intoxicated (drug or alcohol related) motor vehicle incident to Mental Health for evaluation.
   First Sergeant’s will ensure this referral is documented with the appropriate referral agency
   and documented. This will normally be completed during the Command Action phase and
   documented on the AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, Section VIII- Commander’s Action –
   Offender Identifier, which is then forwarded to 55 SFS/S-5R.
       2.9.3.1. Active duty Air Force, members of the Air Force Reserve Command and Air

       receive a minimum of 6-hours of awareness education before reinstatement of base
       driving privileges can be made. Unit First Sergeants or civilian equivalents will ensure
       55 SFS/S-5R is notified of the date the individual completed the 6-hour awareness
       education class/training and document the completion on Section VIII of the AF Form
       3545A.
2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges.
   2.10.1. The Installation Commander or designee may authorize restricted driving privileges
   to those whose authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated. The
   individual’s civilian state driving credentials must still be valid.
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             17


   2.10.2. Without due cause, restricted driving privileges or reinstatement will not be given to
   any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a State
   licensing authority.
      2.10.2.1. If absolutely necessary (and for on installation privileges only), coordinate with
      55 WG/JA.
      2.10.2.2. This option applies only to areas where the Installation Commander exercises
      exclusive military jurisdiction (refer to Attachment 2 for jurisdictional areas). This
      privilege does not extend to areas designated as Proprietary jurisdiction.
      2.10.2.3. Requests will only be considered when there is extreme hardship and there are
      no other workable alternatives. Granting of limited privileges will not be used as an
      alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is the more appropriate
      action.
      2.10.2.4. The Installation Commander or designee will weigh the potential liability
      inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state license is allowed to
      operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropriate
      when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of
      performing their military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.
   2.10.3. All requests for restricted driving privileges must be in writing in accordance with
   Attachment 11, Restricted Driving Privileges Request. Submit the request to the 55 SFS
   Reports and Analysis section for processing.
      2.10.3.1. Upon receiving a request for restricted driving privileges, 55 SFS/S-5R will
      ensure the person’s civilian State driving credentials are valid prior to the request being
      sent to the Installation Commander or designee for a decision. This will primarily be
      accomplished using the NCIC system.
      2.10.3.2. If approved, the restricted individual will be notified by letter and subsequently
      issued an AF Form 75/Visitor’s Pass identifying the restricted driving privilege. The
      individual must have the letter and AF Form 75 in their possession when operating a
      vehicle and must present the items upon request.
2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. The suspension or revocation period will be increased by two years if an individual is
   discovered driving while their driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under
   suspension or revocation. Any restricted driving privileges previously granted are
   immediately revoked.
   2.11.2. The Unit or Installation Commander may also take administrative or disciplinary
   action.

                             TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic
supervision. Traffic supervision includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and
control of motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and
regulations together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are
also important. To be successful, education and communication with the general public is vital.
   4.1.1. Traffic circulation plans provide for the safest and most efficient use of primary and
   secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circulation control. The
   base traffic engineer, DFC, Chief of Safety, and other members of the base traffic control
   plan committee develop the traffic circulation plan. The base traffic control plan committee
   will include representatives from the 55 SFS Installation Security (55 SFS/S-5I) and Reports
   and Analysis (55 SFS/S-5R) sections. 55 SFS/S-5IF will provide advice on the impact to
   current security plans and assist with traffic control studies; 55 SFS/S-5R will provide
   accident/incident data for evaluation when requested. As a minimum, the base traffic control
   plan committee uses the following to develop the base traffic plan:
       4.1.1.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
       4.1.1.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
       measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
       4.1.1.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
       traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
       4.1.1.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
       4.1.1.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
       4.1.1.6. Efficient use of mass transportation, if feasible.
       4.1.1.7. Traffic control studies using factual data on existing roads, traffic density and
       flow patterns, and points of congestion. The DFC and traffic engineer usually conduct
       coordinated traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine
       major and minor routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions
       requiring engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.2. The chief of airfield management will provide program oversight for flight line
   vehicle operations IAW AFI 13-213, Airfield Management.
4.2. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.2.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement emphasizes selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. This is
   accomplished through:
       4.2.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel. The Installation
       Traffic Supervision Vehicle Code is available on the Air Force e-Publishing website at
       www.e-publishing.af.mil.

       4.2.1.2. Selective enforcement activities and analysis of traffic statistics.
           4.2.1.2.1. The DFC has been delegated authority by the Installation Commander to
           determine selective enforcement activities. 55 SFS/S-5R will compile traffic analysis
           statistics on a monthly basis and provide the data to 55 SFS/S-5IF to determine
           selective enforcement efforts by law enforcement patrols.

   POVs within Bldg. 301-D. The 55 CES/CEU maintains this document.
4.17. Parking Wardens.
   4.17.1. Offutt AFB uses parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking
   violators, especially within off-street parking facilities. The parking warden program is
   designed to ensure safe and adequate parking is available in support of the installation
   mission. Enforcement of the regulatory guidance is the key to meeting the needs of this
   program. The 55 MSG/CD is the overall authority for this program.
   4.17.2. Unit commanders are responsible for managing a facility's parking plan by
   overseeing the actions of the parking lot wardens. Parking wardens enforce the regulatory
   guidance for their associated parking lots. Parking wardens are given the authority to enforce
   the parking requirements as outlined in this instruction. This authority includes, but is not
   limited to, citing vehicles parked in reserved parking slots, double parked, parked on hash
   lines, on the grass, or any place other than a designated parking area. This authority is
   extended only to areas of the installation that are associated with their organization or areas
   of responsibility.
   4.17.3. Each facility may select personnel to act as facility parking wardens. These
   personnel will be designated in writing by the commander of the unit, to which the facility is
   assigned. The letter should specify a minimum of one primary and alternate in the grade of
   E-5 or above, or the civilian grade of GS-6 or above. Those selected as parking wardens will
   contact 55 SFS training section to coordinate training. Training will be scheduled and
   provided by the 55 SFS training section. Personnel are not authorized to write tickets until
   this training is completed.
   4.17.4. After training is complete, a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket book will
   be issued to the parking warden. A copy of the appointment letter will be maintained on file
   with the 55 SFS Reports and Analysis section (55 SFS/S-5R).
   4.17.5. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member
   and one issued by a parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy
   that directs the violator to contact the parking monitor who issued the ticket instead of
 34                                              OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013


   SFAR/S-5R. It is important that parking monitors include how or where they can be reached
   by the violators.
   4.17.6. When contacted by the violator, the parking monitor will fill in any missing data in
   sections 1-10 of the DD Form 1408. Tickets that are incomplete or were written by
   personnel not designated as parking monitors will not be processed and will be returned to
   the unit.
   4.17.7. Once the violator makes contact with the parking monitor and the parking monitor
   determines the citation will stand, the citation will be forwarded to 55 SFS/S-5R. Citations
   received more than 10 days after the date they were written will not be processed.
4.18. Booting.
   4.18.1. The “Denver boot” device is authorized for use as a technique to assist in the
   enforcement of parking violations where immobilization of the POV is necessary for safety.
   The device will not be used to punish or “teach a lesson” to violators. Booting may be used
   if other reasonably effective but less restrictive means of enforcement (such as warnings,
   ticketing, reprimands, revocations, or suspensions of installation driving privileges) fail.
   4.18.2. Use of “booting” focuses on specific reasons for booting, such as immobilization of
   unsafe, uninspected, or unregistered vehicles or compelling the presence of repeat offenders.
   4.18.3. When a “Denver boot” is attached to a vehicle, a warning sticker will be affixed to
   the lower, right-hand corner of the driver’s side front window. The sticker serves as a
   warning to the vehicle operator and provides instructions on who to call to have the “boot”
   removed.
   4.18.4. Individual’s that have had their vehicle “booted” are required to contact the ECC at
   extension 294-4245 or 294-4246 for further assistance.
   4.18.5. The “Denver boot” may also be applied in the following situations.
      4.18.5.1. During a Hit-and-Run (or serious offense) when the vehicle involved is
      positively located and positively identified, to prevent the departure of the offender. The
      vehicle in question will remain “booted” until the offender is released from security
      forces custody or directed by competent authority.
      4.18.5.2. For unattended vehicles when information from National Crime Information
      Center (NCIC) notifications, such as driving on suspension, felony warrant, or other
      lawful notifications where contact with the vehicle owner/operator is required due to the
      public interest.
      4.18.5.3. In the event that an unattended child or pet is left secured in a vehicle and in the
      interest of the health and wellbeing of the child or pet, the immediate extraction is
      deemed necessary by the responding patrolman or flight chief, the vehicle will be
      “booted” until a time in which the vehicle owner/operator can be located and
      subsequently released from security forces custody.
   4.18.6. Booting of vehicles will only be conducted by personnel assigned to the 55 SFS who
   have been trained and certified. Training will be documented on the individuals AF Form
   797/Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command Job Qualification Sheet.

exchange traffic activities and data with civil authorities. The 55 SFS will maintain local unit
procedures for receiving, processing, and securing traffic reports and related incident reports
from local police agencies.
   4.20.1. Active duty military members are required to immediately notify the Emergency
   Communications Center, and their supervisor, First Sergeant or Commander when they are
   detained/arrested by civil authorities for DWI/DUI or any other incident (this does not
   include minor traffic citations) resulting in incarceration.
   4.20.2. Security Forces will notify an individual’s Unit Commander or First Sergeant when
   notified by civilian police that a military member was detained or arrested. If the incident is
   due to an intoxicated driving incident, Security Forces will inform them a Preliminary
   Suspension of Base Driving Privileges memo must be served to the person within 12 hours
   from notification of release from custody. The Unit Commander/First Sergeant will ensure
   the person is escorted to Bldg. 160/SFHQ and contact Emergency Communications Center
   (ECC), via extension 294-6110 or 294-6119 so the letter can be served.
       4.20.2.1. Security Forces will accomplish a blotter entry about the arrest and issue the

   accidents, incident and other related documents created by the 55 SFS as Privacy Act
   requests. An Offutt Form 3121/55th Security Forces Document Request must be used to
   request these types of documents. Responses to requests for information contained in
   approved systems of records will be processed using the guidelines shown in AFI 33-332,
   Privacy Act Program.
       4.21.1.1. If the time parameters cannot be met, the Reports and Analysis section will
       provide the requester with a written statement identifying when the record will be made
       available.
       4.21.1.2. If partial or total denial of the requested document will be rendered, the Report
       and Analysis section will inform the requester that a Freedom of Information Act Request

4.23. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.23.1. Security forces personnel will utilize the DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report,
   to documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual. The DD Form 1920 will be used
   in examining, interpreting, and recording results of field sobriety tests. Document all driving
   while intoxicated offenses using AF Form 3545A, Incident Report.
   4.23.2. If a security forces member reasonably suspects that the individual driving or in
   control of a vehicle is impaired, field sobriety tests should be conducted on the individual.
   Perform standard Air Force field sobriety tests, which consist of the one leg stand, the walk
   and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Only qualified personnel will conduct field
   sobriety tests and that qualification must be documented on the individual’s training record.
      4.23.2.1. If an individual suspected of DWI/DUI refuses to perform the standardized Air
      Force field sobriety tests, their refusal and security force observations will be annotated
      on the DD Form 1920.
   4.23.3. Security forces can use Portable Breath Testers (PBT) to aid in the establishment of
   probable cause. In order to use the PBT, users must have been trained by the Nebraska
   Department of Motor Vehicles and possess a Class C Permit. Permits will be maintained by
   the 55 SFS Installation Security Section.

   results of the test as follows and suspend driver’s installation driving privileges pending
   resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
      4.24.1.1. Persons under the age of 21 operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC
      level standard of .01 or higher.
      4.24.1.2. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent,
      presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.

      4.24.1.3. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine
      Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) or Breath Alcohol Content (BrAC) for alcohol or other
      drugs.
      4.24.1.4. Commercial Vehicle Driver with a BAC or BrAC of .04 or higher, the person is
      considered to have been driving under the influence of intoxicants in accordance with NE
      statute 60-465.
      4.24.1.5. If the percentage is 0.05 percent but less than 0.08 percent, presume the person
      is impaired. Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining
      whether the person was under the influence of alcohol. DO NOT allow the individual to
      operate a motor vehicle until a recommendation is received from 55 WG/JA and 55
      MSG/CC (55 MSG/CD or 55 MSG/DD in the 55 MSG/CCs absence).
      4.24.1.6. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.08 percent by volume or
      higher, or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
      been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Offutt AFB assimilates the standard
      utilized by the State of Nebraska (i.e., 0.08 percent).
4.25. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.25.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction under the following
   circumstances:
      4.25.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally
      accepted scientific and medical methods and standards.
      4.25.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.

          4.25.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the
          breath specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew
          tobacco, or ingest any substance.
          4.25.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to
          manufacturer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation
          requirements.
          4.25.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current

      medical authorities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or
      mishap. Conduct tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the
      blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as soon as possible and where practical within eight hours
      of death. Include the test results in the medical reports.
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             43


       4.25.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath
       sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.
4.26. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.26.1. The suspect will be asked to consent to a chemical test of bodily fluids or breathe in
   accordance with the Implied Consent Policy, as defined in paragraph 2.3. The individual
   does not have the right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not
   take the test.
   4.26.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.26.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
       motor vehicle on the installation.
       4.26.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.26.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
       failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breathe
       may result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
   4.26.3. Also advise the driver that the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
   consent provisions of this instruction can be used as evidence in courts-martial, non-judicial
   proceedings under Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.26.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
   refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but will be offered a breath or urine test, or both.
   Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
   4.26.5. Erhling Bergquist Clinic/Specimen Collection lab will perform extraction of urine
   and blood. During non-duty hours, on-call personnel will be notified (extension 296-5236 or
   via Cell phone at extension 598-2417) and respond to conduct the extraction.
   4.26.6. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a breath test, do not
   administer a test except as specified in paragraph 4.27.
4.27. Chemical Testing Devices. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved
NHTSA conforming products list published in the Federal Register. Ensure only qualified
personnel administer breath tests. Personnel will be trained by the Nebraska Department of
Motor Vehicles and will receive a Class B Permit. Permits for qualified personnel will be
maintained by 55 SFS/S-5I. If blood or urine testing will be conducted, ensure qualified medical
personnel obtain the samples and conduct the tests.
4.28. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.28.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped,
   apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
   vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
   Rule 312(d), Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
   granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
   other kinds of investigations.
 44                                               OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013


   4.28.2. If an individual refuses to submit to a breath test, further search authority actions will
   be coordinated through 55 WG/JA. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine)
   require valid search and seizure authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not
   consent to chemical testing, and who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the
   test, may be forced to submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. Probable cause
   must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of a vehicle while under the
   influence of an intoxicant.
   4.28.3. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the following procedures: 1) A search
   authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule
   317, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction; 2) A
   search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication
   that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay
   necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the
   evidence sought; and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the
   servicing staff judge advocate and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official
   fail because of the unavailability of the appropriate commander or military magistrate.
      4.28.3.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
      unsuccessful (due to non-availability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered
      by Rule 317(d), Military Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an
      individual located in the facility at the time an authorization is sought.
          4.28.3.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the
          medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff
          judge advocate.
          4.28.3.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule
          317(d) need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person
          can perform the extraction.
          4.28.3.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
          individual in determining probable cause.
   4.28.4. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
   purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
   defining medical care. Only qualified medical personnel administer extractions and use only
   reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to overcome an individual’s
   resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law enforcement personnel or unit
   personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer or designee. Do not
   use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
      4.28.4.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical
      attention. Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions
      when other medical treatment is required.
4.29. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.29.1. A person subject to tests by Implied Consent can request additional testing. These
   tests are paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base
   hospital or research laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           45


   a military or civilian court of law, they must ensure the State approves the test and test
   method. The individual should complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the
   resulting documents.
   4.29.2. Additional testing is the sole responsibility of the individual.
4.30. Compliance with Local and State Laws. All personnel operating a Government Owned
Vehicle will comply with state and local laws on- and off-base.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. The Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) will be
used to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and parking violations, suspension or revocation
actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and DoD civilian personnel, their family
members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on Offutt AFB.
   5.1.1. Use AF Form 1313, Driver Record, when SFMIS is not available. When filling out
   the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
       5.1.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “Driver 1”
       subject or “Driver 2” victim.
       5.1.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; (MJVA)
       major vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability determined; “PD” property damage; “PI”
       personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object.
   5.1.2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Mandatory
   revocation actions are contained in Table 5.3., Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges.
   This table does not preclude suspensions or revocations being imposed for other violations.
   5.1.3. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as one
   year for intoxicated driving, revocations will run consecutively (total of 24 months).

           accordance with Table 5.1.
           5.2.1.1.3. The third offense within 12 months will result in a 6-month suspension of
           base driving privileges and the individual’s base traffic history being assessed points
           in accordance with Table 5.1.
           5.2.1.1.4. Citations issued to personnel for exceeding the base housing posted speed
           limit by 16 mph or more will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

all other individuals subject to this instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an
individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according to the Table 5.1. and Table 5.2. Also
assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon payment of fine
or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral.
5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 will serve as a basis
   for determining point assessment, except in cases where a AF Form 3545A is accomplished
   and a DD Form 1408 not issued (i.e., intoxicated driving, driving on revocation, etc.). In
   cases where an AF Form 3545A is used, points will be assessed based upon the offense.
   5.4.2. The following driver improvement measures will be utilized, as appropriate:
       5.4.2.1. Notification will be made to individuals and their respective First Sergeant when
       the individual acquires 10 traffic points within a 12 month period. This will facilitate a
       counseling or driver improvement interview by the First Sergeant or Unit Commander, if
       needed. Notification will be made in writing, either by e-mail or US Postal Service
       Certified Mail.
       5.4.2.2. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
       appears to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on
       driving ability.

   5.4.4. The Installation Commander or designee may suspend or revoke driving privileges as
   provided by this instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are
   accomplished.
   5.4.5. If a person accumulates 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months or 18 traffic
   points within 24 consecutive months, the individual’s driving privileges will be revoked for
   one year.
   5.4.6. When a driver is apprehended/detained (on- or off-base) for DWI/DUI or refusing to
   submit to a test to determine the extent of intoxication, a Notification of Preliminary
   Suspension of Base Driving Privileges memo will be issued to the driver for a period of one
   year. If detained for DWI/DUI on-base, the vehicle will be secured at the scene and the keys
   seized via AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. Security force members may move the vehicle to a
   safe location if it poses a safety hazard. The vehicle will not be released to the individual
   until the person is no longer under the influence of drugs or alcohol or gives consent to
   release the vehicle to another individual.
   5.4.7. Reinstatement of driving privileges, upon termination of the suspension or revocation,
   is automatic. However, if the revocation was the result of an alcohol-related incident, the
   Unit Commander must ensure the individual successfully completes a driver improvement
   and rehabilitation course, such as outlined in AFI 24-301/Vehicle Operations and AFI 44-
   12/Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program prior to
   reinstatement. The Unit Commander/First Sergeant will ensure proof of course completion is

component or military and civilian retirement or when continued access to an installation is
authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFI 33-364 records on civilian personnel who are
terminating on-base employment.
   5.5.1. The Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) (currently linked to
   MILPDS) will automatically transfer the individual history record to the gaining installations
   55 SFS/S-5R section (Air Force only). A hard copy of all active suspension/revocation case
   files are forwarded via certified mail to the gaining servicing security forces unit or law
   enforcement servicing unit (other Services). Additionally, for other Services, a printed
   SFMIS report describing an individual’s driving record will be generated and mailed to the
   gaining law enforcement servicing unit. Associate units will provide 55 SFS/S-5R a monthly
   listing of personnel (other Services; non-Air Force) selected for retirement, separation and

           TOWING AND IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General Information. Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) on Offutt AFB are subject to
towing and impoundment if it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or convenience, is
involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or abandoned.
   6.1.1. The Security Forces Investigations section (55 SFS/S-2I) is the focal point for
   coordination and tracking of all towed and/or impounded vehicles at Offutt AFB. If a vehicle
   must be towed, 55 SFS/S-2I will be contacted at 294-6813 prior to the vehicle being towed or
   impounded. The on-duty Security Forces flight chief or higher authority must approve all
   towing or impound actions.
   6.1.2. When possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed.
   If reasonably feasible, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first
   have permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle.
   However in such cases, the security forces (or towing contractor) are not responsible for
   safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.1.3. Standards for Impoundment.       Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the
   following conditions exist:
       6.1.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
           6.1.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with
           the orderly flow of traffic.
           6.1.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
           in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations
           or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
           6.1.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
           6.1.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
       6.1.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
           6.1.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the
           owner fail.
           6.1.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
           6.1.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
           These vehicles will be stored within the SFS Bulk Storage lot, upon coordination with
           S-2I.
           6.1.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore
           unable (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
           6.1.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the
           public roadways.
OFFUTTAFBI31-116 30 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            55


          6.1.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or
          physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
          safekeeping.
          6.1.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned as
          outlined in paragraph 2.4.
6.2. Towing and Storage.
   6.2.1. The installation utilizes a wrecker service for official government sanctioned towing
   and temporary impoundment of vehicles from Offutt AFB. The 55 SFS is the authorized
   representative for Offutt AFB when removal and storage of a privately owned vehicle is
   required within the jurisdiction of Offutt AFB.
   6.2.2. All fees and charges associated with the tow and storage of the vehicle are assessed
   against the vehicle owner.
   6.2.3. In the unlikely event the vehicle removal and storage is erroneous, the wrecker service
   will return the vehicle to the owner, at no cost to the owner or the U.S. Government.
   6.2.4. The impoundment area is located off the installation in a DFC-approved secure area
   belonging to the wrecker service.
   6.2.5. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or
   involvement in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel
   upon coordination with 55 SFS/S-2I.
