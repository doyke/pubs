1. General. This instruction provides guidance for complying with AFMAN 91-201, DoD STD
6055.9, the USF obligation toward the Host Nation and JSP 800 Volume 4b when transporting
explosives over UK public roads. It defines terms used in association with off-base explosives
policy on how personnel are to comply with ADR and IMDG. It identifies AR/ADR training
requirements for individuals to certify, operate, inspect, receive or release explosives laden
vehicles and provides notification requirements, safeguarding and emergency procedures.
2. Authorized Routes and Police Notification:
     2.1. The Mobile Explosives Team (MET) Air Command A4 Operations issues authorized
     routes for vehicles owned by or under control of the Armed Forces for the conveyance of
     explosives. When moving more than 3 tonnes net explosive mass (NEM), which equals
     6,613.8 pounds net explosive weight (NEW) of hazard division (HD) 1.1, either on a single
     vehicle or in aggregate where there is more than one vehicle in a convoy, a MET issued route
     is required to be used. (T-0).
        2.1.1. Use the point of contact listings found in JSP 800 Volume 4b, Para 8.5.1.3.2.2, to
        contact the MET.
        2.1.2. Requests for authorized routes must be submitted to the MET at least 4 weeks or
        as soon as tasking is received, prior to the movement, detailing the following:
            2.1.2.1. Origin and destination
            2.1.2.2. Quantity and nature of explosives being moved
            2.1.2.3. Frequency of use
            2.1.2.4. Date of proposed first use
        2.1.3. Once the MET routing is agreed upon with the appropriate constabularies, the
        route will be assigned a number and copies of the route will be sent to the requesting unit.
        The unit must provide copies of the route to 3 AF-UK/A4, base explosive safety (SEW)
        offices and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Police (MDP) Central Control Room (CCR).
3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008                                                                         3


       To use the route, the consignor advises the MDP Central Control Room of the allocated
       MET route number, consignor and consignee details, description of the vehicle load,
       vehicle registration and driver/attendant details.

NOTE: Security Forces Squadrons (SFS) military working dog (MWD) sections transport small
amounts of explosives to conduct training. Advance coordination and notification with MDP is
not required when SFS is moving MWD explosives in quantities outlined in paragraph 6 to this
instruction.
   2.2. Explosive movements less than 3 tonnes HD 1.1 shall be routed away from highly
   populated areas and congested motorways. Certain local authorities are authorized by acts of
   parliament to prohibit or restrict the movement of explosives within areas under their specific
   control. Local authorities will be approached for special advice, the route must be agreed
   with relevant police authorities in advance and police must be informed when the move is
   scheduled to take place. The following are some examples:
       2.2.1. Cities: Cardiff, Liverpool, London, etc.
       2.2.2. Tunnels: Mersey, Tyne, Dartford, Blackwall, Rotherhithe: See JSP 800 Volume
       4b, Section 8.3.9.2
       2.2.3. Bridges: Tay, Erskine, Forth, Severn (both bridges)
       2.2.4. Harbors and sea movement: See JSP 800 Volume 4b, Section 7S
3. Management of Training and Certification:
   3.1. Installation Dangerous Goods Advisors are the focal point for ADR and AR
   requirements concerning Class 1 (explosives), 3 AF-UK/A4 is the training focal point for
   other UN classes.
   3.2. Installation Dangerous Goods Advisors are the single point of contact for ADR
   uniformed driver training and certificate application processing through the UK’s
   Department for Transport.
   3.3. Appointment, Training and Certification of ARs:
       3.3.1. Unit supervision selects their most qualified noncommissioned officers or civilian
       equivalents for AR qualification training.
       3.3.2. AR qualification training may be achieved through one of two methods:
       Successful completion of the AR course or by attending the JSP 482 MoD Explosives
       Regulations Familiarization course.
4. Classification of Explosives:
   4.1. You must know the NEW of items before releasing a vehicle transporting explosives.
   Use the Joint Hazardous Classification System (JHCS) to classify ammunition and
   explosives. If JHCS is unavailable, TO 11A-1-46, Fire Fighting Guidance, Transportation,
   and Storage Management Data, Table 3-1, Column 6 and Column 10 may be used as a
   secondary source.
   4.2. Reserved.
 4                                                                     3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008


     4.3. Use the following conversion factors to compute NEM: 1 kilogram = 2.2046 pounds,
     2,204.6 pounds = 1 tonne NEM.
5. Notification and Logging Requirements:
     5.1. Notification of explosive movements is accomplished in three phases. All notification
     contacts are to be logged in by both releaser and receiver.
        5.1.1. Phase I is the initial contact (at least 48 hours prior) between releaser/receiver and
        MDP Central Information Room.
        5.1.2. Phase II informs the receiver that a shipment of explosives is about to be released.
        5.1.3. Phase III is the final notification that vehicle(s) conveying explosives have
        departed. It includes confirmation from the receiver that the vehicles have arrived at their
        destination.
     5.2. For all explosive shipments:
        5.2.1. The releaser notifies the receiver of the description, quantity, hazard classification,
        UN numbers and NEM of the explosives before releasing the vehicles. The receiver must
        be notified as soon as possible but not less than 48 hours before the release (not
        applicable to emergency aircraft operations). The receiver must agree to receive the items
        at a specific time and place. The releaser notifies the receiver of departure time, which
        includes any changes when the vehicle is released.
        5.2.2. The releaser will notify the MDP Central Control Room, using the checklist at
        Attachment 2, at least 48 hours prior to departure for road movement of munitions
        which:
            5.2.2.1. Exceed 3 tonnes (6,613.8 pounds) NEW explosive HC/D 1.1 in a single
            vehicle or aggregate in a convoy
            5.2.2.2. Require armed escorts to accompany the road movement (See Paragraph
            10.5)
            5.2.2.3. Require more than one vehicle (convoys)
        5.2.3. Releasing and Receiving ARs will maintain a record consisting of:
            5.2.3.1. Vehicle owner
            5.2.3.2. Vehicle registration number and vehicle type
            5.2.3.3. Names of driver and attendant (check to see that the driver is certified under
            ADR rules for transporting dangerous goods and possesses a valid vocational training
            certificate)
            5.2.3.4. Date/time vehicle released/received by AR
            5.2.3.5. Remarks/condition of cargo and any shipping irregularities upon arrival
            5.2.3.6. Shipping irregularities that must be reported to Senior AR
     5.3. Emergency Notification. If the MDP cannot be contacted, or mission requirements do
     not allow for 48-hours notice, contact 3 AF-UK/A4, installation SEW and applicable
     command post.
3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008                                                                             5


6. Road Movements of Small Quantities:
   6.1. Vocational training certificates and notifications are not required when carrying certain
   quantities of explosives. It is still essential that the driver and attendant be knowledgeable of
   the hazards associated with the material being transported. The following are excepted small
   quantities for transportation within Great Britain as prescribed by JSP 800 Volume 4b,
   Chapter 1, paras 1.1.3.6 and 1.1.3.7:
      6.1.1. 1.4S in any quantity.
      6.1.2. 1.4B,C,D,E,F,G, and 1.6N up to a total of 500kg NEM.
      6.1.3. 1.1B to 1.1J/1.2B to 1.2J/1.3C,G,H,J,/1.5D up to 50kg NEM.
      6.1.4. There is no exemption for compatibility group (CG) “A” or “L” of any HD.
      6.1.5. Any other than the above, up to a total of 50 kg NEM.
      6.1.6. Refer to JSP800 Volume 4b, Section 7RR Para 7.5.5, Limitation of the Quantities
      Carried, for the maximum quantity permissible per transport unit.
   6.2. For movement of small quantities of explosives that meet 6.1 definition, following are
   not required:
      6.2.1. Placard/Plate the vehicle
      6.2.2. Have a vocationally trained driver (driver still needs a health and safety briefing)
      6.2.3. Provide instructions in writing (notice to crews carrying military explosives,
      and/or TREMCARD)
      6.2.4. Meet any type of approved vehicle construction requirements
   6.3. For movement of small quantities of explosives that meet 6.1 definitions, following are
   still required:
      6.3.1. An attendant
      6.3.2. A vehicle where the load compartment is separated from the crew, not a single
      compartment vehicle
      6.3.3. Carry appropriate fire extinguishers IAW JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 8, Para
      8.1.4.
   6.4. The attendance of an AR is not required when loading or unloading the following
   natures:
      6.4.1. HD 1.4S
      6.4.2. 50kg or less NEM of HD 1.4 other than 1.4S
      6.4.3. Flares and signaling devices of HD 1.2G and HD 1.3G in quantities totaling not
      more than 1kg NEM.
      6.4.4. Movement exclusively on MOD training areas and ranges.
7. Packing, Marking, Placarding, Labeling and Customs Requirements:
6                                                                     3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008


    7.1. ARs must ensure the following conditions are met before releasing munitions vehicles:
    (T-0)
       7.1.1. Each package or pallet must be packaged in accordance with the applicable
       dangerous goods regulation, Special Packaging Instruction (SPI), and appropriate item
       TO. SPI requirements take precedence over item TO packaging procedures.
       7.1.2. Each package, pallet or unitized load must be properly marked with the proper
       shipping name, HD, CG, packaging group number, UN number and packaging
       specification. Additional markings must be in accordance with the MIL STD 129-P or
       appropriate item TO.
       7.1.3. Each outer package containing explosives will be labeled with the appropriate
       HD/CG label. For items such as palletized MK-82 bombs, the pallet is considered the
       outer package. On unitized loads such as 20mm, fuses, etc., each package must be labeled
       and the labels should be visible on two vertical face of the pallet/load.
       7.1.4. Vehicles carrying ammunition in excess of the quantities given at 6.1 above must
       display two blank reflective orange and black rectangular panels. One affixed at the front
       of the vehicle and one at the rear (JSP 800, Volume 4b, Section 5.3.2).
    7.2. Placards (Danger Signs). Vehicles carrying ammunition in excess of the quantities given
    at 6.1 above will display three orange and black colored hazardous HD/CG placards, (JSP
    800 Volume 4b, Section 5.3). One affixed to each side of the load carrying compartment and
    one on the rear. When a container is carried on a vehicle, four placards will be attached to the
    container instead of the vehicle. When placards are placed on containers they must be placed
    on the front, rear and each side of the container. These procedures must be followed unless
    exempt by the quantities given at Para 6.1.
       7.2.1. Where two or more containers carrying explosives of different hazard divisions are
       loaded on the same vehicle, the vehicle is still regarded as a single load and is to be
       placarded according to the highest hazard division (JSP 800 Volume 4b Chapter 5, Para
       5.3 referring to ADR 5.3.1.1.2). This may be achieved in two ways:
           7.2.1.1. By covering the container placards and placarding the vehicle itself with the
           highest HD.
           7.2.1.2. By leaving the placards on the container carrying the highest HD and
           covering the others. This may require the display of an additional “worst case”
           placard on the rear of the rear-most container while being transported by road.
    7.3. Labels. The DD Form 1387, Military Shipping Label, 31 March 2003, prescribed by
    AFI31-205 shall be applied to containers in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)
    129P, Military Marking, 19 September 2007. This standard provides the minimum
    requirements for military marking and procedures for their application. Affix labels in a
    secure manner using a weatherproof pouch to protect the label from deterioration or loss
    during transit.
    7.4. Customs. Customs inspections shall be performed in accordance with USEUCOM
    Directive 30-3, Customs Border Clearance Agency Program (CBCAP), 23 October 2003, for
    explosive shipments destined to or that will transit through the Customs Territory of the
    United States (CTUS). USEUCOM 30-3-1, Military Customs Inspection, certification must
3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008                                                                        7


   be attached to preclude it from being removed and placed onto another container. Affix the
   certification in secure manner with a weatherproof pouch to protect the label from
   deterioration or loss during transit to/through the CTUS.
8. Vehicle Requirements:
   8.1. The vehicle must be in good structural and mechanical condition. The AR must inspect
   each vehicle used for the movement of explosives prior to release with the checklist
   prescribed by JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 7RR, Para 7.5.12.3.1 in conjunction with any
   locally developed procedures. (T-0)
   8.2. Vehicles used to carry explosives must carry fire extinguishers as prescribed by JSP 800
   Volume 4b, Chapter 8, Para 8.1.4.
   8.3. Intentionally deleted
   8.4. Radio transmitters or telephones may be fitted or carried in the cab of vehicles carrying
   explosives. However, drivers and attendants must be instructed if an accident occurs and
   packaging is damaged, ammunition-containing electro-explosive devices (EED) may be
   exposed and vulnerable to initiation by radio transmissions. In these circumstances, hand-
   held or portable transmitters will not be used within 10 meters (32.8 feet) of the load or
   vehicle. It should always be assumed that EEDs are among the load unless it is certain they
   are not. Mobile phones must not be used within 50 meters (164 feet) of explosive laden
   vehicles (JSP 800 Vol 4b, Chapter 8, Para 8.5.1.2.1).
   8.5. Tractor trailers (prime movers, tow vehicles) may not tow more than one trailer (JSP
   800, Volume 4b, Chapter 8, Para 8.1.1.1). Military vehicles may tow single-axle trailers.
   With the exception of Private Light Goods Vehicles (PLGV), trailer brakes must be operable
   from the driver’s cab and automatically applied in the event the trailer becomes accidentally
   detached from the towing vehicle (JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 9, Para 9.2.3.1). A
   breakdown of the types of vehicles allowed for explosives movements follow:
      8.5.1. PLGV. PLGV are vehicles with a maximum authorized mass (MAM) < 3,500 kg
      and manufactured before 1 Jan 97. They may be closed or sheeted, and fueled by either
      unleaded or diesel. Land rovers, saloon cars, estate cars and minibuses come into this
      category.
      8.5.2. Ordinary Goods Vehicles (OGV). OGV are all other goods vehicles with a MAM
      > 3,500 kg and manufactured before 1 Jan 97, and associated containers. When the
      vehicle is sheeted, the sheet should be of an impermeable material not readily flammable
      and, where reasonably practicable, tightened so to cover the vehicle on all sides and kept
      in position by a lockable device. Most load carrying military B vehicles, including 4, 8,
      10, 14 and 16 tonne are considered OGVs.
      8.5.3. EX/II and EX/III vehicles. EX/II and EX/III type approved vehicles are specially
      designed, constructed and maintained to allow the carriage of explosives in larger
      quantities and prevent the risk of fire getting to the explosives cargo being transported.
      EX/II and EX/III type approved vehicles are vehicles specially constructed or adapted
      with special safety features to allow the carriage of larger quantities of ammunition than
      those allowed in an OGV. Few military vehicles meet the requirements.
 8                                                                      3AFI24-201 29 JULY 2008


        8.5.4. See JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 9, section 9.1 for all explosive vehicle
        descriptions.
     8.6. Tarpaulin Requirements: When specifically required by the DoD activity, using a flat-
     bed trailer, flat-rack container or similar open equipment to transport explosives; the load
     must be completely covered by tarpaulin. The requirement for use of a tarpaulin will be
     annotated on the freight warrant, bill of lading, etc. The tarpaulin used must be fire and water
     resistant and be securely fastened by the carrier to the trailer to protect the load in accordance
     with DoD 4500.9-R, Part 2, Section 205, Paragraph N.
     8.7. Vehicles transporting explosives are restricted to the maximum allowable limits shown
     in JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 7RR, section 7.5.5.
     8.8. When explosive articles and substances in different CG are transported together, apply
     the maximum quantity limits allowed in JSP 800 Volume 4b, Section 7RR Para 7.5.5.
     8.9. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) freight containers which bear the
     International Convention for Safe Containers Safety Approval Plate is authorized for
     transporting explosives. Those in charge of stuffing a container must always check the plate
     first to ensure the container’s serviceability. Load restraint must be in accordance with the
     applicable series TO or associated regulations.
     8.10. As prescribed by JSP 800 Volume 4b, Chapter 7RR, section 7.5.1.3, explosives
     contained in any one approved container (subject to gross weight considerations) are not to
     exceed the limits shown in JSP 800 Volume 4b, Section 7RR, Para 7.5.5.
        8.10.1. Reserved.
        8.10.2. Reserved.
        8.10.3. Units transporting explosives should contact 3 AF-UK/A4 to determine if any
        waiver exists from the UK government that would allow explosives to be carried in
        excess to the amounts limited above.
     8.11. In addition to locally developed procedures and AR checklist (JSP 800 Volume 4b,
     Section 7RR, Para 7.5.12.3.1), the maximum NEM limits (JSP 800 Volume 4b Chapter1,
