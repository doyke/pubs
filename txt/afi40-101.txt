                                 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. The Air Force Health Promotion (HP) program drives the Air Force toward a
“Culture of Health” that optimizes Comprehensive Airman Fitness. HP strives to make healthy
living become the default lifestyle choice and social norm across the base community. HP
enables individuals to lead healthy lives; units to become exemplary healthy workplaces; and
military and civilian personnel to execute their missions productively.
1.2. Target Areas. While HP supports all initiatives that promote a fit and healthy force, HP
Target Areas include Tobacco Free Living, Nutritional Fitness, Physical Activity, and Healthy
Weight.
1.3. Funding. HP positions are programmed using Defense Health Program (DHP) funding
only at Active Component MTFs. Responsibilities, duties, and compliance standards for HP
staff members pertain only to active component units.
   1.3.1. Promotional Items. Items of low intrinsic value (e.g. pens, coffee mugs, key chains,
   t-shirts) may be purchased with DHP funds if used to educate or reinforce health/wellness
   programs IAW AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. Personalized items or
