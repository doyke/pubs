2. SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDSs).
  2.1. Work area/shop supervisors are responsible for ensuring that paper or electronic copies
  of SDSs are readily accessible to all personnel during all work shifts for all hazardous
  material currently on hand in the shop. SDSs should be in plain sight and centrally located to
  the operations where hazardous materials are used. These SDSs will also be located in the
  HAZCOM binder or reference to their location will be annotated. The manufacturer listed on
  each SDS must match the manufacturer identified on the hazardous material, as ingredients
  may change from manufacturer to manufacturer, with a specific national stock number.
  SDSs for products no longer in use will be removed.
  2.2. Workers desiring SDS information will contact Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE)
  (DSN: 673-6289) to establish a mutually acceptable time during the current work shift to
  review the SDS. BE will review the SDS with the employee and provide an explanation of
  the SDS information. Requests after normal duty hours will be directed to the BE on-call
  phone (commercial: 843-412-0635).
  2.3. Supervisors will notify their respective Hazardous Material Pharmacies (HAZMART)
  each time a new chemical is introduced into the work area:
     2.3.1. HAZMART Air Base - DSN: 673-5449
     2.3.2. HAZMART Weapons Station - DSN: 764-7419
     2.3.3. Civil Engineering (CE) procures chemicals through their own HAZMART. CE
     personnel should direct all questions to DSN: 673-1565.
  2.4. If an SDS is not available for newly procured chemicals, the supervisor should not
  accept the chemical until a SDS is obtained. If the supervisor is unable to obtain a SDS, they
  should contact BE for assistance.
3. CONTAINER LABELING PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS. The workplace
supervisor will:
  3.1. Ensure that each container of hazardous chemical(s) in the workplace is labeled, tagged
  or marked with the identity of the hazardous chemical(s) contained therein, the appropriate
  hazard warning(s) and the name/address of the manufacturer, importer or other responsible
  party.
  3.2. Ensure that existing labels on incoming hazardous chemicals are not removed or
  defaced unless the container is immediately marked with the required information.
  Workplace supervisors will not accept or allow unlabelled containers of potential HAZMAT.
  3.3. Ensure transfer containers, vats, tanks and other containers filled with hazardous
  materials are properly labeled in accordance with AF1 90-821, Hazard Communication.
  3.4. DD Form 2521, Hazardous Chemical Warning Label (8 1/2x11) or . DD Form 2522,
  Hazardous Chemical Warning Label (4x6) signs, placards, process sheets, batch tickets or
  other such written materials will be used to label these containers IAW AFI 90-821.
4. EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRAINING.
  4.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials
  receive training using guidance found in AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7.

    4.2. Supervisors will develop and maintain a work area specific employee education and
    training plan (See Attachment 2 for template). Workplace supervisors requiring technical
    assistance in creating a training plan should contact BE at DSN: 673-6289 or Public Health
    at DSN: 673-6954.
    4.3. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph
    2.7, “Employee Information and Training”. This training may be provided by the supervisor,
    the organization occupational health coordinator or other formal organization training
    structure (i.e. maintenance trainers). Before presenting workplace specific HAZCOM
    written plan (Attachment 2), the supervisor will ensure the following appropriate agencies
    review the information for technical accuracy:
       4.3.1. Bioenvironmental Engineering: 628 AMDS/SGPB, DSN: 673-6289
       4.3.2. Public Health: 628 AMDS/SGPM, DSN: 673-6954

       4.3.4. Fire Department Technical Services: 628 CES/CEF, DSN: 673-3777
    4.4. Documentation of all Hazard Communication Program training will be annotated on AF
    Form 55 or approved equivalent.
5. HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL INVENTORY.
    5.1. The hazardous chemical inventory for each work area will be developed by the shop
    supervisor. Printouts from electronic databases such as EESOH-MIS are preferred methods.
    BE will review this inventory IAW the assessment priority established in AFI 48-145,
    Occupational and Environmental Health Program.
    5.2. Supervisors will maintain an up to date hazardous chemicals inventory and SDS
    documentation in the work area and update it as necessary; annually at minimum
    (Attachment 3).
    5.3. Chemical nomenclature, name, or identity that is used on the SDS must be clearly cross-
    referenced to the inventory. Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the
    ESOH-MIS, but the work area/shop must have a print out of the chemical inventory.
6. NON-ROUTINE TASKS INVOLVING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.
    6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work areas normal activities but performed
       infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or cleaning
       up spills.
       6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
       (AFSC) or job series.
    6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in this work area
    which involve hazardous materials (attached to Attachment 2). The supervisor will ensure
    work area Operating Instructions (OIs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated
    hazards and controls for the infrequent tasks performed in this work area. OIs do not need to
    be prepared if Technical Orders (TOs) or other official documents adequately describe these
JBCHARLESTONI90-821 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                          5


  tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing any non-
  routine tasks.
  6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
  the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the
  activity:
     6.3.1. The initial Employee Information and Training Program described in Paragraph
     2.7 of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, for workers not previously trained.
     6.3.2. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and
     associated controls.
  6.4. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal supervisor
  describing the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
  Health Record, (or approved equivalent) can be updated.
7. HAZARD DETERMINATION.
  7.1. Joint Base Charleston will rely on the hazard determination of the supplier or
  manufacturer for purchased hazardous materials. For those materials determined hazardous,
  all sections of this instruction apply.
     7.1.1. This instruction does not apply to the following materials:
         7.1.1.1. Hazardous Waste.
         7.1.1.2. Wood or wood products.
         7.1.1.3. Consumer products. When these products are used in the workplace in the
         same manner as normal consumer use, and which results in a duration and frequency
         of exposure that is not greater than exposures experienced by consumers. This will
         be a case-by-case judgment; for more information call the Hazardous Material
         Management Program (HMMP) manager at DSN: 673-4976.
         7.1.1.4. Warehousing. As long as employees only handle materials in sealed
         containers that are not opened under normal conditions.
         7.1.1.5. Pharmaceuticals. Such as vaccines, serums and blood products; however,
         chemotherapeutic agents are included.
         7.1.1.6. Laboratories that do not produce a finished product (i.e. dentures from a
         dental lab) are exempt from 29 CFR 1910.1200 but must meet requirements of
         Chemical Hygiene in Laboratories (29 CFR 1910.1450) (Lab Standard).
  7.2. For Air Force produced chemicals, the AF activity controlling the formulation will
  make the hazard determination and produce a SDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The AF
  activity producing the chemical will include hazard determination procedures in their written
  program, and ensure personnel are trained on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to
  any other organizations, the producing organization will provide a SDS with the shipment
  and transmit the SDS to United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM,
  DSN: 798-3764).

8. CONTRACTOR OPERATIONS.
     8.1. The Contracting Officer (CONS/CO, DSN: 673-5155), with assistance from BE and the
     work area supervisor, if requested, will advise contractors of hazardous chemicals they may
     encounter and protective measures needed in the normal course of their work in this work
     area. The Administrative Contracting Officer will also inform the contractor that SDS
     information is available through BE (Bldg 631, DSN: 673-6289).
     8.2. At the pre-performance conference and subsequently during the contract performance
     period, the requiring activity Contracting Officer Representative will advise work area
     supervisors and AF employees monitoring the performance of contractors of hazardous
     chemicals introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on
     the use of hazardous materials IAW FAR clause 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification
     and Material Safety Data.
9. HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. This is a performance-
oriented instruction. The primary focus of this instruction is to reduce the incidence of
chemically induced occupational illnesses and injuries by informing Joint Base Charleston
personnel of the hazards associated with, and protective measures required when using or
handling hazardous materials. Observing work practices, testing worker HAZCOM knowledge
and measuring occupational illness and injury rates will assess program effectiveness as well as
prepare the workshop for the annual Environmental Safety and Occupational Health Compliance
Assessment and Management Program (ESOHCAMP).

                     WORKPLACE SPECIFIC HAZCOM PROGRAM
                                   SPECIFIC WORK AREA


This written program provides workplace specific hazardous material training as required by Air
Force Instruction 90-821, Hazard Communication (HAZCOM). Our work center is required to
maintain this document with current information on the hazards posed by chemicals used in the
shop. The overall goal of the program is to ensure all assigned personnel are trained on the types
of hazardous materials in the work area prior to potential exposure. Shop supervisors should also
make certain personnel receive additional training when a uniquely different type of hazardous
material, with different hazardous properties, is introduced into the work center.
1.      EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRAINING
        1.1. The HAZCOM monitor or trainer, name of individual, and the shop supervisor are
responsible for ensuring all workers assigned to this shop have received the following training
before workers handle or are occupationally exposed to hazardous materials.
               1.1.1. All workers will be trained on the AFI Std 90-821 Hazard Communication.
               1.1.2. All workers will receive workplace specific HAZCOM training from
supervisors or shop appointed HAZCOM trainer.
               1.1.3. Supplemental training will be required when a new hazard is brought into
the work area/shop or a new chemical is introduced.
               1.1.4. Initial and supplemental training is conducted by explain how you will be
training such as a verbal briefing, power point or other forum based on this lesson plan and is
documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record or equivalent. Supplemental
training will be provided at the time a new chemical is introduced, which will also be in the form
of a explain how you will be training such as a verbal briefing, power point or other forum.
The following subjects are included in the lesson plan:
                       1) Employee Information and Training
                      2) Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)
                      3) Hazardous Chemical inventory
                      4) Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
                      hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of

                      hazardous material used in association with work area/shop processes.
                      5) Labeling and other forms of warning
                      6) Non-routine tasks
                      7) Unlabeled pipes
                      8) Multi-employee work sites
                      9) Chemical Hazards
                     10) Personal protective equipment
                     11) Foreseeable emergency
               1.1.5. Public Health (PH) is the point of Contact for occupational health
education, and provides consultation on training and technical matters to work area/shop
supervisors on the AF HAZCOM Program. While primary responsibility for performing
HAZCOM training rests with the work/shop supervisor, PH will make the appropriate training
available to work area/shop.
2. SAFETY DATA SHEETS (SDS)
     2.1. Our SDS’s are located Squadron/organization, workplace name, “Hazard
Communication Program Book.
        2.2. Insert name of individual is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the SDS’s.
        2.3. SDS’s are kept in the form(s) of electronic and/or hardcopy. NOTE: If SDSs are
kept electronically or somewhere else, a DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, may be substituted
and will identify the specific location of ensure a cross-reference form in place in the shops
Hazard Communication Program Book.
        2.4. There must be an SDS for each chemical on hand. The SDS must be from the
manufacturer and part number/trade name specific to the material on hand. Manufacturers use
different constituents, percentage of constituents in their products, and they have different
emergency contact numbers. The hazardous material inventory (HMI) may list the same
chemical name twice, but it will show different manufacturers.
        2.5. If we have a chemical on hand or receive a chemical that we do not have an SDS
for, one can and will be requested from the manufacturer (companies are required by law to
provide an SDS for each hazardous material). The chemical will not be used until an SDS is
obtained and workers have been adequately trained on the material.
       2.6. SDS information will be readily available to all workers during all shifts.
       2.7. An explanation on how to read and interpret a SDS can be found in Attachment 3.
3. HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL INVENTORY
      3.1. Name of individual maintains the chemical inventory and updates it when new
chemicals are added or when old chemicals are deleted from inventory. Individual “will develop
chemical inventory by…” identify how the inventory is generated.
      3.2. The chemical inventory can be found in Squadron/organization, workplace name,
“Hazard Communication Program Book.
JBCHARLESTONI90-821 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 11


4. LABELING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
       4.1. Name of individual will ensure that hazardous material containers are properly
labeled with the chemical name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer, appropriate
hazard warning, expiration date (if applicable), and responsible party (our address). Ensure any
shipped containers are also properly labeled.
        4.2. Chemicals will not be accepted without an appropriate label. When a chemical is
transferred from one container to another or from a larger container to a smaller one, it will be
labeled to include all appropriate information in a typed or printed format.
        4.3. The chemical name on the label must match the SDS on hand and the chemical
identified on the hazardous material inventory.
        4.4. Each worker will check labels for accuracy and readability at time of use. If a
chemical needs a new label, the worker will notify the HAZCOM monitor.
5. NON-ROUTINE TASKS
        5.1. Non-routine tasks are tasks that are performed infrequently, once or twice a year

tasks completed in this work area.
        5.2. Personnel will be trained on all non-routine tasks and chemicals involved with them
before the task is performed.
      5.3. Non-routine tasks will be thoroughly described to include: task, frequency,
chemicals used, associated health hazards, protective measures, and controls.
         5.4. This workplace has non-routine tasks or does not currently perform non-routine
tasks.
         5.5. Non-Routine task can be found in Attachment 3. Or delete if not applicable.
6. UNLABELED PIPES
        6.1. If you have any unlabeled pipes containing chemicals, mention them here. If not,
state that you don’t.

7. MULTI-EMPLOYEE WORK SITES
        7.1. If for some reason, one of our workers is required to perform duties in another work
center, they will request that the supervisor brief them on the chemicals, hazards, personal
protective equipment (PPE), and labeling system used in that area. They will also be shown the
location of SDS’s and HAZCOM lesson plan.
        7.2. If someone from another work center (i.e. a contractor) needs to perform duties in
our area, name of individual will provide them information on the chemicals we use and hazards
associated with them. They will be shown our labeling system, SDS’s, PPE, and HAZCOM
Lesson plan.

                               Explanation of Safety Data Sheets


1. Chemical Identification:
   The introductory section of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) includes the chemical
   manufacturer’s name, address and emergency phone number, the chemical name, trade name,
   and chemical formula. This section helps you identify the chemical on the SDS.

2. Hazardous Ingredients:
   This section lists any hazardous ingredients found within the chemical that can be hazardous
   to you. In this section, you might also see the terms TLV (Threshold Limit Value) and PEL
   (Permissible Exposure Limit). Both terms are used to express the airborne concentration
   levels of a C.A.S. (Chemical Abstract Service), which will usually be listed in this section the
   SDS. The C.A.S. numbers identify specific chemicals according to information published by
   the American Chemical Society.

3. Physical Data:
   This section lists such important physical properties of the chemical as boiling point, vapor
   density, percent volatile, appearance and odor, and other. This information helps determine
   the degree of hazards associated with the chemical in different work environments. For
   example, vapor density describes the weight of a vapor relative to an equal volume of air (air
   = 1). If a chemical has a vapor density greater than 1, the vapor will be heavier than air and
   tends to fall and hug the ground.

4. Fire and Explosion Data:
   This section helps you determine the chemical flash point, which is the temperature at which
   a chemical will release enough flammable vapors to ignite. Chemicals that ignite at or below
   100F are classified as flammable. In addition, this section usually lists the chemical’s upper
   and lower flammability limits, proper types of extinguishing media required to safety
   extinguish the fire (example CO2, water, foam, etc.), special firefighting procedures, and any
   unusual fire and explosion hazards associated with the chemical.

5. Health Hazard Data:
   This section describes health effects associated with being overexposed to the chemical
   through ingestion, inhalation, and skin or eye contact. The information may include: the
   acute (immediate) and chronic (long term) effects of overexposure to the chemical, whether
   the chemical is a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), emergency and first aid
   procedures to follow in case of overexposure, whether overexposures may require immediate
   medical attention, and medical conditions that may be aggravated upon contact with the
   chemical. If you work in an area where overexposure is possible, safety equipment may be
   needed to protect you.
JBCHARLESTONI90-821 17 OCTOBER 2013                                                               19


6. Reactivity Data:
   The information contained in this section helps you determine if the chemical will react with
   other chemical or conditions. Chemicals that are reactive (unstable) may explode, burn, or
   release toxic substances under certain conditions. In addition, this section usually tells you if
   the chemical is stable or unstable and list any chemicals or substances that might be
   incompatible with the chemical.

7. Spill or Leak Procedures:
   This section lists the procedures to follow when a chemical is accidentally released or spilled.
   It will also cover types of cleanup and protective equipment needed to safely contain or clean
   up a spill as well as proper ways to dispose of the chemical.

8. Special Protection Information:
   This section lists the types of special protective equipment (e.g. respirators, gloves, eye
   protection, and ventilation) that is recommended to be used when with the chemical.
   Remember, there are various types of protective equipment that are specially designed for
   certain tasks. Consult it with your supervisor to ensure you are using the correct type for the
   work you are performing.

9. Special Precautions:
   The last section usually discusses special precautions to be taken to during handling and
   storage of the chemical. Also, this section will usually discuss any other health or safety
   concerns that have not already mentioned in another section of the SDS.
