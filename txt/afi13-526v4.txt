                                              Chapter 1

                                             GENERAL

1.1. Objective. Guidance contained in Volume 1, 2, and 3 of this instruction series is written
exclusive of each other based upon the mission that is to be executed. Specifically, guidance
from one of these Volumes does not apply to any of the other Volumes. This Volume prescribes
basic guidance and approved procedures for Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations (ENAO)
(formerly Emergency Nuclear Airlift Force – ENAF).
     1.1.1. This Volume describes recommended actions for Courier and crew during emergency
     nuclear airlift operations. It is designed for those missions diverted en route to an onload site
     where the crew does not have the opportunity to receive a formal 618 AOC (TACC), home
     station, or command post briefing. However, even if a formal briefing is given, this guidance
     may be used as a refresher. Security, time, and ground support may not be sufficient to allow
     using this guidance during emergency operations. In such cases, the Courier and crew must
     discuss all factors and use their judgment on the best course of action to accomplish the
     mission. Safety and security is paramount in all decisions affecting transportation of nuclear
     cargo.
     1.1.2. The objective is to move nuclear cargo safely under U.S. custody. Cargo aircrew may
     be tasked at any time to airlift nuclear weapons. The amount of preparation time and degree
     of assistance received will depend on the length of time the MAJCOM has to move the
     weapons.
     1.1.3. ENAO plans will comply with AFI 91-115, Safety Rules for Nuclear Logistics
     Transport by the Prime Nuclear Airlift Force, weapon system safety rules, and Volume 1 of
     this regulation to the maximum extent possible.
1.2. Key Words Explained
     1.2.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
1.3. Responsibilities. AMC, Nuclear Operations Division (AMC/A3N), is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in cited source
references, AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the procedures unique to this publication and 18
AF/CC is the authority for specified mission planning and execution waivers.
1.4. Distribution. The following individuals and agencies associated with supporting or
executing nuclear airlift operations will maintain a copy of this instruction:
     1.4.1. Commanders of nuclear capable logistics units (PNAF/ Munitions Squadron (MUNS)/
     Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS)).
     1.4.2. Operations, logistics, and safety staff agencies.
AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        5


   1.4.3. Security Forces units.
   1.4.4. PNAF airlift squadron(s)/units.
   1.4.5. Each individual PNAF aircrew member.
   1.4.6. Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) for nuclear accounts.
   1.4.7. Custodial unit Civil Engineering, Readiness and Emergency Management, and
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.
   1.4.8. Non-PNAF C-5, C-17, and C-130 crewmembers (authorized to maintain a copy, but
   should obtain a copy when tasked with executing a mission contained in this volume).
1.5. Protecting Classified Information.
   1.5.1. Use caution at all times to avoid compromising classified information. Adhere to all
   available classification guidance.
   1.5.2. AFI 16-610, Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG), the Air Force Nuclear
   Weapons Security Classification Policy, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DoD Nuclear Weapon
   Classification Policy Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DoD Topical Classification Guide
   for Weapon Production and Military Use, Airlift Request (if used), Mission Setup Message
   (if used), and nuclear transportation technical orders govern the classification of nuclear
   mission information. Restricted data and formerly restricted data are not normally releasable
   to foreign nationals (NOFORN). Do not send this type of information to any agency (civilian
   or military) of a foreign government unless directed to do so by an authoritative publication
   such as the SWOG.
   1.5.3. Do not use terms in unclassified text that reveals nuclear or classified cargo is aboard
   a specific aircraft or mission or at a specific location.
   1.5.4. Do not talk around classified information. Use only the SAAM number, aircraft tail
   number, or Aircraft Commander’s name when discussing a particular mission in unclassified
   media or via open lines. Do not use the term “ENAO” or “special weapons mission” in
   conjunction with the SAAM number, aircraft tail number, or Aircraft Commander’s name.
   Do not associate line numbers with any of the shipping information that reveals actual
   nuclear cargo data (e.g., nuclear cargo or package name, net explosive weight (NEW),
   dimensions, or weight).
   1.5.5. Do not talk about any aspect of an ENAO SAAM unless the other person has an
   appropriate security clearance and a definite need-to-know. This applies even after a mission
   is complete.
1.6. Releasing Information. Only appropriate commanders and public affairs officers may
release information about nuclear mishaps to the public or news media. Public Affairs will
ensure timely and uniform implementation of DoD approved policies as referenced in DoDI
5400.13, Public Affairs Operations, and AFI 35-104, Media Operations, to establish and conduct
efficient and effective procedures for the release of nuclear activity information to the public,
including news media (domestic, international), to include nuclear operations, accidents, IND
incidents, or nuclear weapon significant incidents.

1.7. Conduct of Operations. Crews should be briefed and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this instruction and the
requirements in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
1.8. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and
common sense in what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Pay particular attention to the
following areas:
     1.8.1. Nuclear cargo must be handled safely.
        1.8.1.1. Avoid exposing nuclear cargo to abnormal levels of thermal, mechanical, or
        electrical energy (e.g. high heat, projectile/mechanical impact, high voltage).
        1.8.1.2. Keep loading operations controlled and orderly at all times.
        1.8.1.3. Load or handle only one item or pallet at a time. Crews may ask shipper or
        receiver personnel to help, but the overall aircraft loading responsibility still belongs to
        the aircrew.
     1.8.2. Use standard T.O. MDS-1 and -9 loading procedures.
        1.8.2.1. For mixed loads (more than one type of nuclear cargo), base the load plan on
        how many weapons can be properly restrained using MDS-1 and -9 criteria. Do not
        allow nuclear cargo to rub or touch each other when tied down.
     1.8.3. If available, the T.O. MDS-16-1 is an excellent guide to use when planning the
     maximum density logistic movement of a single type of weapon. The tiedown patterns will
     aid crews in floor planning a maximum tested load. The MDS-16-1 is also a useful guide for
     positioning approach, rolling, parking, and step-up shoring. Step-by-step use of the MDS-
     16-1 is not necessary.
     1.8.4. The route of flight must not violate restrictions in the classified AFI 16-610, Special
     Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG). Over-flight of a foreign country with nuclear cargo is
     an extremely sensitive issue. Comply with SWOG instructions at all times. Crews without
     access to the SWOG, will request a route of flight that complies with the SWOG through
     command and control center (C2 agency) channels. The C2 agency must ensure the route of
     flight is provided to the aircrew by the most expeditious means available. If no route of
     flight is provided, fly normal air traffic control (ATC) routings to the destination. Do not
     divulge the nature of cargo to any en route ATC facility or country to obtain a specific
     clearance.
     1.8.5. United States military custody of nuclear cargo is required. Normally, the Copilot,
     who is the Courier, has custody of the nuclear cargo for the flight. Under certain conditions,
     the shipper may furnish United States military Couriers who will retain custody of nuclear
     cargo in flight.
1.9. Aircrew Selection. All active duty or ARC aircrew on Title 10 may be used for ENAO.
Time permitting, AMC will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or more of the
following:
     1.9.1. Assign Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) Loadmasters (LM) and pilots so as to
     have one or the other on each aircraft.
AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    7


  1.9.2. Place PNAF pilot and LM teams at the onload bases to assist with the loads and flight
  plans.
  1.9.3. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
  1.9.4. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no
  advance preparation or assistance.
 8                                                                   AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013


                                             Chapter 2

                             PREDEPARTURE REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Aircrew Requirements.
     2.1.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
     not specified, use a normal crew complement.
     2.1.2. The crew will be armed.
     2.1.3. Crewmembers tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than their
     personnel security clearance will be authorized emergency access to enough information to
     complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or
     wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
2.2. Aircrew Briefings. Crews should be briefed on the following:
     2.2.1. Purpose of the mission.
     2.2.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
     2.2.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material as

include the following items that are carried as part of the aircrew trip kit:
     2.3.1. AFI 13-526, Nuclear Airlift Operations.
     2.3.2. AFI 91-115.
     2.3.3. T.O. MDS-16-1, Loading and Air Transport of Nuclear Weapon Cargo, if
     published/available.
AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       9


                                           Chapter 3

                                 EN ROUTE OPERATIONS

3.1. Prior to Onload (either at home station or en route to the onload site).
   3.1.1. Review crew responsibilities and the procedures to be used during onload (loading
   method, security setup, cargo receipt, and Two-Person Concept (TPC)). Do not discuss
   classified information over inter-phone.
   3.1.2. If time permits, review the applicable section of the T.O MDS-16-1, if available. Use
   of the MDS-16-1 is not mandatory, but it may provide useful loading information for the
   cargo, such as parking and rolling shoring requirements and tiedown patterns. If the 16-1 is
   not available, reference AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, Operations Procedures (Chapter 21, ENAO)
   and applicable cargo loading manual.
   3.1.3. En route and 30 minutes prior to landing, contact the onload site and notify them of
   estimated time of arrival (ETA). Make support requirements known (fuel, materials handling
   equipment (MHE), transportation, security, etc.) at this time.
3.2. Arrival and Onload. Ensure the aircraft is ready for onload prior to accepting custody of
nuclear cargo.
   3.2.1. Contact the senior security official and comply with the following: If crews have
   nuclear cargo aboard, establish a restricted area and keep everyone off the aircraft. Provide
   armed security until the host security forces assume responsibility.
       3.2.1.1. A restricted area, encompassing the limited and exclusion areas, will be
       established around the aircraft. Ropes and stanchions are normally used to denote the
       restricted area.
       3.2.1.2. A single entry control point will be established.
   3.2.2. The entry controller must allow only those individuals into the restricted area who
   have been cleared by the Courier. Tell the entry controller which individuals are authorized
   into the area and, time permitting, use crew orders as an entry authorization lists (EAL) and
   prepared shipper lists.
   3.2.3. After security is established, verify shipper identification and accomplish the Shipper
   briefing. The Shipper briefing should include the following: (Note: Accomplish the shipper
   briefing and cargo inspection if time and the security environment permit)
       3.2.3.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of nuclear cargo, including line
       numbers from T.O. 11N-20-11, DoD class explosive hazard class or division, and net
       explosive weight (NEW).

         3.2.3.6. Special handling or unique requirements particular to the cargo.
         3.2.3.7. Individuals required to assist during onload or offload. Pass the information to
         the entry controller.
         3.2.3.8. Authorized recipients at offload station. Get this information in writing.
      3.2.4. The primary LM, Courier, and shipper will inspect the cargo for broken seals, exterior
      damage, security to carrier, wheel and casters, tiedown points, etc. Do not allow the
      inspection procedures to affect the security of the cargo.
      3.2.5. Before starting the onload, tell the tower to notify the fire department the “onload is
      commencing.”
      3.2.6. During onload or offload monitor the operation, assist as necessary, and ensure
      personnel comply with the Two-Person Concept (TPC).
      3.2.7. After all cargo is onloaded, accept custody of the cargo by signing the DD Form 1911.
      CDS codes (if issued) must remain with an aircrew member aboard the aircraft (normally
      with Copilot) until custody is transferred to the receiving authority.
      3.2.8. Prior to engine start, give the controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking
      location and approximate engine start time and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the
      aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is standing by the aircraft for engine start. The armed Courier
      will deplane and tell the host base security to break down security and maintain surveillance
      until aircraft departure. The Courier and other armed crewmember will monitor access to the
      aircraft and crew entrance door during engine start.
3.3. En route to Offload. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating procedures
IAW the applicable MDS Vol 3.
      3.3.1. Flight Plans. Enter “hazardous cargo” and the mission number in the “other
      information” section of the flight plan. Crews carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items
      that could be mistaken for real weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency will
      enter “inert devices.”

      3.3.5. En route to offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of the
      following: command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission number and
      verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base does not
      have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately to the crash
      or fire protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
         3.3.5.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
         3.3.5.2. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       11


       3.3.5.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
       (normally 1.1).

       3.3.5.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
       3.3.5.7. Inert devices, if applicable.
3.4. Offload.
   3.4.1. If security forces do not meet the aircraft, the Aircraft Commander must be prepared
   for an immediate departure until security is established. Immediately upon block-in, deploy
   the armed Courier (minimum) and team (if required) to setup up security with security
   forces. The aircrew will keep the aircraft engines running, all aircraft doors closed and delay
   preparation for nuclear cargo transfer until the Courier verifies appropriate security is in
   place. CDS codes (if issued) must remain aboard the aircraft (normally with the Copilot)
   until custody is transferred to the receiving authority. Once security is established, the only
   personnel authorized near the aircraft are aircrew members and those support personnel
   necessary to install landing gear pins, ground power and wheel chocks. Monitor these people
   at all time.
   3.4.2. Maintain the Two-Person Concept (TPC).
   3.4.3. Brief the receiver on the cargo:
       3.4.3.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of the nuclear cargo, including
       line numbers from T.O. 11N-20-11, DOT explosive hazard class or division, DOT class,
       and NEW.
       3.4.3.2. Courier escort requirements.
       3.4.3.3. Items requiring the Two-Person Concept (TPC).
       3.4.3.4. Items that are CDS-equipped and if the CDS has been activated (weapon not

       3.4.3.5. Items exposed to an abnormal environment or not operational.
       3.4.3.6. Special handling or unique requirements applicable to the cargo.
       3.4.3.7. Individuals required to assist during the offload. Pass this information to the
       entry controller.
   3.4.4. The receiver and Courier will conduct an inspection of the cargo for broken seals,
   exterior damage, etc. If discrepancies are found and they have not been previously noted, the
   receiver will annotate them on the DD Form 1911 and obtain the Courier’s initials.
   3.4.5. Transfer custody of cargo. (Receiver signs DD Form 1911).
   3.4.6. Complete offload of cargo.
3.5. Emergency Procedures.
   3.5.1. Security Emergencies. Crews may use deadly force to protect nuclear cargo and will
   resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture nuclear cargo. Consider any attack on an
12                                                                   AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013


     aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the
     nuclear cargo. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to thwart
     recovery of nuclear cargo, the welfare and safety of the hostages should be considered in
     determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not deter the taking
     of decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes the use of deadly force to recover
     nuclear cargo and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of nuclear cargo. If crews
     are attacked, take the following actions:
        3.5.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
        3.5.1.2. If the attack occurs during onloading or offloading, load the nuclear cargo as fast
        and safely as possible, even if improper procedures must be used. Ensure effective cargo
        restraint and take off immediately.
        3.5.1.3. Some weapons are equipped with a CDS that internally destroys the capability of
        a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be activated when capture
        of a weapon is imminent. CDS is the only disablement procedure aircrews are authorized
        to use.
     3.5.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is jettisonable IAW
     T.O. MDS-1. The Aircraft Commander bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or crash-
     land where the least amount of damage will result. Activate the CDS, if applicable, prior to
     jettisoning or crash-landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the
     jettison restrictions in the SWOG.
     3.5.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and as inconspicuous as possible while still
     protecting nuclear cargo. If confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to
     the status of US military aircraft in the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), which states:
     US military aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities. US military aircraft cleared to overfly or
     land in a foreign territory are entitled to the privileges and immunities customarily accorded
     to warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the
     contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections
     (including customs and safety inspection); or other exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation
     over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo aboard. Air Force Aircraft Commanders
     will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated
     above by foreign authorities except by direction of USAF or the American Embassy in the
     country concerned. Diplomatically, but firmly, refuse any requests to board or inspect, and
     get help through any available United States channel.

                                          SECURITY

4.1. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. During contingency operations where nuclear weapons are dispersed,
responsible commanders will take the necessary steps to provide a level of security comparable
to the basic security objectives in DoD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108, Nuclear Weapons
Security Manual. The Courier officer (who has custody of the nuclear cargo) is the final
authority on security matters within the exclusion area; however, crews should follow the advice
and procedures of the host security force as much as possible. If the situation is serious, use
judgment in determining whether to remain or load and depart quickly. Prior to takeoff, the AC
will ensure security support is available at all stations being transited that day through the AOC.
4.2. Home Station. Conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unauthorized
explosives or stowaways. Use an explosives detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not
delay the mission to “sanitize” the aircraft.
4.3. Onload/Offload Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes
and stanchions, around the aircraft.
   4.3.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the area.
   The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy of the
   flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the aircrew
   Courier before allowing anyone into the area. Exception: Allow the nuclear cargo convoy
   to enter the restricted area without delay.
   4.3.2. Exclusion area. Do not allow anyone to be alone in the exclusion area or aircraft
   when nuclear cargo is present (inside either the area or the aircraft). The purpose of an
   exclusion area is to prevent any one person from tampering with nuclear cargo. The easiest
   way to enforce an exclusion area is to always be in pairs inside the exclusion area (for
   example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member and one shipper).
   Maintain the Two-Person Concept (TPC) throughout the flight. Do not allow anyone to be
   alone in the cargo compartment, crew rest area and/or cockpit. Note: An individual may
   enter a lavatory within an exclusion area without continuous direct observation by the
   remaining TPC team.

                         CUSTODY TRANSFER PROCEDURES

5.1. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. The Courier must be a commissioned officer. A Copilot or
third pilot is the preferred option. The Courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody,
security, safety, and delivery of nuclear cargo to authorized receivers.
   5.1.1. Prior to accepting and loading nuclear cargo, the shipper briefs the crew (at least the
   AC, Courier officer, and primary LM) on the nature and hazards of the cargo. ACs will brief
   crewmembers who didn’t receive the shipper’s briefing prior to flight. Ask the shipper to
   point out any specifics crews may need to handle the nuclear cargo, i.e. tiedown points,
   forklift stirrups, CDS procedures, etc.
   5.1.2. Time permitting, the Courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody.
   The Courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapons case and replace any
   broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept
   damaged nuclear cargo without documentation. Document damage on the DD Form 1911,
   Materiel Courier Receipt, and obtain the shipper’s initials prior to signing for the nuclear
   cargo.
   5.1.3. The Courier accepts custody of nuclear cargo by signing the DD Form 1911 provided
   by the shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement Couriers. The Courier
   retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny nuclear cargo.
   5.1.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement Courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   5.1.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 618 AOC (TACC) Command Center
   to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD, DSN 576-2597 for resolution.
AFI13-526V4 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       15

                                   LOGISTICS SUPPORT

6.1. Maintenance on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   6.1.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo must not violate safety rules
   normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. To the maximum extent
   possible, have maintenance and servicing completed before loading nuclear cargo on the
   aircraft. Do not allow maintenance, such as the following, that could increase the possibility
   of a fire:
      6.1.1.1. Using flame or uncontrolled heat-producing items.
      6.1.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where significant
      fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components, etc.
   6.1.2. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear for minor
   maintenance (tire change, brake change, bogie maintenance, etc.) is not considered jacking.
   6.1.3. Do not refuel, defuel, or service oxygen while loading or offloading nuclear cargo.
   Have a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxygen servicing.
   6.1.4. An aircrew member will monitor all maintenance on the aircraft while nuclear cargo is
   aboard, dependent on TPC requirements.
