SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction updates the previous version and provides Tier numbers to identify waiver
authority for wing/unit level requirements. Administrative updates include revisions to the
course numbers in Paragraph 3.1.2, to paragraph 2.4,     and to Attachment 2, which updates
Medical Law Consultant (MLC) locations and realigns the bases within MLC regions.
1. Purpose of the Medical Law Program. The Medical Law Program ensures the Air Force
has a cadre of trained personnel ready to provide medical law advice and support to medical
centers, hospitals and clinics, and to manage medical malpractice claims and litigation.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG):
        2.1.1. Establishes the Medical Law Program and manages its activities through the Air
        Force Legal Operations Agency, Claims and Tort Litigation Division (AFLOA/JACC).
        (T-1)
        2.1.2. Provides management and professional development for the MLCs through the
        Chief, Medical Law Field Support Center (MLFSC). (T-1)
        2.1.3. Determines the locations of the MLC positions in consultation with the Air Force
        Surgeon General (SG) who provides funding for the MLC positions. (T-1)
     2.2. HQ USAF/JAX should coordinate with AFLOA/JACC to select qualified MLC
     applicants, subject to TJAG approval of the assignments.
     2.3. AFLOA/JACC:
        2.3.1. Oversees and directs the Medical Law Program through its MLFSC and the
        Medical Law Branch (MLB). (T-1)
        2.3.2. Dedicates a field grade judge advocate position for the MLFSC Chief. (T-1)
        2.3.3. Provides TDY funding for JACC members who are not MLCs to visit MLC
        offices and Military Treatment Facility (MTF) locations as appropriate. (T-3)

     2.4. MLFSC Chief:
        2.4.1. Provides reach-back medical-legal support to MLCs in coordination with subject
        matter experts in the MLB. (T-1)
        2.4.2. Supervises, oversees, manages and rates each MLC. (T-3) In an office with more

        2.4.3. Visits each MLC Office at least annually. (T-3) The MLFSC Chief will meet with
        the host MTF/CC during these visits. (T-3)
        2.4.4. Seeks the input of the MTF/CC or other Office of Air Force Surgeon General
        (AF/SG) personnel where MLCs are stationed before drafting MLC OPRs and PRFs. (T-
        3) The MLFSC Chief will evaluate an MLC’s performance, in part, on the degree to
        which the MLC provided responsive, timely, and accurate medical-legal advice to the
AFI51-302 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     3


     MTF/CC where the MLC is stationed and to the commanders of other MTFs within the
     MLC’s region through reach-back medical-legal services to the base legal offices. (T-3)
     2.4.5. Conducts meetings with the MLCs regularly to provide guidance, feedback,

     3)
  2.5. MLCs are stationed at United States Air Force MTFs and at the Office of the Surgeon
  General of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE/SG). Generally, MLCs provide
  medical-legal advice directly to the MTF/CC and staff of the facility where they are assigned.
  (T-1) MLCs also ensure that other MTFs within their regions receive medical-legal advice
  by providing reach-back support to the base Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) or by providing
  advice to the MTF in coordination with the base SJA. (T-1) (See Attachment 2 for MTFs

  missions of their region’s facilities. In performing these services, MLCs will:
     2.5.1. Advise the MTF/CCs and staffs on all medical-legal matters, including but not
     limited to release of medical information consistent with the Freedom of Information Act,
     the Privacy Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. (T-1)
     2.5.2. Serve on MTF committees and boards, as appropriate, to help improve the quality
     of medical care at MTFs and assist with the administration of the MTF’s healthcare
     operations, to include, among other responsibilities, serving as a government
     representative or a legal advisor in hearings on adverse clinical privileging actions and
     advising MTFs on any associated investigation. (T-1) The MTF conducting the hearing
     funds the MLC’s TDY expenses incurred when preparing for and attending these
     hearings. (T-1)
     2.5.3. Review local operating instructions and prepare legal documents concerning the
     operations of the MTFs. (T-1)
     2.5.4. Lecture at meetings, seminars, and conferences on medical-legal matters. (T-3)

     Reserve Components. (T-1)
     2.5.6. Visit each MTF and base legal office within the MLC’s region once a year, or
     more often if needed, to lecture and teach on medical-legal matters, and assist with
     medical-legal issues. (T-3) These visits shall be coordinated well in advance with the
     legal office attorney designated to support the MTF in accordance with paragraph 2.7.2.
     (T-3) The MTF where the MLC is stationed funds these visits. (T-3)
     2.5.7. In coordination with MAJCOM SJAs, provide medical-legal advice to
     MAJCOM/SG offices on matters affecting the command. (T-1) If the MAJCOM/SG
     requests advice about a facility in another MLC’s region, the MLC also coordinates with
     that region’s MLC. (T-1)
4                                                             AFI51-302 5 NOVEMBER 2014


       2.5.8. Assist MAJCOM/SGs and MAJCOM SJAs, as needed, in any Medical Incident
       Investigation (MII). (T-3)
       2.5.9. Prepare and distribute medical-legal newsletters as appropriate, advising the MTFs
       and base legal offices within the MLC’s region of medical-legal developments and
       trends. (T-3)
       2.5.10. Assist the MLB attorneys by providing support in investigating medical
       malpractice claims and defending suits arising at the MTF where the MLC is stationed
       and at MTFs within the MLC’s region. (T-3) The support includes, but is not limited to,
       arranging and conducting witness interviews and locating documents and other evidence.
       2.5.11. MLCs are to refer all non-medical-legal matters pertaining to the MTF to the
       servicing base SJA. (T-1) MLCs will keep the base SJA apprised of important medical-
       legal issues concerning the base MTF. (T-3) MLCs are to promptly brief the base SJA on
       all matters brought to the MLC’s attention where legal advice is sought, but outside the
       medical law area. (T-1) If an MLC is unsure as to whether a matter is outside the
       medical law area, the MLC should consult with the MLFSC Chief. MLCs will not advise
       the MTF commander and staff on matters pertaining to:
           2.5.11.1. Military justice, including nonjudicial punishment, courts-martial,
           administrative discharge, and other administrative disciplinary action taken against
           military members.
           2.5.11.2. Labor issues, including unfair labor practice and Equal Employment

           2.5.11.4. Fiscal law issues.

           Joint Ethics Regulation.
    2.6. MLB: The MLB consists of the MLB Chief and attorneys who are subject matter
    experts in medical law and specialize in medical malpractice claims and litigation. These

       MLB personnel at these hearings. (T-1)
   2.7. Base legal offices: The base SJA furnishes professional legal services to the MTF
   commander on all matters that are outside the medical law area.         Base legal offices,
   particularly at installations where there is no MLC co-located at the MTF, also serve a vital
   role in the Air Force’s Medical Law Program. The base legal office maintains a key
   interface with the MTF, ensures that medical-legal concerns are promptly raised to the
   regional MLC, and facilitates legal support to MTFs. (T-1) At those bases with no co-

       Affiliation Agreement Program. (T-3) MTFs forward the base legal review and TAA
       package to the regional MLC. (T-1)
       2.7.4. Provide administrative support to MLB staff on medical malpractice claims and
       litigation, including locating witnesses, obtaining documents and medical records,
       participating in witness interviews, providing office space for TDY personnel, and other
       logistical support. (T-3)
       2.7.5. At all locations outside the 50 states, base legal offices investigate medical
       malpractice claims under AFI 51-501, Tort Claims. (T-1) Upon completion, the claim
       investigation is forwarded to the MLB for expert review and final action. (T-1)
3. Courses. There are three annual courses pertaining to the Medical Law Program.
   3.1. MLC Course. To the extent possible, each attorney selected for any medical law
   position will attend the MLC Course before being assigned to that position. (T-2) The Air
   Force SG funds MLCs attending this course. (T-2) The Senior MLC assigned to Wright-
6                                                            AFI51-302 5 NOVEMBER 2014


    Patterson US Air Force Medical Center is the course director and coordinates the curriculum
    with the MLFSC Chief. (T-3)
       3.1.1. The course curriculum shall include briefings on relevant medical specialties and
       laws, and related medical-legal training to include MLC student observation of a variety
       of surgical procedures.
       3.1.2. The MLC Course is held at Wright-Patterson US Air Force Medical Center and
       AFLOA/JACC (Course numbers J5OZO51J4 00AB & J5OZO51J4 00AC respectively).
    3.2. MLFSC Update Course. All MLCs shall attend the annual MLFSC Update Course
    hosted at AFLOA/JACC for an update on the law and medical-legal issues, and on current
    policies of the Office of the Surgeon General, the JAG Corps, and the Department of Justice.
    (T-3) The Update Course shall coincide with the MLC Course so that the attendees can also
    attend and benefit from the practical experience of the incumbent MLCs. The MTF where
    the MLC is assigned funds the MLC’s attendance at the course.
    3.3. Medical Law Mini-Course. This four-day course trains base-level attorneys and
    paralegals on medical-legal issues arising in a number of medical specialties. To the extent
    possible, SJAs will nominate MTF liaisons and paralegals who routinely work on medical-
    legal issues and fund their attendance. (T-3) All aspects of the course are coordinated with
    the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s School. The MLFSC Chief is responsible for final
    approval of the curriculum. (T-3)
