1.9. Flight Management. Flight Management is the set of integrated processes and supporting
technologies producing effective planning and execution of air mobility sorties. It provides
increased safety, risk-mitigation, effectiveness, and efficiency to ensure successful completion of
sorties and ultimately all air mobility missions across the spectrum of warfighting operations.
This promotes continuous and proactive shared situational awareness of mission-critical
information, predicts and evaluates the impact of potential threats or disruptions, derives
alternatives through collaborative decision making, and pushes actionable plans to the aircrews.
It is the basis for improved Command and Control capability that enables dynamic response to
changes in Combatant Commander requirements and the operating environment through more
effective information fusion, communications, resource visibility (aircraft, aircrews, and
payload), and resource utilization.
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                       9


  1.9.1. Flight Management Focus. Flight Management is primarily focused on sortie
  planning and execution but also integrates sortie management with mission management and
  mission planning processes to ensure satisfaction of Combatant Commander requirements. It
  represents the linchpin in the MAF’s effort to ensure more centralized, secure, collaborative
  style of decision making, linking supporting processes throughout MAF C2 agencies. Flight
  Management proactively identifies obstacles and threats to sortie progress early in mission
  planning, execution planning and execution phases and removes or mitigates them prior to
  them becoming impediments to the sortie’s success.
  1.9.2. Flight Management Process. Flight Management encompasses the entire planning
  process from United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), United States
  European Command (USEUCOM), and United States Pacific Command (USPACOM)
  validation through execution. It begins when the mission is validated and ends with the
  completion of the mission. It is a cycle of planning, monitoring, assessing, collaborating, and
  re-planning to conduct the sorties at the optimum levels of safety, risk mitigation,
  effectiveness, and efficiency. Flight Managers (FMs) work with Mission Planners and other
  supporting functions through collaborative decision making processes to satisfy Combatant
  Commander requirements. FMs are the focal point of a centralized network which monitors
  changes in key informational elements that could pose hazards/risks and communicates
  alternatives to the aircrew. The Flight Management process is integral to planning and
  executing MAF operational missions.
  1.9.3. Flight Management Goals. The driving principle for Flight Management is
  increased operational capability for global air mobility. Flight Management seeks to achieve
  the objectives and produce the outcomes listed below:
     1.9.3.1. Provide synchronized and standardized planning and execution policies across
     the MAF.
     1.9.3.2. Provide centralized processes and procedures within MAF C2 agencies that
     provide aircrews with a primary point of contact for planning and executing the sortie.
     1.9.3.3. Improved Combat Flexibility. Flight Management supports Combatant
     Commanders during rapidly changing conditions through flexible redirection of MAF
     sorties. Improvements in intelligence, flight following, and assessment enable en route
     sorties to be quickly re-planned to counter threats while supporting battlefield
     requirements. Air refueling, aerial delivery and arrival points can be adjusted; delivery
     modes modified; and resource visibility expanded. Deployment/buildup times are
     shortened and greater combat power facilitated during employment and sustainment.
     1.9.3.4. Improved Force Protection. Threat awareness and force protection are
     paramount and must pervade every aspect of the Air Mobility culture to effectively
     neutralize the ever-present and ever-changing dangers aircrews face in executing their
     missions. In a Flight Management environment of shared situational awareness,
     improved communications, and fused information, Security, Intelligence, Investigative,
     and Information Operations agencies can quickly identify changing conditions to Flight
     Managers (FM). Tactics, Information Operations, and Intelligence can then devise
     actions to avoid, mitigate, or defeat potentially hostile actions. Sorties are planned with
     timely mitigation strategies when emerging threat conditions would impede successful
     sortie accomplishment.
10                                                            AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


     1.9.3.5. Improved Support for Safety. The PIC and FM are partners responsible for
     the safe conduct of the flight. The FM is the focal point of a centralized support network
     for changes in key elements such as weather, airfield status/restrictions, Notice to Airmen
     (NOTAM), intelligence, and threats. Notify aircrews of potential safety, security and
     other key elements impacting the mission. Sorties are dynamically adjusted to avoid or
     mitigate hazards, unburdening the aircrew to concentrate on flight preparations, mission
     execution, and in-flight aircraft operations.
     1.9.3.6. Real Time, Dynamic, and Improved Global Situational Awareness. This is a
     core process for Flight Management. The ability to view all mission activities and
     influencing factors and assess their consequences is vital to forecasting disruptions,
     increasing the margin of safety, and improving force protection.
     1.9.3.7. Improved Productivity. Flight Management improves and maximizes mission
     productivity through streamlined planning and execution as well as maximizing use of
     asset capability to minimize waste of assets. Collaborative tools improve accountability
     and provide an accurate picture of the entire mobility mission and its sorties. The 618
     AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD collaborate with appropriate
     agencies to resolve problems and coordinate solutions throughout the sortie. This ensures
     execution of sorties with high levels of reliability, momentum, and utilization.
     1.9.3.8. Improved Collaborative Sortie/Mission Planning. This environment relies on
     functional groups to collect, screen, and assemble key data into a collaborative plan.
     Each process owner has responsibility and accountability for ensuring essential elements
     of information is accurate, complete, and timely. This facilitates shared knowledge and
     close collaboration between C2 agencies. Communication and coordination with the
     aircrew are continuously maintained to ensure that operational, safety, security, and
     ultimately force protection considerations are shared, assessed, and acted upon as the
     sortie progresses.
     1.9.3.9. Improved Access to Global Airspace. C2 planning and execution processes
     must keep pace with advancing requirements to select routes/altitudes (profiles) and
     departure/arrival times that are fully coordinated with Air Navigation Service Providers
     (ANSP) functions. MAF AOCs must maintain close working relationship/partnership
     with geographic AOCs and Combat Air Operations Center (CAOCs), worldwide ANSPs,
     and working groups to ensure access to high-demand global airspace.

       FLIGHT MANAGER TRAINING, EVALUATION, AND CERTIFICATION

3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a brief overview of FM training, evaluation, and
certification programs. Prior to performing unsupervised duties, FM personnel will be trained,
evaluated, and certified in those duties in accordance with appropriate directives.
   3.1.1. FMs will use AFI 11-255, Volume 1, Integrated Flight Management Training, AFI
   11-255, Volume 2, Integrated Flight Management Evaluation Criteria, and AFI 11-255V3 as
   the primary sources for training, evaluation, and procedures.
   3.1.2. C2 personnel will use AFI 13-1 AOC V1, V2, and AMCI 10-202V4 Contingency
   Response Operations, and AMCI 10-210 Stage Management Operations as the primary
   sources for training, evaluation, and certification.
   3.1.3. Non-C2 AOC personnel will use MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 13-1 AOC V1, V2,
   and V3 as the primary sources for training, evaluation, and certification.
3.2. Training Requirements. FM training falls into six categories:              Initial/Mission
Qualification, Periodic, Continuation, Ancillary, Upgrade, and Requalification Training. More
detailed information on FM Training is found in AFI 11-255, Volume 1 and associated
MAJCOM instructions/supplements.
   3.2.1. Initial/Mission Qualification Training. The goal of Initial/Mission Qualification
   Training is to produce a certified FM who is qualified in basic sortie management. These
   FMs perform the following tasks:
       3.2.1.1. Confirm information (weather, NOTAMs, intelligence, etc) needed to plan
       assigned sorties is accurate, complete, and de-conflicted; create risk-mitigated flight
       plans; file flight plans with ANSPs; prepare, publish, and transmit accurate and complete
       ADP; and provide verbal departure briefings when contacted by the aircrew.
       3.2.1.2. Flight follow the sortie from takeoff to landing; assist aircrews in execution as
       required, and coordinate sortie issues with appropriate authorities; proactively monitor
       the sortie’s operational environment; perform predictive analysis on changes in key
       information elements that could pose hazards/risks to sortie success and derive
       alternatives and push actionable plans to the aircrew and ANSPs.
       3.2.1.3. Prepare and brief the on-coming FM on the status of assigned sorties.
   3.2.2. Periodic Training. This training provides a forum to present new information or
   programs, present topics requiring additional emphasis and share information and lessons
   learned from the experience of qualified FMs. Designed to serve as refresher training, it is
   intended to raise the level of knowledge of FMs in procedures and sortie/mission
   requirements.
   3.2.3. Continuation Training. The goal of FM Continuation Training is accomplished by
   the regular performance of FM Duties. Currency requirements are defined in AFI 11-255
   Volume 1 and reflect the minimum requirements needed to maintain currency.
 16                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


   3.2.4. Ancillary Training. This includes all other training required, but not directly related
   to specific FM duties and responsibilities (i.e…. Force Protection, Operations Security
   (OPSEC)/Communications Security (COMSEC), etc…)
   3.2.5. Upgrade Training. FMs completing initial/mission qualification training and
   certification are qualified to perform basic FM duties. Additional training, evaluation, and/or
   certification are required for the duties of Instructor FM, Evaluator FM, and other MAJCOM
   unique positions.
       3.2.5.1. Instructor Flight Manager Qualification. The Chief, Flight Management
       Division (or the 613 AOC/AMD and 603 AOC/AMD equivalents) will select Instructor
       FM candidates based on experience, judgment, ability to instruct, FM competence, and
       technical knowledge. Personnel selected for upgrade to Instructor FM will be current and
       qualified and have at least one year experience as a certified FM and be certified in all
       FM duties. Instructor candidates will demonstrate to an Evaluator FM their ability to
       instruct and perform selected duties according to AFI 11-255, Volume 1, Integrated
       Flight Management Training and other applicable directives.
       3.2.5.2. Evaluator Flight Manager Qualification. The Chief, Flight Management
       Division (or the, 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD equivalents) will select
       experienced Instructor FMs for upgrade to Evaluator FM. Personnel selected for upgrade
       to Evaluator FM will be current and qualified and have at least six months experience as
       an Instructor FM. Evaluator candidates will demonstrate to an Evaluator FM their ability
       to evaluate and perform selected duties according to AFI 11-255 V2 and other applicable
       directives.
   3.2.6. Requalification Training. Training must be tailored to meet the needs of the student
   and consist of portions of FM Initial/Mission Qualification Training. Student FMs who hold
   a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Dispatch License are not required to
   repeat the licensing process. The MAJCOM, however, may require student FMs who
   possess an FAA Aircraft Dispatch License to audit the FAA Aircraft Dispatch Course
   without the requirement to pass the written and practical licensing examinations.
3.3. Flight Manager (FM) Evaluations. FM proficiency will be measured using written
examinations and task evaluations. Written examinations and task evaluations are designed to
provide a systematic review of publications and procedures pertinent to the area in which the FM
is certified. FM written examination and evaluation procedures are located in AFI 11-255 V2.
3.4. Flight Manager Certification/Decertification. All 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD,
and 603 AOC/AMD FMs must be certified prior to performing unsupervised duties. Completion
of all periodic training and evaluation requirements is necessary to maintain certification.
Failure to maintain established certification standards will result in immediate entry into
remedial training or decertified. FM certification/decertification procedures are located in AFI
11-255 V1.

                           FLIGHT MANAGER PROCEDURES

4.1. General Responsibilities. FMs are the focal point for a collaborative team performing pre-
flight coordination, conducting flight planning, creating and filing flight plans, assembling and
distributing ADP, proactively performing flight following, providing support to the aircrew, and
working in conjunction with C2 personnel to accomplish the coordination necessary to ensure
successful completion of all tasked sorties. 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD and 603
AOC/AMD FMs perform mission management responsibilities IAW AFI 10-207 AMC
Supplement, Command Posts.
   4.1.1. Unique Responsibilities. The 89 AW, 932 AW, and 6 AMW will support Special Air
   Missions (SAM)/Special Air Resource (SPAR) missions scheduled by the Office of the Vice
   Chief of Staff (CVAM), USAF. Only the 89 AW/Command Post (CP) and the 932 AW/CP
   are permitted to enter SAM mission movement information into the MAF C2 systems. Only
   the 6 AMW/CP is permitted to enter SPAR mission movement information into MAF C2
   systems. The 89 AW and 6 AMW will report real-time progress of other than Close Watch
   missions. Close Watch mission progress will be reported directly to the 618 AOC (TACC)
   Director of Operations. These missions will be managed internally, IAW AFI 10-207, AMC
   Supplement to Command Posts."
4.2. Flight Manager and PIC Shared Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The FM and the PIC have specific duties that must be accomplished separately, but
   they share the responsibility for safe, risk-mitigated, effective, and efficient sortie
   execution/completion. The FM has primary responsibility for planning flight-managed
   sorties in execution and taking action in coordination with the Collaborative Decision
   Making (CDM) Team to ensure mission success. The PIC has ultimate responsibility for the
   safe operation of the aircraft and of all personnel on board.        NOTE: MAJCOM
   supplements may modify FM duties to meet specific MAJCOM requirements/capabilities.
4.3. Flight Manager Procedures.
   4.3.1. Sortie Allocation. AOCs will develop procedures to ensure flight managed sorties
   are properly identified in the C2 system (i.e. aircrew, local C2, airfield management).
   4.3.2. Pre-Mission Actions. FMs must complete the following actions prior to beginning
   work on first assigned flight managed sortie:
       4.3.2.1. Shift Briefing. On-coming FMs will attend a shift briefing prior to assuming
       FM duties. This briefing will include, but is not limited to the following topics: weather
       briefing covering all shift missions; computer systems status; read file changes;
       intelligence update (if applicable), and other information relevant to the shift.
       4.3.2.2. Shift Changeover. The off-going FM will provide a thorough briefing to
       account for all sortie specific information.
       4.3.2.3. Read File. FMs will ensure the latest FM Read File item is reviewed and signed
       off prior to beginning work on assigned sorties.

  4.3.3. Execution Planning. The normal planning process begins 6 hours prior to departure
  and ends with publishing Aircrew Departure Papers 4 hours prior to departure.
     4.3.3.1. Planning Requirements. Ensure all planning documents (FLIP) and
     information system software (Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF),
     Flight Plan Route Database) are current and up to date prior to starting work on first
     sortie.
     4.3.3.2. Sortie Planning. Prior to running a computer flight plan, the FM must gather
     and analyze pertinent planning data by referencing AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight
     Rules; AFMAN 11-217Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, AFI 11-2 MDS Volume
     3, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements.        NOTE: This is not an all inclusive list
     of documents to review; other documents may apply depending on the area to be flown
     and mission type.
         4.3.3.2.1. Departure Planning. Regardless of the type of departure flown
         (Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)/Visual Flight Rules (VFR)), review the following (as
         appropriate): Actual Payload/Hazardous Material (HAZMAT), IFR Departure
         Procedure, instrument approach plate, Standard Instrument Departure (SID)s,
         NOTAMs, diplomatic clearances, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH),
         Global Decision Support Software (GDSS), Airfield Suitability and Restrictions
         Report (ASRR)/Giant Report, Special Departure Procedures (SDP), Adverse
         Weather, Operation Order (OPORD), Special Instructions (SPINS), Prior Permission
         Required (PPR), Operating and Quiet Hour Restrictions, Air Refueling
         Track/Altitude Reservation (ALTRV), unique communication requirements and
         Formation Departures.      NOTE: The Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report
         (ASRR)              (accessible             through            GDSS              or
         https://www.GDSS2ams.c2.amc.af.mil/GDSS2web/) and Giant Report are binding
         on all AMC and AMC-gained operations; other MAJCOMS will establish specific
         policy on the applicability and accessibility of the ASRR report IAW AFI 11-202
         Volume 3.
     4.3.3.3. Departure Alternate Planning. Use AFI 11-202 Volume 3, AFI 11-2 MDS
     V3, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements to determine specific departure alternate
     requirements. If required, departure alternate will be filed in the remarks section of DD
     1801 International Flight Plan. (i.e…. RMKS/Departure Alternate KCHS) and included
     in the FM notes.
         4.3.3.3.1. Departure Alternate. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or
         visibility is below landing minimums for an available approach at the departure
         aerodrome. When planning an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach, use
         Category I minimums.
         4.3.3.3.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is
         required, the aircraft must be capable of maintaining the Minimum En route Altitude
         (MEA) or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to
         the alternate using one engine inoperative (OEI) performance criteria. To qualify as a
         departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
            4.3.3.3.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                    19


            must be equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to
            remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-
            1/2 (Runway Visual Range (RVR) 2400), or;
            4.3.3.3.2.2. For an alternate within two (one for some aircraft) hours flying time,
            the existing weather must be at least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published
            approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for
            a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the
            alternate.
        4.3.3.3.3. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI
        escape procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the
        loss of an engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure
        planning. When appropriate, FMs will calculate an SDP to determine Maximum
        Allowable Cabin Load (ACL) prior to running the final computer flight plan.
        NOTE: Requests for fields not currently listed may be requested through Unit OGV.
        OGV will forward requests to AMC/A3V NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure.
        AMC/A3V authorizes the use of ―ad hoc‖ SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the
        analysis date. The SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the
        takeoff performance.     Exception: USAFE FMs do not calculate SDPs for their
        aircrews.
     4.3.3.4. En Route Planning. FMs will base sortie routing on Foreign Clearance Guide,
     diplomatic clearances, en route weather, airspace, NOTAMs, threats, and ANSP
     preferred routing. Commands will establish a route database that meets the requirements
     of country specific Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP), regional routing
     documents (i.e…. Route Availability Document (RAD)), Fuel Savings, and user
     preferred routings.
        4.3.3.4.1. En Route Alternate. FMs are not required to include en route alternates
        in aircrew departure papers. However, if FMs include an en route alternate they will
        include weather and NOTAMs for those airfields.
        4.3.3.4.2. Air Refueling Alternate. For missions that require Air Refueling, FMs
        will choose an alternate for receiver aircraft in the event air refueling cannot occur.
        Air refueling alternates selected must meet destination alternate weather
        requirements.
        4.3.3.4.3. Adverse Weather.
            4.3.3.4.3.1. Severe Turbulence/Icing. FMs will not plan routes of flight through
            areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence and/or severe icing. When
            planning prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, areas of moderate
            icing should be avoided.
            4.3.3.4.3.2. Mountain Wave Turbulence. FMs will not plan routes of flight
            into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave turbulence.
            4.3.3.4.3.3. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). FMs will use
            AOC approved military weather sources as the primary source for detailed
            weather forecast and advisories if available. National Weather Service in-flight
20                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


            weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft.
            4.3.3.4.3.4. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of
            forecast or known volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to
            avoid volcanic activity by at least 20 NMs.
        4.3.3.4.4. Equal Time Point (ETP). ETP calculations are required on portions of
        oceanic routes when the total time between the Last Suitable Air Field (LSAF) and
        First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) is 3-hours (5 hours for C-130E/H/J) or more. FMs will
        choose the LSAF and FSAF closest to Coast in/Coast out. (In some situations the
        LSAF/FSAF may be the departure and/or the arrival airfield).       NOTE: Approach
        minimums will be used for selecting LSAF/FSAF.
        4.3.3.4.5. Depressurization Fuel. This fuel will be calculated for every ETP.
     4.3.3.5. Arrival Planning. FMs will consider the following when planning this phase:
     Adverse Weather, BASH, NOTAMs, Operating Hours, PPRs, STARs, Approach
     Procedures, and GDSS/ASRR Giant Report.
        4.3.3.5.1. Destination Requirements. (for filing purposes).         The forecast
        destination weather will be according to AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules
        and the following:
            4.3.3.5.1.1. File two alternates when:
               4.3.3.5.1.1.1. The forecast visibility (temporary or prevailing) is less than
               published minimums for an available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting
               Office (NACO) precision approach; or
               4.3.3.5.1.1.2. The forecast ceiling or visibility (temporary or prevailing) is
               less than published minimums for all other approaches. For approaches with
               no published ceiling requirement (for example, Jeppesen approaches®), the
               minimum required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published Height
               Above Aerodrome (HAA) or Height Above Terrain (HAT) and rounding it up
               to the nearest one hundred feet (or as determined by MAJCOM Terminal
               Instrument Procedures (TERPs) review). For example, a Jeppesen Very High
               Frequency Omni Directional Range (VOR) approach with a published HAA
               of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet; or
               4.3.3.5.1.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed
               limits corrected for Runway Condition Reading (RCR).
            4.3.3.5.1.2. File an alternate airport, regardless of forecast weather, when the
            departure or destination aerodrome is outside the Continental United States
            (CONUS). (EXCEPTION: Intra-theater flights outside CONUS that do not
            exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202 V3.)
        4.3.3.5.2. Alternate Airport Planning. FMs will select alternate airports meeting
        the requirements of AFI 11-202 V3. Choose the nearest suitable alternates that best
        meet mission requirements and conserve fuel. Select alternates that are not restricted
        by FLIP, Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), or diplomatic clearances, and are
        compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the aircraft. For
        alternates more than 75nm from destination, FMs will include the route to the
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                      21


         alternate in the flight plan. This will provide accurate fuel calculations for the
         aircrew.
         4.3.3.5.3. Remote or Island Destination. A remote or island destination is defined
         as any aerodrome, which due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable
         alternate airport (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. When filing to a
         remote or island destination, FMs may use 2+00 holding fuel (in lieu of an alternate).
         The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
         criteria,
             4.3.3.5.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within
             limits at Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) and forecast to remain so for 2 hours
             thereafter, and
             4.3.3.5.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than
             published minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2
             hours. However, if a precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may
             be intermittently below non-precision approach minimums (excluding Airport
             Surveillance Radar (ASR)), but not below precision approach minimums (for
             ETA plus 2 hours).       NOTE: When using holding fuel in lieu of an alternate,
             reserve fuel total is comprised of the following: (45 minutes holding fuel) +
             (1+15 minutes of island/remote destination fuel) + (15 minutes of contingency
             fuel) = 2+15 minutes total holding fuel.
  4.3.4. Computer Flight Plans (CFP). The FM will provide a copy of the CFP and the
  Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) route file in the ADP.
     4.3.4.1. Flight Planning. FMs will use the command approved flight planning software.
     The CFP provides a fuel optimized route. MAJCOM instructions and worldwide
     aeronautical directives will be used to maintain the route segment database used by the
     FMs.
     4.3.4.2. Flight Plans. CFPs are route, altitude, and fuel optimized based on MAJCOM
     approved MDS flight performance modules. CFPs will reflect the optimized solution
     based on the following limitations: payload, diplomatic clearance requirements, en route
     weather, routing to avoid or join established tracks, aircraft performance restrictions,
     threats, intelligence, etc. FMs will modify the stored flight profile in the route database
     as required to meet sortie parameters and then submit request for an optimized CFP.
     Ensure optimized CFP planning factors are accurate and meet sortie requirements.
     4.3.4.3. IAW AMCI 10-202 Volume 6, Mission Management and Reliability Reporting
     System, the Command Post (CP)/Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC) will review sortie
     details to ensure they reflect the most current information and will provide this
     information to the appropriate AOC’s FMs and C2 personnel no later than six hours prior
     to scheduled launch. The primary means of notification will be the MAF C2 system
     followed up by verbal confirmation. The CP/AMCC will inform the appropriate AOC
     immediately of maintenance deviations, revised payloads, or changes of aircraft tail/fleet
     number, to ensure an accurate CFP can be generated and included in the ADP.
  4.3.5. Flight Plan Filing. FMs will create, validate, and submit, a correctly addressed, flight
  plan to the appropriate Air Traffic Service (ATS) agencies including appropriate DoD Base
22                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


  Operations Offices. Only FMs and Airfield Management, in coordination with the AC, have
  the authority to file, amend, or cancel flight plans.
     4.3.5.1. FM coordination is required for any changes to filed ATS flight plans for flight
     managed sorties. In circumstances where operational requirements necessitate a flight
     plan change and prior coordination with the FM is not possible, the PIC may approve a
     flight plan change from an authorized alternative agency (e.g., Airfield Management,
     Automated Flight Service Station, etc.), but must coordinate the change with the FM as
     soon as practical. No other third party may alter a flight plan after an FM submits it to
     ATS.       NOTE: The intent of this restriction is to ensure synchronization between filed
     flight plans and all other flight planning elements (e.g., diplomatic clearances, slot times,
     etc,). Uncoordinated changes to flight plans made by third parties may have serious
     operational implications (e.g. safety of flight, airspace or diplomatic violations, etc).
     4.3.5.2. When feasible, FMs will confirm acceptance of electronically submitted flight
     plans for flight managed sorties by use of manual or automated systems or processes.
     FMs will re-coordinate rejected flight plans with ATS to ensure the flight plan is properly
     on file with all appropriate ATS providers.       NOTE: MAJCOM procedures for filing
     flight plans on non-flight managed sorties will be outlined in the appropriate MAJCOM
     supplement.
  4.3.6. Prepare, Assemble, and Post Aircrew Departure Papers (ADP). FMs will provide
  each aircrew a complete set of ADP on Flight Managed sorties. When there is no
  opportunity or capability for the aircrew to receive an ADP package at the next destination,
  the FM will provide the aircrew with a multiple sortie ADP package. Contents of ADPs, in
  addition to the required information listed below will be defined and approved by MAJCOM
  Standardization/Evaluation.
     4.3.6.1. The ADP will include at a minimum:
         4.3.6.1.1. FM Remarks.
         4.3.6.1.2. A copy of the CFP.
         4.3.6.1.3. A copy of the completed and electronically filed DD Form 1801
         information that complies with appropriate guidance, and an Air Traffic Control
         (ATC) route of flight acknowledgement (if available).
         4.3.6.1.4. A copy of all Air Traffic Service (ATS) messages applicable to the sortie
         to include the latest copy of Organized Track messages, (Example: North Atlantic
         Track (NAT) or Pacific Organized Track (PACOT) messages.
         4.3.6.1.5. NOTAMs. Applicable NOTAMs for intended departure, destination, and
         alternate airfields (i.e…. departure alternate, en route alternate, air refueling
         alternate), and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) NOTAMs as stipulated in AFI 11-
         202 V3.        NOTE: MAJCOMs may modify NOTAM requirements in MAJCOM
         supplement.
         4.3.6.1.6. Weather information. The FM requests the weather package, the Weather
         Forecasters build and post the weather package to the ADP, and then the FM reviews
         the weather before publishing the ADP.             NOTE: MAJCOMs may modify
         weather process in MAJCOM supplement.
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                      23


         4.3.6.1.7. Mission itinerary and information, including leg remarks, and diplomatic
         clearances (if required).
         4.3.6.1.8. Air Refueling (AR) information if applicable (i.e…. receiver/tanker, sortie
         status, AR track weather, AR radio frequencies, etc.)
         4.3.6.1.9. Predictive Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) check
         information if applicable.
  4.3.7. Aircrew Departure Papers Package Transmission. The ADP package will
  normally be distributed to the aircrew by posting an electronic copy to GDSS. The primary
  means for delivering ADPs to aircrews will be thru publishing in GDSS. If the ADP cannot
  be retrieved from GDSS due to system outages or connectivity issues the FM will use
  alternate means, e.g. email or fax. Aircrews will retrieve the ADP package using their
  individual GDSS account or by obtaining it from pre-designated local facilities such as
  Command Post, AMCC or as designated by the local Wing Commander (see paragraph.
  2.4.3).        NOTE 1: MAJCOMs may define alternate methods of transmitting ADP
  packages in the MAJCOM supplement.             NOTE 2: Classified information will not be
  included in ADP or transmitted over communications networks that are not approved for the
  transmission of classified information.
  4.3.8. Electronic Receipt. The PIC or designated representative will provide electronic
  receipt by selecting the ―accept crew papers‖ button in GDSS, email or verbal receipt
  confirmation to the FM signifying that the ADP package was received. Any sortie planning
  or administrative problems will be immediately identified to the FM for resolution.
  4.3.9. Flight Following. FMs will flight follow/monitor their assigned sorties. Flight
  following includes sorties in the pre-departure, en route, and arrival phases of flight. FMs
  will monitor AOC messaging (if equipped) and respond appropriately to aircrew messages.
  FMs will exercise sound judgment to ensure they do not contact aircrews during critical
  phases of flight (i.e. takeoff, air refueling, airdrop, and landing).
     4.3.9.1. Pre-Departure Phase. FMs will brief the PIC using ADP according to
     applicable guidance. The FM’s responsibility is to provide the briefing, explaining key
     planning factors that went into sortie profile determination, highlighting special
     considerations such as force protection, and answering/resolving any questions/concerns
     the PIC may have. The PICs responsibility is to review the ADP and receive a briefing
     from the FM. Should the PIC identify changes required for safety or operational
     requirements, the FM will act to incorporate them. Non-Essential changes identified by
     the PIC will be worked if time permits. If the FM feels a PIC requested change would
     present an unacceptable risk, for safety or operational reasons, the matter will be resolved
     or elevated to the senior C2 individual on duty for resolution.
         4.3.9.1.1. The PIC will contact the FM after reviewing the ADP if time and/or
         circumstances permit. An FM briefing is highly desired. If the PIC requests a
         briefing, the FM will accomplish the briefing.
         4.3.9.1.2. If there are special circumstances that require coordination between the FM
         and the aircrew, the FM briefing is mandatory and the FM will indicate "PRE-
         DEPARTURE FLIGHT MANAGER BRIEFING REQUIRED" in the FM remarks in
         the ADP and add a leg remark to the GDSS Mission Detail.
24                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


         4.3.9.1.3. FMs will monitor changes in key elements of sortie planning with special
         emphasis on risk mitigation and force protection and update ADP as required
         ensuring information provided to aircrews is current.
         4.3.9.1.4. FMs will determine status of tanker(s)/receiver(s) and air refueling timing
         for air refueling sorties.    NOTE: Expect the aircrew to check in with an ―at the
         aircraft‖ free text message and/or a flight plan uplink request. FMs will configure
         GDSS appropriately to send/receive messages and for waypoint reporting on assigned
         AOC equipped aircraft.
     4.3.9.2. En Route Phase. Proactively ―flight follow‖ the sortie from block-out to block-
     in. Flight following consists of actions performed by the FM in sortie execution. They
     include: proactively monitoring sortie progress by remaining aware of aircraft position,
     aircraft systems status, and external factors affecting sortie execution (threats, weather,
     air traffic congestion, etc.); performing predictive analysis of conditions along the sortie
     profile for potential disruptions; and collaborating with appropriate members of the CDM
     Team, ATS, diversion locations (if necessary), and the aircrew to derive best course of
     action when conditions jeopardize sortie success. FMs will notify the aircrew when the
     following occur: the weather goes below approach minimums; there are known ATC
     delays, and mission changes. (These are meant as examples not a complete list.) If the
     sortie executes as originally planned, flight following is principally one of proactive
     observation, assessment, and support for the aircrew’s arrival location preparations.
         4.3.9.2.1. Flight following also consists of monitoring data link message traffic and
         responding to, or ensuring response to, aircrew requests. FMs will respond to all
         appropriate messages with the exception of weather request, which will be answered
         by a weather forecaster. However, if there are no weather hazards to mission
         accomplishment the weather response is automated. The FM should verify the
         weather request is answered.
         4.3.9.2.2. FMs will periodically check destination and alternate airfields weather
         forecast for assigned in-flight aircraft. FMs will notify the aircrew whenever
         destination or alternate airfield weather falls below weather minimums and provide
         viable options (to include revised fuel plan if required).      Exception: USAFE
         FMs will only provide this information to properly equipped aircraft.
         4.3.9.2.3. Forward waiver requests to the C2 element on behalf of the aircrew.
         4.3.9.2.4. Provide support to aircrews requesting assistance to enhance the safe
         recovery of the flight and coordinate actions with appropriate agencies.
     4.3.9.3. Arrival Phase. FMs maintain flight following responsibilities until sortie is
     ―arrived‖ in GDSS. FMs should notify C2 personnel whenever aircraft arrival times are
     not entered into GDSS by 30 minutes after scheduled arrival time.
  4.3.10. Mission Rerouting/Diversions. If an aircraft is rerouted due to an emergency, en
  route or terminal weather, facility problems, threats, or any other safety of flight
  consideration, the FM will be notified as soon as practical. However, for other than safety of
  flight, aircraft will not be rerouted or diverted without 618 AOC (TACC), or 613
  AOC/AMD, or 603 AOC/AMD approval. When rerouting or diversions are directed by the
  618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, or 603 AOC/AMD, the FM will coordinate changes to
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                     25


  the route of flight with the appropriate air traffic control services. MAJCOMs may designate
  alternate rerouting/diversion coordination requirements in the MAJCOM supplement.
     4.3.10.1. If route changes or diversions are determined necessary to accomplish the
     sortie prior to departure, the FM will coordinate with appropriate C2 personnel to initiate
     changes.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

5.1. General. The MAF C2 network consists of the following C2 centers: AOCs (such as the
AMC 618 AOC, PACAF 613 AOC, USAFE 603 AOC), and other geographic AOCs, AMD,
Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air Missions Division, CVAM, Unit
Command Posts, AMCCs, Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Contingency Response
Elements (CRE), Contingency Response Teams (CRT) and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2
centers are action agents for the MAF Commanders with execution authority (operational
control) over mobility missions/forces.
5.2. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. PIC’s are designated for all
flights, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and are vested with the following:
   5.2.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   5.2.2. Authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly events
   authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency condition
   demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air refueling (AR) or
   transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   5.2.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   5.2.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   5.2.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to appropriate C2
   agents. The PIC will use all reasonable means possible to use secure communications when
   passing mission reports in order to protect mission data.
   5.2.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point of contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC’s behalf.
   5.2.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission. PIC is responsible for monitoring
   communications of passengers sent out over unsecure, PIC communications systems. PIC
   will advise users the systems are not secure and should not be used to discuss classified or
   sensitive information.
   5.2.8. Responsible to consult with the FM (if applicable) for sortie planning and execution.
5.3. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   5.3.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required due to insufficient fuel or en route or terminal weather
   conditions.
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                       27


   5.3.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   5.3.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   5.3.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will coordinate
   with the appropriate FM so they can ensure existing and forecast weather for the alternate,
   NOTAM, and airfield information from the GDSS/ ASRR, and predictive RAIM
   requirements are suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, coordinate with
   the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for accepting a suitable
   alternate. A C2 agent will alert Customs and all appropriate ground service agencies to
   prepare for arrival.
5.4. Flight Manager and Pilot in Command Shared Responsibilities.
   5.4.1. Verification of Aircrew and Aircraft Information. The PIC will review the aircrew
   and aircraft sortie/mission information to include other communications capabilities (e.g.
   Iridium phone number), if applicable, for accuracy and coordinate any needed updates with
   the Flight Controller. The Flight Controller is responsible for updating the information and
   will ensure GDSS accurately reflects actual aircrew/aircraft information.
   5.4.2. Verification of Route of Flight. The FM uses current route of flight information
   provided by the Flight Planners to plan the sortie profile. The PIC shares the responsibility
   for route of flight accuracy and coordinates any needed changes with the FM.
   5.4.3. Verification of the Fuel Load. The FM calculates the required ramp fuel load for the
   sortie using the command approved flight planning system programmed with the current
   flight performance data for the appropriate aircraft MDS. The PIC shares responsibility for
   fuel calculation by verifying the required ramp fuel load using command approved flight
   performance data or flight management systems. The PIC coordinates any needed changes
   with the FM.
   5.4.4. Verification of Diplomatic Clearances. FMs will prepare the ADP using the most
   accurate diplomatic clearance information provided to them. The FM uses the current
   diplomatic clearances displayed in GDSS or blanket diplomatic clearances per the Foreign
   Clearance Guide when completing the DD Form 1801. The PIC shares the responsibility for
   current diplomatic clearances by reviewing the CFP and DD Form 1801 and cross checking
   flight planned entry and exit points/times and call signs against the GDSS Mission Detail
   diplomatic clearance data. If changes are needed to the CFP and/or the DD Form 1801, the
   PIC will coordinate the changes with the FM.
   5.4.5. Verification of the Payload. The FM receives planned payload information six hours
   prior to sortie launch. This planning information is used to calculate the flight plan and fuel
   plan. The PIC will review payload information provided in the ADP and coordinate any
   discrepancies greater than 10,000 lbs with the FM. If a significant discrepancy is found
   between the planned payload and the actual payload (one that requires a re-planning of the
   sortie, IAW AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations) the PIC will coordinate with the FM
   for a new flight plan profile and fuel plan.
 28                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


   5.4.6. Verification of GPS Predictive RAIM. The FM will check that RAIM will be
   available on those segments of the filed flight planned route requiring GPS navigation
   (typically airspace or terminal procedures having a Required Navigation Performance (RNP)
   < 5 requirement or MDS specific requirements). The PIC will review the predictive Receiver
   Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) results and coordinate with the Flight Manager
   for any changes to the ADP or sortie based off this information and available aircraft
   equipment.
5.5. Flight Controller Functions. The Flight Controllers are responsible for coordinating
requirements that affect sortie execution. They confirm airframe, hazardous cargo, diplomatic
clearance, and slot time status, coordinate aircrew alert times, monitor aircrew scheduled return
times, and update C2 support systems. See MAJCOM instructions, supplements, and paragraphs
for more specific duties.
5.6. Global Operations Director Functions. Global Operations Directors provide the
important link between individual sorties and the overall mission. They control and manage
MAF missions and are the primary advocates for applicable Combatant Commander
requirements. Global Operations Directors exercise stewardship over all assigned sorties
through completion and perform sortie C2 activities. They are responsible for knowledge of
MAF sortie goals, constraints, and operating procedures and for applying that knowledge to
resolve issues arising under time-sensitive conditions. Global Operations Directors collaborate
with Mission Planners, FMs, Flight Controllers, and other agencies to devise options to avoid or
mitigate disruptions to sortie success. The Global Operations Director will:
   5.6.1. Assume sortie C2 oversight approximately 24 hours prior to scheduled sortie
   departure (except for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions).
       5.6.1.1. Ensure mission/sortie planning information has been completed by appropriate
       CDM agencies.         NOTE: MAJCOMs may supplement this process in MAJCOM
       supplement.
       5.6.1.2. Direct CDM agencies to resolve discrepancies in planning information, as
       required.
       5.6.1.3. Coordinate with other members of the CDM agencies to ensure sorties are re-
       planned, as required.
5.7. 618 AOC (TACC) Air Traffic Management Coordinator (ATMC) Functions. The
ATMC will:
   5.7.1. Advise FMs of preferred routings and airspace sectors to avoid or minimize delays.
   5.7.2. Monitor the Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU) Internet Application (IA)
   system for departures.
   5.7.3. Coordinate with aircrews, through the FM or applicable AMCC, for slot time
   improvements.
5.8. Flight Manager and Flight Controller Division of Duties. The 618 AOC (TACC), 613
AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD are uniquely designed around their sortie requirements and
constraints. Positions within the 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD may
be aligned and named differently, but the CDM Team is core to the success of Flight
Management. The FM and the Flight Controller perform different functions within the CDM
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                        29


Team. In addition to this paragraph, see MAJCOM instructions and supplements for more detail
regarding specific duties for the FM and the Flight Controller.
   5.8.1. Flight Manager. The FM’s work is sortie centric. The focus of the FM is the
   movement of the aircraft from the departure point to the arrival point. The FM creates and
   files flight plans; assembles, publishes, and distributes ADP; briefs aircrews using ADP;
   flight follows the sortie in execution, and acts as the aircrew’s primary source of support in
   sortie execution.
   5.8.2. Flight Controller (1C3). The Flight Controller’s work is mission centric. The focus
   of the Flight Controller is on performing the duties that integrate the individual sorties into
   the larger mission. Specifically, the Flight Controller coordinates sortie information
   internally with 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, or 603 AOC/AMD and externally with
   other agencies including coordination of ground support, administrative support, aircrew
   management, and other duties as described in this AFI, MAJCOM instructions, and
   supplements.
5.9. Originating Mission Setups.
   5.9.1. Normal Procedure. Between six and eight hours prior to sortie departure,
   CP/AMCCs will ensure mission setup information is accurately entered into the MAF C2
   system for each sortie departing their station. If the information has not been loaded, the
   CP/AMCC will inform the responsible agency. The following information is required no
   later than six hours prior to scheduled sortie departure time to be able to calculate a flight
   profile/plan and provide adequate support for the aircrew:
       5.9.1.1. Mission identifier and schedule (not later than 24 hours prior to departure).
       5.9.1.2. PIC name and last four digits of social security number, squadron, wing,
       Scheduled Return Time, call sign, and the breakdown of the aircrew (numbers of officers
       male and female and enlisted male and female).
       5.9.1.3. Aircraft tail/fleet number and aircraft due home date.
       5.9.1.4. Accurate cargo/passenger information including total cargo weight and
       hazardous cargo (type/amount).
   5.9.2. When local input cannot be accomplished due to system outages, C2 personnel will
   immediately contact the 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD with the
   information to be input into GDSS.
5.10. Intelligence Watch Procedures. The Flight Management process must ensure pertinent
intelligence information (i.e…. threat information, terrorist warnings, and force protection
conditions) is considered and reflected in the planning and execution of Flight Managed sorties.
Threat awareness and force protection must be integral to mission/sortie development. Dangers
presented by potentially hostile forces must be acceptably mitigated during both planning and
execution before operations can proceed.
   5.10.1. The FM will assist the CDM Team and advise airborne aircraft of either potential or
   actual threats to operations. Notification will be accomplished via secure means when
   dictated by message security classification. When informed of the need for intelligence
   update, the FM will advise the airborne PIC. See paragraph 4.3.7 NOTE.
 30                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


   5.10.2. Command and Control Directorate personnel will ensure the aircrew is notified of all
   actions to be taken to preclude damage to MAF aircraft or injury to aircrews en route to
   locations designated in the Terrorist Advisories and Intelligence Warnings. They may be
   directed to reroute or divert aircraft to ensure safety of flight. See paragraph 5.2
5.11. Secure Launch Program. Increasing political instability creates situations where MAF
forces may find themselves in life threatening situations during seemingly routine sorties. To
minimize this exposure, the 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD conduct a
Secure Launch control program. After receiving the latest threat assessment, the 618 AOC
(TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD Senior Director will approve/disapprove the
launch into these high threat regions. The decision is entered into the MAF C2 system and
telephonically forwarded to the departure C2 agency or directly to the PIC by the Flight
Controller. The 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD Senior Controller are
the secure launch approval officer.
5.12. Positive Launch Procedures. Positive Launch is used by the 618 AOC (TACC), 613
AOC/AMD, or 603 AOC/AMD to ensure flow control and for other management reasons. When
implemented, departure station C2 agencies will be notified of applicable sorties. One hour prior
to aircrew alert at crew rest locations and one hour prior to departure at en route stops, C2
agencies will call the respective 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD for
alert/launch coordination and approval. The C2 agency will coordinate actions with the
associated FM. Aircrews should be prepared to hold in place at flight duty stations for Positive
Launch approval. The 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD Senior
Controller is the positive launch approval officer.
5.13. Operational C2 Reporting. FMs should be familiar with Operational C2 Reporting as
they may be asked to relay information to the OPCON C2 agency.
   5.13.1. MAF C2 Agency.
       5.13.1.1. Stations with MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
       (arrival, departure, advisory and delay messages) in the MAF C2 system.
       5.13.1.2. Stations without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data to the Operational
       Control (OPCON) and/or Tactical Control (TACON) C2 agency by any means available
       (preference in the following order, Defense Switching Network (DSN), Aircraft
       Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), High Frequency (HF),
       Iridium Phone, AERO-I). For critical C2 communications, i.e…. aircraft waiver request,
       maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method. The PIC will
       use all reasonable means possible to use secure communications (Combat Tracker II
       (CTII) if SPINS directed) when passing mission reports in order to protect mission data.
   5.13.2. En Route Reporting.
       5.13.2.1. Make the following en route calls to 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, or
       603 AOC/AMD:
       5.13.2.2. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
       5.13.2.3. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
       5.13.2.4. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing, to
       update arrival
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                     31


     5.13.2.5. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     5.13.2.6. Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). MAJCOM C2 agencies will
     specify increased reporting procedures through a communications plan in the Operations
     Plan (OPLAN), Operations Order (OPORD), Fragmented Order (FRAG), Mission
     Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the
     communications plan within aircraft equipment capabilities.
  5.13.3. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs and/ or crew chiefs
  shall report aircraft system malfunctions that traditionally require extensive troubleshooting
  as soon as feasible. Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2
  for relay. The PIC will use all reasonable means possible to use secure communications
  when passing mission reports in order to protect mission data.
  5.13.4. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) or Very High
  Frequency (VHF) arrival advisory to the destination C2 agency approximately 30 minutes
  prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks (ETB). 30 minute out calls will release
  the minimum amount of information possible passed using unsecure means. When no
  deviations are being reported, the phrase "As FRAGGED" should be used, with deviations
  using the FRAG as a baseline: "10 minutes later than FRAGGED": "Minus 3 pax from
  FRAG"; etc.
  5.13.5. Flight Management Sorties. The FMs will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. For
  critical C2 communications, voice communications are the primary method. EXCEPTION:
  For AFRC/ANG missions using FMs, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
  5.13.6. Position Reporting on FM Missions. For non-AOC equipped aircraft on missions
  transiting oceanic flight information regions (FIRs) the crew will need to add the phrase
  ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC position reports. Crews may also use the Aeronautical Radio
  Incorporated (ARINC) frequencies listed in Flight Information Handbook Use ARINC phone
  patch only after exhausting normal communication methods.
     5.13.6.1. High Frequency Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the
     worldwide C2 network. This does not apply to AOC equipped aircraft.
     5.13.6.2. The secondary HF radio should be operated in Automatic Link Establishment
     (ALE) mode to support voice contacts between the PIC and MAJCOM C2.
  5.13.7. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and
  Rescue (CSAR), aeromedical evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2
  attention. PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events
  that affect on-time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission
  (ETIC), planned estimated time of departure (ETD), and estimated time of arrival (ETA)
  within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows. The PIC will use all reasonable
  means possible to use secure communications when passing mission reports in order to
  protect mission data.
  5.13.8. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
  cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI
  10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and
 32                                                           AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


   procedures service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian
   law enforcement agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for
   assistance through appropriate C2 channels.
   5.13.9. Air Traffic Control Incident Reports. ATC agencies (Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) or international) may notify FMs of ATC related incidents involving
   AMC aircraft. ATC incidents include, but are not limited to: pilot deviations, Hazardous Air
   Traffic Reports (HATR), airspace violations, altitude deviations, loss of required aircraft
   separation, Gross Navigational Errors (GNE), noise abatement notices, and Communications
   Loss (COMLOSS) reports. For COMLOSS reports on airborne aircraft, ATC may ask FMs
   to attempt to relay an ATC radio frequency to crews using ACARS. FMs will pass all ATC
   incident reports via appropriate channels to AMC/A3AA via e-mail: amc.a3aa@amc.af.mil
   and/or telephone: 229-4496/4557.
5.14. En Route Maintenance Support. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL will support all mobility
aircraft requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance for missions under TACC C2. 613
AOC/AMD will support requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance for mission under 613
AOC/AMD C2.
5.15. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) Team Responsibilities. Flight Managed sorties
are key to an integrated environment that lends itself to CDM. Each MAJCOM’s sortie
requirements result in a unique CDM Team composition. Members listed below represent the
most common functions on the CDM Team. MAJCOMs will document CDM Team
composition and responsibilities in the MAJCOM supplement when different than those listed
below.
   5.15.1. Flight Manager. FMs are the focal point for the preflight planning and execution of
   the sortie. For more detail on FM responsibilities within the CDM Team see paragraph 4.1
   5.15.2. PIC. The PIC is a critical part of the CDM Team.          For more detail on PIC
   responsibilities within the CDM Team see paragraph 5.2
   5.15.3. Weather Functions. The primary purpose of the weather function is to provide
   weather information to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of Flight Managed
   operations. Flight Managed Lead Weather Unit (LWU) designation is documented in
   AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2 , Air and Space Weather Operations - Exploitations, and
   MAJCOM supplements/instructions. The designated LWU serves as the source of weather
   information for sortie flight planning and execution. Weather provides needed functionality
   to the CDM Team through:
      5.15.3.1. Integrating weather into Flight Manager processes. Weather information
      assists the CDM Team to refine routes, select alternates, optimize fuel and payload, and
      enhance maintenance and launch preparation activities.
      5.15.3.2. Providing weather guidance for all phases of sortie planning and execution and
      discussing courses of action to mitigate the effects of weather.
      5.15.3.3. Refining and posting weather briefing packages for the FM to include in the
      ADP.
      5.15.3.4. Responding to PIC requests.
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                    33


     5.15.3.5. Assisting FMs, Mission Planners, and others in predictive analysis of potential
     weather disruptions to the sortie.
     5.15.3.6. Providing en route and airfield weather assessments to Mission Planners (e.g.,
     climatological impacts to operations).
     5.15.3.7. Recommending departure, en route, and arrival alternates based on reported
     and forecast weather conditions. Provide fuel burn information for alternate routing.
     5.15.3.8. Recommending alternate routing and flight levels, based on current and
     forecast weather conditions, to avoid adverse weather.
     5.15.3.9. Providing FMs a weather briefing at the beginning of the duty period tailored to
     areas and sorties assigned.
     5.15.3.10. Maintaining current and accurate weather Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) in GDSS to support FM predictive analysis and mitigation actions. NOTE: These
     requirements are in no way intended to constrain PICs from exercising their inherent
     responsibilities for safety of assigned aircraft both in-flight and on the ground.
  5.15.4. Maintenance Control Functions. The primary function of Maintenance Control is
  to monitor sortie maintenance issues and manage the on-line maintenance repair condition of
  aircraft in execution away from home station. Maintenance Control will also provide needed
  functionality to the Flight Management CDM Team through:
     5.15.4.1. Coordinating with the departure location to ensure the maintenance status of
     the aircraft, if applicable, are provided to the FM and continuously updating maintenance
     information in C2 systems throughout sortie flight planning.
     5.15.4.2. For aircraft operating with system discrepancies, coordinating with MAJCOM
     Stan/Eval to provide logistics information required to obtain waivers and coordinating
     with home station Maintenance Group Commander for necessary downgrade grounding
     Red X items.
     5.15.4.3. Recommending, in conjunction with the departure location, alternative courses
     of action, if degraded aircraft condition prior to takeoff will cause sortie disruption.
     5.15.4.4. Identifying in-system airframe availability and restrictions allowing the 618
     AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD to accommodate short-notice, high-
     priority sortie requirements.
     5.15.4.5. Providing analysis of impact on sortie progress and recommending alternative
     courses of action, when airborne aircraft systems malfunctions are detected and reported
     by the aircrew.
     5.15.4.6. Recommending arrival alternates, if impediments prevent the sortie from
     landing at the planned destination.
     5.15.4.7. Acting as an interface between the departure location and 618 AOC (TACC),
     613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD FM for maintenance issues.
  5.15.5. Flight Planner Functions. The primary duties of a Flight Planner are to administer
  and update the CFP standard route database and create unique or new flight routes for MAF
  sorties. Flight Planners support FMs by coordinating unique sortie requirements with the
34                                                             AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012


  CDM Team and developing CFP routes no later than eight hours prior to scheduled sortie
  departure. See paragraph 4.3.4.2 for more information on CFPs.
  5.15.6. Diplomatic Clearance Functions. The primary duty of the Diplomatic Clearance
  Function is to work with the Mission Planner and Flight Planner to coordinate diplomatic
  clearances for future MAF sorties. The Diplomatic Clearance function also supports the FM
  through coordinating short-notice diplomatic clearance changes and recommendations.
  5.15.7. Intelligence Functions. The primary duties of the Intelligence function are to advise
  the 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD, and 603 AOC/AMD of global security/threat
  conditions that will affect current and future MAF sorties and recommend risk management
  actions. The Intelligence function, in conjunction with the Information Operations Team
  monitors the world threat environment for late-breaking events, reports, etc. which could
  affect successful sortie accomplishment and advises the FM of changes which may affect
  sortie operations. The Intelligence function will:
     5.15.7.1. Provide FMs an intelligence briefing at the beginning of the duty period
     tailored to areas of responsibility and sorties to be flight managed.
     5.15.7.2. Perform Intelligence Preparation of the Battle space assessment for OCONUS
     airfields.
     5.15.7.3. Develop location, route, or mission/sortie-specific threat assessments, as
     required.
     5.15.7.4. Conduct review of threat information for designated Secure Launch locations
     six hours prior to takeoff.
     5.15.7.5. Coordinate with the FM and other members of the CDM Team to ensure they
     are aware of intelligence information and force protection developments which could
     impact sortie planning and execution.
     5.15.7.6. Monitor the world threat environment for late-breaking events, reports, etc. that
     could affect successful mission/sortie accomplishment.
     5.15.7.7. Provide continuous intelligence flight watch and timely threat warning support
     for sorties in execution. Coordinate with theater Intelligence Watch centers to secure
     notification of events, crises, or hostilities that may impact air mobility sorties.
     5.15.7.8. Recommend alternatives when threats pose unacceptable levels of risk or will
     impede sortie progress.
     5.15.7.9. Perform threat assessments to support near real time alternate flight profile and
     arrival location planning.
     5.15.7.10. Collaborate to build the Threat Assessment portion of ADP, when required.
     NOTE: PICs will receive intelligence and tactics briefings at the last stop prior to
     entering a new Area of Responsibility (AOR).
  5.15.8. Mission Planner Functions. Detailed planning is ―key‖ to a successful sortie. The
  goal of mission planning is to translate the user’s validated transportation requirements into
  an executable plan. Threat awareness and force protection must be integral to mission/sortie
  development. Dangers presented by potentially hostile forces must be acceptably mitigated
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                     35


  during both planning and execution before operations can proceed. The responsibility of the
  Mission Planner is to provide a complete mission plan to the FM.
     5.15.8.1. Mission planning is normally accomplished using the Consolidated Air
     Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) and/or GDSS.
     5.15.8.2. Additional mission planning considerations must be taken into account for legs
     transiting an AOR. Threat awareness and force protection are paramount and must
     pervade every aspect of the MAF culture to effectively counter the ever-present and ever-
     changing dangers aircrews face in executing their sorties. Mission Planners will ensure
     the aircrews have the opportunity to receive an appropriate AOR intelligence and tactics
     brief, related Air Tasking Order (ATO) and Airspace Control Order (ACO) products,
     tactical flimsies and communication cards (as appropriate), and SPINS. Mission Planners
     should also contact the appropriate AOC to ensure no additional restrictions or conflicts
     exist that may cause sortie delay or cancellation.
  5.15.9. Information Operations Team (IOT) Functions. The primary duty of the IOT, in
  conjunction with the Intelligence function, is to advise the Flight Manager of any Information
  Operations (IO) event changes that could affect sortie operations. The IOT will support the
  Flight Manger with notifications and recommended Course of Actions (COAs) via the
  Senior/Battle Staff Director of Influence Ops, Network Defense, and Electronic Protection to
  successfully employ information operations and any related mission impacts.

                                          Chapter 6

      FLIGHT MANAGER COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM
                         REQUIREMENTS

6.1. General. The communications requirements detailed in this chapter are the minimum
required to support Flight Management responsibilities.
6.2. Flight Manager Communications/Policy and Requirements. The 618 AOC (TACC),
613 AOC/AMD and 603 AOC/AMD must maintain the capability for rapid, reliable, secure
voice and data communications. The 618 AOC (TACC), 613 AOC/AMD and 603 AOC will be
equipped with the capability to communicate with an aircrew using various secure and non-
secure voice and data communications systems. Secure Internet Protocol Router Network
(SIPRNET) and Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) access will be
available for data communication at the appropriate security level. A non-secure facsimile
(FAX) capability is required to facilitate the transmission/receipt of ADP and information
pertaining to Flight Managed sorties from aircrews and ground support agencies. For Operations
Security reasons, transmission of mission critical information will be accomplished IAW AF and
Command policy. A secure FAX capability is required to facilitate hard copy transfer of
classified data. FMs will have the capability to transmit flight plans to ATS agencies for
electronic filing.
   6.2.1. Voice Communications Policy and Requirements. 618 AOC (TACC), 613
   AOC/AMD and 603 AOC/AMD/AMD must ensure FMs have reliable voice
   communications (including secure telecommunications) required to maintain positive control
   of MAF forces.
   6.2.2. Data Communications Policy and Requirements. 618 AOC (TACC), 613
   AOC/AMD and 603 AOC/AMD must ensure FMs have reliable data communications
   capability with properly equipped MAF aircraft to ensure positive control of MAF forces.
   (i.e…. non secure - AOC messaging, Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting
   System (ACARS), AERO-I; secure - Combat Track II etc.)
6.3. Global Decision Support System. GDSS is the MAF’s primary force/unit-level C2
system. It is used to manage the execution of airlift and air refueling missions. It provides
accurate, near real-time data required for making decisions concerning the deployment and
employment of MAF resources. GDSS interfaces with several C2 systems, including CAMPS,
ACFP, GO81, Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES), United States
Transportation Command’s (USTRANSCOMs), Global Transportation Network (GTNs), and
the ANG’s Airlift Information Reporting System (AIRS).
6.4. GO81 Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance System (CAMS). The GO81 system is a
Maintenance Management Information System used exclusively by AMC and those agencies
that interface with AMC. GO81 is the primary MAF aircraft maintenance scheduling and
monitoring system. The FM can track the maintenance status of an aircraft assigned to a flight-
managed sortie and check for availability of tail numbers. GDSS will have access to GO81 to
support Flight Manager processes. The Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance System (CAMS) is
used by commands other than AMC as it provides maintenance data on theater airlift and air
refueling aircraft.
AFI11-255V3 8 MARCH 2012                                                                       37


6.5. Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP). ACFP provides an optimized solution to
navigational and fuel computations. Flight plans are route, altitude, and fuel optimized based on
forecast winds, temperatures, and planned payload weight. The use of computer flight plans is
essential to electronically file routes of flight.
6.6. Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) Payload Information. Payload
information resides in GATES. The GDSS interface with GATES allows FMs to view
aggregated payload weight, number of passengers and hazardous material details. This
information is a critical element in the FM’s and/or unit mission planner’s fuel load, takeoff
weight, and flight profile planning determinations.
6.7. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). The AFWA data link includes the capability to
populate flight weather briefings, and to view Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF) and
Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR) for any airfield which provides forecasts and/or
observations to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
6.8. Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). NOTAMs
and TFRs are retrieved from the Defense Internet NOTAMs Service (DINS) website. Once
requested NOTAMs are retrieved, they are reviewed for content and applicability and then
posted into the Aircrew Departure Papers.
6.9. Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS). PFPS is a robust, yet compact, common
aviation mission planner. The system consists of PC-based tools to support a broad range of
mission needs and operational environments, including simple day-to-day training proficiency
flights, peace-time operational/exercise sorties, or conventional or nuclear conflict. The system
is capable of supporting planning for air-to-air, air-to-ground, air refueling, electronic combat,
reconnaissance, special operations, conventional gravity weapon releases from high, mid or low
altitudes using a wide variety of release procedures, to airlift and rescue missions.
6.10. Falcon View. Falcon View is a PC based mapping application used by the DoD that is the
graphical part of PFPS. This program allows the graphical presentation of routes of flight. The
FMs use Falcon View to visualize the route to determine the best route of flight.
