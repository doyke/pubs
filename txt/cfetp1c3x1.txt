                    CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN


Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle training and education requirements, training support
resources, and upgrade requirements for Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1C3X1. This CFETP
provides personnel a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field
training. AFRC and ANG career paths will differ from the career paths depicted in this document.

2. This CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors, who plan, manage, and control training within
the career field will use both parts of the plan.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information,
duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level
with specialty qualifications (i.e., knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); Section D
indicates resource constraints (i.e., funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities); and Section E
identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt and all certified controllers.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
includes duties, tasks and technical references to support certification training, position qualification
training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core tasks and wartime
course, and correspondence course requirements. Section B may contain the Course Objective List
(COL) and training standards supervisors use to determine if airmen have satisfied training
requirements; Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification
Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training. These packages
are indexed on the Air Force Publications web site, Numerical Index of Specialized Educational
Training Publications. Section D provides a mandatory and optional training course index
supervisors use to determine resources available to support training. Section E identifies MAJCOM
unique training requirements supervisors use to determine additional training required for the
associated qualification needs. At unit level, the NCOIC of Training, supervisors, and assigned
trainers, will use Part II to conduct and document initial certification and recertification training.
Additionally, they will conduct position qualification training (based on appointment) and
applicable skill level upgrade training commensurate with identified requirements, regardless of
applicability towards certification.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals are trained and certified in this
specialty and receive effective and efficient qualification or skill-level training at the appropriate
points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

                                                 8
Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM FMs
(MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and
conduct an effective career field training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in
this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan
identifies initial skills, upgrade, certification/recertification, duty position qualification, and
proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon
entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.
Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade
training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence
course requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Certification/Recertification
training is a combination of self-study, OJT, and both written and performance examinations used to
certify/recertify controllers in CP operations, mission monitoring/management,
operational/readiness reporting, emergency actions and emergency management. Duty Position
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in
a specific duty position. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.
Proficiency training is recurring training identified by the ATP consisting of self-study, formal
classroom training, and both written and performance training/evaluations. The CFETP has several
purposes, some are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field’s training
program. Also, it will be used to certify/recertify controllers and help CP Managers and supervisors
identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training
delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints, which impact full implementation of the desired career
field training process.

1.5. Used to document controller certification training and pairs with the MTP, Plan of Instruction
(POI).

2. Use. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and
exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the
CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining
resources needed to provide the identified training.




                                                  9
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade,
and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can
satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be
identified for inclusion in the plan.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory skill level training requirements, certification and
position qualification tasks identified in the MTP POI. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as
a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will
initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training
requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

                                                 12
over 48 months time in service or once selected for promotion to SSgt and should continue their off-
duty education toward a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.

5.3. Craftsman (7-Skill Level). Completion of the 1C371 CDCs and all 7-skill level core tasks. A
craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions, and should take courses
or obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel. Continued academic
education through CCAF, completion of the Course 14 and higher degree programs are expected. In
addition, when selected or promoted to TSgt, individuals will attend the Noncommissioned Officer
(NCO) Academy (or by correspondence for ARC) with appropriate Time in Service requirements.

5.4. Superintendent (9-Skill Level). Completion of all formal training and OJT requirements.
MSgts will attend the Senior NCO Academy Resident Course (or by correspondence for ARC). A 9-
skill level can be expected to fill positions such as superintendent and various staff positions/jobs.
Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) management,
resources and personnel management should be pursued through continued education. Completion
of a CCAF degree program is required. Higher education, completion of courses outside of the
career AFSC, and completion of Sister Service equivalent PME are also recommended and
encouraged. Additionally, many SMSgt assignments within the career-field are Joint/COCOM
positions where 1C3s are often the senior AF enlisted person in the unit. Therefore, SMSgt and
SMSgt selects are encouraged to complete, at a minimum, the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional
Military Education (SEJPME) CBT in order to become prepared for these demanding roles.

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the CP career field. The spectrum
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must
be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disorganized/ disjointed
training approach. A Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) for the CP Career Field was held
at Randolph AFB, TX, 02-03 April 2013. The purpose was to review recommendations from the
November 2012 Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) meeting and finalize proposed
changes to the CFETP.

6.1. 3-Skill Level Requirement. Initial/entry level training will be developed and taught by AETC.
Key U&TW decisions added Nuclear Enterprise training, updated training references, and ensured
training focused on current field equipment and systems. AFSC 1C331 is awarded following
successful completion of CP Apprentice Course. The AF Form 2096 is completed at gaining
installation to award 3-level.

6.2. 5-Skill Level Upgrade Requirements. AFSC 1C351 is awarded following successful
completion of 12 months UGT (minimum 9 months UGT for retrainees), all core task items, and
CDC 1C351, CP Journeyman. Unit or mission-specific skills and knowledge are locally determined
and taught. Upon completion of upgrade requirements, supervisors must complete an AF Form
2096.




                                                13
6.3. 7-Skill Level Upgrade Requirements. AFSC 1C371 is awarded following successful
completion of the 7-skill level CDC. Additional requirements include completion of 12 months
UGT and all core task items, and attainment of the grade of SSgt. Individuals in retraining status are
subject to the same requirements and must complete a minimum 6 months in UGT for award of 7-
skill level. However, retrainees require an additional 12 months experience, once they've been
awarded a 7-skill level, before they may hold a CP Ops or Training NCOIC position. Additionally,
retrainees require 36 months experience following the award of the 7-skill level in order to fill a
Superintendent position in the Command Post. Upon completion of upgrade requirements,
supervisors must complete an AF Form 2096.

6.4. Upon promotion to SMSgt, complete the AF Form 2096 to award the 9-skill level.

6.5. Proficiency Training. Proficiency training is recurring training identified by the ATP
consisting of self-study, formal classroom training, and both written and performance
training/evaluations. MAJCOMs may supplement both the STS (with an AF Form 797) and the
MTP with MAJCOM-specific tasks.

7. CCAF. Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training. CCAF provides
the opportunity to obtain an Emergency Management Associate Degree. In addition to the associate
degree program, CCAF offers the following:

7.1. CCAF Occupational Instructor Certification Program. CCAF offers the CCAF Instructor
Certification (CIC) Program for qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level courses at a
CCAF affiliated school. The purpose of the certification is to recognize the instructor's faculty
development training and qualification required to teach a CCAF course and formally acknowledges
the instructor's practical teaching experience.

7.2. Degree Requirements. Successful completion of the criteria below and award of the 5-skill
level will lead to award of an Emergency Management Associate Degree through CCAF for our
AFSC. The CCAF Catalog details the requirements for award of the CCAF degree. A student must
complete all degree requirements before separating, retiring or becoming a commissioned officer.
Obtain additional information on CCAF degrees and requirements through your base education
office, or the CCAF representative. Refer to the CCAF catalog for further information at

Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements

9. Purpose. Skill level training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of task and
knowledge requirements. This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each
skill level in broad, general terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award and
retention of each skill level. The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in
the STS in Part II, Section E of this CFETP. Mandatory training requirements can also be found in
AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training Program, and the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory
(AFECD). The AFECD may be accessed through the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) website at
http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil.

10. Specialty Qualification Requirements.

10.1. Apprentice Training:

10.1.1. Knowledge. Knowledge is mandatory of: Air Force organization and administration; EM
the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Air Force Incident Management System
(AFIMS); C2 data systems and reporting; automated data processing equipment use, capabilities,
and limitations; techniques of presenting data; data collection procedures and summary techniques;
purpose of CP for preparing, executing, and controlling assigned forces; emergency actions and
directives; command weapon systems movement and transfer procedures; encode, decode; and
authorization procedures used by command of assignment.

10.1.2. Education. For entry into this specialty, completion of high school with courses in oral
communications and computer operations is desirable.

10.1.3. Training. For award of the AFSC 1C331, completion of the CP Apprentice Course is
mandatory.

10.1.4. Experience. N/A.

10.1.5. Other. Per the AFECD, the following are mandatory as indicated:

10.1.5.1. For entry into this specialty: Trainees must have a minimum score of 67 General and 55
Administrative on their AFQT.

10.1.5.2. For entry, award, and retention of these AFSCs:

10.1.5.2.1. Continued demonstration of mental and emotional stability.

10.1.5.2.2. Ability to speak English clearly and distinctly as demonstrated by Reading Aloud Test
administered in accordance with AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.




                                                19
10.1.5.3. Specialty requires routine access to Top Secret material or similar environment. For award
and retention of AFSCs 1C3XX, completion of a current Single Scope Background Investigation
(SSBI) according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.

NOTE: Award of the 3-skill level without a completed SSBI is authorized provided an interim Top
Secret clearance has been granted according to AFI 31-501.

10.1.6. Training Sources and Resources. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the
tasks and knowledge provided in the 3-skill level resident course (E3ABR1C331 00CD) located at
Keesler AFB, MS. A list of additional training courses to support education and training is in Part II,
Section C, of this CFETP.

10.1.7. Implementation. Entry into training occurs upon completion of basic military training or
an approved retraining from another AFSC. Basic trainees selected for AFSC 1C3X1 are screened
during basic military training to ensure they meet the minimum requirements for entry and award of
this AFSC. Successful completion of the CP Apprentice Course results in award of the 3-skill level.

10.1.7.1. Personnel cross training into the CP 1C3X1 career field are required to be interviewed by
the CP Superintendent and a Competent Medical Authority (CMA) for the personnel reliability
program (PRP), prior to being approved for cross-training. The CP Superintendent will review the
members current AMS SURF, last five EPRs and conduct a face to face interview. If the CP
Superintendent identifies any potential negative trends or in-eligibility for receiving a top secret
clearance they will non-recommend the individual for cross training. The CMA will review the
member’s records for potentially disqualifying information (PDI). If PDI is found, the member will
not be recommended to cross train into the 1C3 career field.

10.1.7.2. The interview process is critical to maintaining the integrity of the 1C3X1 AFSC. CP
missions differ based on command of assignment and weapons systems employed. Therefore, the
interviewer must consider the person’s ability to meet all career field requirements when deciding
whether to recommend a person for retraining into the 1C3X1 AFSC.

10.1.7.3. If the applicant does not have access to a CP (i.e., deployed/assigned location has no CP),
individuals must be interviewed and recommended for entry into the 1C3X1 AFSC by their 1C3
MFM (telephone interviews are acceptable). All recommendations must be reviewed and approved
by the AFCFM. Final approval/disapproval rests with the AFCFM.

10.2. Journeyman Training:

10.2.1. Knowledge. In addition to the knowledge gained at the apprentice level, the journeyman
should have further knowledge in the areas of mission monitoring; purpose of CP for preparing,

Part II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for 3-skill
level classes beginning on 21 January 2014 and graduating on 11 March 2014. Anticipated
delivery date for 5-level CDC is 11 April 2014: 7-level CDC is 1 May 2014.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References) lists the most common tasks,
knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties at the 3, 5,
and 7-skill level. Tasks identified as “CONTROLLER” in the MTP are the baseline AF-required
tasks that must be trained for controller certification.

2.2. Wartime Tasks, identified by an asterisk (*) to the left of the task statements in column #1,
are tasks identified by the MAJCOM functional managers that must continue to be taught when
the wartime course chart is implemented by HQ AETC. These tasks must be taught when courses
are accelerated in a wartime environment. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be
taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those
career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks. NOTE: All 3-level tasks in
this specialty training standard are considered wartime tasks.

2.3. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by an asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.

2.4. Column 3 (Certification for OJT) provides certification for OJT and is used to record
completion of controller certification/recertification, position qualification, skill level task and
knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
technician qualifications, if available. Task certification is to the “GO” level and must show a
certification or completed date.

2.5. Column 4 (Proficiency Code Used To Indicate Training/Information Provided) identifies
formal training and correspondence course requirements. It also shows the proficiency to be
demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the
career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.

2.6. Qualitative Requirements. This section contains the proficiency code key used to indicate
the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training, career development courses,
and distance learning.

2.7. The STS will serve as the AF Master Task List (MTL) and is used as the job qualification
standard (JQS) for controller certification/recertification according to AFI 10-207, MTP, and AFI
36-2201.




                                                24
Note: At unit level, tasks are trained and qualified to the Go/No Go level. Go means the
individual can perform IAW requirements identified in AFI 10-207, MTP, and applicable
Emergency Actions Procedures (EAP). Graduates of the 3-level resident course are trained to
the level indicated by the codes in column 4 of the STS, as they relate to the proficiency code
key at the front of the STS, NOT to the “Go” level.

2.7.1. Documentation. Accomplished IAW AFI 36-2201, Master Training Plan and AFI 10-
207.

2.7.2. Transcribing from Old Document to CFETP. Accomplished IAW AFI 36-2201.

2.7.3. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available: the supervisor
identifies STS training references the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a
minimum, trainees cover the core tasks listed in the STS. For first time CDC exam failure the
unit commander, with help from the unit education and training manager or base education and
training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine the reason for the failure.
For two-time CDC course exam failures individuals will be removed from career field.

2.7.4. Certification. The STS will serve as the AF MTL and be maintained in the AF Form 623.
As part of the MTP, the STS (MTL) pairs with the ATP, POI, and Performance Standards to
conduct and document controller certification/recertification training, recurring training, skill
level upgrade training, and position qualification training. When required in the current duty
position (e.g. controller, security manager, etc), controllers will be trained to the proficiency level
listed in the POIs and/or performance standards. The proficiency codes in column 4 will only
apply to those tasks (may include core tasks) not required in the current duty position (i.e.
Nuclear Enterprise Tasks or CP Supervision and Program Management Tasks). For example: 7-
level Core Task 5.2.6 (Test Control Procedures) would be opened and trained for individuals in
7-level upgrade. If task 5.2.6 does not represent a task required in the current duty position
(controller vice training manager), then you would evaluate the individual to the “B” subject
knowledge level (identified in STS column 4) for skill level mastery. The MTP POIs will
indicate the baseline AF-required tasks for the “Controller” duty position. Additional controller
duty position tasks, as well as, all other duty position tasks found in the work center (e.g. CRO,
SUPERVISOR, NCOIC, Training, etc.) will be identified in the unit Master CFETP/STS IAW
AFI 36-2201.

2.7.5. Decertification and Recertification. Accomplished IAW AFI 36-2201 and AFI 10-207.

2.8. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Enlisted Promotions
References Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in
their career field, develop Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the Headquarters AETC/A3
Airman Advancement Division. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged
by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.
Questions are based upon study references listed in the EPRRC. Individual responsibilities are in
AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. EPRRC is not applicable to the
AFRC/ANG.


                                                25
3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of
AETC training. A customer service information line (CSIL) has been installed for the
supervisors' convenience. For a quick response to concerns, call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or
fax us at DSN 597-3790, or e-mail us at 81trg-tget@us.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC. OJT will be
provided at the unit/base level (initial/recertification training).

NOTE: All 3-level tasks in this specialty training standard are considered wartime tasks. See paragraph 2.2 for description of wartime
schedule/tasks.
