SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The original instruction
only addressed Survival and Code of Conduct (CoC) Training. In this revision, continuation training was
added to the CoC section and four chapters were added addressing general program information, Person-
nel Recovery (PR) operational support, career field management, and SERE program evaluation and
inspection.
(ACC) Since the first publication of this supplement in June 2007 several areas requiring increased clari-
fication have been identified that impact the entire command. Program elements that will be evaluated
during HQ ACC staff assistance visits are specifically identified. Updated locations are identified to com-
plete or obtain copies of SERE 100 computer based training. Clarification of additional duties assigned to
SERE specialist at unit level is provided to ensure mission accomplishment. The requirement for operat-
ing instructions signed at the Operations Group (OG) commander or equivalent level is spelled out and
basic guidance provided on contents. The process to request additional manpower authorizations to con-
duct code of conduct continuation training is clearly defined and time limits placed on approved requests.
OG commanders are delegated greater authority in relation to identifying Emergency Parachute Training
(EPT) SS-06 instructors. New guidance is provided on currency requirements for EPT and non-interfer-
ence flyers. This new guidance allows OG commanders to designate increased currency requirements for
those personnel that have demonstrated proficiency reducing training requirements. Guidance explaining
the intent of combat survival training is provided to ensure units understand objectives of the training and
methods to meet them. Information provided on Conduct After Capture (CAC) SS-03 brings require-
ments in AFI 16-1301 and MDS specific Vol-1’s in line and reduces confusion. Combat mission ready/
basic mission capable individuals are required to complete CAC every 36 months. New guidance is pro-
vided to increase safety, requiring aircrew members to wear helmets and gloves during emergency para-
chute training and personnel lower device training. Clarification on requirement for SERE specialists to
have a Top Secret clearance and be indoctrinated into Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI/SI-TK)
is provided. Guidance ensures SERE specialists are fully integrated into mission, evasion, and combat
search and rescue planning. Finally, additional clarification is given in Attachment 3, Operational Risk
Management. This guidance clarifies areas that need to be tailored to local environment and training to
increase safety. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.

                                 THE AIR FORCE SERE PROGRAM

1.1. General Issues. This instruction:
   1.1.1. Applies to all MAJCOMs and ANG.
   1.1.2. Defines minimum Code of Conduct Training (CoCT) and Code of Conduct Continuation
   Training (CoCCT) requirements for United States Air Force (USAF) personnel.
   1.1.3. Lists overall Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support responsibilities and defines roles
   and duties of Air Force SERE Specialists (1T000/1T0X1) in support of PR.
   1.1.4. Defines roles and responsibilities for SERE Specialist career field management.
   1.1.5. Defines procedures for evaluating and inspecting key aspects of the Air Force SERE Program.

1.2. Program Explanation:
   1.2.1. This instruction describes the Air Force SERE Program as a function within DoD PR. The Air
   Force SERE program encompasses CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support required to enable
   military, civilian, contractor, and other designated personnel to return to friendly control after isolation
   due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other unforeseen events. The sole purpose of the AF
   SERE Program is to support PR operations through education, training, and operational support activ-
   ities. Specifically, the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL), Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMTEL),
   and applicable Air Force tasks for conducting personnel recovery operations drive SERE Program
   requirements. Doctrinally, the PR continuum is comprised of education and training, mission plan-
   ning, execution, tracking, debriefing, repatriating, and applying applicable lessons learned. The SERE
   Program begins and closes the PR continuum beginning with initial SERE training and culminating
   with repatriation.
   1.2.2. CoCT Goals and Objectives.
       1.2.2.1. The goal of CoCT is to prepare personnel to return with honor, regardless of the circum-
       stances of isolation.
       1.2.2.2. The objective of CoCT is to provide a clear and direct SERE/PR linkage from initial
       through refresher and continuation training, exercises, and combat operations to ensure efficient
       training and effective support occur throughout the member's career.
       1.2.2.3. The Code of Conduct (CoC) is the foundation underpinning the warfighter’s PR/SERE
       preparation and training. AF CoCT programs must prepare USAF personnel for all forms of mod-
       ern contingencies, from wartime to Operations Other Than War (OOTW).
       1.2.2.4. Any event that places any US forces member in a situation where he or she is isolated and
       no longer in friendly control triggers the need for PR. These triggering events can occur through
       hostile enemy actions during OOTW, terrorist actions, or as a result of natural or manmade condi-
       tions. The Air Force SERE Program is an integral part of an organized PR effort among several
       related functions.
       1.2.2.5. AF SERE program must provide the necessary PR information prior to and during con-
       tingency operations to USAF personnel at risk of capture. Isolated personnel increase their chance
6                                                             AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


       of an expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when they are trained to perform
       PR Joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (JTTPs).

     needs as determined by HQ USAF/A3OS, then MAJCOMs and ANG must employ the following
     priority system for determining who receives student-training quotas:
        2.2.2.4.1. First Priority: Rated Officers, Career Enlisted Aviators, SERE specialists, and select
        Special Operations and Ground Combat Forces, e.g., TACP, Combat Weather, Pararescue,
        Combat Control, Combat Aviation Advisor, and other high risk of capture (HRC) personnel as
        approved by HQ USAF/A3OS.
        2.2.2.4.2. Second Priority: Aircrew personnel including all AFSCs whose duties require fly-
        ing and are not considered Career Enlisted Aviators or rated officers.
        2.2.2.4.3. Third Priority: Operational support personnel whose duties require SERE CoCT
        experience to augment SERE CoCCT and PR operational support programs.
        2.2.2.4.4. HQ USAF/A3OS may reprioritize personnel in response to real-world contingen-
        cies and/or constraints.
        2.2.2.4.5. Attendance requests outside these priorities require approval from HQ USAF/
        A3OS.
        2.2.2.4.6. HQ AETC/DOR has the authority to replace any lower priority student with a
        higher priority student for AETC’s formal SERE CoCT courses. All changes will be coordi-
        nated with the affected SERE MFM prior to implementation.
     2.2.2.5. Any unfilled training quotas not sub-allocated 30 days prior to class start date may be uti-
     lized by any authorized attendee. Authorized attendees will request unused allocations through
     their respective SERE MFMs to HQ AETC/DOR.

2.3. Code of Conduct Continuation Training (CoCCT) Program Management:
     2.3.1. CoCCT Intent:
        2.3.1.1. CoCCT is a combination of refresher CoCT and additional theater specific Contingency
        SERE Indoctrination (CSI) training. Frequency and depth of training are based on missions con-
        ducted (and associated perceived threats) of personnel requiring training. MAJCOMs and the
        ANG will tailor curriculum and training to meet minimum requirements levied by this publication
        and IAW combatant command guidance.
        2.3.1.2. CoCCT is designed to ensure personnel maintain critical SERE skills gained at formal
        SERE training courses and to tailor SERE skills for specific aircraft, missions, and deployed loca-
        tions.
        2.3.1.3. (Added-ACC) Equipment used during all CoCCT events will mirror operational equip-
        ment carried aboard assigned MDS to greatest extend possible. Training equipment will be prop-
        erly maintained in accordance with applicable T.O. and instructions.
        2.3.1.4. (Added-ACC) An operating instruction (OI) will be developed detailing how the CoCCT
        program will be conducted. The OI will be coordinated with any agency (e.g. weapons/tactics,
        intelligence, ALS) that assists SERE personnel in providing training to assigned personnel. The
        OI will be approved by the Operations Group (OG) Commander or equivalent and should include,
        at a minimum:
           2.3.1.4.1. (Added-ACC) Training schedule process
           2.3.1.4.2. (Added-ACC) Operational Risk Management
           2.3.1.4.3. (Added-ACC) No-show for training policy
           2.3.1.4.4. (Added-ACC) CoCCT event processes
     2.3.2. CoCCT Instructors:
        2.3.2.1. IAW DoDI 1300.21, the Air Force is "responsible for identifying and qualifying CoC and
        SERE training specialists."
        2.3.2.2. 1T0X1, SERE Specialists are the only Air Force specialty specifically recruited, trained,
        and employed to conduct SERE operations support, CoCT, and CoCCT for the duration of their
        career.
        2.3.2.3. Where SERE specialists aren't assigned, available, or additional manpower is required,
        SERE MFMs in coordination with affected MFMs may authorize other designated personnel to
AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007                                                                     19


     support this requirement. All CoCCT instructors will be qualified and certified IAW SERE train-
     ing plans. The SERE MFM will coordinate MAJCOM specific training requirements for unit level
     CoCCT instructors with the respective MFM(s) for inclusion into their Master JQS/CFETP.
        2.3.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) OG/CC will submit requests for additional manpower to conduct
        CoCCT events to the ACC Combat Search and Rescue Operations Division (HQ ACC/A3B),
        with the exception of Emergency Parachute Training SS-06 covered in paragraph 2.3.2.3.3.
        (Added) Requests will be evaluated on an individual basis and HQ ACC/A3B approval must
        be received prior to additional personnel being authorized to conduct CoCCT events. Individ-
        uals certified to conduct CoCCT will receive an instructor evaluation from the unit SERE spe-
        cialist every 12 months in order to maintain certification. All evaluations will be documented
        on ACC Form 261, Instructor Evaluation Checklist. Any area marked “Weak” on the evalua-
        tion form requires a follow-up evaluation within 30 days. The results of the follow-up evalu-
        ation will be documented in section IV of the original ACC Form 261. Documentation of
        evaluations and certifications will be maintained for duration of certification.
        2.3.2.3.2. (Added-ACC) Approved requests for additional manpower remain in effect for 1
        year from date of approval. If additional manpower is still required to conduct CoCCT events
        request will be re-submitted IAW paragraph 2.3.2.3.1. (Added)
        2.3.2.3.3. (Added-ACC) OG commander or equivalent may identify in writing qualified air-
        crew members certified to conduct CoCCT event SS-06, Emergency Parachute Training.
        Identified individuals must receive initial training and certification from a SERE Specialist
        (1T0X1) prior to certification. Annual evaluations by a SERE specialist are required in order
        to maintain certification. All evaluations will be documented on ACC Form 261. Any area
        marked “Weak” on the evaluation form requires a follow-up evaluation within 30 days. The
        results of the follow-up evaluation will be documented in section IV of the original ACC Form
        261. Documentation of evaluations and certifications will be maintained for duration of certi-
        fication.
     2.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) If SERE Specialists are deploying, leaving no SERE Specialist/CoCCT
     capability at home station, all CoCCT required during the planned duration of the deployment
     should be accomplished prior to departure.
        2.3.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) When base-level SERE Specialists are deployed for more than 30
        days, leaving no SERE Specialist capability at home station, those aircrew remaining at home
        station are automatically granted a waiver for CST, WST, and CAC training events until the
        SERE Specialist returns. EPT will not be waived and must be completed on or before the due
        date by a certified instructor. Aircrew must accomplish all waived training within 60 days of
        the SERE Specialist return to home station.
  2.3.3. Exceptions to Continuation/Refresher Training Events.
     2.3.3.1. If deploying to a location where a CoCCT training capability does not exist, training must
     be accomplished prior to departure.
     2.3.3.2. If deployed to a location where a training capability doesn't exist and the individual
     becomes due CoCCT, training must be accomplished within 60 days of return to home station.
     2.3.3.3. Personnel arriving from permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty (TDY)
     during a period when combat survival or water survival training is not available (i.e., winter
20                                                              AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


        months, pool unavailable) are automatically granted a waiver to this requirement until 60 days fol-
        lowing the first available training date. However, individuals will attend the academic portions of
        training at the earliest opportunity.
        2.3.3.4. (Added-ACC) Personnel newly identified as requiring CST or WST, i.e. newly trained
        Flight Surgeons, and during a period when training is not available are automatically granted a
        waiver to this requirement until 60 days following the first available training date. However, indi-
        viduals will attend the academic portions of training at the earliest opportunity.
        2.3.3.5. (Added-ACC) Individuals scheduled for orientation flights (familiarization/distin-
        guished visitor/incentive), individuals in casual status awaiting pilot training, aerospace physiolo-
        gists, intelligence personnel), Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP), etc., must receive, at
        a minimum, Emergency Parachute Training (if applicable). Training should be tailored to meet the
        needs and knowledge level of the flyer. Training must be provided within 72 hours prior to flight
        and should be accomplished in conjunction with required egress training. If the 72 hours are
        exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished.
        2.3.3.6. (Added-ACC) Individuals authorized recurring flights via non-interference aeronautical
        orders (see AFI 11-401) may be placed on a 365-day currency. Personnel must show proficiency
        in required training prior to being placed on 365-day currency. After showing proficiency during
        a minimum of three SS-06 Emergency Parachute Training sessions, the SERE Specialist (or pri-
        mary CoCCT instructor if SERE Specialists are not assigned) will evaluate/validate the member's
        proficiency and forward a memorandum to the OG commander (or equivalent) recommending the
        member be placed on a 365-day currency. The OG commander (or equivalent) will be the
        approval authority for the 365-day currency.

   and Recovery (E&R), and JP 3-50.21, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (JTTP) for CSAR.
   NOTE: PR operational support was formerly known as Evasion and Recovery (E&R) or Escape and
   Evasion (E&E) and includes duties related to conventional and non-conventional assisted recovery
   (NAR) IAW DoDI 2310.6, Non-Conventional Assisted Recovery in the Department of
   Defense.3.1.1.1. PR operational support programs consist of: all actions taken prior to mission execu-
   tion to equip and facilitate planning for warfighters’ SERE and PR efforts in the event of isolation,
   actions taken after isolation to plan and execute PR, and actions taken after recovery to ensure lessons
   learned are documented and incorporated into TTP.
      3.1.1.1. Unit-level operational support programs are executed by SERE, Intelligence and Aircrew

          debriefings are applied at the tactical level and included in theater briefings during contin-
          gency operations. Additionally, SERE SMEs will ensure repatriation after action/lessons
          learned are included in entry level CoCT and CoCCT.

                       SERE SPECIALIST CAREER FIELD MANAGEMENT

4.1. Other SERE Specialist Missions and Responsibilities. This chapter addresses general mission
employment, training requirements, physical fitness standards, and additional issues not discussed in
other documents such as in the SERE Specialty Description in AFMAN 36-2108, training requirements in
the CFETP, or other AFIs. SERE specialists will be qualified as a worldwide deployable resource capable
of supporting operations in any theater as a SME in support of PR/SERE operations.

4.2. Parachuting Program:
     4.2.1. SERE personnel conduct static line and military free fall (MFF) operations. Sustainability for
     parachute program includes basic, senior and master parachutists, and upgrade to MFF jumpmaster
     throughout the AFSC. SERE specialists will implement and maintain their Personnel Parachute Pro-
     gram IAW AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations. MAJCOMs will establish specific com-
     mand requirements to support aircrew emergency parachuting activities.
        4.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) SERE Specialists will maintain an informal jump record folder (JRF)
        which contains current copies of the following documents: aeronautical orders, AF Form 1042,
        AF Form 797 & 1098, all parachute training and evaluation documents, AF Form 922 and/or
        4323, and formal parachute training diplomas and/or certifications.
     4.2.2. SERE specialist parachutist duty requirements include performing and instructing emergency
     egress, emergency parachute systems, and aircrew emergency parachuting during initial SERE CoCT
     and CoCCT programs. NOTE: As reflected in paragraph 2.3.4.6.4. of this instruction, primary instruc-
     tors for this training will be graduates of a US military parachutist course and freefall experience is
     highly desired.
     4.2.2. (ACC) OG commanders will ensure funds are available for assigned SERE Specialists who are
     jump qualified, to accomplish a minimum of one jump per quarter for each parachute qualification
     (static-line/freefall) held to maintain proficiency and skill progression.
     4.2.3. Advanced parachuting skills may be required for SERE specialist parachutist duties including:
     performance in developmental/operational testing of experimental parachuting systems, aircraft para-
     chutist deployment testing, and emergency egress with associated SERE/aircrew life support equip-
     ment; instructor duties at the Army Military Freefall School; and EPT for PR exercise mission
     accomplishment.
     4.2.4. Advanced skills take years of training that require parachutist skills to be supplemented with
     proficiency training integrated into all MAJCOMs. The goal of proficiency training is to provide
     expertise for advance parachutist experience requirements and to provide a stable force ready for
     advanced parachutist positions.
     4.2.5. HQ AFMC's Test Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB CA provides intentional aircrew
     emergency parachuting qualification training for conducting developmental and operational tests and
     evaluations. The TPP is the center of expertise for aircrew emergency bailout procedures/operations.

4.3. SERE Specialist Qualification Training Program :
AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007                                                                       37


   4.3.1. SERE specialists must perform challenging training and exercise activities and must be mis-
   sion ready for worldwide deployment. Therefore, all personnel must maintain the capability to pro-
   vide SERE training regardless of climatic and environmental conditions. All SERE specialists, 5-skill
   level and higher, will maintain mission ready status by reviewing and performing the following profi-
   ciency/currency requirements using the associated CFETP core task and line items as the baseline for
   refresher training. Method of refresher training accomplishment will be MAJCOM directed:
   4.3.1. (ACC) Multiple refresher training requirements can be combined into one trip or TDY to
   ensure cost effective budgeting, i.e. supporting a Red Flag exercise as an Observer Controller could
   provide credit for both biome (desert) and navigation proficiency requirements.
       4.3.1.1. Land Navigation - Biennial.
       4.3.1.1. (ACC) Navigation proficiency/currency activities will include hands-on performance of
       navigation principles to include travel using a map and compass, GPS, celestial aids, as well as
       night navigation TTPs. Currency: 24 months
       4.3.1.2. Medical - Biennial. Training will include emergency first aid refresher and include per-
       formance of ground search and emergency rough land patient transport and evacuation TTP.
       4.3.1.3. Environmental/Biome - Biennial.
       4.3.1.3. (ACC) Environmental/Biome (Arctic, Desert, Tropics, Temperate or Coastal/Open
       Ocean) proficiency requirements will be maintained by experiencing at least one different envi-
       ronment per biennial event. Training will incorporate various SERE TTPs identified in the 1T0X1
       CFETP for the applicable environment. Currency: 24 months
       4.3.1.4. Conduct after capture guidance for wartime, peacetime governmental, and hostage cap-
       tivity – Biennial, (unless conducting regular duties as an RT instructor). This can be accomplished
       by observing the RT portion of Combat Survival Training, S-V80-A, by monitoring/attending the
       JPRA Joint Resistance Training Instructor Course (JRTIC), or by participating in other similar
       events or courses.
       4.3.1.5. PR JTTP - Biennial. This can be accomplished by deploying for contingency operations,
       performing SERE escort/controller duties in a PR exercise, or through unit level training.
       4.3.1.6. (Added-ACC) ACC SERE Specialists will observe S-V80-A, SERE Training, bienni-
       ally.
       4.3.1.7. (Added-ACC) Proficiency/currency requirements will be tracked on an AF Form 1098
       and maintained in the members AF Form 623 (OJT Training Folder) or informal training folder.
       4.3.1.8. (Added-ACC) SERE Specialists assigned Wing level and below will maintain currency
       in CoCCT events (LAS, WST, CST, CAC, and EPT). At a minimum, currency is maintained by
       conducting each event bi-annually.

4.4. Physical Fitness Test:
   4.4.1. Successful execution of the SERE specialist missions requires a high degree of physical fitness
   beginning with entry level training (S-V81-A) and continuing throughout a member’s career. The
   unique SERE mission requires optimum individual performance in areas of adverse terrain, every
   environmental condition, and airborne operations. These conditions require mental and physical capa-
   bilities be maintained at a high level. Commanders will ensure assigned SERE specialists complete at
38                                                             AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


     least 5 hours of fitness training weekly. Commanders will utilize the following standards to assess and
     maintain overall fitness levels:
     4.4.2. SERE specialists will be assessed annually. The fitness test consists of push-ups, sit-ups,
     pull-ups and 2-mile run. Point values for the events are shown in Table 4.1., Physical Fitness Evalua-
     tion Criteria. A minimum of 210 points is necessary for satisfactory completion. Grading criteria are
     as follows: 520-395 points = Outstanding, 390-280 points=Excellent, 275-210 points=Satisfactory.
     Additionally, an alternate 6-mile ruck march or 800-meter swim may be used in lieu of the 2-mile run.
     Points associated with the 6-mile ruck march and 800-meter swim are outlined within the related para-
     graph. Calisthenics events will be tested, one immediately after the other, with approximately a
     2-minute time rest between events. Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of approximately
     10 minutes is given prior to starting the 2–mile run, 6-mile ruck march or 800-meter swim.
     4.4.2. (ACC) Annual SERE Specialist physical fitness test may be conducted by the unit physical fit-
     ness monitor or anyone in the members chain-of-command. Point calculations for annual SERE Spe-
     cialist physical assessments are completed as follows. Airman completes 55 pushups, 55 sit-ups, 10
     pull-ups and completes his run in 16 minutes. Each of his callisthenic exercises are worth 65 points
     and his run receives 160 points. The calculation of points would be 65+65+65+160=355 total points.

        4.4.2.1. Pull–ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise is executed on a pull–up bar. The individ-
        ual grasps the bar with the palms toward the face about shoulder width apart. This is a two-count
        exercise. The exercise begins in the “dead hang” position. Count one, pull the body directly
        upward until the chin is over the bar. Count two, lower the body until the body is again in the
AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007                                                                         39


     “dead hang” position. Individuals will not swing excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled
     over the bar. Repeat as many times as possible. This exercise is designed to measure strength and
     endurance in the back and biceps muscles.
     4.4.2.2. Sit–ups (time limit: 4 minutes). Start with the back flat on the ground, fingers interlocked
     behind the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Another
     individual will hold the feet during the exercise. This is a two-count exercise. Count one, sit up
     until the back is vertical to the ground. Count two, return to the starting position. There is no
     authorized rest position. If an individual raises buttocks from ground or their fingers are not inter-
     locked behind head during a repetition, the repetition is not counted. This exercise is designed to
     measure strength and endurance in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups.
     4.4.2.3. Push-ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise starts from the front leaning rest position.
     The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together. This is a two-count
     exercise. Count one, flex the elbows, lowering the body until the elbows form a 90-degree angle.
     Count two, raise the body until the elbows are straight and locked. Repeat this exercise as many
     times as possible. Event is stopped if an individual touches a knee to the ground. The only autho-
     rized rest position is the starting position. This exercise is designed to measure the strength and
     endurance of the chest and triceps muscles.
     4.4.2.4. Two-Mile Run. This is performed with running shoes and appropriate athletic attire. This
     event will be performed on flat, level, hard-surfaced terrain. This exercise is designed to measure
     aerobic endurance.
  4.4.3. Substandard Performance. Due to the potential risk to the SERE specialist and those they
  work with, minimum fitness standard must be met in order to control factors associated with ORM.
  SERE specialists who fail to achieve the minimum standard on the SERE physical fitness test (SPFT)
  will satisfactorily complete the entire evaluation within 60 calendar days of the failure. Those who fail
  the rstest should not be considered for worldwide deployment, field operations under adverse condi-
  tions, or airborne duty. A review board will be convened after the second failure.
  4.4.3. (ACC) Units will inform the SERE MFM within seven days if any SERE Specialist fails to sat-
  isfactory complete the AFS physical fitness test.
  4.4.4. Review Board.
     4.4.4.1. The review board will consist of the unit operations officer, SERE MFM, and one senior
     enlisted SERE specialist designated by the SERE MFM.
     4.4.4.2. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a situation and provide an
     impartial judgment.
     4.4.4.3. The review board will determine the circumstances and adequacy of training and submit
     recommendations to the commander for further action. Recommendations may include additional
     supervised training, counseling, or other administrative actions. Board findings will be maintained
     on file for 18 months.
  4.4.5. Temporary Profiles. A member with a temporary profile must take the regular four-event fit-
  ness test after the profile has expired. (Members with temporary profiles of more than 3 months may
  take an alternate test as determined by the commander with input from health-care personnel.) Once
  the profile is lifted, the SERE specialist must be given twice the time of the profile (but not more than
  90 days) to train for the fitness test. For example, if the profile period was 7 days, the SERE specialist
40                                                               AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


     has 14 days to train for the SPFT after the profile period ends. If a normally scheduled SPFT occurs
     during the profile period, the SERE specialist should be given a mandatory make-up date.
     4.4.6. Permanent Profiles. Members who have been given a permanent profile by Air Force health
     professionals will be exempt from the SPFT. In the event that the member is returned to duty with no
     profile, he/she must take the SPFT within 90 days unless otherwise indicated in member's profile.
     4.4.7. Alternate Fitness Events:
        4.4.7.1. An alternate aerobic fitness test event is a 6-mile ruck march in lieu of the 2-mile run. The
        6-mile ruck march will be conducted on flat level terrain with a 40-pound rucksack worn for the
        entire duration of the movement. Successful completion of the 6-mile ruck march with 40-pound
        ruck under the maximum time will be scored at 120 points for the aerobic portion of the fitness
        test.
        4.4.7.2. Additionally, members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim test. The 800-meter
        swim test assesses the aerobic fitness and muscular endurance of the individual. Members may
        elect to perform the 800-meter swim in lieu of the 2-mile run. The standards for the alternate swim
        event are listed in Table 4.2. Satisfactory completion of the alternate swim event will be scored at
        120 points.

                     SERE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND INSPECTION

5.1. Inspection: MAJCOMs will establish comprehensive certification and evaluation programs to
ensure compliance with this AFI and applicable MAJCOM instructions.

5.2. Compliance with the Air Force SERE Program: This will be assessed in three areas: formal ini-
tial CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support programs. These three areas will be evaluated during
MAJCOM Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), MAJCOM specific Inspector General inspections,
MAJCOM Unit Compliance inspections (UCI), functional inspections, or site visits.
   5.2.1. Initial SERE Training Programs.
      5.2.1.1. HQ AETC will report all results of ORI evaluations of courses S-V80-A, S-V84-A,
      S-V86-A, S-V87-A, S-V90-A, and MT-220, to HQ USAF/A3OS. These evaluations will be con-
      ducted at least biennially.
      5.2.1.2. AFSOC/IG will post results of AFSOC ORI evaluations on the AFSOC IG website. Eval-
      uations of AFSOC SOF level-B Courses will be conducted in conjunction with AFSOC’s regu-
      larly scheduled ORI’s.
      5.2.1.3. HQ JPRA, in coordination with HQ USAF/A3OS, will conduct EAI inspections of
      level-B and -C CoCT courses in conjunction with Air Force inspection programs.
          5.2.1.3.1. MAJCOMs will notify HQ USAF/A3OS of pending inspections in which JPRA can
          be integrated for a concurrent EAI inspection.
          5.2.1.3.2. HQ USAF/A3OS will notify JPRA of the pending inspection and coordinate
          JPRA's involvement.
          5.2.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A3OS will obtain the results of evaluations from JPRA.
          5.2.1.3.4. HQ AFMC will report all results of ORI Inspections of USAFSAM Level-B Course
          to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.2. SERE CoCCT Programs.
   5.2.3. SERE MFMs will compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations involving SERE CoCCT
   programs and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.4. SERE Operational Support Programs. MAJCOM SERE functional managers will compile an
   annual report of MAJCOM evaluations of SERE Operational Support Programs and forward to HQ
   USAF/A3OS by 1 February.

5.3. SERE MFM Responsibilities:
   5.3.1. Coordinate SERE specialists augmentation for inspection teams to evaluate training and PR
   operational support programs.
   5.3.1. (ACC) Inspection team augmentees will be 1T0X1s in the rank of TSgt or above.
42                                                                AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


     5.3.2. As a minimum, all CoCCT programs will be reviewed by a SERE specialist (1T071) at least
     biennially for safety processes and overall program effectiveness. This should be incorporated into the
     normal inspection programs when possible, although staff assistance visits are acceptable.
     5.3.3. Ensure PR operational support missions are evaluated by qualified SERE SMEs during
     unit-level Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI)s or equivalent inspections.

5.4. PR Exercises.
     5.4.1. A robust PR exercise program is imperative for preparing the warfighter for prosecution of
     recovery across the spectrum of engagement. A major part of training for the PR process is the spe-
     cific "actions on the objective" or the isolated personnel's role in the overall recovery effort. Currently,
     numerous MAJCOM-directed PR exercises are in place to allow recovery forces to execute critical
     METs of a successful recovery, as well as providing potential isolated personnel with an opportunity
     to practice evasion and recovery skills in a simulated combat environment (e.g., Red Flag, Air Mobil-
     ity Warfare Center CADS, Cope Thunder, and ACC/AFSOC Combat Air Force (CAF) integration
     exercises). These exercises provide planners, aviation and ground recovery forces, as well as potential
     isolated personnel a forum for planning and executing full-spectrum PR TTP. Specifically, the SERE
     role within this process is to provide mission-critical feedback and after action review from the "sur-
     vivor's" perspective.
     5.4.2. Specific SERE responsibilities.
        5.4.2.1. Assists in development of exercise plans (EXPLANs), SPINs, PR CONOPs, etc.
        5.4.2.2. Develops mission plans to include survivor participation, aircraft/team support, logistical
        support requirements, etc.
        5.4.2.3. Performs observer/controller (escort) duties to include data collection, performance feed-
        back, safety, and emergency field medical treatment, as required.
        5.4.2.4. Coordinates and performs airborne operations, as required.
     5.4.3. Incorporating summary of PR exercise lessons learned and after action into both the formal and
     continuation processes is essential to successful PR. MAJCOMs conducting PR exercises will for-
     ward sanitized lessons learned and other PR-related after action items to HQ USAF/A3OS for review
     and distribution to the field. Use the "observation, analysis, and lessons learned" format for collecting
     and disseminating data.
     5.4.3. (ACC) SERE Specialists involved with/supporting PR exercises will provide the SERE MFM
     a detailed trip-report containing any mission-critical feedback, after action reviews, and lessons
     learned within ten duty days following the conclusion of the exercise.
        5.4.3.1. HQ AETC/DOFA will ensure applicable data is incorporated into the formal training pro-
        cess.

     5.4.3.2. MFMs for commands with Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR) person-
     nel and personnel assigned to combat-coded units will ensure appropriate lessons learned are dis-
     tributed to subordinate units for inclusion in continuation/refresher training programs.

                           OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

A3.1. The SERE mission area often places personnel in remote environments and potentially hazardous
situations. Conditions often include austere operating locations, inclement weather, rugged terrain, haz-
ardous life forms, and fixed or rotary-wing operations. While operations within the SERE mission area
are typically objective driven, it is imperative all SERE missions begin with a thorough and comprehen-
sive risk assessment IAW the six step risk management processes outlined in AFI 90-201 and AFPAM
90-202. While it is impractical to identify all potential contingencies during an operation, proper planning
will ensure overall individual safety during high-risk training evolutions. Thorough risk management
must assess the risk, weigh all associated factors, and posture for as many contingencies as possible
within a given operation and ensure the appropriate level of command is involved in the decision making
process to accept residual risk. Regardless of the mission, thorough risk management must include bioen-
vironmental, equipment, communication, location, and medical considerations.
     A3.1.1. Specifically, SERE operations and training activities should include the following:
        A3.1.1.1. Bioenvironmental
            A3.1.1.1.1. Weather
            A3.1.1.1.2. Terrain
            A3.1.1.1.3. Animal life
            A3.1.1.1.4. Plant life
            A3.1.1.1.5. Socio-political
        A3.1.1.2. Equipment
            A3.1.1.2.1. Vehicles
            A3.1.1.2.2. Personal protective
        A3.1.1.3. Communication
            A3.1.1.3.1. Mobile radios
            A3.1.1.3.2. Telephone
            A3.1.1.3.3. Air to ground visual signals
        A3.1.1.4. Assistance required date and time
            A3.1.1.4.1. Rear support element
        A3.1.1.5. Location
        A3.1.1.6. Medical
            A3.1.1.6.1. Minor
            A3.1.1.6.2. Major
            A3.1.1.6.3. Evacuation plans
            A3.1.1.6.4. Location/directions/contact procedures for local emergency care facilities.
AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007                                                                       53


  A3.1.2. Specifically, the SERE Program approach to ORM should include consideration of three
  main areas involved with each factor; "what exists, what is the impact, and what is the plan" for deal-
  ing with each particular factor. Incorporating these areas into unit-level ORM programs will ensure
  overall standardization, reduce instability within the planning processes, and ultimately ensure all
  SERE operations are prosecuted in a safe manner regardless of the operating environment.
  A3.1.3. The following ORM checklists/matrixes may be applied to SERE operations and training
  activities in order to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission. However, it must be under-
  stood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision- making pro-
  cedures: the more complex and potentially hazardous the operation, the more detailed the mission
  planning. Additionally, units are encouraged to develop matrixes specifically tailored to their individ-
  ual operational requirements.
  A3.1.3. (ACC) This tailoring may include specialized vehicle requirements to support emergency
  evacuation such as All Terrain Vehicles (ATV), 4x4 trucks, or ambulances for field training. During
  water operations, personal water craft may be needed for evacuation and safety. In remote locations
  specialized medical support may be required. These are simply examples of some of the consider-
  ations that should be made at local level to ensure the safety of the CoCCT program.
  A3.1.4. Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in “open water” or when uti-
  lizing compressed air, pose a variety of unique risks that must be accounted for. MAJCOMs will
  ensure units develop detailed operating instructions/plans of instruction (OIs/POIs) to ensure overall
  objective accomplishment and risk management. Procedures must include location of decompression
  chambers and chamber access procedures. The following outlines specific SERE Specialist/support
  element requirements when conducting water survival training operations:
     A3.1.4.1. Certified lifeguard.
         A3.1.4.1.1. CPR qualified instructors or support personnel.
     A3.1.4.2. Units are encouraged to conduct training operations in an open water environment.
     Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows:
         A3.1.4.2.1. All participants will be equipped with adequate flotation.
         A3.1.4.2.2. Ensure adequate medical coverage is available.
     A3.1.4.3. Rotary-wing requirements. In addition to environmental factors, medical consider-
     ations, recovery TTP, etc. training for rotary-wing crewmembers will also include “hands-on”
     application of the Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) for assigned aircrews. Addition-
     ally, units are encouraged to utilize the Shallow Water Egress Trainer (SWET) as a method of rein-
     forcing “hard skill” requirements associated with underwater egress. When conducting hands on
     HEED and SWET operations, the OIs/POI will also include the following additional require-
     ments:
         A3.1.4.3.1. SERE Specialists conducting HEED training require a thorough understanding of
         dive physiology. Personnel may receive this training either through basic civilian dive courses,
         military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation training.
         A3.1.4.3.2. To ensure aircrew safety, HEED and/or SWET training must be conducted in a
         controlled environment, i.e., swimming pool. Depth for personnel utilizing the HEED appara-
         tus will not exceed 4 feet.
54                                                            AFI16-1301_ACCSUP_I 23 JUNE 2007


            A3.1.4.3.3. SWET. As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to clear the
            HEED bottle under water using both approved techniques (IAW US Navy HEED video) and
            breath successfully under water, maintain reference point, release, and effectively egress the
            SWET. Participants will be required to demonstrate proficiency with the HEED bottle prior to
            entering the SWET.
     A3.1.5. The matrixes identify basic concepts needed for consideration when conducting water sur-
     vival training. These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected waters.

A3.2. (Added-ACC) Instructor will run operational and safety checklist on the EPT Trainer (Hanging
Harness apparatus) and applicable training aids prior to each EPT class. This inspection will include an
operational check to ensure the EPT device is working properly, as well as a visual inspection of the EPT
apparatus to include all attached hardware and webbing/risers, training harnesses, PLD device and tape,
helmets/visors, masks, and LPUs to ensure safety.

                                  PR KIT/EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE

A4.1. Personnel Recovery Kits (PRK) or equipment, provide High-Risk-of-Capture (HRC) personnel
with essential equipment, tools and items necessary for successful evasion in specific non-permissive
environments. They are designed to supplement/augment AF Issued Survival vest/kits, which are of a glo-
bal nature. They should contain items that support the Combatant Commander's PR plan by including
items that aid in evasion and recovery events and enhance the isolated person's ability to survive and
evade. PRKs should be tailored to specific units and missions when possible.
     A4.1.1. Coordinate unit's PRK requirements through the chain of command to respective SERE
     MFMs prior to acquisition. To ensure unity of effort, uniformity, life cycle, and supportability of kit
     items SERE MFMs will coordinate with theater recovery coordination centers (i.e., JSRC, RCC, Air
     Operations Center (AOC), etc.) to ensure interoperability and feasibility of PRK items into PR JTTP.
     A4.1.2. SERE SMEs are responsible for recommending items, containers, employment methods and
     conducting necessary PRK training events.
     A4.1.3. HRC personnel should employ PRKs during CST events and PR exercises and become famil-
     iar with the items. They must possess a thorough understanding of effective tactics, techniques and
     procedures for their employment, zeroization, destruction, and care and use while under field condi-
     tions.
     A4.1.4. Include PRK items as part of the individuals Evasion Plan of Action. In the event of a recov-
     ery effort, PRK information for missing personnel must be quickly passed by a secure means to the
     servicing recovery center.
     A4.1.5. PRKs should, as a minimum, contain Evasion Charts (EVC), small nighttime signaling

     A4.1.6. Additional PRK items should address the specific needs required for successful evasion in a
     specified area of responsibility (AOR) and enhance the isolated person's ability to navigate, signal,
     hide, survive, and facilitate recovery. PRKs can include global positioning system (GPS) receivers,
     infrared lights, camouflage netting, insulated clothing, large capacity water containers etc. PRK con-
     tents are limited to mission, platform, egress procedures, and need.
     A4.1.7. The specific size and placement of the PRK on personnel should be closely scrutinized. If
     worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats, ensure the PRK does not impose a windblast
     hazard. Contact the local wing safety office and the group Life Support Officer if there is safety con-
     cerns for the PRK. If safety is in doubt, AFMC's Test Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB,
     CA, and the 311th Human Systems Wing, Brooks AFB, TX should evaluate PRKs for impact of emer-
     gency egress procedures.

  1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this document is to outline the training plan for personnel selected to
     augment/support Combat Survival Training. All training outlined in this Training Plan will be
     conducted under the direct supervision of assigned SERE specialists. The assigned SERE Special-
     ist will determine who will be selected to augment training. Personnel selected to teach any por-
     tion of training should be a graduate of S-V80-A, SERE Training when possible. Guidance
     provided by ACC/A3T supersedes the guidance contained in this document.
  2. AUGMENTATION TRAINING PLAN: Attachments outline the steps in certifying selected
     personnel to accomplish both the academic and operational portions of CoCCT.
  3. CERTIFICATION: Once each step is completed in succession the support instructor can be cer-
     tified to perform the selected portion of CoCCT. A copy of attachment 1 along with a completed
     ACC Form 261, Instructor Evaluation Checklist, will be placed in each person’s training records.
     Each person certified on these tasks will need to be reevaluated on an annual basis by the assigned
     SERE Specialist to ensure instructor proficiency and content of instruction. To maintain minimum
     proficiency each support instructor will participate in CoCCT at least once a quarter.
