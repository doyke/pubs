1.1. Board Objectives. The specific objective of the Federal Recognition Examining Board
process is to review the qualifications of officers for appointment, reappointment, or promotion

     1.1.2. Federally recognize promotion of officers for each grade, as officer vacancies occur.
1.2. Board Policies.
     1.2.1. Each candidate for appointment or promotion will be examined without regard to race,
     religion, sex, color, creed, or national origin to determine his/her general, physical, moral,
     and professional fitness for the grade and position for which they are being considered.
     1.2.2. Individuals should not meet a Federal Recognition Examining Board until they have
     met all of the requirements for promotion or appointment IAW Air National Guard

     and as a Reserve of the Air Force Below the Grade of General Officer or ANGI 36-2005,
     Appointment of Officers in the Air National Guard of the United States and as Reserves of
     the Air Force. Any waiver authorized by the preceding instructions must be approved prior
     to holding a Federal Recognition Examining Board.
     1.2.3. Federal Recognition Examining Boards considering candidates for appointment do not
     consider current Air National Guard (ANG) officers, current Regular Air Force officers, or
     current Air Force Reserve officers, unless the officer is changing competitive categories.

  official military record, any information the State Adjutant General concerned may provide
  to the board IAW the provisions of this instruction, and any information about the record
  communicated to the board by individual eligible officers under this instruction. For
  appointment and reappointment, a personal appearance is mandatory, unless waived by the
  Adjutant General. For vacancy promotion to grades below general, a personal appearance is
  at the discretion of the Adjutant General, or NGB/CF for officers serving on a statutory tour.
  Board members in their deliberations may discuss their own personal knowledge and

  is contained in material provided to the board under the provisions of this instruction. The
  board recorder must be present during all board deliberations.
  3.3.2. Board members apply the whole-person concept to assess all factors in the candidate’s
  record that support each candidate’s potential to serve in the appointed grade. Consider the
  following when determining potential for success in the Air National Guard of the United

   qualities, leadership, depth, and breadth of experience, job responsibility, developmental
   education, and specific achievements. Of these factors, job performance is the most
   important.
   3.3.3. The board must also thoroughly review the following:
      3.3.3.1. Physical qualifications. Ensure that the applicant meets fitness standards per Air
      Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905, Fitness Program, and is physically qualified by medical
      authority for world-wide service without limitation IAW AFI 48-123, Medical
      Examinations and Standards.
      3.3.3.2. Moral qualifications. Ensure the candidate meets the high moral and personal
      standards expected of an Air Force officer.
3.4. Communications about Particular Officers. Information about a particular officer may
be communicated to a Federal Recognition Examining Board as follows:
   3.4.1. Personal appearance of candidates before the board:

      is at the discretion of the AMS Commandant.
      3.4.1.3. For vacancy promotion to grades below general, a personal appearance is at the
      discretion of the State Adjutant General, or NGB/CF for officers serving on statutory
      tour.
      3.4.1.4. If at any time during the personal appearance (examination) it is determined by
      the board that the candidate does not meet the minimum eligibility requirements (fully
      qualified) the examination will cease, the candidate will be excused if present, and the
      appointment, reappointment or promotion request will be returned to the Force Support
      Squadron (FSS) with written reasons why the officer is not eligible using the criteria in
      paragraph 3.3 and 3.5.3.2.
      3.4.1.5. Upon completion of the examination, the president of the board will excuse the
      candidate (if present), and the board will then deliberate the candidate’s fitness for
      appointment, reappointment or promotion using the criteria in paragraph 3.3.
   3.4.2. Information in an eligible officer’s official military personnel record provided to the
   board IAW this instruction as listed in paragraphs 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3.
   3.4.3. An eligible officer may send a written communication, to include facsimile, to the
   board to arrive no later than the day before the board convenes, calling attention to any
   matter concerning him/herself which the officer considers important for the board to know.
   3.4.4. Written information that is not part of the official military record of an officer, but
   which the State Adjutant General determines to be substantiated and relevant information
   that might reasonably and materially affect deliberations of the board may be considered. In
   making such a determination, the State Adjutant General’s procedures for identifying
   concerns must ensure that the proposing of such information for consideration applies to all
   eligible officers for the board concerned. Additionally, the State Adjutant General concerned
   must ensure:
ANGI36-2505 26 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   11


      3.4.4.1. The officer is notified in writing that such information will be presented to the
      board.
      3.4.4.2. The officer is provided a copy of the information that will be provided to the
      board.
      3.4.4.3. The officer is afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments on
      that information to the board. If an eligible officer may not have access to the
      information for reasons of national security, the officer shall (to the maximum extent
      possible) be provided with an appropriate summary of the information, prepared by the
      State Adjutant General concerned for that purpose.
      3.4.4.4. Information provided to a board under this paragraph may not be provided to
      subsequent boards unless either:
          3.4.4.4.1. The information is in the official military personnel record, as defined in
          regulation by the SecAF or State statute/regulation concerned, of the officer
          concerned.
          3.4.4.4.2. The State Adjutant General makes a new determination, IAW procedures
          in this paragraph and the officer is again provided the notification and opportunity to
          comment. A board is authorized to request administrative information to amplify or
          clarify the official military records, instructions and information provided to the
          board. If such requests pertain to the non-administrative information regarding an
          individual officer, the rules of paragraph 3.4.3 apply. All requests for additional
          information from the board will be made to or through the personnel representative
          assigned to the board.

   voted, ballots are passed to the recorder to tally. Upon completion of the tally, the recorder
   provides the president the results along with whether or not the vote was unanimous. The
   president will notify any voting member who is eligible to submit a minority report IAW
   paragraph 3.5.5.
   3.5.3. The findings and recommendations of the board will be recorded on the NGB Form

4.2. General Procedures. Under the ANG Federal Recognition program, an officer selected for
promotion to the grade of colonel in the National Guard of his or her state may be recommended
for federal recognition in the Reserve grade of colonel. The officer must be recommended by his
or her immediate commander, approved by the Adjutant General of the State, and found
qualified by the Colonel Federal Recognition Review Board. If found qualified, he/she must
receive approval through the President of the United States, and further, be recommended to and

breadth of experience, job responsibility, developmental education, and specific achievements.
A final vote will then be taken and the majority will be the final result.
4.5. Disclosure of Board. Board votes are internal working papers, exempt from disclosure,
and destroyed as soon as the board proceedings are approved.

                           STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING

Figure A3.1. Statement of Understanding.


  1. I understand that all communications intended to express the views of the Adjutant
  General, the commander of the individual meeting this board, or any other service member
  shall be put in writing, furnished to me and each member of this board, and made a part of
  the board record. Communications regarding the individual being considered by the board
  are expressly forbidden unless unusual circumstance exists that would preclude an officer’s
  performance from being documented in the official record (i.e. sensitive classified
  material, etc.)
  2. I understand that no person may direct that the individual being considered by this
  board be selected or direct the board to fail to select a particular individual.
  3. I understand that if any adverse information is submitted to the board, the Federal
  Recognition Examining Board will not be held pending adjudication of the adverse
  information.
  4. If I cannot, in good conscience, perform my duties as a member of the board without
  prejudice or partiality, it is my duty to request relief by the Chief, National Guard Bureau,
  or the Commandant of the Academy of Military Science, or the State Adjutant General (as
  applicable) or other authority in the state from such duty. I understand that this request
  will be honored. If I believe that the integrity of the board’s proceedings has been
  adversely affected by improper influence of superior military authority, misconduct of the
  board president or a member, or any other reason, it is my duty to request relief from this
  duty from proper authority and to report the basis for my belief to that authority.
  5. If at any time relief from your appointment as a board member, recorder, or advisor is
  warranted, complete the statement below and provide to the personnel representative
  appointed to serve this board. If no relief is sought, complete the statement at the
  conclusion of the board proceedings.
  I do/do not request relief from my appointment as a member of this Federal Recognition
  Examining Board. I have read and will comply with this statement of understanding. I
  do/do not request relief from my appointment as a member of this Federal Recognition
  Examining Board.
