This Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) is the process guide for the US Air Force Risk Management
(AF RM) Process as prescribed by Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8, Environmental,
Safety & Occupational Health Management and Risk Management, and supports the AF RM
requirements and processes outlined under Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-802, Risk
Management. This pamphlet provides the definitions, guidelines, procedures and tools for
integration and execution of RM as a risk reduction process to assist leaders in identifying and
controlling safety and health hazards in making informed decisions. This publication has
application and use for all Air Force units, agencies and personnel (military and civilian), to
include Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG).

This AFPAM is for reference and is not directive in nature. Although interrelated, it does not
address AF RM guidelines, policies, and procedures specifically tied to Acquisition and
Sustainment Life Cycle Management, Anti-terrorism, Integrated Defense RM Process (IDRMP),
Installation Emergency Management (EM) RM. AF RM concerns related to Integrated Life
Cycle Management (ILCM) guidelines, policies, and procedures for the development, review,
approval, or management of systems, subsystems, end-items and services are addressed in AFI
63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, and related publications. All AF
RM issues related to acquisition and test efforts are addressed in AFI 63-101 and will be
coordinated with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ). AF RM
concerns related to Anti-terrorism reside in AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT), (AF/A7S). IDRMP
is addressed in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, (AF/A7S). AF RM concerns related to the
Installation Emergency Management Program reside in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management Program Planning and Operations, (AF/A7C). Additionally, this AFPAM does not
address the risk assessment applied to the Annual Planning and Programming Guidance, the Air
 2                                                                                  AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Force Requirements Oversight Council, and similar strategic-level applications developed by
AF/A9, with the process stakeholders, which link to the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff
(CJCS) Integrated Risk Matrix and the Air Force’s related Risk Criteria. Per Department of
Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.1, DoD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program, this
AFPAM excludes explosive safety covered under Department of Defense (DoD) 6055.9-STD,
DoD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards, fire prevention and protection covered under
DoD Instruction 6055.6, DoD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, and AFI 32-2001,
Fire Emergency Services Program. Specific questions on any of the above topic areas should be
directed to the appropriate subject matter experts and agencies as appropriate.

This AFPAM may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements must be routed to
AFSEC/SEAI for coordination prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field
through Major Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance

Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. All references
to the term “Operational Risk Management” (ORM) have been removed and replaced with the
term “Risk Management” (RM) to emphasize the importance of hazard and risk mitigation and
management in all aspects of the AF, not just Operations. In addition, all references to the term
“Program” have been replaced with the term “Process” to support the premise that RM is a
systemic process and tool to enhance risk mitigation practices for all personnel and across all
functional areas of the AF rather than simply a program to be managed. Several revisions were
made to standardize the AF RM Process with sister service RM processes, terms and
applications. Primary changes include: 1) The 6-Step AF RM Process was modified to a 5-Step
RM Process; 2) The RM principles were modified; 3) The levels of RM were reduced to
“Deliberate” and “Real-Time”; 4) Section H was added on the Real-Time RM (RTRM) Model.

Section A—Key RM Concepts.

1. Introduction: All Air Force (AF) missions, work activities and daily routines (on- and off-
duty) involve some level of risk. These operations/activities require smart decisions and effective
risk assessment and RM to ensure success. Commanders, supervisors and all individuals are
responsible for identifying potential risks and adjusting or compensating appropriately. Risk
decisions must be made at a level of responsibility that corresponds to the degree of risk, taking
into consideration the significance of the mission/activity and the timeliness of the required
decision. Risk should be identified using the same disciplined, organized, and logical thought
processes that govern all other aspects of military endeavors. The aim is to increase
mission/activity success while reducing the risk to personnel and resources to the lowest
practical level in both on- and off-duty environments.
   1.1. RM Definition. RM is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible
   courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action (COA)
   for any given situation. RM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and
   individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through application of a simple,
   systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty

     situations. Appropriate use of RM increases an organization’s and individual’s ability to
     safely and effectively accomplish their mission/activity while preserving lives and precious
     resources.
     1.2. RM is an essential element in on- and off-duty operations/activities. It is a given that
     uncertainty and risk play a part in military operations and can impact off-duty activities under
     various circumstances. Risk is characterized by both the probability and severity of a
     potential failure or loss that may result from exposure to various hazards. Carefully
     determining hazards, analyzing and controlling these hazards and executing a plan
     accounting for these hazards contributes to the success in all on- and off-duty
     operations/activities.
     1.3. RM is not a radical new way of doing business; the AF has applied RM philosophy and
     methods intuitively and experientially for years. The steady decline of on-duty mishap rates
     in recent history for ground, flight, weapons and space can be associated with steady
     improvements in systems via system safety efforts, improved personnel training programs
     and an emphasis on effective and formalized RM efforts across the AF. Although there have
     been great strides in managing risk in on-duty activities, the AF continues to experience
     significant numbers of fatalities in off-duty mishaps. It is essential that the same RM
     principles implemented in military operations are applied in off-duty activities as well. The
     RM process allows greater and more consistent results by utilizing a systematic method to
     analyze and mitigate hazards rather than relying solely on experience. The cornerstone of this
     process is early education of AF personnel in RM principles and tools.
2. Vision: Create an AF RM culture that pervades every on- and off-duty AF activity, while
maintaining a focus on mission readiness.
3. RM Tenets:
     3.1. Risk is inherent in all missions, operations and activities, both on- and off-duty.
     3.2. Risk can be effectively mitigated if understood and appropriate action is taken.
     3.3. All personnel are responsible for utilizing RM concepts, tools and techniques.
     3.4. The RM process outlined herein applies to risk-related decisions when such decisions
     are not governed via separately established requirements/guidelines (i.e., statutes,
     regulations, or DoD/AF policy/guidance that address personnel health and safety or
     environmental matters and dictate particular decisions or outcomes within these
     requirements/guidelines).
4. RM Goals:
     4.1. Enhance mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving assets and safeguarding
     health and welfare.
     4.2. Create an Air Force cultural mindset in which every leader, Airman, and employee is
     trained and motivated to manage risk in all their on- and off-duty activities.
     4.3. Integrate RM into mission and activity planning processes, ensuring decisions are based
     upon risk assessments of the operation/activity.
     4.4. Identify opportunities to increase AF warfighting effectiveness in all environments, and
     ensure success at minimal cost of resources. The RM Process shall be institutionalized and be
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                       7


   an inherent part of all military operations to address safety, occupational and environmental
   health risks.
5. RM Foundations:
   5.1. RM is a comprehensive system for improving individual and organizational
   performance in all functional areas, operations and activities both on- and off-duty.
   5.2. RM must be tailored to meet the unique mission needs and operational requirements of
   each organization and to the personnel within the organization.
   5.3. RM provides the processes and tools to develop and increase awareness and
   understanding of at-risk activities and behavior of personnel both on- and off-duty. These
   processes and tools help create effective risk assessments that identify potential hazards and
   effective strategies to mitigate or eliminate the hazards.
   5.4. Effective RM has the added advantage of not only identifying risks, but can also
   identify areas where opportunities exist to enhance effectiveness. For example: regulatory
   guidance or standard operating procedures may be overly restrictive or inconsistent with
   mission/activity requirements. In this event, a comprehensive risk assessment may be used to
   support solicitation of appropriate level waivers, variances, or changes, but will not in itself
   constitute authority to violate or deviate from any directive, policy, standard, or other
   applicable regulatory guidance.
   5.5. RM does not:
       5.5.1. Inhibit flexibility, initiative, or accountability in any chosen course of action.
       5.5.2. Remove risk altogether or support a “Zero Defect” mindset. RM seeks to provide
       decision makers with the tools and strategies necessary to make the appropriate decision
       for a given set of circumstances.
       5.5.3. Take the place of training, practice, drills, rehearsals, tactics, techniques, and
       procedures associated with a specific event and/or action.
       5.5.4. Override or supersede compliance with federally mandated Department of Defense
       (DoD), OSHA standards, federal environmental cleanup standards, AF standards/criteria,
       or any risk-based statutory and regulatory requirements that apply and dictate the
       outcome of such requirements. The AF does not have authority to grant exemptions and
       waivers for statutory and regulatory requirements that have risk related exposure
       elements or standards. All other waivers, variances, or change requests must be properly
       vetted through appropriate agencies for approval. In addition, the RM does not sanction
       or justify violations of any law.
6. Principles: Four principles govern all actions associated with RM. These continuously
employed principles are applicable before, during and after all on- and off-duty operations and
activities.
   6.1. Accept no unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return
   in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All AF missions and even daily routines
   involve risk. All activities require a basic understanding of hazards and risks as well as
   appropriate controls. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that
   meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest
 8                                                         AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


     acceptable risk. RM provides tools to determine which risk or what level of risk is
     unnecessary. However, effective RM also supports decision makers “accepting necessary
     risk” as required to successfully complete the mission or task. As an example, choosing the
     lowest threat ingress to a target versus the most direct route avoids unnecessary risk. All
     identified benefits should be compared to all identified costs. The process of weighing risks
     against opportunities and benefits helps to maximize unit capability. Even high risk
     endeavors may be undertaken when there is clear knowledge that the sum of the benefits
     exceeds the sum of the costs. Balancing costs and benefits may be subjective and open to
     interpretation, but it is essential to the RM decision-making process. Ultimately, the balance
     will be determined by the appropriate decision authority.
     6.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the appropriate
     level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure of the
     mission must be included in the risk decision process. Although anyone can make a risk
     decision that impacts their personal well being, some risk acceptance decisions must be made
     by an appropriate decision making authority that can effectively allocate resources and
     implement controls to mitigate or eliminate risks associated with an operation/activity.
     Commanders and supervisors at all levels must ensure subordinates know how much risk
     they can accept and when they must elevate the decision to a higher level. Typically, the
     commander, supervisor, or individual responsible for executing the mission or task is:
        6.2.1. Authorized to accept levels of risk typical of the planned operation (i.e., loss of
        mission effectiveness, normal wear and tear on materiel).
        6.2.2. Required to elevate decisions to the next level in the chain of command after it is
        determined that controls available to him/her will not reduce residual risk to an
        acceptable level. Obviously in situations where an individual is making a risk decision for
        themselves, or in an off-duty scenario, the individual must carefully weigh the risk
        decision as there is generally no other decision authority to defer to.
     6.3. Integrate RM into operations, activities and planning at all levels. Integrate RM
     into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This provides the greatest opportunity to
     make well informed risk decisions and implement effective risk controls. To effectively
     apply RM, commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and resources to
     integrate RM principles into planning, operational processes and day-to-day activities. Risk
     assessments of operations and activities are most successful when they are accomplished in
     the normal sequence of events (the pre-planning of a mission or activity) by individuals
     directly involved in the event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. Any amount of pre-
     planning that can be accomplished, even in a time constrained environment, is better than no
     planning at all.
     6.4. Apply the process cyclically and continuously. RM is a continuous process applied
     across the full spectrum of military training and operations, base operations functions, and
     day-to-day activities and events both on- and off-duty. It is a cyclic process that is used to
     continuously identify and assess hazards, develop and implement controls, evaluate outcomes
     and provide feedback to our Airmen to save lives and preserve combat resources.
7. Levels of RM: There are two primary levels of RM (Deliberate & Real-Time) that dictate
the level of effort and scope that should normally be undertaken when evaluating risk(s). Figure
1 depicts the basic relationship of the two levels and how they interact across the strategic (long-
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                        9


term) to tactical (short-term) planning spectrums. The controls/resources and issues shown below
the RM levels are examples of resources and impacts that might apply across the planning and
execution timelines. As the diagram shows, Deliberate and Real-Time RM are interrelated when
making RM decisions; they are separated only at the point where the planning phase transitions
to the execution phase of the mission/activity. A strong, effective RM process involves careful
and Deliberative planning coupled with effective, Real-Time RM. This full spectrum approach
ensures comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission/activity success.

Figure 1. Relationship of RM Levels.




   7.1. Deliberate: Deliberate RM planning refers to pre-mission/activity planning and
   involves the full formal application of the complete 5-Step RM process outlined in paragraph
   15. This process can range from an in-depth planning process involving thorough hazard
   identification (ID), detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal testing, and
   long term tracking of the risks associated with an operation, activity or system, down to
   normal day-to-day operations/ activity planning that utilizes the same 5-Step RM process but
   requires less time and resources to complete. Generally associated with "Deliberate-level"
   planning, Deliberate RM planning is reserved for complex operations/systems, high
   priority/high visibility situations, or in situations where hazards are not well understood.
   Deliberate RM is normally implemented well in advance of the planned system, mission,
   event, or activity and is normally reserved for more complex and riskier efforts (i.e. large
   troop/unit movements, airshow planning, system development, tactics & training curricula
   development, road trips, organized camping/hiking activities, etc.). As the situation,
   operation or activity becomes less complex, familiar and/or closer to execution, Deliberate
   RM planning becomes simplified and the focus shifts to ensuring near-term hazards and
   mitigation strategies are considered. Across the spectrum of Deliberate RM, always include
   the experience, expertise and knowledge of unit personnel to identify known hazards/risks
   and strategies to effectively mitigate risks for the specific mission, activity or task in both on-
   and off-duty situations. Although pre-planning is always desired for any situation, also
   consider how to deal with RM once the execution phase of an activity begins.
   7.2. Real-Time: This level of RM is always associated with RM decisions made in “Real-
   Time” during the “execution” or Tactical phase of training, operations, emergency/crisis
 10                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   response situations, or off-duty activities where there is normally little or no time to conduct
   formal RM planning. It is usually an informal, mental risk assessment that is done “on the
   fly” using basic RM process steps to identify and mitigate hazards in the new or changing
   situation. As time is normally constrained or limited in these situations deliberate application
   of the 5-Step RM Process (see paragraph 15) is impractical. In Real-Time situations it is
   imperative that individuals are able to efficiently and effectively apply RM concepts to
   mitigate risks. To enhance recall of critical RM steps, the AF has adopted an easy to
   remember mnemonic (ABCD) to assist personnel in making sound RM decisions during
   “Real-Time”. Section H provides a description of the AF Real-Time RM (RTRM) process
   that is appropriate during the “execution” of a mission or activity and/or time constrained
   situations.

Section B—The RM Process.

8. Introduction: RM is a continuous process designed to detect, assess, and control risk while
enhancing performance, maximizing combat capabilities and preserving life in both on- and off-
duty situations. RM provides the basic structure for the detection, assessment, and ultimate
sustained control of risk while enhancing performance, maximizing combat capabilities, and
preserving lives and resources. Individuals at all levels identify and control hazards through the
RM process.
9. RM Integration: A key objective of RM is to accomplish the RM process as an integrated
aspect of mainstream on-duty mission and/or off-duty activity processes. When RM is
effectively integrated, it quickly ceases to be consciously identifiable as a separate process. To
effectively apply RM, commanders, supervisors and individuals must dedicate time and
resources to incorporate RM principles into the planning processes. Risks are more easily
assessed and managed in the planning stages of an operation/activity. Integrating RM into
planning as early as possible provides the decision maker the greatest opportunity to control risk.
10. Benefits: RM is a logical process of weighing potential costs of risks versus anticipated
benefits. Benefits are not limited to reduced mishap rates or decreased injuries, but may be seen
as actual increases in efficiency or mission effectiveness. Examples of potential benefits include:
   10.1. A greater level of confidence through prudent risk taking. Old and even risky actions
   may be undertaken when the benefits have been carefully weighed against the probability
   and severity of loss.
   10.2. Improved ability to protect the force with minimal losses. Analysis of current practices
   may reduce risks that are currently accepted.
   10.3. Enhanced decision-making skills. Decisions are based on a reasoned and repeatable
   process instead of relying on intuition.
   10.4. Improved confidence in unit capabilities. Adequate risk analysis provides a clearer
   picture of unit strengths and weaknesses.
11. Acceptability of Risk:
   11.1. Applying RM requires a clear understanding of what constitutes “unnecessary risk,”
   when costs outweigh the benefits. Accepting risk is a function of both risk assessment and
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                11


  RM. Risk acceptance is not as elementary a matter as it may first appear. Several points must
  be kept in mind.
     11.1.1. Some degree of risk is a fundamental reality.
     11.1.2. RM is a process of tradeoffs.
     11.1.3. Quantifying risk alone does not ensure safety.
     11.1.4. Risk is a matter of perspective.
  11.2. Realistically, some risk must be accepted. How much is accepted, or not accepted, is
  the prerogative of the defined decision authority. That decision is affected by many inputs.
  As options are considered and mission/activity planning progresses, it may become evident
  that some of the mission parameters or circumstances are forcing higher risk to successful
  mission/activity completion. From the commander’s/leader’s perspective, modifying planned
  parameters, or COAs may appear to be advantageous when considering the broader
  perspective of overall mission success. When a commander/leader decides to accept risk, the
  decision should be coordinated whenever practical with the affected personnel and
  organizations, and documented so that in the future everyone will know and understand the
  elements of the decision and why it was made. In off-duty applications, this same decision
  process can be applied through effective communication with others. This communication
  may lead to discussion of alternatives or at a minimum awareness of planned activities and
  associated risks with others that can assist if problems arise.
  11.3. General RM guidelines are:
     11.3.1. All human activity involving a technical device or complex process entails some
     element of risk.
     11.3.2. Do not panic at every hazard; there are ways of controlling them.
     11.3.3. Keep problems in proper perspective.
     11.3.4. Weigh risks and make judgments based on knowledge, experience, and
     mission/activity requirements.
     11.3.5. Encourage others to adopt similar RM principles.
     11.3.6. Operations/activities always represent a gamble to some degree; good analysis
     tilts the odds in your favor.
     11.3.7. Hazard analysis and risk assessment do not free us from reliance on good
     judgment, they improve it.
     11.3.8. It is more important to establish clear objectives and parameters for risk
     assessment than to find a “cookbook” approach and procedure.
     11.3.9. There is no “best solution;” there are normally a variety of COAs. Each of these
     COAs may produce some degree of risk reduction.
     11.3.10. Point out the benefits of RM to mission/activity planners; it is more effective
     than correcting specific proposals.
     11.3.11. Complete safety is a condition that seldom can be achieved in a practical
     manner.
 12                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


       11.3.12. There are no “safety problems” in mission/activity planning or design. There are
       only management problems that, if left unresolved, may cause mishaps.
12. RM Responsibilities:
   12.1. Commanders, supervisors, and/or primary activity planner (if off-duty related):
       12.1.1. Are responsible for effective management of risk.
       12.1.2. Select appropriate and effective risk reduction options.
       12.1.3. Accept or reject risk based on the benefit to be derived.
       12.1.4. Train and motivate leaders and supervisors to use RM.
       12.1.5. If not authorized to accept high level risks, elevate to the appropriate level.
   12.2. Staff/activity planners:
       12.2.1. Assess risks and develop RM options.
       12.2.2. Integrate risk controls into plans.
       12.2.3. Identify unnecessary risk controls.
   12.3. Supervisors:
       12.3.1. Personally apply RM processes in day-to-day operations and interaction with
       subordinates to influence and motivate personnel to use effective RM both on- and off-
       duty.
       12.3.2. Consistently apply effective RM concepts and methods to operations/activities
       and tasks.
       12.3.3. Elevate risk issues beyond their control or authority to superiors for resolution.
   12.4. Individuals:
       12.4.1. Understand, accept, and implement RM processes both on- and off-duty.
       12.4.2. Maintain a constant awareness of the changing risks associated with
       operations/activities and tasks and be prepared to manage these changes.
       12.4.3. Make supervisors, team members and others immediately aware of any
       unrealistic risk reduction measures or high risk procedures.
13. Systematic RM: RM is the systematic application of management, engineering principles,
criteria and tools to optimize all aspects of safety within the constraints of mission/activity
effectiveness, time, and cost throughout all mission/activity phases. To apply the systematic RM
process, the composition of hardware, procedures, and people that accomplish the mission or
produce mishaps, must be viewed as a system. To support this concept, there are a couple of
models that can assist individuals when analyzing hazards within the scope of an operation or
activity. Within the joint service community the Mission, Enemy, Terrain & Weather, Troops &
support available, Time available, and Civil considerations (METT-TC) Model provides a
sound basis for evaluating hazards and risks normally associated with military ground operations
and the environment associated with those operations. It is a model that is taught across most of
the service-related leadership schools as a standard when preparing for military operations and is
one that AF personnel should be familiar with. The METT-TC Model provides a systematic
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     13


basis for situation analysis primarily for ground-centric military operations and should be a
considered when addressing RM concerns in deployed locations. The Man, Machine, Media
(environment), Management, and Mission (5-M) Model provides a similar approach as the
METT-TC, but is less specific in regards to its overt military application; it is an excellent Model
for both on- and off-duty RM considerations. Both models will be described in the following
sections; each provides a systematic view of analyzing risk and excellent starting points for
conducting risk assessments across the gamut of on- and off-duty operations and activities.
   13.1. The METT-TC Model. The METT-TC model can be used for conducting a situation
   analysis by breaking it into six general areas: (1) Mission (2) Enemy, (3) Terrain & weather,
   (4) Troops & support available, (5) Time available, (6) Civil considerations.
       13.1.1. Mission: Leaders first analyze the assigned mission. They look at the type of
       mission to be accomplished and consider possible subsequent missions. Certain kinds of
       operations are inherently more dangerous than others. For example, a deliberate frontal
       attack is more likely to expose a unit to losses than would a defense from prepared
       positions. Identifying missions that routinely present greater risk is imperative. Leaders
       also look for hazards associated with complexity of the plan or the impact of operating
       under a fragmentary order.
       13.1.2. Enemy: Commanders look for enemy capabilities that pose significant risk to the
       operation. For example, “What can the enemy do to defeat my operation?”
           13.1.2.1. Common shortfalls that can create risk during operations include failure to:
               13.1.2.1.1. Assess potential advantages to the enemy provided by the battlefield
               environment.
               13.1.2.1.2. Fully assess the enemy’s capabilities.
               13.1.2.1.3. Understand enemy capabilities and friendly vulnerabilities to those
               capabilities.
               13.1.2.1.4. Accurately determine the enemy’s probable COA.
               13.1.2.1.5. Plan and coordinate active ground and aerial reconnaissance activities.
               13.1.2.1.6. Disseminate intelligence about the enemy to all echelons.
               13.1.2.1.7. Identify terrorist threat and capabilities.
           13.1.2.2. Intelligence plays a critical part in identifying hazards associated with the
           presence of an enemy or an adversary. Intelligence Preparation of the Operational
           Environment (IPOE) is a dynamic staff process that continually integrates new
           information and intelligence that ultimately becomes input to the commander’s risk
           assessment process. Intelligence assists in identifying hazards during operations by:
               13.1.2.2.1. Identifying opportunities and constraints the battlefield environment
               offers to enemy and friendly forces.
               13.1.2.2.2. Thoroughly portraying enemy capabilities and vulnerabilities.
               13.1.2.2.3. Collecting     information     on    populations,   governments,     and
               infrastructures.
14                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


     13.1.3. Terrain & weather: Terrain and weather pose great potential hazards to military
     operations. The unit must be familiar with both the terrain and its associated environment
     for a mission to succeed. Basic issues include availability of reliable weather forecasts,
     how long the unit has operated in the environment and climate, and whether the terrain
     has been crossed before.
        13.1.3.1. Terrain. The main military aspects of terrain are observation and fields of
        fire, cover and concealment, obstacles, key terrain, and avenues of approach; these
        may be used to identify and assess hazards impacting friendly forces. Terrain analysis
        includes both map and visual reconnaissance to identify how well the terrain can
        accommodate unit capabilities and mission demands.
            13.1.3.1.1. Observation and fields of fire. Hazards associated with observation
            and fields of fire usually involve when the enemy will be able to engage a friendly
            unit and when the friendly unit’s weapon capabilities allow it to engage the
            enemy effectively.
            13.1.3.1.2. Cover and concealment. Hazards associated with cover and
            concealment are created either by failure to use cover and concealment or by the
            enemy’s use of cover and concealment to protect their assets from observation
            and fire.
            13.1.3.1.3. Obstacles. Hazards associated with obstacles may be caused by
            natural conditions (such as rivers or swamps) or man-made conditions (such as
            minefields or built-up areas).
            13.1.3.1.4. Key terrain. Hazards associated with key terrain result when the
            enemy controls that terrain or denies its use to the friendly forces.
            13.1.3.1.5. Avenues of approach. Hazards associated with avenues of approach
            include conditions in which an avenue of approach impedes deployment of
            friendly combat power or conditions that support deployment of enemy combat
            power.
     13.1.3.2. Weather. To identify weather related hazards, leaders and unit personnel must
     assess the impact on operating systems. Hazards may arise from:
            13.1.3.2.1. Lack of understanding of reliability and accuracy of weather
            forecasting due to the inherent spatial and temporal limitations of weather
            forecasts.
            13.1.3.2.2. Effects of climate and weather on personnel and equipment operation
            and maintenance.
            13.1.3.2.3. Effects of weather on mobility.
     13.1.4. Troops & support available. Leaders analyze the capabilities of available
     friendly troops. Associated hazards impact both individual personnel and the unit. Key
     considerations are level of training, manning levels, the condition and maintenance of
     equipment, morale, availability of supplies and services, and the physical and emotional
     health of personnel. All personnel must be vigilant to the fact that hazards in these areas
     can adversely affect a mission. Even when all tactical considerations point to success,
     mission failure can be caused by:

         13.1.4.1. Hazards associated with physical and emotional health. The health hazards
         depend on a complex set of environmental and operational factors that combine to
         produce “disease and non-battle injuries” as well as combat injuries. Care of troops
         requires long-range projection of logistical and medical needs with close monitoring
         of mission changes that could impact troop support.
         13.1.4.2. Hazards to task organization or units participating in an operation. Hazards
         include poor communication, unfamiliarity with higher headquarters Standard
         Operating Procedures (SOPs), and insufficient combat power to accomplish the
         mission. How long units have worked together under a particular command
         relationship should be considered when identifying hazards.
         13.1.4.3. Hazards associated with long-term missions. Long-term missions include
         peacekeeping, or insurgency/counterinsurgency operations. Hazards associated with
         these missions include the turmoil of personnel turnover, lack of continuity of
         leadership, inexperience, and lack of knowledge of the situation and the unit’s
         operating procedures. Long-term missions can also lead to complacency; units
         conditioned to routine ways of accomplishing the mission fail to see warnings evident
         in the operational environment. An especially insidious hazard is the atrophy of
         critical-skills that results from not performing mission-essential task list related
         missions.
     13.1.5. Time available. The hazard may be insufficient time to plan, prepare, and execute
     operations. Planning time is always at a premium. Leaders routinely apply the one-
     third/two-thirds rule (providing two thirds of time available to subordinates for planning)
     to ensure their subordinate units are given maximum time to plan. Failure to accomplish a
     mission on time can result in shortages of time for subordinate and adjacent units to
     accomplish their missions.
     13.1.6. Civil considerations. Consideration must be given to the influence of man-made
     infrastructure, civilian institutions, and attitudes and activities of the civilian leaders,
     populations, and organizations within an area of operations on the conduct of military
     operations. Rarely are military operations conducted in uninhabited areas. Most of the
     time, units are surrounded by noncombatants. These noncombatants include residents of
     the area of operations, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental
     organizations. Based on information available and their own knowledge and judgment,
     leaders identify civil considerations that affect their mission. Civil considerations are
     analyzed in terms of six factors known by the memory aid “ASCOPE”: Areas,
     Structures, Capabilities, Organizations, People and Events. ASCOPE is a memory aid
     to organize civil considerations in planning. ASCOPE helps to categorize the man-made
     infrastructure, civilian institutions, attitudes, and activities of the civilian population and
     their leaders.
  13.2. The 5-M Model. The 5-M Model (Figure 2) provides a basic framework for
  analyzing systems and determining the relationships between composite elements that work
  together to perform the mission. The 5-M’s are: Man, Media (environment), Machine,
  Management, and Mission. Man, Media and Machine interact to produce a successful
  Mission or, sometimes, an unsuccessful one. The amount of overlap or interaction between
  the individual components is a characteristic of each system and evolves as the system
 16                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   develops. Management provides the procedures and rules governing the interactions between
   the various elements.

Figure 2. 5-M Model.




      13.2.1. Figure 2 is a generalized model of a mission system. There is significant overlap
      between Man, Media, and Machine, because these elements interrelate directly, but the
      critical element is Management because it defines how the other elements interact. When
      a mission/ activity is unsuccessful or a mishap occurs, the system must be analyzed: the
      inputs and interaction between the 5-Ms must be thoroughly reassessed. Management is
      often the controlling factor in mission success or failure. Military safety centers and the
      National Safety Council cite the management processes in as many as 80 percent of
      reported mishaps.
      13.2.2. Successful and unsuccessful missions (mishaps) do not just happen; rather they
      are indicators of how well a system is functioning. The basic causation factors for
      mishaps fall into the same categories as the contributors to successful missions: Man,
      Media, Machine, and Management.
          13.2.2.1. Man. Area of greatest variability and thus the source of the majority of
          risks.
             13.2.2.1.1. Selection: Right person psychologically/physically, proficiency in the
             task/mission, knowledge of procedural guidance, established habit patterns
             (good/bad).
             13.2.2.1.2. Performance: Awareness, perceptions, task saturation, distraction,
             channelized attention, stress, peer pressure, confidence, insight, adaptive skills,
             pressure/workload, fatigue (physical, motivational, sleep deprivation, circadian
             rhythm).
             13.2.2.1.3. Personal Factors: Expectancies, job satisfaction, values,
             families/friends, command/control, discipline (internal and external), perceived
             pressure (over tasking) and communication skills.
          13.2.2.2. Media. External, largely environmental forces.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      17


               13.2.2.2.1. Climatic: Ceiling (cloud cover), visibility, temperature, humidity,
               wind, precipitation.
               13.2.2.2.2. Operational: Terrain, wildlife, vegetation, man-made obstructions,
               daylight, darkness.
               13.2.2.2.3. Hygienic: Ventilation/air quality, noise/vibration, dust, contaminants.
               13.2.2.2.4. Vehicular/Pedestrian: Pavement, gravel, dirt, ice, mud, dust, snow,
               sand, hills, curves.
           13.2.2.3. Machine. Used as intended, limitations, interface with man.
               13.2.2.3.1. Design: Engineering reliability and performance, ergonomics.
               13.2.2.3.2. Maintenance: Availability of time, tools, and parts, ease of access.
               13.2.2.3.3. Logistics: Supply, upkeep, repair.
               13.2.2.3.4. Tech data: Clear, accurate, useable, and available.
           13.2.2.4. Management. Directs the process by defining Standards, Procedures, and
           Controls. Be aware that while management provides procedures and rules to govern
           interactions, it cannot completely control the system elements; i.e., weather is not
           under management control & individual decisions affect off-duty personnel much
           more than management policies.
               13.2.2.4.1. Standards: Doctrine statements, policy, and directives.
               13.2.2.4.2. Procedures: Checklists, work cards, Technical Orders (T.O.’s), multi-
               command manuals, AF Instructions (AFIs), etc.
               13.2.2.4.3. Controls: Crew rest, altitude/airspeed/speed limits, restrictions,
               training rules/ limitations, rules of engagement (ROE), lawful orders.
           13.2.2.5. Mission/Activity. The desired outcome.
               13.2.2.5.1. Objectives: Complexity understood, well defined, obtainable.
               13.2.2.5.2. Results of the interactions of Man, Media, Machine, & Management.
14. Applying Opportunity-Risk and Training Realism Procedures: Just as every
organization should be targeting its more important risk issues, it should also be systematically
targeting risk barriers to expanded operational capabilities and increased training realism. All
important organizational missions should be analyzed to determine the risk barriers to expanded
capabilities. Procedures should be in place to use the tools of RM to break through these barriers.
As a general rule, about half the effort expended on RM should be directed toward using RM to
expand operational capabilities and effectiveness. The other half is directed at reducing various
types of risk.
15. The 5-Step RM Process: RM is a continuous, systematic decision-making tool consisting
of five primary steps that define the formal RM process associated with Deliberative RM
considerations. The following is a description of the 5-step RM process. Figure 3 shows the
standardized AF RM process “wheel” and associated steps.
 18                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 3. AF Standardized 5-Step RM Process.




   15.1. Step 1: Identify the Hazards. This step is used to identify hazards within an
   operation/activity. A hazard can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause
   mission degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or
   property. Experience, common sense, and specific RM tools help identify real or potential
   hazards.
   15.2. Step 2: Assess the Hazards. Risk is the probability and severity of loss from
   exposure to the hazard. The assessment step is the application of quantitative or qualitative
   measures to determine the level of risk associated with a specific hazard. This process
   defines the probability and severity of a mishap that could result from the hazard based upon
   the exposure of personnel or assets to that hazard. Rank the risks in terms of overall impact,
   addressing the highest risks with the most impact to the operation/activity first.
   15.3. Step 3: Develop Controls and Make Decisions. Investigate specific strategies and
   tools that reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the risk. Effective control measures reduce or
   eliminate one of the three components (probability, severity, or exposure) of risk. Decision
   makers at the appropriate level choose the best control or combination of controls based on
   the analysis of overall costs and benefits.
   15.4. Step 4: Implement Controls. Once risk control strategies have been selected, an
   implementation strategy needs to be developed and then applied by management and the
   work force. Implementation requires commitment of time and resources.
   15.5. Step 5: Supervise & Evaluate. RM is a process that continues throughout the
   lifecycle of the system, mission, or activity. Leaders, supervisors and individuals at every
   level must fulfill their respective roles in assuring controls are sustained over time. Once
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   19


   controls are in place, the processes must be periodically reevaluated to ensure their
   effectiveness. If they are found to be inadequate or circumstances have changed that alter the
   effectiveness of the control measure(s) then the process is repeated to find a more effective
   RM strategy.
16. How to use the 5-Step RM Process Model: To get maximum benefit from this powerful
tool, there are several factors to keep in mind:
   16.1. Apply the Steps in Sequence. Each of the steps is a building block for the next step. It
   is important to complete each step, however briefly, before proceeding to the next step. For
   example, if the hazard ID step is interrupted to focus on control of a particular hazard before
   the ID step is complete, other more important hazards may be overlooked and the RM
   process may be distorted. Until the hazard ID step is complete, it is not possible to properly
   prioritize risk control efforts.
   16.2. Maintain Balance in the Process. All five steps are important. If an hour is available to
   apply the RM process, it is important not to lose sight of the total process. Spending 50
   minutes of the hour on hazard ID may not leave enough time to effectively apply the other
   four steps of the process. The result is sub-optimal RM. Of course, it would be simplistic to
   rigidly insist that each of the five steps gets 12 minutes. The idea is to assess the time and
   resources available for RM activities and allocate them to the five steps in a manner most
   likely to produce the best overall result.
   16.3. Apply the Process as a Cycle. Notice that the “Supervise & Evaluate” step feeds back
   into the first step. It is this cyclic characteristic that generates the continuous improvement
   characteristics of the RM process. When the “Supervise and Evaluate” step establishes that
   some risks have been significantly reduced, the hazard ID step is reapplied to find new
   hazard targets. In this way, the RM process is continually reevaluating the risks.
   16.4. Fully Involve Affected Personnel. The only way to ensure the RM process is
   supportive is to provide for the full involvement of the personnel actually exposed to the
   risks. Take the time to periodically revalidate RM procedures and assure that they are
   mission supportive and viewed positively by the personnel involved in the mission or
   activity.
   16.5. Document the Process. In all Deliberative RM planning, the process should be
   documented to ensure there is a record of the considered hazards and mitigation strategies
   applied against the hazards. This documentation provides a basis for future reviews of the
   operation/activity to ensure the risk mitigation strategies remain effective and as a reference
   for others who plan to conduct similar activities.
   16.6. Sections C-D provide a more comprehensive explanation of the steps associated with
   the formal 5-Step RM Process. Attachments 8 and 9 provide practical application of the risk
   assessment process and an example of the AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment
   Worksheet, to assist in applying the Deliberative steps of the RM process.

Section C—Step 1—Identify Hazards.

17. Introduction: Hazard ID is the foundation of the entire RM process. Obviously, if a hazard
is not identified it cannot be controlled. The effort expended in accurately identifying hazards
 20                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


has a significant impact on the total RM process. Figure 4 depicts the actions necessary to
complete this step.
   17.1. Identify hazards associated with these three categories:
       17.1.1. Mission Degradation.
       17.1.2. Personal Injury or Death.
       17.1.3. Property Damage.

Figure 4. Actions for Step 1—Identify Hazards.




18. Action 1—Mission/Task Analysis: The 5-M’s are examined. This is accomplished first by
reviewing current planning documents and other available resources associated with the
operation/activity mission. The commander or decision maker defines requirements and
conditions to accomplish the tasks. Construct a list or chart depicting the major phases of the
operation or steps in the job process, normally in time sequence. Break the operation down into
’bite size’ chunks. Hazard ID Tools, Details and Examples can be found in Attachment 2; the
following tools are commonly used to perform mission/task analysis:
   18.1. Operations Analysis (OA)/Flow Diagram (simple).
   18.2. Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) (simple).
   18.3. Multilinear Events Sequence (MES) (complex).
19. Action 2—List Hazards: Hazards, and factors that could generate hazards, are identified
based on the deficiency to be corrected and the definition of the mission and system
requirements. The output of the ID phase is a listing of inherent hazards or adverse conditions
and the mishaps which could result. Examples of inherent hazards in any one of the elements
include fire, explosion, collision with ground, wind, or electrocution. The analysis must also
search for factors that can lead to hazards such as alertness, ambiguity, or escape route. In
addition to a hazard list for the elements above, interfaces between or among these elements
should be investigated for hazards. An Airman required to make critical and delicate adjustment
to an aircraft on a cold, dark night, handling of an air-to-air missile with missile-handling
equipment, or frost-bite would be examples of the “interface hazards.” Make a list of the hazards
associated with each phase of the operation or step in the job process. Stay focused on the
specific steps in the operation being analyzed. Hazards should be tracked on paper or in a
computer spreadsheet/database system to organize ideas and serve as a record of the analysis for
future use. Tools that help list hazards are:
   19.1. PHA.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    21


   19.2. “What if” Tool.
   19.3. Scenario Process Tool.
   19.4. Logic Diagram.
   19.5. Change Analysis Tool.
   19.6. Opportunity Assessment.
   19.7. Training Realism Assessment.
20. Action 3—List Causes: Make a list of the causes associated with each hazard identified in
the hazard list. A hazard may have multiple causes related to areas highlighted within the METT-
TC or 5-M Models. In each case, try to identify the root cause (the first link in the chain of
events leading to mission degradation, personnel injury, death, or property damage). Risk
controls can be effectively applied to root causes. Causes should be annotated with the associated
hazards in the same paper or computer record mentioned in the previous action. The same tools
for Action 2 can be used here.
21. Deliberate Tools: If time and resources permit and additional hazard information is
required, use deliberate hazard analysis tools. These are normally used for medium and long term
planning, complex operations/activities, or operations/activities in which the hazards are not well
understood.
   21.1. The first step of in-depth analysis should be to examine available historical and hazard
   information regarding the operation and any associated mishap information associated with
   similar operations/activities (if available). Suggested tools are:
       21.1.1. The mission mishap analysis.
       21.1.2. Cause and effect diagrams.
   21.2. The following tools are particularly useful for complex, coordinated
   operations/activities in which multiple units, participants, and system components and
   simultaneous events are involved:
       21.2.1. MES.
       21.2.2. Interface analysis.
       21.2.3. Failure mode and effect analysis.
   21.3. The following tools are particularly useful for analyzing the hazards associated with
   physical position and movement of assets:
       21.3.1. Mapping tool.
       21.3.2. Energy trace and barrier analysis.
       21.3.3. Interface analysis.
22. Tool Selection and Other Resources: It is impractical for the AF to create detailed
procedures to ensure the “right” tools are utilized for every activity and every contingency. On
the other hand, choosing the best tools is important when planning to undertake a potentially
hazardous operation. Most of the tools mentioned can be used in a variety of creative ways.
 22                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   22.1. Attachment 2 lists and describes a variety of Hazard ID tools that may be useful in
   various situations. The most frequently used of these tools are depicted in Figure 5. These
   tools are normally used in the sequence indicated, however it is important for the user to
   become familiar with them and choose the best combination for a particular situation.

Figure 5. Seven Primary Hazard ID Tools.




   22.2. There are many additional tools that can help identify hazards. One of the best is
   through a group process involving representatives directly from the workplace. Most people
   want to talk about their jobs; therefore a simple brainstorming process with a facilitator is
   often very productive. The following is a partial list of other sources of hazard ID
   information:
      22.2.1. Mishap Reports: These can come from within the organization, from tenants,
      within the chain of command, from outside the chain (other bases, wings, MAJCOMs,
      etc.), other services, DoD agencies, etc. Obviously, a “missionized” ID is the best, for it
      represents corporate memory applicable to the local workplace, flight deck, mission, etc.
      Other sources might be medical reports, maintenance records, and fire and police reports.
      22.2.2. Unit Personnel: Relevant experience is arguably the best source of hazard ID.
      Reinventing the wheel each time an operation/activity is proposed is neither desired nor
      efficient. Seek out personnel that have participated in similar operations/activities and
      solicit their input; there is no substitute for experience and no better way to ensure the
      operation or activity has the best chance for success.
      22.2.3. Outside Experts: Look to those outside your organization for expert opinions or
      advice. Possible sources of help include Safety, Quality Assurance, manufacturers,
      depots, other bases, activity experts/instructors etc.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      23


       22.2.4. Current Guidance: A wealth of relevant direction can always be found in the
       guidance that governs operations and activities. Consider regulations, operating
       instructions, checklists, briefing guides, syllabi, Flight Crew Information Files (FCIFs),
       SOPs, Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs), policy letters, etc.
       22.2.5. Evaluation and inspection reports: Functional and Inspector General (IG) visits
       provide important feedback and written documentation on local process management. In
       non-military or off-duty settings, seek out this information where able and appropriate to
       ensure equipment and facilities are properly maintained and safe for use.
       22.2.6. Surveys: These can be unit generated. Target an audience and ask some very
       simple questions related to such topics as: What will your next mishap be? Who will
       have it? What task will cause it? When will it happen? The survey can be a powerful tool
       because it pinpoints people in the workplace with firsthand knowledge of the job. Often,
       first line supervisors in the same workplace do not have as good an understanding of risk
       associated with a particular procedure/operation as those who confront it every day.
       22.2.7. Inspections: Inspections can consist of spot checks, walkthroughs, checklist
       inspections, site surveys, and mandatory inspections. Utilize people in the workplace to
       provide input beyond the standard third-party inspection. When conducting activities off-
       duty or outside a normal work environment, take the time to inspect the area, familiarize
       yourself with your surroundings; try to identify potential hazards and risks.

Section D—Step 2—Assess Hazards.

23. Introduction: Hazard assessment is the process which associates “hazards” with “risks”.
When various hazards are identified that may impact a mission/activity, and an estimate of how
likely the hazards are to occur are made, then the hazard is formally defined as a risk. The second
aspect of risk assessment is the ranking of risks into a priority order. Figure 6 depicts the actions
necessary to complete this step. The number one risk is the one with the greatest potential impact
on the mission/activity. The last risk is the least risky issue that still may deserve some attention
and possible risk control action. Keep in mind that this priority listing is intended to be used as a
guide to the relative priority of the risks involved and not necessarily an absolute order to be
followed. There may be, as an example, something that is not a terribly significant risk that is
extremely simple to control.

Figure 6. Actions for Step 2—Assess Hazards.




24. The Components of Risk: There are three key aspects of risk: Probability, Severity, and
Exposure.
 24                                                         AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   24.1. Probability is the estimate of the likelihood that a hazard will cause a loss. Some
   hazards produce losses frequently, others almost never do.
   24.2. Severity is the estimate of the extent of loss that is likely.
   24.3. Exposure is the number of personnel or resources affected by a given event, or by
   repeated events over time.
   24.4. To place hazards in rank order, a best possible estimate of the probability, severity, and
   exposure of a risk compared to the other risks that have been detected must be made. A
   complete description of this concept, including an application of the risk assessment matrix
   and an example of a risk priority list, are available in Attachment 3.
25. Action 1—Assess Hazard Exposure: Surveys, inspections, observations, and the mapping
tool can help determine the level of exposure to a hazard and allow personnel to record it. This
record can be expressed in terms of time, proximity, volume, or repetition. Does it happen often,
or near personnel or equipment? Does the event involve a lot of people or equipment? Repeated
exposure to a hazard increases the probability of a mishap occurring. Understanding the exposure
level can aid in determining the severity and/or the probability of the event. Additionally, it may
serve as a guide for devising control measures to limit exposure.
26. Action 2—Assess Hazard Severity: Determine the severity of the hazard in terms of its
potential impact on the people, equipment, or mission/activity. Cause and effect diagrams,
scenarios and “What-If” analysis are some of the best tools for assessing the hazard severity.
Severity assessment should be based upon the worst possible outcome that can reasonably be
expected. Severity categories are defined to provide a qualitative measure of the worst credible
mishap resulting from personnel error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies,
procedural deficiencies, or system, subsystem, or component failure or malfunction. The
following severity categories provide guidance to a wide variety of missions and systems.
   26.1. Severity Categories.
       26.1.1. Catastrophic: Complete mission failure, death, or loss of system.
       26.1.2. Critical: Major mission degradation, severe injury, occupational illness or major
       system damage.
       26.1.3. Moderate: Minor mission degradation, injury, minor occupational illness, or
       minor system damage.
       26.1.4. Negligible: Less than minor mission degradation, injury, occupational illness, or
       minor system damage.
27. Action 3—Assess Probability: Determine the probability that the hazard will cause a
negative event of the severity assessed in Action 2 above. Probability is proportional to the
cumulative probability of the identified causes for the hazard. Probability may be determined
through estimates or actual numbers, if they are available. Assigning a quantitative mishap
probability to a new mission or system may not be possible early in the planning process. A
qualitative probability may be derived from research, analysis, and evaluation of historical safety
data from similar missions and systems. The typical mishap sequence is much more complicated
than a single line of erect dominos where tipping the first domino (hazard) triggers a clearly
predictable reaction. Supporting rationale for assigning a probability should be documented for
future reference. The following are the Joint RM Working Group (JRMWG) accepted terms and

definitions for the varying levels of probability associated with a standard Risk Assessment

28. Action 4—Complete Risk Assessment: Combine severity & probability estimates to form
a risk assessment for each hazard. By combining the probability of occurrence with severity, a
matrix is created where intersecting rows and columns define a Risk Assessment Matrix. The
Risk Assessment Matrix forms the basis for judging both the acceptability of a risk and the
management level at which the decision on acceptability will be made. The matrix may also be
used to prioritize resources to resolve risks due to hazards or to standardize hazard notification or
response actions. Severity, probability, & risk assessment should be recorded to serve as a record
of the analysis for future use. Existing databases, Risk Assessment Matrix, or a panel of
personnel experienced with the mission and hazards can be used to help complete the risk
assessment. Figure 7 is an example of a matrix. NOTE: Risk assessment matrices can take
different forms and should be designed to fit the organization and/or situation as warranted.

Figure 7. Sample Risk Assessment Matrix.




29. Assessment Pitfalls: The following are some analytical pitfalls that should be avoided in
the assessment:
   29.1. Over optimism: “It can’t happen to us. We’re already doing it.” This pitfall results
   from not looking for root causes of risk.
   29.2. Misrepresentation: Individual perspectives may distort data. This can be deliberate
   or unconscious.
   29.3. Alarmism: “The sky’s falling” approach, or “worst case” estimates are used
   regardless of their remote possibility.
   29.4. Indiscrimination: All data is given equal weight.
   29.5. Prejudice: Subjectivity and/or hidden agendas are used, rather than facts.
   29.6. Inaccuracy: Bad or misunderstood data nullifies accurate risk assessment.
       29.6.1. It is difficult to assign a numerical value to human behavior.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     27


       29.6.2. Numbers may oversimplify real life situations.
       29.6.3. It may be difficult to get enough applicable data, which could force inaccurate
       estimates.
       29.6.4. Oftentimes numbers take the place of reasoned judgment.
       29.6.5. Risk can be unrealistically traded off against benefit by relying solely on
       numbers.
30. The Output of the Hazard Assessment Step: The outcome of the risk assessment process
is a list of risks developed from the output of the hazard ID process. The first risk is the most
serious threat to the mission; the last is the least serious risk of any consequence (see Figure 8).
Each risk is either labeled with its significance (high, medium, etc.) or the section in which its
place is labeled. This allows us to see both the relative priority of the risks and their individual
significance.

Section E—Step 3—Develop Controls and Make Decisions.

31. Introduction:
   31.1. Step 3, Develop Controls and Make Decisions, involves several interrelated steps
   focused at targeting prioritized hazards/risks for elimination or mitigation:
       31.1.1. Identifying control measures available to mitigate the identified hazard(s).
       31.1.2. Determining the effects of each control on the targeted hazard(s).
       31.1.3. Prioritizing the best controls/strategies to mitigate the hazard(s).
       31.1.4. Selecting the risk control measure(s) that will reduce the risks to an acceptable
       level.
       31.1.5. Deciding whether or not to accept the residual risk present in a mission, activity
       or project after applying all practical risk controls; the classic “risk versus reward”
       decision.
   31.2. Identifying, developing & making control decisions is accomplished in several ways.
   Attachment 5 defines each of these options in detail. Figure 9 depicts the actions necessary
   to complete this step.
 28                                                         AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 9. Actions for Step 3—Develop Controls and Make Decisions.




32. Action 1—Identify Control Options: Starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in
Step 2, identify as many risk control options as possible for all hazards. Each hazard should have
one or more controls that can effectively eliminate, avoid, or reduce the risk to an acceptable
level. Refer to the list of possible causes from Step 1 for control ideas. Whenever possible,
involve personnel impacted by risk controls in the development and implementation of the risk
controls to ensure that the controls are appropriate for the action, operation or activity and that it
is realistic and effective for those most closely involved in its implementation; see paragraph 44
for additional discussion on this. The Control Options Matrix, Mission mishap analysis, and
“What-If” analyses are excellent tools to identify control options. Examples of criteria for
establishing effective controls are listed in Table 1.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  29


Table 1. Effective Control Criteria.




   32.1. There are many types of controls that can be applied to hazards. The following controls
   are the most common:
       32.1.1. Engineering Controls: These are controls that use engineering methods to
       reduce risks by design, material selection or substitution when technically or
       economically feasible. Design solutions are generally considered the best risk control
       option when dealing with systems or acquisition development issues.
       32.1.2. Physical Controls: These controls take the form of barriers to and guards
       against a hazard, such as: fences, equipment guards, Personal Protective Equipment
       (PPE) (NOTE: PPE is also associated with Administrative Controls when its use is
       directed), etc.
       32.1.3. Administrative Controls: These are controls that reduce risks through specific
       administrative actions, such as: 1) Providing suitable warnings, markings, placards, signs
       and notices; 2) Establishing written policies, programs, instructions and standard
       operating procedures; 3) Conducting job and RM training, or; 4) Limiting the exposure to
       a hazard (either by reducing the number of assets or personnel, or the length of time
       personnel are exposed).
       32.1.4. Educational Controls: These controls are based on the knowledge and skills of
       the units and individuals. Effective control is implemented through individual and
       collective training that ensures performance to standard.
30                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


     32.1.5. Operational Controls: These controls involve operational actions such as pace
     of operations, battlefield controls (areas of operations and boundaries, direct fire control
     measures, fire support coordinating measures), rules of engagement, airspace control
     measures, map exercises, and rehearsals.
  32.2. Each control should eliminate or mitigate the risk of a hazard via one or more of the
  following methods:
     32.2.1. Rejection: Refuse to take a risk if the overall costs of the risk exceed its mission
     benefits. For example, operational planners may review the risks associated with a
     specific ground attack profile for a particular aircraft type. After assessing all the
     advantages of this profile, evaluating the increased risk associated with it, and the
     application of all available risk controls, it is determined the benefits do not outweigh the
     expected costs and that the unit is better off not using that profile. This is a valid option
     when there are insufficient resources to overcome the risks and the appropriate decision
     making authority (normally a high-level decision maker) determines that the hazards of
     the operation or activity do no warrant further consideration.
     32.2.2. Avoidance: It may be possible to avoid specific risks by “going around” them or
     by accomplishing the mission or task in a different way. Avoiding risk altogether requires
     canceling or delaying the job, mission, or operation; it is an option that is rarely exercised
     due to mission importance. However, it is possible to avoid specific risks: risks
     associated with a night operation may be avoided by conducting the operation during
     daylight hours. Likewise, if a known nightclub is a problem area, it may be best to avoid
     the establishment all together. Keep in mind that avoiding a risk can present other
     hazards that will need to be identified and assessed as a result of the avoidance strategy.
     32.2.3. Delay: If there is no time deadline or other operational benefit to speedy
     accomplishment of a risky task, then it is often desirable to delay the task. During the
     delay, the situation may change and the requirement to accept the risk may go away.
     During the delay additional risk control options may become available (resources become
     available, new technology becomes available, etc.) thereby reducing the overall risk. For
     example, a commander may be faced with conducting risky training for a special mission
     that has yet to be given the "go" for actual execution. By delaying the risky training until
     later in the mission preparation cycle, the commander could effectively prevent
     unnecessary injuries or damage to equipment if the mission were to be cancelled or
     change in such a way that ultimately the training was no longer necessary.
     32.2.4. Transference: Risk may be reduced by transferring all or some portion of that
     mission or task, to another individual, unit or platform that is better positioned, more
     survivable, or more expendable. Risk transference does not change probability or severity
     of the hazard, but it may decrease the probability or severity of the risk actually
     experienced by the individual or organization accomplishing the mission/activity. For
     example, the decision to fly a remotely operated vehicle into a high-risk environment
     instead of risking a manned vehicle is risk transference.
     32.2.5. Spreading: Similar to transference, spreading refers to the movement of forces,
     equipment, or tasks to other areas in order to avoid risk to the entire mission. Risk can
     also be spread out by either increasing the exposure distance or by lengthening the time
     between exposure events. For example, placing aircraft or vehicles in a single area can
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   31


     lead to catastrophic losses if an explosion or fire breaks out; spreading your resources can
     mitigate this potential risk by reducing the exposure of these resources in a single,
     combined area.
     32.2.6. Compensation: To ensure the success of critical missions or tasks and
     compensate for potential losses, assign redundant capabilities. For example: tasking a
     unit to deploy two aircraft to attack a single high value target increases the probability of
     mission success; or having spare parts in case of an equipment malfunction. Flight
     control redundancy is an example of an engineering or design redundancy that
     compensates for primary system malfunctions. Another example is to plan for a back-up
     designated driver or other means of procuring a ride home after a night out.
     32.2.7. Reduction: Reducing the number of individuals, equipment or resources
     exposed to a particular risk is a very simple way of mitigating overall risk. Although this
     strategy may reduce risk, it must be weighed carefully against potential rewards. Just as
     compensation allows for probability of success, reduction can sometimes have the
     negative consequence of not having back-up options available when you need them. The
     overall goal of RM is to plan missions or design systems that do not contain hazards.
     However, the nature of most complex missions and systems makes it impossible or
     impractical to design them completely hazard-free. As hazard analyses are performed,
     hazards will be identified that will require resolution. To be effective, RM strategies must
     address the components of risk: probability, severity, or exposure. A proven order of
     precedence for dealing with hazards and reducing the resulting risks flows as follows:
        32.2.7.1. Plan or design for minimum risk: From the beginning, plan the mission or
        design the system to eliminate hazards. Without a hazard there is no probability,
        severity or exposure. If an identified hazard cannot be eliminated, reduce the
        associated risk to an acceptable level. Flight control components can be designed so
        they cannot be incorrectly connected during maintenance operations as an example.
        32.2.7.2. Incorporate safety devices: If identified hazards cannot be eliminated or
        their associated risk adequately reduced by modifying the mission or system elements
        or their inputs, that risk should be reduced to an acceptable level through the use of
        safety design features or devices. Safety devices usually do not effect probability but
        reduce severity: an automobile seat belt does not prevent a collision but reduces the
        severity of injuries. Nomex gloves and steel-toed boots will not prevent a hazardous
        event, or even change the probability of one occurring, but they prevent, or decrease
        the severity of, injury. Physical barriers fall into this category.
        32.2.7.3. Provide warning devices: When mission planning, system design, and
        safety devices cannot effectively eliminate identified hazards or adequately reduce
        associated risk, warning devices should be used to detect the condition and alert
        personnel of the hazard. As an example, aircraft could be retrofitted with a low
        altitude ground collision warning system to reduce controlled flight into the ground
        mishaps. Warning signals and their application should be designed to minimize the
        probability of the incorrect personnel reaction to the signals and should be
        standardized. Flashing red lights or sirens are a common warning device that most
        people understand.
 32                                                         AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


           32.2.7.4. Develop procedures and training: Where it is impractical to eliminate
           hazards through design selection or adequately reduce the associated risk with safety
           and warning devices, procedures and training should be used. A warning system by
           itself may not be effective without training or procedures required to respond to the
           hazardous condition. The greater the human contribution to the functioning of the
           system or involvement in the mission process, the greater the chance for variability.
           However, if the system is well designed and the mission well planned, the only
           remaining risk reduction strategies may be procedures and training. Emergency
           procedure training and disaster preparedness exercises improve human response to
           hazardous situations.
33. Action 2—Determine Control Effects: Determine how each control affects the risk
associated with the hazard. A computer spread sheet or data form may be used to list control
ideas and indicate control effects. With controls identified, the hazard should be re-assessed,
taking into consideration the effect the control will have on the severity and/or probability. The
new estimated value(s) for severity and/or probability and the change in overall risk assessed
from the Risk Assessment Matrix should be recorded. This refined risk assessment determines
the residual risk for the hazard, assuming the implementation of selected controls. At this point,
it is also appropriate to consider the cost (personnel, equipment, money, time, etc.) of the control
and the possible interaction between controls.
34. Action 3—Prioritize Risk Controls: For each hazard, prioritize those risk controls that
will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The best controls will be consistent with mission
objectives and optimize use of available resources (manpower, material, equipment, funding and
time). Priorities should be recorded in some standardized format for future reference.
Opportunity assessment, cost versus benefit analysis and computer modeling provide excellent
aids to prioritize risk controls. If the control is already implemented in an established instruction,
document, or procedure, that too should be documented.
   34.1. As discussed in Attachment 4, the "standard order of precedence" indicates that the
   ideal action is to “plan or design for minimum risk” with less desirable options being, in
   order, to add safety devices, add warning devices, or change training and procedures. This
   order of preference makes perfect sense while the system is still being designed, but once the
   system is fielded, this approach is frequently not cost effective. Redesigning to eliminate a
   hazard or add safety or warning devices is both expensive and time consuming and, until the
   retrofit is complete, the hazard remains unabated.
   34.2. Normally, revising operational or support procedures may be the lowest cost
   alternative. While this action does not eliminate the hazard, it may significantly reduce the
   likelihood of a mishap or the severity of the outcome (risk) and the change can usually be
   implemented quickly. Even when a redesign is planned, interim changes in procedures or
   maintenance requirements are usually required. In general, these changes may be as simple
   as improving training, posting warnings, or improving operator or technician qualifications.
   Other options include preferred parts substitutes, instituting or changing time change
   requirements, or increased inspections.
   34.3. The feasible alternatives must be evaluated, balancing their costs and expected benefits
   in terms of mission performance, dollars and continued risk exposure during implementation.
   A completed risk assessment should clearly define these tradeoffs for the decision maker.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     33


35. Action 4—Select Risk Controls: For each identified hazard, select those risk controls that
will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The best controls will be consistent with
mission/activity objectives and optimum use of available resources (manpower, material,
equipment, funding, and time). Paragraph 32.1. discussed types of controls and their hierarchy in
implementing them (i.e., physical controls are preferable to administrative controls in
effectiveness) but the decision maker must determine the appropriate controls for the situation.
   35.1. At this point it is important to consider the measurements necessary to ensure accurate
   evaluations of the effectiveness of selected risk controls before they are implemented. These
   measurements are essential to support the feedback aspect of the RM process as outlined in
   the final step of the RM process "Supervise and Evaluate" covered in section G. Establishing
   evaluation tools such as after action reports, surveys, and in-progress reviews provides real-
   world measurements of the selected control measures and ensures leadership can accurately
   determine if the controls are working. These measurements must quantitatively or
   qualitatively identify reductions of risk, improvements in mission success, or enhancement of
   capabilities to be effective.
   35.2. In addition, control selection and implementation decisions should be recorded in some
   standardized format for future reference. As a technique, determine the hazards and
   associated risk level on the risk assessment matrix (Figure 7) before implementation of the
   control(s) and compare this initial risk to the anticipated remaining or residual risk after
   application of each control. The residual risk may be notional or known depending upon the
   situation, but it provides the necessary starting point for leaders to make a formal risk
   decision on which controls to implement. Note that once the operation/activity is conducted
   and real-world data and measurements are available, then a more accurate determination can
   be made on the effectiveness of the control and appropriate feedback can be made as
   described in Section G.
36. Action 5—Make Risk Decision: Analyze the level of risk for the operation or activity with
the proposed controls in place. Determine if the benefits of the operation/activity now exceed the
level of risk the operation/ activity presents. Be sure to consider the cumulative risk of all the
identified hazards and the long term consequences of the decision. When a decision is made to
assume risk, the factors (cost versus benefit information) involved in this decision should be
recorded. Documentation is important to provide leaders and managers the steps necessary to
mitigate or accept the hazard associated with the risk. This is critical to the success of Step 5
(Supervise & Evaluate) in the overall RM process.
   36.1. If the cost of the risk(s) outweighs the benefits, re-examine the control options to see if
   any new or modified controls are available. If no additional controls are identified, inform the
   next level in the chain of command that, based on the evaluation, the risk of the mission
   exceeds the benefits and should be modified.
   36.2. If the benefits of the mission/activity outweigh the risk, with controls in place,
   determine if the controls can all be implemented at the current level in the chain of command
   or if the decision should be elevated to a higher authority (as applicable). Keep in mind that
   the decision to elevate a risk control decision may be dictated by unit policy rather than by
   personal choice; ensure personnel are aware of the policies and rules under which they are
   working. If the decision cannot be implemented at the current level due to circumstances or
 34                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   policy, notify the next appropriate decision authority in the chain of command, or others that
   can assist in the decision as appropriate for the situation.
   36.3. When notified of a situation in which risk outweighs benefit, the next level in the chain
   of command should assist with implementing required controls, modify/cancel the mission,
   or accept the identified risks based on a higher level of the risk-benefit equation. When
   practical, a higher level decision-maker should explain to lower level personnel the basis on
   which the risk decision is reached. This allows the lower level personnel to understand the
   reasons for proceeding and helps expand their decision-making experience base. When this
   situation arises in an off-duty or non-mission related situation, the decision maker must take
   extra time and care to ensure that they are making a sound and informed decision on
   accepting a particular risk. Every effort must be made to utilize all available resources to
   form this decision. If no additional resources or options are available to modify or reduce the
   risks associated with an activity, the decision maker should lean toward the most
   conservative decision or option available.
   36.4. For activities and process that are routinely repeated and are likely to encounter
   varying hazards/risk levels, consider documenting the process and establishing formal risk
   acceptance levels for these activities and processes; i.e., flying units that require flight
   personnel to fill out RM worksheets prior to mission execution. These worksheets formally
   define risk acceptance levels that range from the aircraft commander or flight lead for low
   risk missions to higher leadership levels (Squadron DO, Squadron Top-Three, Squadron
   Commander, Wing Commander, etc.) as the mission risk increases.
37. Some Special Considerations in Risk Control:
   37.1. The following factors should be considered when applying the third step of RM.
      37.1.1. Try to apply risk controls only in those activities and to those personnel who are
      actually at risk. Too often risk controls are applied indiscriminately across an
      organization leading to wasted resources and unnecessary irritation of busy operational
      personnel.
      37.1.2. Apply redundant risk controls when practical and cost effective. If the first line of
      defense fails, the back-up risk control(s) may prevent loss.
      37.1.3. Involve personnel directly impacted by a risk control in the selection and
      development of risk controls whenever possible. This involvement will result in better
      risk controls and in general a more positive risk control process.
      37.1.4. Benchmark (find best practices in other organizations) as extensively as possible
      to reduce the cost associated with the development of risk controls. Why expend the time
      and resources necessary to develop a risk control and then have to test it in application
      when you may be able to find an already complete, validated approach in another
      organization?
      37.1.5. Establish a timeline to guide the integration of the risk control into operational
      processes.
   37.2. The decision maker selects the control options after considering all the possible
   controls. This decision is not ad hoc, but rather a logical, sequenced part of the RM process.
   Decisions are made with awareness of hazards and how important hazard control is to

   mission success or failure (cost versus benefit). Control decisions must be made at the
   appropriate level. The decision maker must be in a position to obtain the resources needed to
   implement the risk controls he or she approves. Usually, the earlier in the life of the process
   that a control is implemented, the less costly it becomes. When making control decisions, it is
   important to keep in mind the law of diminishing returns. There is a point at which it is no
   longer cost effective to continue applying control measures for the small amount of
   additional return in terms of reduced risk.
38. Decisions Regarding Risk Controls: The primary objective of effective RM decision
making is to select the best possible combination of risk controls from among the options
provided via the risk control methods described in Step 3. There are several important points to
keep in mind when making a risk control decision:
   38.1. Carefully evaluate the mission impact of the various risk control options. The most
   effective risk control may also be the one that has the most negative impact on other aspects
   of the mission/activity. The objective is to choose the option(s) that has the best overall
   favorable impact on the mission/activity.
   38.2. Be sure to consider all the positive (benefit) and negative (cost) factors associated with
   a risk decision. A common mistake is to consider only the safety or other loss control aspects
   of risk decisions. Often more important issues are the quality, productivity, or moral
   implications of the decision.
   38.3. Try to focus risk controls only on those parts of the operation actually impacted by the
   risk. This may be a specific group of personnel, a particular phase of the operation/activity,
   or a particular piece of equipment. By tightening the focus, resource requirements are
   minimized and any negative mission impact is reduced.
   38.4. Make risk decisions at the right time. It is important to review an activity or mission
   and identify the points in time at which risk decisions can best be made. On one hand,
   making risk decisions at the latest possible time provides more time for collecting and
   considering hazards and associated risks. On the other hand, decisions must be made in time
   to be effectively integrated in the overall mission/activity process.
   38.5. Make risk decisions at the right level. The right level is the level that can best judge
   the full range of issues involved. It is also relevant to ask who will be held accountable if the
   risk produces a loss. That person should either have a voice in the risk decision or actually be
   the appropriate decision maker for the operation/activity.
39. Making the Overall Risk Decision: Once the best possible set of risk control options has
been selected, the individual in charge (decision maker) must make a final decision whether to
proceed, thereby accepting the residual risk of the operation. This decision is based on the best
possible estimate whether the overall potential benefit to the organization or individuals of a
particular mission or activity exceeds the best estimate of the overall potential cost. The First
Principle of RM tells us to "Accept no unnecessary risk", but to normally accept the risk when
the benefits outweigh the costs. This is an especially critical concept of RM. The risk decisions
should be based on the question “Which risk is greater, the risk of doing this or the risk of not
doing it?” This view of risk decisions recognizes that organizations are placed at risk when they
do not take the risks they need to take to remain superior to or at least competitive with their
potential adversaries. It is important to note that the RM process may occasionally reveal areas
 36                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


where regulatory guidance is overly restrictive or otherwise in need of evaluation, however, RM
is not authorization to violate policy. Properly performed RM assessments serve as a tool to seek
necessary changes through established channels. Remember, the goal is not the least level of
risk, it is the best level of risk for the total mission of the organization or individuals.

Section F—Step 4—Implement Controls.

40. Introduction: Implement Controls. Once the risk control decision is made, and an
implementation plan developed for initiating the controls, assets must be made available to
implement the specific controls. Part of implementing control measures includes informing
appropriate personnel of the RM process results and subsequent decisions to implement planned
measures. If there is a disagreement, then the decision makers should provide a rational
explanation. Careful documentation of each step in the RM process facilitates risk
communication and the rational processes behind RM decisions. Figure 10 depicts the actions
necessary to complete this step.

Figure 10. Actions for Step 4—Implement Controls.




41. Action 1—Make Implementation Clear: To make the implementation directive clear,
consider using examples, providing pictures or charts, including job aids, etc. Provide a roadmap
for implementation, a vision of the end state, and describe successful implementation. The
control measure must be deployed in a method that ensures it will be received positively by the
intended audience. This can best be achieved by designing in user ownership.
42. Action 2—Establish Accountability: Accountability is a critically important area of RM.
The accountable person is the one who makes the decision (approves the control measures), and
hence, the right person (appropriate level) must make the decision. The foundation of
establishing effective accountability is the principle that behavior/actions equal consequences
and that those delegated to make RM decisions are able to accept the consequences (good or bad)
of their approval for specific mission taskings and or activities. In general, this translates to the
premise that as risk increases, so does the level of authority to approve the action, operation or
activity. Also, be clear on who is responsible at the unit level for actual implementation of the
risk control(s) and ensure they are equally aware of the cost and benefits associated with the
action. This accountability must be known and adhered to by all individuals involved in the RM
process to ensure that proper decisions are made by the appropriate authorities as the risk
equation changes.
43. Action 3—Provide Support: To be successful, command/leadership must be behind the
control measures put in place. Prior to implementing a control measure, get approval at the
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   37


appropriate level. Then, explore appropriate ways to demonstrate command/leadership
commitment along with accountability (see paragraphs 44-46). Provide the personnel and
resources necessary to implement the control measures. Design in sustainability from the
beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure along with a feedback mechanism that will
provide information on whether the control measure is achieving the intended purpose.
44. Common Problems in Implementing Risk Controls: A review of the historical record of
risk controls indicates that many never achieve their full potential. The primary reason for
shortfalls is failure to effectively involve the personnel who are actually impacted by a risk
control. Note that virtually all the listed factors are driven by the failure to properly involve
personnel impacted by risk controls in the development and implementation of the risk controls:
   44.1. The control is inappropriate for the problem.
   44.2. Operators/personnel dislike it.
   44.3. Leaders dislike it.
   44.4. It turns out to be too costly (unsustainable).
   44.5. It is overmatched by other priorities.
   44.6. It is misunderstood.
   44.7. Nobody measures progress until it is too late.
45. Procedures for Implementing Risk Controls within an Organizational Culture: The
following procedures provide useful guidance for shaping a risk control within an organizational
culture. Followed carefully they will significantly improve the impact and duration of the
effectiveness of risk controls.
   45.1. Develop the risk control within the organization’s culture. Every organization has a
   style or a culture. While the culture changes over time due to the impact of commanders and
   other modifications, the personnel in the organization know the culture at any given time. It
   is important to develop risk controls which are consistent with this culture. For example, a
   rigid, centrally directed risk control would be incompatible with an organizational culture
   that emphasizes decentralized flexibility. Conversely, a decentralized risk control may not be
   effective in an organization accustomed to top down direction and control. If you have any
   doubts about the compatibility of a risk control within your organization, ask some personnel
   in the organization what they think. People are the culture and their reactions will tell you
   what you need to know.
   45.2. Generate maximum possible involvement of personnel impacted by a risk control in
   the implementation of the risk control. Figure 11 provides a tool to assist in assessing this
   “involvement factor.” The key to making RM a fully integrated part of the organization
   culture, is to achieve user ownership in a significant percentage of all risk controls that are
   developed and implemented by the personnel directly impacted by the risk. This is essential
   for both on- and off-duty RM control considerations.

Figure 11. Levels of User Involvement in Risk Controls.




   45.3. Develop the best possible supporting tools, guides and /or infrastructure to aid
   personnel in implementing the risk control. Examples include standard operating procedures,
   model applications, job aids, checklists, training materials, decision guides, help lines, and
   similar items. The more support that is provided, the easier the task is for the affected
   personnel; the easier the task, the greater the chances for success.
   45.4. Develop a timeline for implementing the risk control. Identify major milestones, being
   careful to allow reasonable timeframes and assuring that plans are compatible with the
   realities of organizational resource constraints.
46. Procedures for Generating Command Involvement in Implementing Risk
Controls: AS stated in paragraph 43, a commander’s and supervisor’s influence behind a risk
control can greatly increase its chances of success. It is usually a good idea to signal clearly to an
organization that there is leader interest in a risk control if the commander in fact has some
interest. Figure 12 illustrates actions in order of priority that can be taken to signal leader
support. Most commanders are interested in risk control and are willing to do anything
reasonable to support the process. Take the time as you develop a risk control to visualize a role
for organization leaders.
47. Procedures for Sustaining Risk Control Effectiveness: To be fully effective, risk controls
must be sustained by maintaining the responsibility and accountability over the long haul. If the
risk control is well designed for compatibility with the organization's mission & culture then
sustainability should not be difficult. Leaders must maintain accountability & provide a
reasonable level of positive reinforcement as appropriate.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    39

Section G—Step 5—Supervise & Evaluate.

48. Introduction: The fifth step of RM, Supervise & Evaluate, involves the determination of
the effectiveness of risk controls throughout the operation. This step involves three actions. The
first action is monitoring the effectiveness of risk controls through proper supervision. The
second action involves evaluating and determining the need for further assessment of either all or
a portion of the operation due to an unanticipated change as an example. The last action is the
need to capture lessons-learned, both positive and negative, and provide feedback so that lessons
learned may be integrated into future activities of the same or similar type. Figure 13 depicts the
actions necessary to complete this step.

Figure 13. Actions for Step 5—Supervise and Evaluate




49. Action 1—Supervise: Monitor the operation to ensure:
   49.1. The controls are effective and remain in place.
   49.2. Changes which require further RM are identified.
   49.3. Action is taken when necessary to correct ineffective risk controls and reinitiate the
   RM steps in response to new hazards.
   49.4. Anytime the personnel, equipment, or mission tasking change or new
   operations/activities are anticipated in an environment not covered in the initial RM analysis,
   the risks and control measures should be reevaluated. The best tool for accomplishing this is
   change analysis.
 40                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   49.5. Successful mission performance is achieved by shifting the cost versus benefit balance
   more in favor of benefit through controlling risks. By applying RM principles when changes
   occur, risk (those known before an operation and those that develop during an operation) can
   be consistently controlled. Being proactive and addressing the risks before they get in the
   way of mission accomplishment saves resources, enhances mission performance, and
   prevents the mishap chain from forming.
50. Action 2—Evaluate: Process evaluations must be systematic. After assets are expended to
control risks, then a cost benefit evaluation/review must be accomplished to see if cost and
benefit are in balance. Any changes in the system are recognized and appropriate RM controls
are applied. Note that the METT-TC, 5-M model, and the flow charts from the earlier steps
provide convenient benchmarks to compare the present system to the original system.
   50.1. To accomplish an effective review, supervisors need to identify whether the actual cost
   is in line with expectations. Also the supervisor will need to see what effect the control
   measure has had on mission/activity performance. It will be difficult to evaluate the control
   measure by itself so focus on the aspect of mission performance the control measure was
   designed to improve.
   50.2. When a decision is made to assume risk, the factors (cost versus benefit information)
   involved in this decision should be recorded as described in paragraph 36. When a mishap or
   negative consequences occur, proper documentation allows for the review of the risk
   decision process to see where errors might have occurred or if changes in the procedures and
   tools led to the consequences. Secondly, it is unlikely that every risk analysis will be perfect
   the first time. When risk analyses contain errors of omission or commission, it is important
   that those errors be identified and corrected.
   50.3. Measurements and associated tools (as described in paragraph 35.1. and 35.2.) are
   necessary to ensure the accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of selected controls. At this
   point in the process, the measurements and data tied to the control measure(s) must be
   reviewed and analyzed to determine if they are effective or ineffective in eliminating or
   mitigating the risks they were intended for. Once this is determined, effective feedback can
   be made to leadership and personnel.
51. Action 3—Feedback: An evaluation/review by itself is not enough; mission feedback
systems must be utilized and/or established to ensure that the corrective or preventative action
taken was effective and that any newly discovered hazards identified during the mission/activity
are analyzed and corrective action taken. Feedback informs all involved as to how the
implementation process is working, and whether or not the controls were effective. Whenever a
control process is changed without providing the reasons, co-ownership at the lower levels is
lost. The overall effectiveness of the implemented controls must be shared with other
organizations with similar risks to ensure the greatest possible benefit. Feedback can be in the
form of briefings, lessons learned, cross-tell reports, benchmarking, database reports, etc.
Without this feedback loop, there is no way to know if the previous forecasts were accurate,
contained minor errors, or were completely incorrect.
52. Monitoring the Effectiveness of Implementation: This aspect of the “Supervise &
Evaluate” step should be routine. Periodically monitor the progress of implementation against
the planned implementation schedule that should have been developed during the third and
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      41


fourth RM steps. Take action as necessary to maintain the planned implementation schedule or
make adjustments as necessary.
53. Monitoring the Effectiveness of Risk Controls: If the risk control has been well designed,
it will favorably change either physical conditions or personnel behavior during the conduct of
an operation/activity. The challenge is to determine the extent to which this change is taking
place. If there has been no change or only minor change, the risk control is likely not worth the
resources expended on it. It may be necessary to modify it or even rescind it. At first thought it
may seem obvious to only determine if the number of mishaps or other losses has decreased.
This is only practical at higher levels of command, typically wing level or higher, because
accurate measurement of changes in actual losses almost always requires large amounts of
exposure (man-hours, flight hours, miles driven, etc.) only found at those levels of command.
Even at those levels, where there is sufficient exposure to validly assess actual losses, it may be a
year or more before significant changes actually occur; this is simply too long to wait to assess
the effectiveness of risk controls. The answer is to directly measure the degree of risk present in
the system versus relying on mishap data.
   53.1. Direct Measures of Behavior. When the target of a risk control is behavior, it is
   possible to actually sample behavior changes in the target group. The results of an effort to
   get personnel to wear seat belts, for example, can be assessed by making a number of
   observations of the use of restraints before initiating the seat belt program and a similar
   sample after. The change, if any, is a direct measure of the effectiveness of the risk control.
   The sample would establish the percentage of personnel using belts as a percentage of total
   observations. Subsequent samples would indicate the success in sustaining the impact of the
   risk control.
   53.2. Direct Measures of Conditions. In the exact same manner as described in 53.1., it is
   possible to assess the changes in physical conditions in the workplace. For example, the
   amount of foreign objects found on the flight line can be assessed before and after a risk
   control initiative aimed at reducing foreign object damage.
   53.3. Measures of Attitudes. Surveys can also assess the attitudes of personnel toward risk-
   related issues. While constructing survey questions is technical and must be done right, the
   AF often conducts surveys and it may be possible to integrate questions in these surveys,
   taking advantage of the experts who manage these survey processes. Nevertheless, even
   informal surveys taken verbally in very small organizations will quickly indicate the views of
   personnel.
   53.4. Measures of Knowledge. Some risk controls are designed to increase knowledge of
   some hazard or of hazard control procedures. For example, a short quiz administered during a
   safety meeting or stand-down day can effectively assess the levels of knowledge before and
   after a risk control is initiated.
   53.5. Safety and Other Loss Control Audit Procedures. Programmatic and procedural
   risk control initiatives (such as revisions to standard operating procedures) can be assessed
   through various kinds of audits. A typical audit involves a standard set of questions or
   statements reflecting desirable standards of performance against which actual operating
   situations are compared.
 42                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


54. Evaluating Overall Organization Performance: If the organization is large enough to
accumulate enough exposure (i.e., 100,000 flight hours, 200,000 personnel hours, 1,000,000
miles driven, etc.) to have statistically valid rates, then rates are an excellent results measure of
organization performance. Most organizations do not have this much exposure and consequently
valid rates cannot be calculated on an annual basis. Even in organizations that accumulate the
exposure necessary to calculate valid rates, it is important to use them properly. Because of their
statistical nature, there is a considerable amount of variation in normal rates. They go up and
down for no other reason than the normal variation in the occurrence of events. It is important
not to let this normal variation be interpreted as meaningful. As an example, when mishap
numbers or rates increase or decrease, it is important to have an individual with statistical
expertise assess the significance of the changes. In smaller organizations, in which rates are not a
useful tool, it is possible to assess overall organization RM success using a cross section of
indicators like those described in paragraph 50. See Attachment 7 for a more detailed
explanation. Even larger organizations need such measures of process effectiveness to augment
the use of mishap rates or numbers as performance result measures.

Section H—Real-Time RM (RTRM).

55. Introduction: This level of managing risk is normally associated with RM decisions made
in “Real-Time”. These decisions are made most often during the execution phase of training,
operations, emergency/crisis response situations, or off-duty activities where there is little or no
time to conduct formal RM planning. This is where all personnel operate on a daily basis and is
usually an informal, mental risk assessment that is done “on the fly” using basic RM process
steps to identify and mitigate hazards in a new or changing situation. As time is normally
constrained in these situations, "Deliberate" application of the 5-Step RM Process is impractical.
56. The RTRM Process; ABCD Model: The 5-Step RM process is the cornerstone of all RM
decisions and lays the framework for conducting formalized risk assessments normally
associated with the In-depth and Deliberative levels of RM. Although RTRM is founded by the
5-Step RM process, streamlining the steps is essential in situations where risk decisions need to
be made in Real-Time; it is the practical application of the 5-Step process during the execution
phase of any on- or off-duty operation or activity. To enhance recall of critical RM steps, the AF
has adopted an easy-to-remember mnemonic (ABCD) to assist personnel in making sound RM
decisions in “Real-Time.” This mnemonic walks individuals through the essential steps of the
RM wheel to: Assess the situation, Balance controls, Communicate, Decide & Debrief the RM
decision: ABCD. This simple and easy to remember memory jogger provides individuals with a
means to evaluate risks and formulate mitigation strategies in a short time and can be easily
applied in both on- and off-duty situations. Figure 14 provides a graphic example of the
relationship between the 5-Step RM Process and RTRM/ABCD model.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  43


Figure 14. RTRM/ABCD Model and 5-Step RM Process Relationship.




   56.1. Discussion: Experience is the result of all learning events both good and bad.
   Therefore, most individuals have some experience to draw upon when responding to an
   event. The task for leaders and individuals is to marshal and coordinate the experience from
   personnel involved in a mission or a task to assist in the RM process. The ABCD Model
   establishes a standard structure for individuals, teams, and/or crews to learn and effectively
   apply new or complex behaviors, skills, values and understanding to a situation. Using the
   ABCD Model in a personal or professional application, regularly, will result in deep memory
   of those learned qualities. When individuals execute tasks, they have an expectation of a
   response consistent with their experience. Utilizing a standard RTRM model allows leaders,
   team/crew members and individuals to have an expectation of a response consistent with
   their experience. By recalling and communicating with the same standardized ABCD Model,
   the ability to match a previous mission or task to a new experience provides uniform and
   consistent responses when considering RM decisions.
   56.2. The ABCD Model provides a common language and structure for a measured response
   when an individual, crew or team is executing a routine task or when they are under duress
   from a more complex situation. Consistent emphasis and training on the ABCD Model will
   embed a standard way of thinking about RM that will help personnel recognize and recall a
   set of actions to counter risk even when they are distracted. This simple and easy to
   remember mnemonic provides individuals with a means to evaluate risks and formulate
   mitigation strategies on-the-run, and it can be easily applied in both on- and off-duty
   situations.
   56.3. The nature of RTRM decisions includes an understanding that:
44                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


     56.3.1. Using the ABCD Model on a regular basis creates a habit and trains the brain to
     continue thinking under duress or stress.
     56.3.2. The model is designed to assist when:
         56.3.2.1. Working in a dynamic and/or unfamiliar environment.
         56.3.2.2. Monitoring a static or routine situation to capture errors.
         56.3.2.3. Making a decision with partial information.
     56.3.3. In all three situations, it is necessary to develop habits that trigger the RTRM
     process to “Assess” the situation, “Balance” controls, “Communicate” to others, and
     “Decide” upon a course of action and ultimately “Debrief” the event.
     56.3.4. Real-Time decision making requires a unique set of skills, which must be
             practiced to become second nature. The situations above require the continuous
     use of the ABCD Model to effectively manage risks as the situation changes. This cyclic
     application of the ABCD model provides continuous improvement of RM skills and
             knowledge.
     56.3.5. RTRM relies on the decision maker’s previous experience, training, and ability to
     recall controls/resources from the In-depth or Deliberate RM process.
     56.3.6. Real-Time decisions are based on pattern matching to past training and
     experience and the recall of controls/resources in the ABCD model format.
     56.3.7. Standardizing the communication structure in a Real-Time situation reduces
     conflicts and errors, and improves the ability to manage risk and resources.
  56.4. Assess the situation. Assessing risk in a Real-Time environment when a planned
  activity is already underway, or where the complexity or perception of overall risk is low,
  requires the key elements of hazard/risk ID and understanding the negative effects associated
  with those risks/hazards. It is essential for individuals to seriously consider the activity or
  action they are about to engage in and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to meet the
  hazards they identify. In RTRM, a complete assessment of the situation requires three stages
  of situational awareness in a relatively short time: (a) perception of what is happening, (b)
  integration of information and goals, and (c) projection into the future. Unlike strategic or
  deliberate RM, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, it is an individual’s
  ability to discern the situation and apply available resources quickly and effectively that can
  mean the difference between success and failure. This first step of the RTRM/ABCD model
  effectively combines the first two steps of the 5-Step RM process.
  56.5. Balance Controls. The second step of the RTRM/ABCD model is specifically tied to
  making risk control decisions (step three of the 5-Step process) to mitigate or eliminate the
  risks identified in assessing the hazards of an activity. After assessing the situation, personnel
  must consider all available controls (resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and
  how to manage those controls effectively. Controls/resources can vary in scope and
  availability from situation-to-situation, but the better prepared an individual is prior to an
  activity, the more likely they will have more controls/resources available to create multiple
  redundancies or “blocks” to effectively mitigate and deflect potential risks in Real-Time. As
  an example, this equates to having a good understanding of the situation, being properly
  trained, wearing correct PPE, knowing personal limitations, and having a “wingman” to
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   45


  support their effort(s). Each of these controls/resources serves as a layer of protection and
  enhances a decision maker’s ability to effectively balance risk vs. reward through proper
  preparation and understanding of a situation and options available. When making these
  considerations it is also essential that Airmen communicate with their team and leadership to
  ensure all options and resources are effectively utilized in making a sound yet timely risk
  decision.
  56.6. Communicate. The third step of this model is to communicate. Communication can
  take various forms. For instance, Real-Time communication with leadership to discuss
  problems and/or intentions, internal team/crew communication to discuss Real-Time risk
  mitigation options, or even an individual internalizing their current situation and taking time
  to contemplate if they are heading down the right path. This step assumes individuals have
  adequately assessed the situation and considered the resources at their disposal to effectively
  make a risk mitigation decision. A critical part of this step is to be aware of how perception
  and communication change depending upon the situation and circumstances that are present
  in a dynamic environment. Perception and communication change as individuals become
  more stressed and begin to lose situational awareness (SA). Understanding this, an individual
  or group can quickly identify if they or others are losing situational awareness. This
  awareness allows individuals to more effectively communicate with leadership and
  teammates in Real-Time situations. It enables them to identify when they or others are losing
  SA, and allows them to take a step back and reevaluate options. Asking questions such as:
  “Who needs to know about the situation?”; “Who can help or assist?”; “Who can provide
  back-up?” or “Can this be done differently” are just a few examples of the considerations that
  should be made prior to implementing a mitigation strategy. NOTE: Time-critical situations
  may not allow for proper communication prior to an action, but the goal is to avoid these
  types of situations whenever possible through effective communication during the
  mission/activity.
  56.7. Decide, and Debrief. The final step of the RTRM/ABCD model is to make the
  decision to continue, modify or abandon the mission/activity based upon Real-Time
  circumstances and conditions. Unlike step 4 of the 5-Step process where an implementation
  strategy is carefully developed and carried out through ID of the who, what, when, where and
  cost associated with the control prior to an activity, Real-Time RM relies on the individual or
  small group taking immediate or near immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in Real-Time. This
  aspect alone incorporates more inherent risk than deliberate and strategic RM decisions.
  Individuals must realize this and make every effort to deliberately weigh risk decisions
  before taking action to ensure they are selecting the best COA. Sometimes the original plan
  must be modified or changed to account for unforeseen issues in order to assure success.
  Although minor changes or modifications to a plan or strategy may be easily implemented,
  others may require higher authority (if available) to properly weigh the risk and reward
  decision. Accountability under these circumstances rests solely with the individual(s)
  involved in the activity and it is their responsibility to fully understand the scope and limits
  of their Go/No-Go decision and act accordingly. As such, the acceptance of risk and
  associated consequences needs to be taken seriously with the understanding that any adverse
  outcome from a selected COA may not only affect the individual, but greatly impact loved
  ones, co-workers & ultimately their valuable contribution to the AF mission. Although the
  goal for any mission or activity is to operate safely and achieve success, all Airmen must
 46                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   consider the possibility of abandoning the mission or activity if the situation appears too
   risky or too costly to continue and there are no reasonable options or strategies to
   change/alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the mission/activity.
       56.7.1. As with the formal 5-Step RM Process, it is essential that both leadership and
       personnel involved in a mission/activity ensure that the feedback loop or “Debrief” aspect
       of the “D” is performed. Ensuring individuals follow through and complete the ABCD
       mnemonic loop by identifying what worked, what did not work, and ensuring
       dissemination of documented lessons learned is a vital key to this process. Debriefs will
       improve performance, mitigate risks in future activities, and are essential in completing
       the ABCD loop. Asking questions such as: “Was our assessment accurate?”; “Were we
       lucky?”; “How well did we use the controls/resources?”; “Was the communication
       effective?” and “What can we do to improve events in the future?” are a few examples of
       questions individuals can ask in a debrief to ensure future activities are improved and
       risks are reduced.

Section I—Conclusion.

57. Conclusion: RM provides a logical and systematic means of identifying and controlling
risk. RM is not a complex process, but it does require individuals, supervisors, and leaders to
support and implement the basic principles on a continuing basis. RM offers individuals and
organizations a powerful tool for increasing effectiveness and reducing mishaps. The RM
process is accessible to, and usable by, everyone in every conceivable setting or scenario both
on- and off-duty. It ensures that all AF personnel have a voice in the critical decisions that
determine success or failure in our missions and activities. Properly implemented and supported,
RM can save lives, enhance mission performance and preserve combat capability across the full
spectrum of all on- and off-duty operations/activities.

                    HAZARD ID TOOLS, DETAILS AND EXAMPLES

Section A2A—Primary Hazard ID Tools.
A2.1. Introduction. The seven tools that follow are considered the “primary” or basic set of
hazard ID tools to be applied on a day-to-day basis in organizations at levels down to and
including non-supervisory personnel. There are several reasons that these tools have been chosen
as primary, listed in Figure A2.1. In organizations with a mature RM culture, the use of these
tools by personnel should be regarded as a natural course of events. The cultural norm should be
“Why would I even consider exposing myself and others to the risks of this activity before I have
identified the hazards involved using the best procedures available?” The following pages
describe each tool using a standard format with models and examples.

Figure A2.1. Reasons for Choosing Primary Hazard ID Tools.




A2.2. The Operations Analysis (OA) and Flow Diagram. This tool is also known as “Flow
Diagram,” “Flow Chart,” and “Operation Timeline.”
   A2.2.1. PURPOSE. The OA provides an itemized sequence of events or a diagram (in the
   case of the Flow Diagram) depicting the major events of an operation. The purpose of this
   flow of events is to assure that all elements of an operation are evaluated for potential sources
   of risk. This overcomes a major weakness of traditional RM which tends to immediately
   focus effort on one or two aspects of an operation that intuitively are identified as risky to the
   exclusion of other aspects that may actually prove to be higher risk. The OA also guides the
   allocation of RM resources over time as an operation unfolds, event by event, in a systematic
   manner.
   A2.2.2. APPLICATION. The OA or Flow Diagram is used in virtually all RM applications
   to include the most time critical. It responds to the key RM question “What am I facing here
   and from where can risk arise?”
   A2.2.3. METHOD. Whenever possible the OA is taken directly from the products of the
   personnel planning an operation. It is difficult to imagine planning an operation without
   identifying the key events in a time sequence. If for some reason such a list is not available,
 52                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   then the analyst creates a list using the best available understanding of the operation. A key
   issue is level of detail. The best practice is to break the operation down into time sequenced
   segments that have strongly related tasks and activities. This is normally well above the
   detail of individual tasks. The examples provided in paragraph A2.2.6 are good guides for
   appropriate detail levels. It may be appropriate to break aspects of an operation that are
   obviously higher risk down into more detail than is necessary for lower risk areas. The output
   product of an OA is the major events of an operation in sequence with or without time
   checks. An alternative to the OA is the Flow Diagram. The Flow Diagram converts the list of
   events of the OA into a diagram using the well established procedures of the Flow Diagram.
   Commonly used symbols are provided at Table A2.2 Consider putting the steps of the
   process on index cards or “Post-its.” This allows for rearranging the diagram without erasing
   and redrawing, making it easy to reconfigure the diagram and encouraging contributions.

Table A2.1. Example Flow Chart Symbols.




   A2.2.4. RESOURCES. The key resource for the OA is the mission planners. Using the
   mission layout, from a mission planner, will facilitate the integration of risk controls in the
   main operational plan and will virtually eliminate the expenditure of duplicative resources on
   this key aspect of hazard ID.
   A2.2.5. COMMENTS. It is imperative to look back on personal experience. Everyone can
   recall a time that they have been surprised or seen others surprised because they overlooked
   possible sources of problems. The OA is the key to minimizing this source of failure.
   A2.2.6. EXAMPLES. Following are examples of operations analyses and flow diagrams
   illustrating variations of this tool.
      A2.2.6.1. The first example (Figure A2.2) is of a major operational activity-deployment
      of a large element to a foreign airbase. The initial analysis may be at a relatively macro
      level, listing the major events in the deployment scenario.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                53


Figure A2.2. Example Operations Analysis.




      A2.2.6.2. Any one event of the above sequence may be examined in more detail, if
      developing an OA of events for any one is deemed useful. For example, the planning
      phase can be selected for more detailed examination as illustrated in Figure A2.3

Figure A2.3. Example Planning Phase Events.




      A2.2.6.3. If more detail and more structured examination of the operation is desired, the
      flow diagram can be used. The flow diagram will add information through the use of
      graphic symbols and will add rigor to the process. A flow diagram of the planning phase
      above might be developed as illustrated in Figure A2.4
 54                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.4. Example Flow Diagram.




A2.3. The Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA). This tool is also known as the “Preliminary
Hazard List (PHL).”
   A2.3.1. PURPOSE. The PHA provides an initial overview of the hazards present in the
   overall flow of an operation. It provides a hazard assessment that is broad, but usually not
   deep. The key idea of the PHA is to, at least briefly, consider risk in every aspect of an
   operation. The PHA helps overcome the strong tendency in traditional, intuitive RM to focus
   immediately on risk in one aspect of an operation. This often leads to overlooking more
   serious issues hidden in other aspects of the operation. The PHA will often serve as the total
   hazard ID process when risk is low or routine. In higher risk operations/activities, it serves to
   focus and prioritize follow-on hazard analyses by displaying the full range of risk issues.
   A2.3.2. APPLICATION. The PHA is used in virtually all RM applications except the most
   time critical. Its broad scope is an excellent guide to the ID of issues that may require more
   detailed hazard ID tools.
   A2.3.3. METHOD. The PHA is usually based on the OA or flow diagram. Take each event
   in turn from the OA, apply experience and intuition, use reference publications/standards,
   and consult with personnel who have experience or knowledge useful to the analysis. The
   extent of the effort is dictated by available resources, time limitations and by the estimated
   degree of overall hazards inherent in the operation/activity. Identified hazards are often listed
   directly on a copy of the OA as illustrated in Figure A2.5 The output of the PHA is either
   hazards noted on the OA or the more formal completed PHA worksheet listing all of the
   hazards of each phase of the operation. The completed PHA is used to identify hazards
   requiring more in-depth hazard ID. A key to an effective PHA is to assure that all events of
   the operation are covered.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  55


Figure A2.5. Building the PHA from the OA Flow Diagram.




   A2.3.4. RESOURCES. The two key resources for the PHA are the expertise of personnel
   participating in the operation and the body of regulations, standards, technical orders (TOs)
   and operations instructions (OIs) that may be applicable. The PHA can be accomplished in
   small groups to broaden the base of experience and expertise. A copy of a quality PHA
   accomplished for an earlier, similar operation will expedite the process.
   A2.3.5. COMMENTS. The PHA is relatively easy to use and takes very little time. Its
   significant power to impact risk arises from the forced consideration of risk in all phases of
   an operation. The key to success is to link the PHA closely to the OA.
   A2.3.6. EXAMPLES. The following (Figure A2.6) is an example of a PHA.
 56                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.6. Example PHA.




A2.4. The “What If Tool” (WIT).
   A2.4.1. PURPOSE. The WIT is one of the most powerful hazard ID tools. It is designed to
   add structure to the intuitive and experiential expertise of operational personnel. The WIT is
   especially effective in capturing hazard data about failure modes. It is somewhat more
   structured and rigorous than the PHA. Because of its ease of use, it is probably the single
   most practical and effective tool for use by operational personnel.
   A2.4.2. APPLICATION. Because of its ease of use and effectiveness in identifying hazards,
   the WIT should be used in most hazard ID applications to include many time critical
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    57


   applications. The WIT is generally the first tool used after the OA and the PHA. For
   example, if the PHA reveals an area of hazard that needs additional investigation, the best
   single tool to further investigate the identified area will be the WIT. This tool will allow the
   user to home-in on a particular area of concern, add detail to the OA in the identified area,
   and then use the WIT procedure to dig out the hazards.
   A2.4.3. METHOD. It is imperative to ensure participants have a thorough knowledge of the
   anticipated flow of the operation. The WIT is initiated by visualizing the expected flow of
   events in their given sequence, from beginning to end. The user then identifies a segment of
   the operation on which to focus. This identified area is scrutinized for possible failures with
   the use of “Murphy’s Law.” The key is to ask “what if” various failures occur or problems
   arise. Potentially hazardous failures are then identified and added to a hazard list, where they
   will be assessed on probability and severity. Scenario style thinking will assist in expanding
   the hazard list. Follow the guidelines in Figure A2.7 to develop short scenarios, reflecting
   the worst credible outcome possible for given hazards.

Figure A2.7. Guidelines for Written Scenario Thinking.




   A2.4.4. RESOURCES. A key resource for the WIT is the OA. It may be desirable to add
   detail to the OA in the area to be targeted by the WIT analysis. However, in most cases the
   OA can be used as is. The WIT is specifically designed to be used by personnel actually
   involved in an operation. Therefore, the most critical WIT resource is the involvement of
   operators and their first line supervisors. Because of its effectiveness, dynamic character, and
   ease of application, these personnel are generally quite willing to support the WIT process.
   A2.4.5. COMMENTS. The WIT is so effective that the Occupational Safety and Health
   Administration (OSHA) designated it one of six tools from which activities facing
 58                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   catastrophic risk situations must choose under the mandatory hazard analysis provisions of
   the process safety standard.
   A2.4.6. EXAMPLES. Figure A2.8 illustrates an extract from the typical output of the WIT.

Figure A2.8. Example WIT Output.




A2.5. The Scenario Process Tool. This tool is alternately known as the “mental movie tool.”
   A2.5.1. PURPOSE. The scenario process tool is a time tested procedure to identify hazards
   by visualization. It is designed as a systematic and structured means of capturing the intuitive
   and experiential expertise of personnel involved in planning or executing an operation. In
   other words, it adds increased rigor to the intuitive and experiential processes of traditional
   RM. It is especially useful in connecting various individual hazards into scenarios that might
   actually occur. It is also used to visualize the worst credible outcome of one or more related
   hazards and is therefore an important contributor to the risk assessment process.
   A2.5.2. APPLICATION. Because of its simplicity and powerful ability to identify hazards,
   the scenario process tool should be used in most hazard ID applications to include some time
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    59


   critical applications. In the time critical mode, one of the few practical tools is the scenario
   process tool in which the user quickly forms a “mental movie” of the flow of events
   immediately ahead and the associated potential hazards.
   A2.5.3. METHOD. The user of the scenario process tool attempts to literally visualize the
   flow of events in an operation. This is often described as constructing a “mental movie”. It is
   often effective to literally close the eyes, relax and let the images flow. Usually the best
   procedure is to use the flow of events established in the OA. An effective tool is to actually
   visualize the flow of events twice. The first time, view the events as they are intended to
   flow. The next time, inject “Murphy’s Law” at every possible event. As hazards are
   visualized, they are recorded for further action. Follow the guidelines in Figure A2.9 to
   development effective scenarios.

Figure A2.9. Scenario Process Tool Event Building Guideline.




   A2.5.4. RESOURCES. The key resource for the scenario process tool is the OA. It provides
   the script for the flow of events that will be visualized. Because of its simplicity, key
   resources often available for the scenario process tool are the operational personnel leading
   or actually performing the mission. This tool is often entertaining, dynamic and motivating
   for even the most junior personnel in the organization.
   A2.5.5. COMMENTS. A special value of the scenario process tool is its ability to link two
   or more individual hazards, developed using other tools into a mission relevant scenario.
   A2.5.6. EXAMPLES. Figure A2.10 and Figure A2.11 are examples of how the scenario
   process tool might be used in an operational situation.

A2.6. The Logic Diagram. This tool is also referred to as the “logic tree.”
   A2.6.1. PURPOSE. The logic diagram is intended to provide the maximum structure and
   detail among the primary hazard ID procedures. Its graphic structure is an excellent means of
   capturing and correlating the hazard data produced by the other primary tools. Because of its
   graphic display, it can also be an effective hazard briefing tool. The structured and logical
   nature of the logic diagram adds substantial depth to the hazard ID process and it
   complements the other more intuitive and experiential tools. Finally, an important purpose of
   the logic diagram is to establish the connectivity and linkages that often exist between
   hazards. It does this very effectively through its tree-like structure.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    61


   A2.6.2. APPLICATION. Because it is more structured, the logic diagram requires more time
   and effort than other tools. Following the principles of RM, its use will be more limited than
   the other primary tools. This means limiting its use to higher risk issues. By nature it is also
   most effective with more complicated operations/activities in which several hazards may be
   interlinked. Because it is more complicated than the other primary tools, it requires more
   practice and may not appeal to all operational personnel. However, in an organizational
   climate committed to RM excellence, the logic diagram will be a welcomed and often used
   addition to the hazard ID armory.
   A2.6.3. METHOD. There are three major types of logic diagrams. Each diagram style is
   explained in Figure A2.12. All variants of the logic diagram can be applied to an actual or
   planned operating system. The best time for application is in the planning stages of the
   operational lifecycle. All of the logic diagram options begin with a top block. In the case of
   the positive diagram, this is a desired outcome; in the case of the event diagram, this is an
   operations/activities event or contingency possibility; in the case of the negative diagram, it
   is a loss event. When working with a positive or negative diagram, the user reasons out the
   factors that could produce the top event. These are developed into the subsequent line of
   blocks. With the event diagram, the user lists the possible results of the event being analyzed.
   The conditions that could produce the factors on the second line are then considered and they
   are entered on the third line. This process can go to several levels, but the utility of going
   beyond 3 or 4 levels is usually very limited. The goal is to be as logical as possible when
   constructing logic diagrams, but it is more important to keep the hazard ID goal in mind than
   to construct a masterpiece of logical thinking. Therefore, a logic diagram should be a
   worksheet with lots of changes and variations marked on it. Logic diagrams can be
   completed by a single individual, but with the addition of a chalkboard or flip chart, it also
   becomes an excellent group tool. Figure A2.13 is a generic diagram followed by a simplified
   example of each of the types of logic diagrams (Figure A2.14, Figure A2.15 and Figure
   A2.16).

A2.6.4. RESOURCES. All other primary tools are key resources for the logic diagram. The
logic diagram can correlate hazards generated by the other tools. If available, a safety
professional may be an effective facilitator for the logic diagram process.

   A2.6.5. COMMENTS. The logic diagram is the most comprehensive tool available among
   the primary procedures. Compared to traditional hazard ID approaches, the logic diagram
   will substantially increase the quantity and quality of hazards identified. Its versatility,
   arising from its many variations, also makes it an essential weapon in the operational leader’s
   RM toolbox.
   A2.6.6. EXAMPLE. Figure A2.17 illustrates how a negative diagram could be constructed
   when moving a heavy piece of equipment.

Figure A2.17. Example Negative Diagram.




A2.7. The Change Analysis.
   A2.7.1. PURPOSE. Historically, change has been an important source of risk in operational
   processes. Figure A2.18 illustrates this causal relationship. Some changes are planned, but
   many occur incrementally over time without any intentional or conscious direction. The
   change analysis is intended to analyze the hazard implications of either planned or unplanned
   changes. Properly used, the change analysis allows the RM process to focus on only the
   changed aspects of the operation. This eliminates the need to reanalyze the total operation
   simply because a change has occurred in one area. The change analysis is also used to detect
   the occurrence of change. By periodically and systematically comparing current procedures
   with previous procedures, unplanned changes are identified and clearly defined. Finally,
   change analysis is an important mishap investigation tool. Because many mishaps are caused
   by the injection of change into systems, an important investigative objective is to identify
   these changes using the change analysis procedure.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   65


Figure A2.18. Change Causation.




   A2.7.2. APPLICATION. Change analysis should be routinely used to periodically detect the
   occurrence of unplanned changes in important mission operations. It is also useful whenever
   significant changes are planned in an operation involving significant risk. A typical example
   of this type is when attempting to conduct an operation at night when it has only previously
   been accomplished during daylight hours. The change analysis tool is also a useful mishap
   investigation tool. It can be implemented retrospectively to better understand the change
   causation relationship. Finally, when an operation has been subjected to in-depth hazard
   analysis, this tool can be used to reveal if any elements exist in the current operation that
   were not considered in the previous in-depth analysis.
   A2.7.3. METHOD. The change analysis is best accomplished using a worksheet style
   format. The factors in the left column of Figure A2.19 are intended as a comprehensive
   change checklist.
   A2.7.4. RESOURCES. A key resource for the change analysis tool is experienced
   operational personnel who have long term involvement in an operational process. These
   personnel must help define the “comparable situation.” Another important resource is the
   documentation of process flows and task analyses. Analyses materials, in connection with
   quality improvement and reengineering projects, are excellent definitions of the baseline
   against which change can be evaluated.
   A2.7.5. COMMENTS. The change analysis is one of the most important hazard analysis
   tools. In organizations with mature RM processes, most, if not all, higher risk activities will
   have been subjected to thorough RM applications and the resulting risk controls will have
   been incorporated into operational guidance. Only if specific changes are detected will it be
   necessary to apply any RM procedures. If there is no change, optimum procedures will
   already have been fully integrated in the established operational guidance.
   A2.7.6. EXAMPLES. Figure A2.20 illustrates the comprehensive change checklist required
   for an adequate change analysis worksheet and represents a change analysis scenario.

Figure A2.19. Example Change Analysis.




A2.8. The Cause and Effect Tool. This tool is sometimes known as the “cause and effect
diagram,” “fishbone tool,” and the “Ishikawa diagram.”
   A2.8.1. PURPOSE. The Cause and Effect tool is a variation of the logic tree tool and is used
   in the same hazard ID role as the general logic diagram (i.e. a more rigorous and detailed
   tool).
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  67


  A2.8.2. APPLICATION. The tool is among the most commonly applied quality procedures
  and significant numbers of personnel are comfortable using it. It should be used in the same
  manner as the logic diagram previously covered and can be applied in both a positive and
  negative variation.
  A2.8.3. METHOD. The Cause and Effect diagram is essentially a logic diagram but with a
  significant variation. The Cause and Effect diagram provides more structure than the
  ordinary logic diagram through the branches that give it one of its alternate names, the
  fishbone diagram. Figure A2.20 illustrates this structure. Note that there are two basic
  variations, one for tactical type operations (the 4 “M”) and another for administrative
  processes (the 4 “P”). Of course the user can tailor the basic “bones” based on special
  characteristics of the operation or mission that is being analyzed. As in the case of the logic
  diagram, either a positive or negative outcome block is designated at the right side of the
  diagram. Then, using the structure of the diagram, the user or team of users completes the
  diagram by adding causal factors in either the “M” or “P” structure. By using branches off
  the basic entries, additional hazards can be added to the diagram. The examples provided
  illustrate this process. The Cause and Effect diagram is a very effective team hazard ID tool
  and should be used in a team setting whenever possible.
  A2.8.4. RESOURCES. Personnel should consult online resources and associated
  publications for more specific information and examples on the Cause and Effect tool and
  related diagrams.
  A2.8.5. COMMENTS. This procedure has proven very effective and has established the
  cause and effect diagram as a powerful hazard ID tool.
  A2.8.6. EXAMPLES. An example of the Cause and Effect tool and diagram is illustrated at
  Figure A2.20
 68                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013

Section A2B—The Specialty Hazard ID Tools.
A2.9. INTRODUCTION. The fourteen tools that follow are specialty hazard ID tools designed
to augment the primary tools outlined in Section A2A, as needed. These specialty tools,
illustrated in Figure A2.21, fulfill several purposes as described in the figure. An organization
with a mature RM culture should be aware of the existence of these specialty tools and will be
capable of recognizing the need for their application in support of the primary tools. While not
all personnel will be comfortable using some of these procedures, a number of personnel within
the organization should have experience applying them. MAJCOM, wing and unit RM process
managers, instructors/advisors, etc., should be able to assist in facilitating their application. The
following pages describe each tool using a standard format, with models and examples.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   69


Figure A2.21. Purposes Fulfilled by Specialty Hazard ID Tools.




A2.10. The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Tool.
   A2.10.1. PURPOSE. The special role of the HAZOP is hazard analysis of completely new
   operations/activities. In these situations, traditional intuitive and experiential hazard ID
   procedures are especially weak. Because they are totally new, no one has any experience and
   there is little basis for intuition. This lack of experience hobbles tools such as the WIT and
   Scenario Process Tools which rely heavily on experienced operational personnel. The
   HAZOP deliberately maximizes structure and minimizes the need for experience to increase
   its usefulness in these novel situations.
   A2.10.2. APPLICATION. As indicated above, the HAZOP should be considered when a
   completely new process or procedure is undertaken. The issue should be one where there is
   significant risk because the HAZOP demands significant expenditure of effort and may not
   be cost effective if used against low risk issues. The HAZOP is also useful when an operator
   or leader senses that “something is wrong” but can’t identify it. The process of the HAZOP
   will dig very deep into the operation and is very likely to identify what the “something” is.
   A2.10.3. METHOD. The HAZOP is certainly the most highly structured of the hazard ID
   procedures. It uses a standard set of guidewords (Figure A2.22) which are then linked in
   every possible way with a tailored set of process terms (for example “flow”). The process
   terms are developed directly from the actual process or from the OA. The two words
   together, for example “no” (a guide word) and “flow” (a process term) will describe a
   deviation. These are then evaluated to see if a meaningful hazard is indicated. If so, the
   hazard is entered in the hazard inventory for further evaluation. Because of its rigid process,
   the HAZOP is especially suitable for one person hazard ID efforts.
 70                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.22. Standard HAZOP Guidewords.




   A2.10.4. RESOURCES. Because of its rigid characteristics, there are few base-level
   resources available to assist with HAZOP; however, numerous HAZOP references can be
   found via internet search.
   A2.10.5. COMMENTS. The HAZOP is highly structured, one could say “rigid,” and often
   quite time-consuming. Nevertheless, in its special role, this tool works very effectively. It
   was selected by OSHA for inclusion in the set of six mandated procedures of the OSHA
   process safety standard.
   A2.10.6. EXAMPLES. Extracts from a HAZOP application are illustrated in Figure A2.23.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                71


Figure A2.23. HAZOP Application.




A2.11. The Mapping Tool. This tool is also known as “map analysis.”
   A2.11.1. PURPOSE. The map analysis is designed to use terrain maps and other system
   models and schematics to identify resources at risk and sources of hazards. It is a powerful
   and convenient tool that can be easily linked to the military’s heavy dependence on maps.
   Properly applied the tool will provide the benefits listed in Figure A2.24.
 72                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.24. Benefits of the Mapping Tool.




   A2.11.2. APPLICATION. The mapping tool is an extremely versatile tool that can be used
   in a wide variety of situations. The explosive quantity-distance criteria is a classic example of
   map analysis. The location of the explosives is plotted and then the distance to various targets
   (inhabited buildings, highways, etc.) is determined. The same principles can be extended to
   almost any facility. We can use a diagram of a maintenance shop to note the location of
   hazards such as gases, pressure vessels, flammables, etc. Key assets can also be plotted. Then
   potentially hazardous interactions are noted and the layout of the facility can be optimized in
   terms of risk reduction. Another obvious use is in the layout of billeting and bivouac areas
   from the point of view of both safety and force protection.
   A2.11.3. METHOD. The mapping tool requires some creativity to realize its full potential.
   The starting point is a map, facility layout, or equipment schematic. The locations of
   potential hazard sources are noted. Locating energy sources is the easiest way to detect
   potential hazards. All hazards involve the unwanted release of energy. Figure A2.25 lists the
   basic kinds of energy in question. Mark the locations of these sources on the map or diagram.
   Then, keeping the mission in mind, locate the personnel, equipment, and facilities that the
   various potentially hazardous energy sources could impact. Note these potentially hazardous
   links and enter them in the hazard inventory for RM.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     73


Figure A2.25. Major Types of Energy.




   A2.11.4. RESOURCES. When working with terrain maps, someone who has actually seen
   the terrain in question is an invaluable asset. Maps can convey a great deal of information,
   but they cannot replace the value of an on-site assessment. Similarly, when working with an
   equipment schematic or a facility layout, there is no substitute for an on-site inspection of the
   equipment or survey of the facility. GeoBase capabilities may be available on-base through
   the CE office or other agency.
   A2.11.5. COMMENTS. The map analysis is valuable in itself, but it is also excellent input
   for many other tools such as the interface analysis, energy trace and barrier analysis, and
   change analysis.
   A2.11.6. EXAMPLE. The following example (Figure A2.26) illustrates the use of a facility
   schematic that focuses on the energy sources there as might be accomplished in support of an
   energy trace and barrier analysis.

Figure A2.26. Example Map Analysis.
 74                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


A2.12. The Interface Analysis.
   A2.12.1. PURPOSE. The interface analysis is intended to uncover the potentially hazardous
   linkages or interfaces between otherwise unrelated activities. For example, if a new facility is
   planned for a base, this tool will help identify what hazards may be created for other
   operations on the base during construction and after the facility is opened. The interface
   analysis focuses on energy exchanges to reveal these potential hazards. A hazard necessarily
   involves the transfer of energy from one point to another. By looking at these potential
   energy transfers between two different activities, it is possible to detect important hazards
   that are difficult to detect any other way.
   A2.12.2. APPLICATION. Generally speaking, an interface analysis should be conducted
   any time a new activity is being introduced and there is any chance of an unfavorable
   interaction.
A good cue to the need for an interface analysis is the use of either the change analysis
(indicating the injection of something new) or the map analysis (with the possibility of
interactions).
   A2.12.3. METHOD. The interface analysis is normally based on an outline such as the one
   illustrated at Figure A2.27 Interfaces take the form of energy exchanges, so the outline
   provides a list of potential energy types and guides consideration of the potential interactions.
   A determination is made whether a particular type of energy is present and then whether
   there is potential for that form of energy to adversely impact on other activities. As in
   virtually all aspects of hazard ID, the creation of a good OA assures that interactions in all
   phases of the lifecycle are considered.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     75


Figure A2.27. The Interface Analysis Worksheet.




   A2.12.4. RESOURCES. Interface analyses are best accomplished when personnel from all
   of the involved activities participate in the process. In this way hazards and interfaces in both
   directions can be effectively and knowledgeably addressed. A safety office representative can
   also be useful in advising on possible types and characteristics of energy transfers.
   A2.12.5. COMMENTS. The lessons of the past indicate that the interface analysis is an
   invaluable tool. Serious adverse mission consequences have proven an issue for many past
   military operations because of overlooked interfaces.
   A2.12.6. EXAMPLE. An interface analysis using the general outline is shown in Figure
   A2.28
 76                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.28. Example Interface Analysis.




A2.13. The Mission Protection Tool.
   A2.13.1. PURPOSE. The mission protection tool is designed to focus explicitly on
   protection of the mission rather than on protection of personnel or things. The tool recognizes
   the fact that the mission/activity can be stopped partially or completely by events that may
   injure no one and cause very little damage. Since there is little injury or damage risk, these
   hazards could easily be categorized as low risk under traditional criteria. This tool focuses on
   the key components of mission/activity continuity and success, and what could interrupt
   them. A special characteristic of the mission protection analysis is its consideration of any
   source of mission/activity interruption, not just those arising from traditional mishap sources.
   For example, a mission protection analysis is as concerned about the interruption of
   mission/activity critical spare parts due to a transportation strike as it would be as a result of
   an interruption caused by a vehicle mishap.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                77


  A2.13.2. APPLICATION. As time and resources permit, mission protection analyses should
  be completed on all the major missions of an organization. The most important missions
  should be analyzed first with other missions following in the appropriate order.
  A2.13.3. METHOD. The mission protection analysis has no particular method. This tool is
  characterized by its focus rather than its method. When the decision is made to complete a
  mission protection application, the responsible person examines the nature of the mission and
  then chooses the most effective hazard ID tools. The most likely tools to be used are the
  primary hazard ID tools, but many of the specialty hazard ID tools will also be useful.
  Mission protection analyses can be extended to any level of detail, but for important
  missions, the in-depth analysis is appropriate.
  A2.13.4. RESOURCES. A clear and detailed statement of the mission/activity is an
  important resource for the mission protection tool. Also, diagrams of the key processes used
  to accomplish the mission/activity are important.
  A2.13.5. COMMENTS. The idea of mission is at the heart of the RM process. What is RM
  all about? Optimizing the mission! The mission protection tool is central to fully effective
  RM.
  A2.13.6. EXAMPLES. An example of the process that might be used to select a set of tools
  for the mission protection analysis of a mission critical computer facility is illustrated in
  Figure A2.29 .
 78                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.29. Example Mission Protection Application.




A2.14. The Safety Quiz. The formal name of this tool is the “safety knowledge assessment.” It
is more commonly referred to as the “safety quiz.”
   A2.14.1. PURPOSE. Human error is a key causal factor in mishaps and the creation of risk.
   One key source of human error is lack of knowledge of hazards and risk control procedures.
   The safety quiz is designed to measure the degree to which critical hazard and risk control
   knowledge is possessed by a given target group. Another aspect of the safety quiz tool is the
   attitude survey. The objective is to assess attitudes toward risk control processes and
   requirements.
   A2.14.2. APPLICATION. The safety quiz should be used to assess the status of risk related
   knowledge and attitudes that are connected to high and extremely high risk issues. It should
   also be used when other hazard ID tools seem to indicate a skill, knowledge, or attitudinal
   problem. Alternatively this tool can be used to assess progress in continuously improving
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  79


  these key areas. In these situations, the quiz is used to assess the degree of the problem and
  pinpoint the specific areas of weakness.
  A2.14.3. METHOD. The key to the safety quiz is the selection and development of the
  questions that are placed on the quiz. It is essential that questions be solidly linked to real
  hazards. The questions must truly determine if the target group has the necessary skills and
  knowledge or attitudes to perform safely. Note that the group may not be performing safely
  even though it has the needed knowledge. In these cases, the problem is motivation, not skills
  or knowledge. A second important consideration is the administrative process of
  administering and using the quiz. Quizzes should be timed to minimize the administrative
  burden on the organization. Safety standdown days are an excellent opportunity to use
  quizzes. Also care should be taken to avoid embarrassing individuals who may score poorly.
  There may be many reasons for poor performance and it is important not to turn the quiz
  process into a negative event. The quiz should be only as long as necessary to evaluate key
  knowledge and attitudes.
  A2.14.4. RESOURCES. An experienced trainer can be of real help in insuring questions are
  well developed. An effective database or risk information management system (RIMS) is
  also important in selecting the critical skills and knowledge to be evaluated.
  A2.14.5. COMMENTS. The safety quiz is an efficient and effective way to ensure that an
  organization possesses the risk control skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to achieve RM
  success.
  A2.14.6. EXAMPLES. Extracts from safety quizzes targeted at skills and knowledge are
  provided in Figure A2.30
 80                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.30. Example Safety Quiz Application.




A2.15. The Next Mishap Assessment.
   A2.15.1. PURPOSE. Research has established that there are certain indicators that show a
   statistically significant correlation with high risk of mishap involvement. The Next Mishap
   Assessment uses this information to assess the likelihood that a given activity or situation
   will result in a mishap. The ability to pinpoint risks opens the door to resolution with focused
   effort.
   A2.15.2. APPLICATION. The Next Mishap Assessment is an excellent safety standdown
   day or safety meeting agenda item. Variations of the Next Mishap Assessment tool exist to
   support individual self assessment or for leaders to assess inputs from their subordinates.
   Because an organization’s risk changes over time as mission circumstances change, it is
   useful to repeat the assessment process once every year or two.
   A2.15.3. METHOD. There are a variety of Next Mishap Assessment tools which should be
   utilized over locally developed assessment tools. Locally developed assessment tools should
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     81


   be avoided because the research necessary to validate the product cannot normally be
   accomplished by anyone other than specialized professionals. These include:
      A2.15.3.1. Self assessment tools that are used by individuals and only the user knows the
      outcome.
      A2.15.3.2. Tools specialized to the aviation arena.
   A2.15.4. RESOURCES. There are a variety of established next mishap assessment tools.
   Guidance on locating these tools can be obtained from the AF Safety Center or a local safety
   office. Other copyrighted tools may be commercially available.
   A2.15.5. COMMENTS. Next mishap assessments are effective tools that allow focus
   specifically where the problems are, not on everything. That is the essence of the RM
   process.
   A2.15.6. EXAMPLES. Examples of these tools can be obtained from the sources outlined
   above.
A2.16. The Mission Mishap Analysis. This tool is also known as the “mission accident
analysis.”
   A2.16.1. PURPOSE. Most organizations have accumulated extensive, detailed mishap
   databases that are gold mines of risk data. The purpose of the mission mishap analysis is to
   assure that this data is being effectively applied to the prevention of mishaps.
   A2.16.2. APPLICATION. Every organization should complete a mission mishap analysis
   annually. The objective is to update the understanding of current mishap trends and causal
   factors. Changes that occur in less than a year are not likely to be statistically significant.
   Waiting more than a year may cause important changes in trends to be missed. The analysis
   should be completed for each organizational component that is likely to have unique mishap
   factors.
   A2.16.3. METHOD. The art and science of mishap analysis can be approached in many
   ways. Essentially it relies on Pareto’s Principle (the fact that in a wide variety of activities,
   80% of the problems are found in 20% of the exposure). For example, 80% of the unsafe acts
   in a group of employees may be committed by only 20% of the employees. The process of
   mission mishap analysis is finding the 20% of personnel, facilities, activities, etc. that are
   causing the bulk of the risk in an organization. If the mishap database is computerized, the
   computer can do much of the initial sorting of data. A human analyst will have to do the final
   interpretation of the data. If the work must be done manually, the process involves
   determining likely risk factors and then examining the data to determine if those factors in
   fact exist. Typical factors to examine include those listed in Figure A2.31.
 82                                                     AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.31. Typical Examination Factors.




   A2.16.4. RESOURCES. The mission mishap analysis relies on a relatively complete and
   accurate mishap database. The base safety office will normally have the needed data. That
   office can also provide assistance in the analysis process. Safety personnel may have already
   completed analyses of similar activities or they may be able to suggest the most productive
   areas for initial analysis.
   A2.16.5. COMMENTS. The data in mishap databases has been acquired the hard way -
   through the painful and costly mistakes of hundreds of individuals. It is tragic when
   organizations fail to take full advantage of this information and therefore doom themselves to
   experience the same failures over and over again.
   A2.16.6. EXAMPLES. Examples of mishap analyses and mishap data available can be
   obtained from servicing safety offices.
A2.17. The Interview Tool.
   A2.17.1. PURPOSE. Some of the most knowledgeable personnel in the area of risk are the
   personnel who are operating the system. They are there every working hour of every working
   day, seeing the problems and hopefully occasionally thinking about potential solutions. The
   purpose of the interview tool is to capture the risk related experience of these personnel in
   ways that are efficient and positive for the people involved. Properly implemented, the
   interview tool can be among the most valuable hazard ID tools.
   A2.17.2. APPLICATION. Because of its versatility, it is possible for any and every
   organization to use the interview tool in one form or another.
   A2.17.3. METHOD. The interview tool’s greatest strength is versatility. Figure A2.32
   illustrates the many options available to collect interview data. A key to all of these is
   creating a situation in which personnel feel free to honestly report what they know without
   fear of any retribution or adverse consequences. This means absolute anonymity. This may
   be guaranteed by not using names in connection with data.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    83


Figure A2.32. Interview Tool Alternative.




   A2.17.4. RESOURCES. It is possible to operate the interview process on a base-wide basis
   with the data being supplied to individual units. Interview processes can also be integrated in
   other interview activities. For example, leader-subordinate counseling sessions can be
   modified to include a hazard interview segment. In these ways, the expertise and resource
   demands of the interview tool can be minimized.
   A2.17.5. COMMENTS. The heart of the mishap problem and the key source of risk is
   human error. Of all the hazard ID tools, the interview tool is potentially the most effective at
   capturing human error data. By choosing from among the many variations of the tool, it can
   also be among the most effective.
   A2.17.6. EXAMPLES. Figure A2.32 illustrates several variations of the interview tool. One
   or more of these can be effective in your organization. For example, the exit interview tool
   asks individuals leaving the command to report hazards on a short form (Figure A2.33)
   completed during the outprocessing cycle. Because they are outprocessing, there is no loss of
   productivity and personnel tend to be more open and candid in their comments.

A2.18. The Inspection Tool. This tool is also known as the “assessment tool.”
   A2.18.1. PURPOSE. Inspections have two primary purposes. The first is the detection of
   hazards. Inspections accomplish this through direct observation of operations/activities. The
   process is aided by the existence of detailed standards against which operations/activities can
   be compared. AF Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards and Occupational
   Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards in conjunction with other national
   standards organizations provide good examples. The other purpose of the inspection tool is to
   evaluate the degree of compliance with established risk controls. When inspections are
   targeted at management and safety management processes they are usually called
   assessments. These assessments gauge the effectiveness of management procedures by
   evaluating status against survey criteria or standard. In addition to the two major objectives
   outlined above, inspections are also important as accountability tools and can even be turned
   into important training opportunities.
   A2.18.2. APPLICATION. Inspections and assessments are used in the RM process in much
   the same manner as in traditional safety programs. However, in the RM concept these tools
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    85


   are much more focused on critical risk factors. Where the traditional approach may require
   that all facilities be inspected on the same frequency schedule, the RM concept would dictate
   that high risk activities may be inspected more frequently than lower risk
   operations/activities, and that some of the lowest risk operations/activities might only be
   inspected once every few years. The degree of risk drives the frequency and depth of the
   inspections and surveys.
   A2.18.3. METHOD. There are as many methods of conducting inspections as there are
   safety offices. From a RM point of view, the key target is focusing on what will be inspected.
   The RM response is the highest risks. The first and most important step in effective
   inspections is the selection of inspection criteria and the development of the inspection
   checklist or protocol. This must be a risk-based process. Commercial protocols are available
   that contain criteria validated to be connected with safety excellence. Alternatively, excellent
   criteria can be developed using mishap databases and the results of other hazard ID tools
   such as the OA and logic diagrams, etc. Many excellent inspection and assessment processes
   have been developed within the AF. Some of these have been computerized to facilitate entry
   and processing of data. Once solid criteria are developed, a schedule is created and
   inspections may begin. It is important that the conduct of the inspection be as positive an
   experience as possible. Personnel performing inspections should be carefully trained, not
   only in the technical processes involved, but also in the human relations aspects. During
   inspections, the RM concept encourages another departure from traditional inspection
   practices. Instead of noting deficient performance as in traditional procedures, the RM
   concept also encourages recording observations that meet or exceed the standard. This
   practice makes it possible to evaluate the trend in organizational performance by calculating
   the percentage of unsafe (non-standard) versus safe (meets or exceeds standards)
   observations. Once the observations are made the data must be carefully entered in the
   overall hazard inventory database. Once in the database the data can be analyzed as part of
   the overall body of data or as a mini-database composed of inspection findings only.
   A2.18.4. RESOURCES. As noted above there are many inspection criteria, checklists and
   related job aids available commercially and within the AF. Many of these have been tailored
   for specific types of organizations and activities. The local safety office can be a valuable
   resource in the development of inspection and assessment criteria. It can also provide
   technical support in the form of interpretations, procedural guidance, and correlation of
   inspection data with other like units.
   A2.18.5. COMMENTS. Inspections and assessments have long track records of success in
   detecting hazards and reducing risk. They have been criticized as being inconsistent with
   modern management practices because they are a form of “downstream” quality control. By
   the time a hazard is detected, it already exists and may have already caused loss. The RM
   approach to inspections emphasizes focus on the higher risks within the organization and
   emphasizes the use of management and safety program surveys that detect the underlying
   root causes of hazards rather than the hazards themselves.
Properly designed and conducted, inspections and assessments retain a vital place in an effective
RM process.
   A2.18.6. EXAMPLES. Conventional inspections normally involve seeking and recording
   unsafe acts/conditions. The number of unsafe acts/conditions can be the result of either the
 86                                                        AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   number of unsafe acts/conditions in the organization or possibly the extent of effort extended
   to find hazards. Conventional inspections can never be a reliable indicator of the extent of
   risk. To change the nature of the process to reliably indicate the extent of risk, it is often only
   necessary to record the total number of observations made of key behaviors and then
   determine the number of unsafe behaviors. This yields a rate of “unsafe behavior” that is
   independent of the number of observations made.
A2.19. The Mishap/Incident Investigation. This is also known as the “incident tool.”
   A2.19.1. PURPOSE. The traditional mishap investigation has the objective of determining
   the causes of a mishap so that these causes can be eliminated or mitigated. The RM approach
   adds a new dimension to the traditional concept. RM stresses the determination of the
   inadequacies in the RM process that allowed the mishap cause factors to impact the
   organization. A mishap investigation therefore becomes primarily an investigation of the RM
   process itself to determine if it can be strengthened to control the risk factors that led to the
   mishap. The question now is not only what the cause is, but also how could the cause exist in
   the context of the RM process.
   A2.19.2. APPLICATION. Ideally all mishaps and incidents should be thoroughly
   investigated. Unfortunately, mishap investigations are expensive. The organization should
   have a process to select mishaps and incidents against which to allocate limited investigative
   resources. Severity is a relevant factor in this decision, but it should not be the dominant
   factor that it is in most investigation systems today. Simply because a mishap was serious
   does not mean that it is worth in-depth investigation. On the other hand, what appears on the
   surface to be a minor incident may be a gold mine of data regarding RM processes. An
   effective risk manager will be able to sort out the opportunities and direct the investigative
   effort where it will produce the best return on investment.
   A2.19.3. METHOD. Both the technical and management processes involved in a
   mishap/incident investigation are complex beyond the scope of this publication. Detailed
   guidance is provided in AF publications. From a RM perspective the key is to investigate the
   RM issues that are factors in the direct mishap causes. Only by correcting these root RM
   cause factors will the mishap investigation process be fully effective.
   A2.19.4. RESOURCES. Most safety offices have personnel trained in the mishap
   investigation processes. They can serve as consultants in this critical process. Policy and
   procedures to follow in the process of investigating and reporting mishaps is contained in
   AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and applicable supplements.
   A2.19.5. COMMENTS. Mishap and incident investigations have a long track record of
   success in preventing future mishaps.
   A2.19.6. EXAMPLES. Base safety offices can provide guidance on the investigation and
   reporting process and on the use of the data for hazard ID.
A2.20. The Job Hazard Analysis (JHA). This tool is also known as the “task analysis,” “job
safety analysis” (JSA) tools.
   A2.20.1. PURPOSE. The purpose of the JHA is to examine in detail the safety
   considerations of a single job. A variation of the JHA called the task analysis focuses on a
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     87


   single task. The idea is to get into the job or task in detail and maximize the effectiveness of
   the safety procedures.
   A2.20.2. APPLICATION. There are certain situations that supervisors are required to
   perform a JSA (See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program). Some
   organizations have established the goal of completing JHAs on every job in the organization.
   If this can be accomplished cost effectively, it is a worthwhile goal. Certainly, the higher risk
   jobs in an organization warrant application of the JHA procedure. Within the RM approach,
   it is important that such a plan be accomplished by beginning with the most significant risk
   areas first.
   A2.20.3. METHOD. The JHA is best accomplished using an outline similar to the one
   illustrated at Table A2.2 As shown on the illustration, the job is broken down into the
   individual job steps. Jobs that involve many quite different tasks should probably be handled
   by analyzing each major task on a separate form. Notice that the illustration considers both
   risks to the workers involved and to the system. It also considers risk controls for both risk
   issues. Tools such as the "Scenario" and "WIT" can contribute to the ID of potential worker
   or system hazards. There are two basic strategies for accomplishing the JHA process. The
   first involves a safety professional completing the process by asking questions of the workers
   and supervisors involved. The second involves providing supervisors training in the JHA
   process and motivating them to analyze the jobs they supervise.

Table A2.2. Sample Job Hazard Analysis Format.




   A2.20.4. RESOURCES. Most safety offices have personnel trained in the JHA process.
   They can serve as consultants to walk personnel through the entire process. Refer to AFI 91-
   202, for further guidance.
   A2.20.5. COMMENTS. The concept of completing in-depth hazard assessments of all jobs
   involving significant risk with the active participation of the personnel doing the work is an
   ideal model of RM in action.
 88                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   A2.20.6. EXAMPLES. Examples can be obtained from Safety Offices on many different
   types of operations/activities.
A2.21. The Behavior Observation Tool (BOT). This tool is also known as the “performance
management tool.”
   A2.21.1. PURPOSE. The BOT is a specialized inspection tool designed to improve
   performance in risk critical behavioral areas and create a high degree of positive employee
   involvement. It uses modern performance management technology to create performance
   improvements in risk critical areas.
   A2.21.2. APPLICATION. The BOT is a sophisticated tool that requires the commitment of
   the total organization. If an adequate foundation is in place, the BOT can vastly improve
   safety performance. Because of the resource demands of the process, it should only be
   undertaken in situations in which risk reductions will produce important mission benefits.
   A2.21.3. METHOD. The BOT process consists of several steps. The first is the commitment
   of management to the process. This commitment is ideally undertaken with full consultation
   with operating personnel of the organization and with union leaders if civilian employees are
   involved. The second step is to identify critical behaviors. These are behaviors that have a
   clear and direct connection to risk and associated losses in the organization. Selection of
   critical behaviors should involve the full participation of operators. These critical behaviors
   are carefully analyzed and the criteria for safe versus unsafe performance are clearly stated.
   On this foundation, a group of employees from the various organizational elements
   participating in the application are selected and trained in the BOT inspection process. This
   training involves clearly understanding the safe behavior criteria and, more importantly, the
   procedures for making observations of fellow employees. The trained observers make
   workplace observations of their fellow employees on a regular schedule. The observations
   are performed in an open and non-threatening manner with the full knowledge of the
   employee(s) being observed. The observer provides immediate feedback to the employees
   stressing things done correctly, but noting unsafe performance as well; the feedback is
   provided in a confidential and non-attribution manner. The observer then provides feedback
   to a program coordinator regarding the percent safe versus unsafe for each of the critical
   behaviors. This data is not linked to any particular observations to protect the confidentiality
   of all involved. The program coordinator then rolls the data up into a total for each critical
   behavior. This information is provided to the total workforce on a regular schedule, at least
   monthly. This is often accomplished using a large graph posted right in the workplace. As
   certain major “safe” behavior milestones are reached, the work group may claim certain
   rewards.
   A2.21.4. RESOURCES. Some DoD locations may have experience in the implementation of
   the behavior observation tool, but personnel should utilize on-line resources for finding BOT
   and performance management tool examples.
   A2.21.5. COMMENTS. The BOT is a powerful, high operator involvement tool that can
   dramatically reduce unsafe behavior and ultimately mishaps. Successful application requires
   sophisticated understanding of the tool and the willingness to invest considerable resources
   up-front in the form of training and observation time. Success also depends on the
   organization using it possessing certain characteristics that form a foundation for BOT
   application.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  89


   A2.21.6. EXAMPLES. A flow diagram illustrating the BOT implementation process is
   illustrated at Figure A2.34

Figure A2.34. BOT Implementation Process.




A2.22. Training Realism Assessment (TRA).
   A2.22.1. PURPOSE. The TRA is a procedure intended to assist in the detection and
   elimination or modification of safety restrictions that prevent fully effective training of
   military missions. Using a logic tree, the TRA assists in the detection of training realism
   shortcomings and then guides the user through the alternatives for overcoming them.
   A2.22.2. APPLICATION. The TRA is among the most critical RM procedures in military
   organizations. The TRA should be applied in every case where there are significant
   differences between how the organization trains and how it intends to fight. It can also be
   used periodically to detect such differences.
   A2.22.3. METHOD. The TRA uses a job aid such as the one shown at Figure A2.35 The
   user identifies either a training application or a combat procedure. The training procedure is
   then compared step-by-step with the combat procedure (or vice versa). When differences are
   detected they are evaluated using the procedures in the job aid.
 90                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.35. Example Job Aid.




   A2.22.4. RESOURCES. Effective use of the TRA depends on the availability of personnel
   who understand in detail both the training and combat procedures.
   A2.22.5. COMMENTS. In a military organization, the TRA is a primary RM tool that
   cannot be overlooked. RM seeks to create the optimum level of risk, not the lowest level of
   risk. The TRA is a key tool in achieving the optimum goal. Omitting use of the TRA creates
   the real risk that the RM process may result in inappropriately conservative risk decision
   making in pursuit of reduced risk as an end in itself. However, do not forget that RM does
   not authorize violation of policy or standards. If an assessment identifies an area where a
   policy or standard unnecessarily restricts operations/activities, seek to have the item changed
   or request a waiver as appropriate through applicable channels.
   A2.22.6. EXAMPLES. An example of the TRA in action is provided at Figure A2.36 Note
   that training realism assessments almost invariable create controversy. The objective of the
   tool is to resolve this controversy on the basis of the best possible information and on the
   foundation of the best possible RM principles. The outcome should be a course of action in
   the best interests of the overall AF and national interests.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   91


Figure A2.36. Example TRA.




A2.23. The Opportunity Assessment. This is also known as the “opportunity-risk” tool.
   A2.23.1. PURPOSE. The opportunity assessment is intended to identify opportunities to
   expand the capabilities of the organization and/or to significantly reduce the operational cost
   of risk control procedures. Either of these possibilities means expanded mission capabilities
   and superiority over potential future adversaries.
   A2.23.2. APPLICATION. Organizations should be systematically assessing their
   capabilities on a regular basis, especially in mission critical areas. The opportunity
   assessment can be one of the most useful tools in this process and therefore should be
   completed on all significant missions and be periodically updated at least every two years.
 92                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   A2.23.3. METHOD. The opportunity assessment involves five key steps as outlined at
   Figure A2.37:
      A2.23.3.1. Step 1 involves identifying and prioritizing mission areas that would benefit
      substantially from expanded capabilities. Additionally, areas where risk controls are
      consuming extensive resources or constraining mission capabilities are listed and
      prioritized.
      A2.23.3.2. Step 2 involves the analysis of the specific risk-related barriers that are
      limiting the desired expanded performance or causing the significant expense. This is a
      critical step. Only by identifying the risk issues precisely can focused effort be brought to
      bear to overcome them.
      A2.23.3.3. Step 3 attacks the barriers by using the RM process. This normally involves
      reassessment of the hazards, application of improved risk controls, improved
      implementation of existing controls, or a combination of these options.
      A2.23.3.4. Step 4 is used when available RM procedures don’t appear to offer any
      breakthrough possibilities. In these cases the organization must seek out new RM tools
      using benchmarking procedures or, if necessary, innovate new procedures.
      A2.23.3.5. Step 5 involves the exploitation of any breakthroughs achieved by pushing
      the operational limits or cost saving until a new barrier is reached. The cycle then repeats
      and a process of continuous improvement begins.

Figure A2.37. Opportunity Analysis Steps.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 93


  A2.23.4. RESOURCES. The opportunity assessment depends on a detailed understanding of
  mission processes so that barriers can be identified. An effective opportunity assessment will
  necessarily involve the input of operations experts.
  A2.23.5. COMMENTS. Properly implemented, at least half the value of RM should be
  realized in the form of expanded mission capabilities. The opportunity assessment is a
  process by which that benefit is achieved.
  A2.23.6. EXAMPLES. An example of the opportunity assessment is provided in Figure
  A2.38

Section A2C—The Advanced Hazard ID Tools.
A2.24. INTRODUCTION. The five tools that follow are advanced hazard ID tools designed to
support strategic hazard analysis of higher risk and mission critical operations/activities. These
advanced tools are often essential when in-depth hazard ID is needed. These advanced tools
provide the mechanism needed to push the limits of current hazard ID technology. For example,
the management oversight and risk tree (MORT) represents the full-time efforts of dozens of
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   95


experts over decades to fully develop an understanding of all of the sources of hazards. As might
be expected, these tools are complex and require significant training to use and full proficiency
requires experience. As a result, these tools are generally used exclusively by loss control
professionals. Of course, personnel with a background in engineering, science, or other technical
background are certainly capable of using these tools with a little read-in. Even though the tools
are used by professionals, much of the data that must be fed into the procedures must come from
operators. In an organization with a mature RM culture, all personnel in the organization will be
aware that higher risk justifies more extensive hazard ID. They will feel comfortable calling for
help from various loss control professionals, confident that these individuals have the advanced
hazard ID tools needed to cope with the most serious risk situations. These advanced tools will
play a key role in the mature RM culture in helping the organization reach its hazard ID goal: No
significant hazard undetected.
A2.25. The Energy Trace and Barrier Analysis (ETBA).
   A2.25.1. PURPOSE. The ETBA is a professional level procedure intended to detect hazards
   by focusing in detail on the presence of energy in a system and the barriers for controlling
   that energy. It is conceptually similar to the interface analysis in its focus on energy forms,
   but is considerably more thorough and systematic.
   A2.25.2. APPLICATION. The ETBA is intended for use by loss control professionals and is
   targeted against higher risk operations/activities, especially those involving large amounts of
   energy or a wide variety of energy types. The method is used extensively in the acquisition of
   new weapons systems and other complex systems.
   A2.25.3. METHOD. The ETBA involves 5 basic steps as shown at Figure A2.39:
       A2.25.3.1. Step 1 is the ID of the types of energy found in the system. It often requires
       considerable expertise to detect the presence of the types of energy listed at Figure A2.40
       A2.25.3.2. Step 2 is the trace step. Once identified as present, the point of origin of a
       particular type of energy must be determined and then the flow of that energy through the
       system must be traced.
       A2.25.3.3. Step 3 analyzes the barriers to the unwanted release of that energy. For
       example, electrical energy is usually moved in wires with an insulated covering.
       A2.25.3.4. Step 4 assesses the risk of barrier failure and the unwanted release of the
       energy.
       A2.25.3.5. Step 5 considers and selects risk control options.
 96                                                    AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A2.39. ETBA Steps.




Figure A2.40. Types of Energy




   A2.25.4. RESOURCES. This tool requires sophisticated understanding of the technical
   characteristics of systems and of the various energy types and barriers. Consultation with a
   safety professional, especially a safety engineer or other professional engineer is
   recommended when utilizing this tool.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              97


   A2.25.5. COMMENTS. All mishaps involve the unwanted release of one kind of energy or
   another. This fact makes the ETBA a powerful hazard ID tool. When the risk stakes are high
   and the system is complex, the ETBA is a must have.
   A2.25.6. EXAMPLES. A simplified (no use of electrical schematics) example of the ETBA
   procedure is provided at Figure A2.41

Figure A2.41. Example ETBA Procedure.




A2.26. The Fault Tree Analysis (FTA).
 98                                                       AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   A2.26.1. PURPOSE. The fault tree analysis (FTA), also called the “probabilistic logic tree",
   is a professional-level hazard ID tool based on the negative type logic diagram. The FTA
   adds several dimensions to the basic logic tree. The most important of these additions are the
   use of symbols to add information to the trees and the possibility of adding quantitative risk
   data to the diagrams. With these additions, the FTA adds substantial hazard ID value to the
   basic logic diagram previously discussed.
   A2.26.2. APPLICATION. The method is used extensively in the acquisition of new
   weapons systems and other complex systems where, due to the complexity and criticality of
   the system, the tool is a must.
   A2.26.3. METHOD. The FTA is constructed exactly like a negative logic diagram except
   that the symbols depicted in Table A2.3 are used.

Table A2.3. Key Fault Tree Analysis Symbols.




   A2.26.4. RESOURCES. Like the other more advanced tools, using the FTA will normally
   involve the consultation of a safety professional or engineer trained in the use of the tool. If
   the probabilistic aspects are added, it will also require a relatively sophisticated database
   capable of supplying the detailed data needed.
   A2.26.5. COMMENTS. The FTA is one of the few hazard ID procedures that will support
   quantification when the necessary data resources are available.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                       99


   A2.26.6. EXAMPLE. A basic example of the FTA is provided at Figure A2.42 Please note
   the example is not fully developed as it is intended as a brief example of the tool. It illustrates
   how an event may be traced to specific causes that can be very precisely identified at the
   lowest levels.

Figure A2.42. Example Fault Tree Analysis.




A2.27. The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).
   A2.27.1. PURPOSE. The (FMEA) is a professional level hazard ID tool specifically
   designed to detect and evaluate the impact of the failure of various system components. Most
   FMEAs have traditionally been directed at the failure of parts in mechanical systems, but the
   tool is suitable for analyzing the failure of any component of any type of system. A brief
   example of FMEA illustrating this purpose is the analysis of the impact of the failure of the
   communications component (radio, landline, computer, etc.) of a system on the overall
   mission. The focus of the FMEA is on how such a failure could occur (failure mode) and the
   mission impact of such a failure (effects).
   A2.27.2. APPLICATION. The FMEA is generally regarded as a professional tool but with
   the assistance of the FMEA job aid, most operational personnel can use the tool effectively.
   The FMEA can be thought of as a more formal and detailed “What if” analysis. It is an
   especially useful tool in contingency planning where it is used to evaluate the impact of
   various possible failures (contingencies). The FMEA can be used in place of the what if
   analysis when greater detail is needed or it can be used to examine the impact of hazards
   developed using the what if tool in much greater detail.
 100                                                    AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   A2.27.3. METHOD. The FMEA is normally accomplished using a worksheet similar to the
   one illustrated at Table A2.4 As noted on the sample worksheet, a specific component of the
   system to be analyzed is identified. Several components can be analyzed. For example, a
   rotating part might freeze up, explode, breakup, slow down, or even reverse direction. Each
   of these failure modes may have differing impacts on connected components and the overall
   system. he worksheet then calls for an assessment of probability.

Table A2.4. Sample Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Worksheet.




   A2.27.4. RESOURCES. Like the other more advanced tools, using the FMEA will normally
   involve the consultation of a safety professional or engineer trained in the use of the tool.

A2.28. Multi-linear Events Sequencing (MES). This tool is sometimes referred to as the
“timeline tool,” or the “sequential time event plot (STEP)” tool.
   A2.28.1. PURPOSE. MES is a highly specialized hazard ID procedure designed to detect
   hazards arising from the time relationship of various operational activities. The MES detects
   situations in which either the absolute timing of events or the relational timing of events may
   create risk. For example, an operational planner may have crammed too many events into a
   single period of time, creating a task overload problem for the personnel involved.
   Alternatively, MES may reveal that two or more events in an operational plan conflict
   because a person or piece of equipment is required for both but obviously can’t be in two
   places at once. MES can be used as a hazard ID tool or as a mishap investigation tool.
   A2.28.2. APPLICATION. MES is usually considered a professional loss prevention level
   tool, but MES worksheet actually simplifies the process to the point that a motivated
   individual can effectively use the tool. MES should be used any time that risk levels are
   significant and when timing and/or time relationships may be a source of risk. It is almost an
   essential tool when the time relationships are relatively complex.

   A2.28.3. METHOD. MES is accomplished using a worksheet/form similar to the one
   illustrated at Figure A2.43 The sample worksheet displays the timeline of the operation
   across the top and the “actors” (people or things) down the left side. Notice that in some
   operations/activities the timeline may literally be broken down in seconds. The flow of
   events is then displayed on the worksheet showing the relationship between the actors on a
   time basis. Once the operation is displayed on the worksheet, the sources of risk will be
   evident as the flow is examined.

   A2.28.4. RESOURCES. As with the other more advanced tools, using the MES will
   normally involve consultation with a safety or engineering professional familiar with its
   application.
   A2.28.5. COMMENTS. MES is unique in its role of examining the time-risk implications of
   operations/activities.

A2.29. The Management Oversight and Risk Tree (MORT).
   A2.29.1. PURPOSE. The MORT is the ultimate hazard ID tool. The MORT uses a series of
   charts developed and perfected over several years by the Department of Energy in connection
   with their nuclear safety programs. Each MORT chart identifies a potential operating or
   management level hazard that might be present in an operation. The attention to detail
   characteristic of MORT is illustrated by the fact that the full MORT diagram or tree contains
   more than 10,000 blocks. Even the simplest MORT chart contains over 300 blocks.
   Obviously, full application of MORT is a very time-consuming and costly venture. The basic
   MORT chart with about 300 blocks can be routinely used as a check on the other hazard ID
   tools. By reviewing the major headings of the MORT chart, an analyst will often be
   reminded of a type of hazard that was overlooked in the initial analysis. The MORT diagram
   is also very effective in assuring attention to the underlying management root causes of
   hazards.
   A2.29.2. APPLICATION. Full application of MORT is reserved for the highest risks and
   most mission critical activities because of the time and expense required. MORT is also
   basically a professional tool requiring a specially trained loss control professional to assure
   proper application. The basic MORT diagram can be used to facilitate and check on the
   overall hazard ID process by those with the interest and motivation to ensure excellence.
   A2.29.3. METHOD. MORT is accomplished using the MORT diagrams. As indicated above
   there are several levels of the MORT diagram available. The most comprehensive, with
104                                                    AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


  about 10,000 blocks basically fills a book. There is an intermediate diagram with about 1500
  blocks, and a basic diagram with about 300. Of course it is possible to tailor a MORT
  diagram by choosing various branches of the MORT tree and using only those segments. The
  MORT is essentially a negative tree, so the process begins by placing an undesired loss event
  at the top of the diagram used. The MORT user then systematically responds to the issues
  posed by the MORT diagram. All aspects of the diagram are considered and the “less than
  adequate” blocks are highlighted for risk control action.
  A2.29.4. RESOURCES. The best sources of information on the MORT are the internet and
  other professional engineering resources.
  A2.29.5. COMMENTS. The MORT is the ultimate in RM hazard ID processes.
  Unfortunately, in a military context, rarely will the time, resources, expertise, and mission
  critical issue come together to permit full application of the process. Nevertheless, the wise
  risk manager will become familiar with the MORT processes and use the basic MORT
  diagram to reinforce mainstream hazard ID tools. The MORT diagram is essentially an
  elaborate negative logic diagram. The difference is primarily that the MORT diagram is
  already completed for the user, allowing a person to identify various contributory cause
  factors for a given undesirable event. Since the MORT is very detailed, personnel can
  identify basic causes for essentially any type of event.
  A2.29.6. EXAMPLES. Due to the significant amount of logic and gate diagrams associated
  with MORT charts, anyone seeking examples should refer to references obtained from
  experts either on-line or from expert sources outside the organization.

                RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS, DETAILS, AND EXAMPLES

A3.1. Introduction. There are many ways to assess risk, but the easiest and most effective for
routine RM applications is the risk assessment matrix introduced in Section D, Paragraph 28.
The easiest way to understand the application of the matrix is to apply it. Follow the reasoning of
the matrix user in the example below while applying the matrix to the assessment of the hazards
associated with the movement of a heavy machine from point A to point B.
   A3.1.1. HAZARD TO BE ASSESSED. The hazard associated with this task is the machine
   falling over and injuring personnel.
   A3.1.2. PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT. Figure A3.1 illustrates the thought process that
   might be followed in developing the probability segment of the risk assessment.

Figure A3.1. Probability Assessment Example.
 106                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   A3.1.3. SEVERITY ASSESSMENT. Figure A3.2 illustrates the thinking process that might
   occur in selecting the severity portion of the risk assessment matrix for the machine falling
   hazard.

Figure A3.2. Severity Assessment Example.




   A3.1.4. MAKE A RISK ASSESSMENT. (Example): Combine the probability frequency
   with the severity effect of the hazard in the matrix. The probability category occasional is in
   the middle of the matrix (Figure A3.3). Follow this column down until it meets the critical
   category coming from the left side. The result is a High (H) rating. Notice that it is among the
   lower of the H ratings but it is still considered high for risk considerations.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 107


Figure A3.3. Risk Assessment Matrix.




A3.2. MATRIX LIMITATIONS. There are a few limitations and concerns with the use of the
matrix. These include the following:
   A3.2.1. SUBJECTIVITY. There are at least two dimensions of subjectivity involved in the
   use of the matrix. The first is the interpretation of the matrix categories. One person’s
   interpretation of the term “critical” may be quite different from another’s. The second is the
   interpretation of the hazard. If in recent personal experience a machine, much like the one to
   be moved, fell over and crushed a person to death, a user might have a greater tendency to
   rate both the probability and severity higher than someone who did not have such an
   experience. If time and resources permit, this variation can be reduced by averaging the
   rating of several personnel.
   A3.2.2. INCONSISTENCY. The subjectivity described above naturally leads to some
   inconsistency. A hazard rated very high in one organization may only have a high rating in
   another. This becomes a real problem if the two hazards are competing for a limited pot of
   risk control resources. There is a tendency to inflate risk assessments to enhance
   competitiveness for limited resources.
   A3.2.3. SMALL SCOPE IN RANKINGS. The standard matrix produces only four levels of
   risk: Extremely High (EH), High (H), Medium (M) and Low (L). The highest level, EH, will
   normally be corrected immediately. The lowest level, L, is often so minor that it does not
   warrant serious consideration. This means that the vast majority of meaningful hazards are
   either H or M. Since most meaningful risks are located in only two categories, there is a
   prioritization dilemma when trying to construct a risk priority. An option to overcome this
   problem is to assign numbers to each block of the matrix. These numbers can then be used to
 108                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


   augment the basic categories. An example is shown below in Figure A3.4 Note that the
   modified matrix provides 20 levels of risk. The numbers do not replace the basic EH, H, M
   and L categories, they augment them. Although the levels are arranged so that the higher
   risks have a low number, the matrix can be constructed so high numbers reflect higher risk
   levels. Use whichever method is most suitable.

Figure A3.4. Modified Risk Matrix.




A3.3. RISK PRIORITY LIST. The risk priority list is designed to display the hazards of an
operation in a top down order of priority. The highest risk hazard is placed at the top of the
priority list with progressively less risky hazards displayed in order of priority below. All
hazards are displayed on the priority list until the risk is determined to be low enough that the
hazards are not likely to warrant any expenditure of resources to control them. It is desirable to
indicate the risk rating (EH, H, M, L) for hazards by either labeling each hazard or by labeling
each group. The priority list is used to assure that risk issues are attacked on the basis of worst
first and that the greatest resource expenditures are focused on the worst hazards. Figure A3.5 is
an abbreviated example of a priority list for the machine movement example.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      109


Figure A3.5. Example Risk Priority List.




A3.4. USE OF THE PRIORITY LIST. Because the priority list displays all hazards in order of
importance, it helps to prioritize risk control efforts. However, it can be useful for other functions
as well. For example, it is also useful when evaluating different hazards that may be attacked
with a single risk control. In the example above, several hazards arise from the potential of the
heavy and unstable machine. One potential risk control: attaching the machine to a wider, more
stable base before lifting and moving the machine may reduce the risk from all these related
issues. The risk priority list can also be used to break the overall list of hazards out into clusters
of related risk issues so that the responsible personnel for trouble areas can address risks in order
of priority. This can be a positive step toward integration of RM roles.

          MAKE CONTROL DECISIONS TOOLS, DETAILS, AND EXAMPLES

A5.1. Introduction. The fourth step of the RM process involves making control decisions
regarding the best risk control options to apply toward a given situation. If Step 3, develop risk
control options, has been effectively accomplished there should be a number of practical control
options to consider. These will include the basic options (reject, transfer, spread, etc.) as well as
a comprehensive list of risk reduction options generated through use of the risk control options
matrix. Of course a decision requires a decision maker. The organization will require a procedure
to establish who should, as a matter of routine, make various levels of risk decisions. Finally,
after the best available set of risk controls is selected, the decision maker will make a final go/no-
go decision.
A5.2. DEVELOPMENT. Risk decision making should be routinized in developed risk decision
systems and processes.
   A5.2.1. This system will produce several benefits, listed in Figure A5.1.

Figure A5.1. Decision Making Process and System Benefits.




   A5.2.2. A decision matrix is an important part of a good decision making system. These are
   normally tied directly to the risk assessment process. An example is shown at Figure A5.2

Figure A5.2. Example Risk Decision Making Guidance.
 114                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


A5.3. SELECTION. Selecting the best combination of risk controls can be made as simple as
intuitively choosing what appears to be the best control or group of controls, or so complex they
justify the use of the most sophisticated decision making tools available. For most risks
involving moderate levels of risk and relatively small investments in risk controls, the intuitive
method is fully satisfactory. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind as these intuitive
decisions are made:
   A5.3.1. Don’t select control options to produce the lowest level of risk; select the
   combination yielding the most mission supportive level of risk. This means keeping in mind
   the need to take risks when those risks are necessary for improved mission performance.
   Remember there is a mission risk associated with not taking risks that advance mission
   performance.
   A5.3.2. Be aware that some risk controls are incompatible. In some cases using risk control
   A will cancel the effect of risk control B. Obviously using both A and B is wasting resources.
   For example, a fully effective machine guard may make it completely unnecessary to use
   personnel protective equipment such as goggles and face shields. Using both will waste
   resources and impose a burden on operators.
   A5.3.3. Be aware that some risk controls reinforce each other. For example, a strong
   enforcement program to discipline violators of safety rules will be complemented by a
   positive incentive program to reward safe performance. The impact of these complimenting
   programs will usually lead to a stronger overall safety program.
   A5.3.4. Evaluate full costs versus full benefits. Try to evaluate all the benefits of a risk and
   evaluate them against all of the costs of the risk control package. Traditionally, this
   comparison has been limited to comparisons of the mishap costs versus the safety function
   costs.
   A5.3.5. When it is mission supportive, choose redundant risk controls to protect against risk
   in-depth. Keep in mind the objective is not risk control, it is optimum risk control.
A5.4. COST/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT. In cases where risk level is high and risk control costs
are important, the stakes are high enough to justify application of more formal decision making
processes. All of the tools existing in the management science of decision making apply to the
process of risk decision making. Two of these tools should be used routinely. The first is cost
benefit assessment, a simplified variation of cost benefit analysis. Cost benefit analysis is a
science in itself, however, it can be simplified sufficiently for routine use in RM decision making
even at the lowest organizational levels. Some fiscal accuracy will be lost in this process of
simplification, but the result of the application will be a much better selection of risk controls
than if the procedures were not used. Budget personnel are usually trained in these procedures
and can add value to the application. The process involves the steps listed in Figure A5.3
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                115


Figure A5.3. Cost Benefit Analysis Steps.

Figure A5.4. Example 5-Step Risk Controls Selection.




A5.5. DECISION MATRICES. When risks are high and risk control costs are important, an
excellent tool for evaluating various risk control options is the decision matrix. On the vertical
dimension of the matrix, mission supportive characteristics for risk controls are listed. Across the
top of the matrix various risk control options (individual options or packages of options) are
listed. Control options are ranked on a scale of 1 (very low) to 10 (very high) in each of the
desirable characteristics. Each desirable characteristic can then be weighted (if desired) based on
its mission significance to come up with a calculated/weighted score (illustrated below). All
things being the same, the options with the higher scores are the stronger options. A generic
illustration is provided at Table A5.1
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  117


Table A5.1. Sample Decision Matrix.




A5.6. SUMMARY. It is not unusual for a risk control package to cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars and even millions over time. Millions of dollars and critical missions may be at risk. The
expenditure of several tens of thousands of dollars to get the decision right is sound management
practice and good RM.

             RISK CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS AND DETAILS

A6.1. Introduction. Accountability is an essential element of RM success. Organizations and
individuals must be held accountable for the risk decisions and actions that they take. If there is
no accountability, there will be little motivation to achieve the degree of excellence in
management of risk that the AF seeks. Strong accountability and the resulting motivation it can
create is not a matter of luck. Strong accountability is created through the development of
effective accountability systems and the delivery of focused rewards and corrective actions. The
model depicted at Figure A6.1 is the basis of positive accountability and strong risk control
behavior.

Figure A6.1. Implementation Mode.




A6.2. MODEL APPLICATION. The example below illustrates each step in the risk control
implementation model applied to the sometimes difficult task of assuring that personnel
consistently wear and use their protective clothing and equipment. The steps of the model should
be applied as follows.
   A6.2.1. IDENTIFY KEY TASKS. This step may seem obvious. However, it is critical to
   actually define the key tasks with enough accuracy that effective accountability may be
   justified. The following questions will help define key tasks in the example regarding use of
   protective clothing and equipment. When is the use of such items required? Is it when
   personnel enter the door of a work area? Is it when personnel approach a machine? If so,
   how close? What about on the loading dock? Exactly what items are to be worn? Is there any
   specific way that protective clothing should be worn? What if a person is wearing ear plugs
   incorrectly and has them stuck in the outer ear, producing little or no noise reduction benefit?
   Does this meet the requirement? The task needs to be defined with sufficient precision so that
   personnel know what is expected of them and expectations produce the risk control desired.
   It is also important that the task be made as simple, pleasant, and trouble free as possible. In
   this way we significantly increase the ease with which the rest of the process proceeds.
   A6.2.2. ASSIGN KEY TASKS. Personnel need to clearly understand what is expected of
   them, especially if they are going to be held accountable for the task. This is normally not
   difficult. The task can be included in job descriptions, operating instructions, or in the task
   procedures contained in manuals. It can very effectively be embedded in training. In less
   structured situations, tasks can be assigned through a clear verbal order or directive.
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   119


  A6.2.3. MEASURE PERFORMANCE. Task needs to include at least a basic level of
  measurement. It is important to note that measurement does not need to include every time
  the behavior is displayed. It is often practical to sample performance only once in large
  numbers of actions, perhaps as few as one in several hundred actions as long as the sample is
  an example of routine behavior. Often the only person who needs to perform measurements
  is the individual responsible for the behavior. In other situations, the supervisor or an outside
  auditor may need to perform the observations. Performance must be compared to the
  standard, which should have been communicated to the individual responsible for the task.
  This step of the process is the rigorous application of the old adage that “What is monitored
  (or measured) and checked gets done.”
  A6.2.4. REWARD/CORRECT. Reward correct behavior and correct inadequate behavior.
  The emphasis should be on reinforcing correct behavior. Reinforcement is any action that
  increases the likelihood that a person will display the desired behavior again. It can be as
  informal as a pat on the back or as formal as a major award or cash incentive. Correction of
  inadequate behavior should be accomplished whenever inadequate behavior is observed. The
  special case of punishment should only be used when all other means of producing the
  desired behavior have failed.
  A6.2.5. RISK CONTROL PERFORMANCE. If the steps outlined above have been
  accomplished correctly, the result will be consistent success in controlling risk. Note that the
  extent of the rewards and corrective actions required will be dictated in part by the degree of
  difficulty and unpleasantness of the task. The harder the task for whatever reason, the more
  powerful the rewards and corrective actions needed will be. It is important to make risk
  control tasks as uncomplicated, and pleasant as possible.

               SUPERVISE AND EVALUATE DETAILS AND EXAMPLES

A7.1. INTRODUCTION. Management is moving a task or an organization toward a goal. To
move toward a goal three things are essential: 1) There must be an identified goal; 2) A known
current position of the unit/organization in relation to the goal; and 3) An organized plan to reach
the goal. An effective set of risk matrices provides two of these elements.
A7.2. DEVELOP INDICATORS. In regard to RM, indicators should provide information
concerning the success or lack of success of controls intended to mitigate a risk. These indicators
could focus on those key areas identified during the assessment as being critical to minimizing a
serious risk area. Additionally, matrices may be developed to generically identify
operations/areas where RM efforts are needed. Below is a representative set of risk measures that
a maintenance shop leader could use to assess the progress of his shop toward the goal of
improving safety performance. Similar indicators could be developed in the areas of
environment, fire prevention, security, and other loss control areas.
   A7.2.1. TOOL CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS INDEX. Establish key indicators of tool
   control program effectiveness (percentage of tool checks completed, items found by Quality
   Assurance (QA), score on knowledge quiz regarding control procedures, etc.). All that is
   needed is a sampling of data in one or more of these areas. If more than one area is sampled,
   the scores can be weighted if desired and rolled up into a single tool control index by
   averaging them. See Figure A7.1 for the example.

Figure A7.1. Example Tool Control Effectiveness Measurement.




   A7.2.2. PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT RISK INDEX. This index
   measures the effectiveness with which required protective clothing and equipment are being
   used by shop personnel. Data is collected by making spot observations periodically during
   the work day. Data is recorded on a check sheet and rolled-up monthly. The index is the
   percentage of safe observations as illustrated at Figure A7.2
AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  121


Figure A7.2. Example Safety Observation Measurement.




   A7.2.3. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES INDEX. This index measures the readiness of the
   shop to respond to various emergencies such as fires, injuries, and hazmat releases. It is made
   up of a compilation of indicators as shown at Figure A7.3 A high score is desirable.

Figure A7.3. Example Procedures Measurement.




   A7.2.4. QUALITY ASSURANCE SCORE. This score measures a defined set of
   maintenance indicators tailored to the particular type of aircraft serviced. QA personnel
   record deviations in these target areas as a percentage of total observations made. The
   specific types of deviations are noted. The score is the percentage of positive observations
   with a high score being desirable. Secondary scores could be developed for each type of
   deviation if desired.
   A7.2.5. OVERALL INDEX. Any combination of the indicators previously mentioned, along
   with others as desired, can be rolled up into an overall index for the maintenance facility as
   illustrated at Figure A7.4
 122                                                      AFPAM90-803 11 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure A7.4. Example Overall Measurement.




A7.3. SUMMARY. It is not difficult to set up useful and effective measures of risk,
particularly once the key risks have been identified during a risk assessment. Additionally, the
workload associated with such indicators can be minimized by using data already collected and
by collecting the data as an integrated routine aspect of operational processes. Once the data has
been collected and analyzed, the results need to be provided to the unit. With this information the

                    PREPARATION OF FORMAL RISK ASSESSMENTS

A8.1. Formal Risk Assessment. A formal risk assessment succinctly documents the results of
the Deliberate 5-Step RM process and supports follow-on decision-making processes. Decision
options typically involve determining whether one or more particular COAs should be pursued
(e.g., implementing equipment improvements, safety or warning device improvements,
operational improvements, technical improvements, policy/procedure improvements, etc.), and
whether a risk should be accepted, mitigated or rejected. A risk assessment supports decision-
making processes by objectively identifying a hazard, assessing its risk, thoroughly analyzing
potential options for mitigation and making a recommendation. NOTE: The term “losses”
include fatalities and system losses. Figure A8.1 provides a sample risk assessment layout in
document form to include descriptions of each section:

Risk Assessment Title

Background: Broadly describe the situation being evaluated. Provide enough detail so the
remainder of the risk assessment can be easily understood.
Hazard ID: Hazards are defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission
degradation, illness or injury to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property.
Accurately and succinctly describe the hazard (e.g., deficiency with engineering design, material,
quality, software, operations, maintenance, etc.) being analyzed.
Initial Risk: Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to the hazard. Risk
assessment is the application of qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the level of
risk associated with the identified hazard. Identify the probability and severity of a mishap that
could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of personnel or assets to the identified
hazard. Use the baseline state as the basis for determining initial risk. Fully explain the
methodology used, data considered and rationale for determining baseline risk. Many times
initial mitigation steps have already been taken prior to the completion of a written risk
assessment. These steps may include permanent risk mitigation measures or temporary stop-gap
risk mitigation measures. You should describe these measures and explain how the baseline risk
is being mitigated, the effectiveness and the resulting interim risk until final risk mitigating
options can be implemented.
Risk Mitigation / Control Options: After consideration of initial risk and any steps that have
been taken to mitigate initial risk, it is likely several options still exist to mitigate the remaining
risk of the indentified hazard. Effective control measures reduce or eliminate one of the three
components (i.e., probability, severity or exposure) of risk. Investigate specific strategies and
tools that reduce, mitigate or eliminate risk. Address each risk mitigation option separately. One
option to always consider is “taking no further action” which is the equivalent of accepting the
baseline risk and acknowledging and accepting expected future losses. For each option, including
accepting the baseline risk, consider addressing:

Description: Describe the option being evaluated.
Impact: Describe the impact of this option. What are its benefits; limitations? Address its
effectiveness and explain how it will eliminate or control future losses. Does it address other
hazards/problems or introduce new ones?
Cost: Estimate the costs (i.e., financial, operational, maintenance, etc.) to implement this option.
Schedule: Estimate schedule to implement this option.
Residual Risk: Great risk mitigation options eliminate hazards and their risk entirely; others
only reduce the risk. Assuming this risk mitigation option is implemented; identify the
probability and severity of a mishap that could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of
personnel or assets to the identified hazard. Fully explain the methodology used (including
analytical assumptions and limitations), data considered, and rationale for determining residual
risk.
Expected Future Losses: Estimate the expected losses with implementation of this option.
Express losses over a period of time, a number of events or for a given population. Fully explain
the methodology used, data considered and rationale for determining these expected losses.
Summary of Options: If the number of risk mitigation options is lengthy, a tabular summary
may be appropriate. Include as appropriate.
Recommendation: State the recommended course(s) of action, including rationale.
Attachments: Include more detailed or supporting information, as required.
A8.2. Questions that should be considered when conducting a                           formal      risk
assessment. NOTE: Not all of the following questions will apply to every risk.
   A8.2.1. What were the preliminary mishap risk index results when the safety deficiency was
   initially identified? – Initial Risk
   A8.2.2. What are the identified deficiencies (design, maintenance, material, quality,
   software, etc)? – Hazard ID
   A8.2.3. What are the hazards caused by the deficiencies in light of known requirements and
   interrelationships with man, machine and media (environmental) system elements? –
   Background and Hazard ID
   A8.2.4. What, if any, supporting historical data substantiate the need for controls or changes
   (list Class A, B, C mishaps, HAPs, etc.)? – Initial Risk
   A8.2.5. What, if any, interim corrective action has already been taken to reduce risk (change
   in mission, operational restrictions, grounding, increased inspections, Time Compliance
   Technical Order (TCTO) actions, etc.)? – Interim Risk
   A8.2.6. What, if any, additional action has been recommended by operators, planners,
   System Safety Groups (SSGs), or other groups? – Risk Mitigation Options
   A8.2.7. What are the expected total future direct losses (and indirect losses) if the controls
   are not implemented? If sufficient data exists to make these predictions, what is the current
   mishap severity, probability and frequency, and resulting mishap risk index values? – Risk
   Mitigation Options

   A8.2.8. How will the proposed mitigations eliminate or control these losses? – Risk
   Mitigation Options
   A8.2.9. How effective will the control of losses be? – Risk Mitigation Options
   A8.2.10. If the control is approved, what are the expected losses to be avoided, and any other
   quantitative or qualitative benefits? – Risk Mitigation Options
   A8.2.11. Does the proposed control create any new hazards for the mission/activity
   (consider mission and people, machine and environmental system elements)? – Risk
   Mitigation Options
   A8.2.12. Why are other alternatives to risk reduction unacceptable (accept losses, preferred
   parts substitution, time change, training, procedural changes, increased inspections, etc.)? –
   Risk Mitigation Options
   A8.2.13. If the control is approved, what will be done to reduce risk until the control is fully
   implemented? – Risk Mitigation Options
