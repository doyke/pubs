This pamphlet series supports Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
Program and AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning. This volume of this pamphlet
series provides guidance and procedures for repairing war-damaged airfield operating surfaces. It applies
to Air Force Civil Engineer Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) members and Rapid Engineer
Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED HORSE ) who perform airfield damage
repair (ADR) operations, includ ing Air National Guard (ANG) unit s and Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC). In addition to information on ADR techniques, it also addresses damage assessment, minimum
operating strip (MOS) selection, repair quality criteria (RQC) and airfield marking. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Dispos ition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil//rds_series.cfm. The us e of the na me or mark of any specific manufacturer,
commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not impl y endorsement by the Air
Force.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been substant ially revised and must be complete ly reviewed. This revision changes
the publication title from Rapid Runw ay Repair Operations to Airfield Damage Repair Operations to be
consistent with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-270-07, Airfield Damage Repair. Command and con-
trol functional designators were updated throughout the publication to reflect the new Air Force Incident
Management System construct. Detailed procedures were eliminated if included in official directive pub-
lications elsewhere, such as T.O.s, UFCs, AFIs, etc. The concept of operations was updated to reflect the
force module construct.

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Air Forces fly and fight from airbases; however, it is at the airbase that air power is most
vulnerable. Airbases can be the most immediate and lucrative targets for an ad versary, because it is far
more effective to destroy aircraft while they are on the ground than to hunt them in the air . Destroy the
infrastructure that supports the aircraft, and you essentially destro y air operations. Not only must the
United States maintain the capability to recover our own airbase after an enemy attack, but must also be
capable of restoring an enemy airfie ld after US seizure. In either scenario proper preparation must be
accomplished prior to the moment of need—time will not be available during the c onflict to accomplish
meaningful training.

1.2. Background. American military leaders of World War II recognized the vital need for airfields to
support operations in all theaters of operation. Many ti mes this meant repairing enemy airfields or con-
structing new ones as quickly and close to the front as possible. To provide this level of support, aviation
engineers experimented with several different types of runway materials. Some never proved feasible. For
example, the attempt to construct a runway with wooden 2" x 4" landing mats was too costly and labor
intensive. However, the engineers did develop several types of materi als enabling them to provide expe-
dient runways in just days or even hours. The three primary repair materials included Pierced Steel Plank-
ing, Hessian Matting, and Square MeshT rack. These evolved into the AM-2 matting used extensively in
the Vietnam conflict and still in limited use today (see Volume 1, Attachment 4, of this series for more
information on the history of airfield damage repair [ADR] materials).
   1.2.1. As the USAF developed higher performance aircraft, near -flush repairs on the primar y
   take-off/landing surface became imperative to eliminate the rough “bump” AM-2 mat presented. T o
   address this late 1970s issue, HQ Air Force Engineer and Services Center (AFESC), now HQ Air
   Force Civil Engineer Support Agen cy (AFCESA), developed a synthe tic matting system that would
   provide portability without the transitional roughness problems associated with AM-2 matting. Initial
   versions of their efforts were fielded in August 1984 and called Polyurethane Fiberglass Mats (PFM).
   Unfortunately, these early PFM products were not well received, mainly because of storage and trans-
   port problems presented by their sheer bulk. They were 50 x 60 feet in size, not foldable, and weighed
   approximately 1,500 pounds.
   1.2.2. However, work continued on the project and by February 1992, AFCESA developed the folded
   fiberglass mat (FFM) system that is the primary ADR method now employed Air Force-wide (Figure
   1.1.). The FFM system was basically the PFM with hinges that allows the mat to fold into a manage-
   able size for transport and storage. The system does have its weak points: the elastomer hinges are sus-
   ceptible to damage with heavy fighter and cargo aircraft usage and the corners of the mat’s trailing
   edge failed earlier than anticipated during C-17 high speed taxiing or braking situations.

1.3. Future Planned Improvemen ts. We must continue to improve tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTP) if we expect to remain th e preeminent Air Force in the world, this holds true for ADR tools and
methods. At publishing time for this pamphlet, several ADR modernization projects were underway.
     1.3.1. In the long-term, the Air Force desires to replace foreign object damage (FOD) covers, such as
     AM-2 and FFM, with more permanent cap repairs, such as quick setting concrete and grout mixtures,
     that support all our airframes. This would provide true flus h repairs, minimize rutting issues, and
     eliminate anchoring problems. Mate rials are currently being investig ated and tested to achie ve this
     goal, and short-term projects to improve current FOD covers are currently underway. The overall goal
     is to provide quick repair TTPs that require less maintenance and are applicable for any scenario or
     location.
     1.3.2. A project is underway to deve lop a rapid ramp expansion produc t that is lighter, stronger, and
     requires less maintenance than AM-2.
     1.3.3. Use of alternative crater fill material, such as expanding foam, is bein g tested to determine
     durability, time required for application, and ease of use.
     1.3.4. Studies are in process to improve spall repair materials, techniques, and guidance.
     1.3.5. Air Force civil engineers intend to exploit the full spectrum of technologies to improve all fac-
     ets of ADR; from efforts to decrease damage assessment by using unmanned aerial vehicles and prep-
     ositioned, remotely controlled, digital cameras to exploring software to perform automated minimum
     operating strip (MOS) selection accurately and efficiently. These are but two ideas that can revolution-
     ize the way ADR operations are conducted in the future.

1.4. Today’s Concept of Operations.
     1.4.1. Introduction.
        1.4.1.1. ADR Definition. ADR encompasses all actions required to rapidly prepare airfield oper-
        ating surfaces and infrastructure to establish or sustain operations at a new forward operating loca-
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              11


     tion (FOL) or to recove r operations at a main operating base (MOB) or FOL that has sustained
     damage from an attack.
     1.4.1.2. Concept of Operations (CONO PS) Overview. Airfield damage repair is an essential ele-
     ment in the rapid projection and application of Joint US Military power to ensure the United States
     can establish airbase operations anywhere on the globe in mi nimum time. This CONOPS
     addresses Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) and Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy
     Operational Repair Squadron E ngineer (RED HORSE) ADR capab ilities to support the installa-
     tion’s flying mission. ADR capability includes task s such as damage asse ssment, explosive ord-
     nance reconnaissance, MOS selection, repair quality criteria (RQC) determination, airfield surface
     repair, minimum airfield operating surface (MAOS) marking and striping, aircraft arresting sys-
     tem installation, and airfield lighting system repair and installation.
  1.4.2. Changing Requirement.
     1.4.2.1. Transformed Strategies. The Global Mobility (GM) Op erational CONOPS, within the
     construct of the AF Agile Combat Support (ACS)CONOPS, has transformed. In addition to main-
     taining capabilities to repair damaged airfields resulting from en emy attack at established MOBs
     as in the past, expeditionary e ngineers now face the daunting task s of opening a nd restoring air-
     field operations within friendly hos t nation airbases in a permiss ive environment or after seizing
     an enemy airbase in a non-permissi ve environment. In the latter scenario, the airfield will have
     most likely suffered heavy damage from US and ally airfield denial operations or denial efforts by
     departing enemy forces. In this scenario, lines of communication are longer and material acquisi-
     tion more difficult. Expeditionary engineers must also be able to re store deteriorating airfields
     while operating the airbase at a high ops tempo on substandard and/or aged pavements. Similar to
     the need to act quickly to restore operations following an attack, this requirement drives carefully
     scheduled rapid repairs in order to minimize or eliminate impact to the flying schedule.
     1.4.2.2. Need for Consistency in ADR Operations. The global war on terrorism has compelled the
     United States to project airpow er into places where we must seize and open airbases in non-per-
     missive territories, often in a joint service envir onment. Standard tactics, techniques, and proce-
     dures must be established to deal with this transformed strategy. Recent operations identified the
     lack of familiarity and consistency in ADR pro cedures, equipment, material, and unified pave-
     ment specifications when opening an airbase. Developing unified ADR guidance is the first step in
     overcoming these inconsistencies.
  1.4.3. Objective. Provide the installation commanders and the combatant commander with improved
  capability to restore operations at an existing air base or establish flying operations after opening an
  expeditionary airbase to ensure the rapid, timely, and effective deployment, employment, sustainment,
  and redeployment of US airpower in support of America’s global interests. It also refines the existing
  ADR TTPs to provide the installation commander with capabilities to sustain and restore flying oper-
  ations rapidly after enemy attack on an existing MOB or COB. It shouldalso be used to guide AF civil
  engineer (CE) units in equipping, training, and employing forces to en sure they are prepared to pro-
  vide ACS towards GM in the form of ADR planning, design, evaluation, repair, construction, mainte-
  nance, and training to support aircraft sortie generation.
  1.4.4. Desired Ef fects. Airfield damage repair C ONOPS will define capabili ties required to achieve
  the desired primary effect of rapid projection and application of Joint US Military airpower anywhere
  on the globe in minimum time.
12                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        1.4.4.1. Airpower Proj ection through Expeditionary Air Base s. Provide assured ability to mesh
        seamlessly with other forces (Army, Navy, USMC, and SOF) to establish air operations from a full
        spectrum of airfields. Achieve seamless transition between airfield seizure, airbase opening, sus-
        tainment, and recovery in concert with theater-assigned mobility forces, to include rapid, efficient
        redeployment of forces.
        1.4.4.2. Airpower Projection through MOBs/COBs. Assured ability to recover damaged airfield
        surfaces and associated systems rapidly to continue air operations after an enemy attack.
     1.4.5. Capabilities. Airfield damage repair capabili ties cover a wide range of functional actions to
     establish, sustain, and recover airbase operations.
        1.4.5.1. In a scenario where an enemy airbase has been seized, ADR assets and capability may be
        limited until minimum airfield repairs are completed to enable cargo aircraft to bring in additional
        resources. Special capability un its, such as airborne RED HOR SE and contin gency response
        groups (CRG), will likely accomplish airfield repairs when opening the airbase. Afterwards, oper-
        ations will be handed of f to follow-on Prime BEEF (PB) units to continue airfield repairs. After
        establishing an airbase and beginning sustainment of operations, the potential enemy threat must
        be assessed and resources acquired in anticipation to counter those potential threats.
        1.4.5.2. In a recovery scenario (MOB, COB, or FOL), availability of assets and capability may be
        impacted by the attrition of mate rials, equipment, and personnel due to bomb/missile damage, or
        the necessity to operate in a chemical environment.
        1.4.5.3. The following specific capabilities are provide by PB forces:
            1.4.5.3.1. Assessing airfield damage to determine required repairs.
            1.4.5.3.2. Locating, identifying, marking, clearing, and safing unexploded explosive ordnance
            (UXO).
            1.4.5.3.3. Selecting an appropriate MOS to minimize repair time required to continue launch
            and recovery of aircraft.
            1.4.5.3.4. Determining the RQC of the required airfield repairs.
            1.4.5.3.5. Performing expedient and sustainment repairs to craters and spalls on runways,
            taxiways, and aprons/ramps. Installing FOD covers (FFM, spall patches, etc.) as appropriate to
            the area of the airfield (runway, taxiway, ramp) and airframe (fighter, cargo, etc.) using the air-
            field.
            1.4.5.3.6. Expanding parking aprons and ramps using AM-2 or other means.
            1.4.5.3.7. Marking and striping MAOS.
            1.4.5.3.8. Repairing existing aircraft arresting systems and installing mobile aircraft arresting

      1.4.6.2. GM CONOPS Capabilities.
      1.4.6.3. Training capabilities are necessary to develop the degree of proficiency and expertise
      demanded in damage assessment, UXO reconn aissance, MOS selecti on, RQC determination,
      damage repair, airfield marking and striping, and installation of aircraft arresting systems and air-
      field lighting systems.
   1.4.7. Force Module ADR Capabilities. Airfield damage repair activities take plac e throughout the
   expeditionary airbase life cycle. The following paragraphs will describe activities performed along the
   timeline of each force module ( Figure 1.2.). However, before deploying force modules, pre-action
   assessment and planning will be accomplished.
      1.4.7.1. Pre-action Assessment and Planning. Conduct as much of the assessment actions as pos-
      sible prior to deployment. Throughout the pre-act ion assessment, civil engineers must consider
      and gather data necessary to ensure their ability to initiate, sustain, a nd restore flying operations.
      This phase begins with deliberate planning, through crisis action planning until the first element of
      the airbase opening force sets foot on the base. Important to the pre-action assessment is the Expe-
      ditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP). Intended to provide ground truth, this process includes air-
      field and runway surveys, and overall assessment of facilities; explosive storage siting; petroleum,
      oil, and lubricants (POL ); terminal control; environmental issues (including, but not limited to)
      potable water and potential public health hazards. Ultimately, this process develops a site map. For
      more information on ESSP, see the ESSP C ONOPS on the Air Forc e CONOPS community of

        engineers within the Army component provide special topographic engineer-derived products
        assessing terrain support for mobility and countermobility operations.
            1.4.7.1.1.1. Geology. Civil engineers require know ledge of the surface and subsurface
            strata for foundation designs (where required) and selection of anchoring systems.
            1.4.7.1.1.2. Infrastructure. Essential CE information on infrastructure (e.g., facilities, air-
            field data, utilities systems, and transportation structures) includes host nation design, con-
            struction, and maintenance practices as well as overall condition assessment (particularly
            of roads, bridges, ports, and airfields).
            1.4.7.1.1.3. Resources. Acquire info rmation on the availability of construction resources
            (locally available contractors, skilled labor, construction equipment, and const ruction
            materials) in the host nation and Region. Class IV construction materials may be acquired
            anywhere in the world; however , not all constr uction material is of adequate quality and
            quantity to meet mission needs. Use of local materials often provide repairs that meet mis-
            sion needs while reducing costs and demands on logistic support systems.
        1.4.7.1.2. Many of th ese priority intelligence requiremen ts can be satisfied by information
        available in national-level Department of Defense (DOD) intelligence databases.
        1.4.7.1.3. Other sources of information are:
            1.4.7.1.3.1. Historical database – Geographical database to serve as a historical repository
            of broad range of data collected on bases and other key locations.
            1.4.7.1.3.2. Remote sensor using intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) – A
            great deal of data ca n be collected via sensor. Greater advance knowledge of the location
            will reduce workload of the assessment team (c ommand, control, co mmunications, and
            computer systems C4ISR Capability).

            software, and other useful information and links at https://transportation.wes.army.mil/
            triservice/.
            1.4.7.1.3.4. AFCESA Pavements Program. The AFCESA Pavements Program focuses on
            airfield support to the Major Commands (MAJ COM) and bases by providing services for
            both peacetime and contingency operations. AFCESA pavement evaluation reports can be
            accessed at the following website:

            site (https://www.afd.scott.af.mil/) to determine the suitability for AMC aircraft use.
     1.4.7.2. “Open the Airbase” Force Module. An airborne RED HORSE (ARH) flight may be
     inserted with the tail end of the airfield seizure force to conduct rapid airfield assessment and basic
     preparations for follow on-forces if the airbase is inaccessibl e by ground movement. Otherwise,
     CE forces belonging to an advanced assessment team of the CRG typically perform initial assess-
     ments at the beginning of the “open the airbase” force module. However, not all USAF initial–air-
     base opening capabilities are embe dded within the CRGs and if ra pid response is not critical,
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              15


     UTCs from various units within the Air Force will be tasked to collectively constitute the open the
     airbase force module – initial ai rbase opening capability. The “open the airbase” force module is
     defined in three phases.
        1.4.7.2.1. Phase I – Open the Runway. Following airfield seizure operations, (usually accom-
        plished by USA, USMC or SOF), and the subsequent transition to airbase opening operations,
        Phase I is achieved when the first mobility aircra ft is authorized to land. By the end of this
        stage, adequate runway, ramp and taxiways for the intended mission are cleare d and moni-
        tored. Additionally, the airfield is secure, and the runway, taxiway, and ramp space are capable
        of supporting airlift operations. Engineer capabilities related to ADR in this phase include:
            1.4.7.2.1.1. Expedient force protection construction to protect ADR forces.
            1.4.7.2.1.2. Initial site survey assessment to ve rify airfield operations information and
            evaluate/obtain any details that were not pre-assessed. This capability includes visual
            inspection and evaluation of existing airfield pavements and infr astructure to determine
            aircraft utilization capability and initial repair requirements to allow limited car go/trans-
            port aircraft operations. Specia lized airfield pavement ev aluation teams can perform in
            depth testing with more robust equipment p ackages when sustained operations at a loca-
            tion are planned.
            1.4.7.2.1.3. Limited UXO and explosive hazard cl earance to allow insertion of personnel
            and equipment for limited ADR.
            1.4.7.2.1.4. Limited chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosives
            (CBRNE) and toxic industrial mate rial hazard assessment to inform planners of potential
            airfield hazards.
            1.4.7.2.1.5. Clearance of obstructions preventing safe airfield operations. This capability
            also includes explosive demolition.
            1.4.7.2.1.6. Expedient repair of airfield surf aces to allow limited car go/transport aircraft
            passes. These temporary repairs require constant inspection and maintenance until sustain-
            ment repairs are completed.
        1.4.7.2.2. Phase II – Airc raft Reception. Phase II is a chieved once initial-airbase opening
        forces and t heir equipment are prepared to rece ive aircraft; sufficient ramps, taxiways, and
        facilities are available to support the intended mission. ARH, follow -on CRG forces, and/or
        PB forces work towards accomplishing this phase of opening an airbase. Capabilities related
        to ADR in this phase include:
            1.4.7.2.2.1. Laying out minimum airfield operating surface marking system (MAOSMS),
            obliterating obsolete runway/taxiway stripes, and striping MOS and temporary taxiways.
            1.4.7.2.2.2. Assessing operability and, when possi ble, repairing existing airfield lighting
            and aircraft arresting systems.
            1.4.7.2.2.3. Installing temporary expedient airfield lights, such as those used by Air Force
            Special Operations Command’s Special Tactics Teams (STT), or installing EALS and/or
            MAAS when available. NOTE: The EALS and MAAS arrive via airlift after initial airfield
            operations begin.
16                                                                    AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        1.4.7.2.3. Phase III – Initial Be ddown. Phase III is ach ieved when sufficient real estate has
        been obtained to allow for the initial beddown and sustainment of combat and combat support
        forces. Phase III is complete once like forces are in place to extend, then replace the initial-air-
        base opening force capability. ARH, follow-on CRG forces, and or PB forces continue to work
        towards accomplishing this final phase of openi ng the airbase concurre ntly with continuing
        ADR tasks such as debris removal, backfilling craters, and spall repair. Additional capabilities
        are mainly related to beddown tasks including:
            1.4.7.2.3.1. Expanding on initial site survey assessme nts to provide beddown planners
            critical airbase information. This capability includes visual inspection and evaluation of
            potential beddown sites.
            1.4.7.2.3.2. Limited clearing of UXO and explosive hazards to allow erection of beddown
            structures.
            1.4.7.2.3.3. Limited assessment CBRNE to inform planners of potential on-site threats.
            1.4.7.2.3.4. Clearing obstructions to make real estate ava ilable for beddown structures .
            This capability also includes explosive demolition.
            1.4.7.2.3.5. Expedient construction of fighting po sitions and other force protection struc-
            tures to secure living and working conditions.
     1.4.7.3. “Command and Control” (C2) Force Module. The C2 force module provides the perma-
     nent C2 capability of assigned forces, including ACS forces, through the establishment of the Air
     and Space Expeditionary W ing or Gr oup Structure. Engineer repres entatives are assigned to the
     Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to provide engineering expertise and to reduce redundancy
     and confusion. The EOC implement s decisions, made by the Inst allation Control Center (ICC),
     and directs all base recovery forces. The CE Damage Control Center (DCC), or sometimes
     referred to as the Unit Control Center, is manned by civil engineers and normally controls all CE
     ADR activities as directed by the EOC.
     1.4.7.4. “Establish the Base” Force Module. This force module is complete when ADR and forces
     are sufficient to support the arrival of the first mission aircraft. PB forces through the normal Air
     and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking construct normally replace ARH and CRG forces.
     Engineer ADR actions include tasks such as:
        1.4.7.4.1. Minimizing risk from UXO.
        1.4.7.4.2. Adding ex plosive ordnance disposal (EOD) , CBRNE, and conv entional threat
        response capabilities.
        1.4.7.4.3. Adding 24/7 fire protection.
        1.4.7.4.4. Installing EALS and providing lighting fo r the airfield to es tablish 24-hour flight-
        line operations.
        1.4.7.4.5. Enhancing airfield ope rations by conducting additiona l airfield operating surface
        repairs to increase size of the MAOS to support mission aircraft.
        1.4.7.4.6. Expanding ramps to support all expected aircraft operations at the airbase.
        1.4.7.4.7. Repairing and/or installing aircraft arresting systems to enhance flying safety.
        1.4.7.4.8. Assisting communications personnel in repairing/installing navigational aids.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               17


     1.4.7.5. “Generate the Mission” Force Module. The airfield is considered operational when air-
     field repairs and forces are sufficient to fly operational missions. CE provides PB forces to:
        1.4.7.5.1. Support and maintain infrastructure; in cluding vertical structures, real property ,
        power, water, and a robust C2 capability.
        1.4.7.5.2. Respond to CBRNE threats to include the capability to support all flightline opera-
        tions including ADR and crash and recovery capability if needed.
        1.4.7.5.3. Upgrade expedient airfield repairs w ith sustainment repairs. Initiate sustainment
        repairs as soon as the operational tempo permits , considering that expedient repairs are only
        designed to support 100 aircraft sorties.
     1.4.7.6. Operate the Airbase and Robust the Airb ase Force Modules. These force modules con-
     tinue to enhance the airbase by expanding the infrastructure. They contain mission support forces
     needed to achieve full operating capability and to make the initial operating capabilities of the air-
     base mature and robust. CE PB forces typical ly perform the following ADR tasks during these
     force modules:
        1.4.7.6.1. Continue to upgrade expedient repairs with sustainment repairs.
        1.4.7.6.2. Conduct further airfield repairs to increase capabilities and enhance flying safety.
     1.4.7.7. Airbase Sustainment. While not considered a force module, airbase sustainment is still an
     important part of the expeditionary airbase life cycle. Airbase sustainment is maintaining effective
     capacities of mission support for the duration of operations worldwide through the maximum use
     of reachback to strategic and operational levels of support; and distribu ting in those instances
     where executive agent’s role fa lls to the Air Force. This pha se of operation is much like
     day-to-day sustained operations at a M OB. Specific sustainment tasks in relation to ADR are
     based on the expected duration a nd general nature of the operation and other factors, but may
     include:
        1.4.7.7.1. Performing or maintaining sustainment airfield repairs.
        1.4.7.7.2. Returning the runway to full operability to the fullest extent possible.
        1.4.7.7.3. Increasing ramp space.
        1.4.7.7.4. Installing semi-permanent or permanent arresting systems.
        1.4.7.7.5. Installing permanent airfield lighting systems.
        1.4.7.7.6. Acquiring the skills, e quipment, and material necess ary to provide a lean and
        responsive depot structure that provides an organic repair capability for all airfield mainte-
        nance responsibilities.
        1.4.7.7.7. Performing day-to-day operations and maintenance the same as if at a MOB.
        1.4.7.7.8. Assessing the enemy’s potential to attack and damage the airfield and the airbase’s
        vulnerabilities.
        1.4.7.7.9. Perform necessary preattack actions as determined by assessing the enemy’s poten-
        tial attack threat. Preattack actions include tasks such as active and passive defensive measures
        and stockpiling assets to repair damage from potential attacks if necessary.

        1.4.7.8. Airbase Recovery. Forces must be prepar ed to recover the airb ase after a conventional
        attack with the re sumption of flying operations as first priority. Other recovery activities may be
        conducted concurrently; however, these activities must not impede the resumption of flying oper-
        ations. Base recovery actions s hould be identical whether at a MOB or bare base. The basic air-
        base recovery tasks include:
            1.4.7.8.1. Damage assessment.
            1.4.7.8.2. Safing and disposing of UXO.
            1.4.7.8.3. MOS selection.
            1.4.7.8.4. RQC determination.
            1.4.7.8.5. Repairing airfield damage and installation of FOD cover as necessary.
            1.4.7.8.6. Airfield marking and striping.
            1.4.7.8.7. MAAS installation.
            1.4.7.8.8. EALS installation.

1.5. Scope of Publication. This publication mainly focuses on the airbase recovery aspect of ADR,
although many of the TTPs apply in any ADR scenario. It is a complex and difficult tasking that requires
the total commitment of all involved to succeed.
     1.5.1. The procedures presented in this volume follow what may be expected as the most common
     order of accomplishment. In addition, a number of attachments have also been included that serve to
     amplify some of the more intri cate functions presented in a numb er of chapters. Detailed airfield
     pavement damage repair procedur es are now covered in Unified Fa cilities Criteria (UFC) 3-270-07,
     O&M: Airfield Damage Repair, and will be referenced throughout this volume. The ADR discussed
     in this document is not to be confused with the permanent repairs accomplished with host nation, US
     Army, or contract support.
     1.5.2. In addition, ADR processes are performed by AF units other than PRIME BEEF forces, such as
     STTs, CRGs, and RED HORSE units. Engineer personnel in these units typically perform “open the
     airbase” actions prior to the arriva l of Prime BEEF forces who establish the airbase, operate the air-
     base, robust the airbase, and then sustain operations thereafter. While “open the airbase” ADR TTPs
     are similar to those in other fo rce modules, this publication will ma inly focus on operations after the
     airbase is opened.

1.6. SUMMARY.
     1.6.1. The capability to launch and r ecover aircraft rapidly, subsequent to any attack, is a critical
     requirement. If damage prevents or significantly degrades this response in either time or quantity, it is
     a severe handicap to friendly forces. The abilit y to rapidly determine da mage and conduct repairs is
     essential.
     1.6.2. The ADR CONOPS described in this chapte r supports the ACS and GM CONOPS’ goals of
     force projection and sustainment. The ADR CONOPS objective is to provide the regional Combatant
     Commander with the necessary capabilities to enable rapid, timely, and effective projection, employ-
     ment, and sustainment of US airpower in support of US global interests. The CONOPS describes the
     capabilities required to rapidly restore flying operations at a damaged airbase and defines the capabil-
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 19


  ities necessary to open a runway , establish an airf ield, sustain, and recover an airbase to conduct air
  combat operations.
  1.6.3. In the event of future hostilities, the United States Air Force will, as in the past, play a decisive
  role in defeating the aggressor. The flexibility, massive firepower, and speed of employment of our air
  forces are capabilities needed to win a future conflict. The overwhelming success enjoyed by the Air
  Force from World War II through Operation IRAQI FREEDOM amply demonstrated these features.
  To preserve these characteristics we must maintain the relatively uninterrupt ed operation of our for-
  ward-based airfields through all stages of a conflict . During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, allied
  forces combined numerous aircraft sorties with cruise missiles and other weapon systems to attack
  Iraqi forces and inf rastructure; many of these tar geted Iraqi airfields , including airfield pavements.
  There is little reason not to expect a capable enem y will attempt to do likewise to our airfields with
  every weapon system they have at their disposal during future conflicts.
  1.6.4. Fortunately, we have not experienced a crippling air attack on one of our airbases in more than
  half a century ago. Because of th is, we have no real world ADR data in terms of problems encoun-
  tered, shortfalls experienced, or effort expended to draw from. This complicates the training situation
  in that training must be based on various assumptions, estimates, and subjective judgments. Com-
  puter-modeling techniques have in dicated in the past that given adequate equipment and personnel,
  current ADR procedures can meet the stringent parameters stipulat ed in various requirement docu-
  ments and plans. However , recent technological de velopments, experience in repairing seized air-
  fields during Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM, and FFM deficits require
  enhancements of our ADR TTPs.
  1.6.5. The scope of airfield oper ating surface repair requirements will vary proportionally to the
  intensity of the attack. It could range from minor pavement disruption with minimal interference to
  aircraft operations to major airfield damage. It is this latter possibility that AF engineers must be pre-
  pared to handle swiftly and correctly. Engineers must be prepared for major airfield damage to include
  multiple bomb craters and numerous spall fields. In its most basic interpretation, the ADR mission is
  simply to overcome these multiple problems and provide an accessible and functional MAOS within
  a scant few hours. Though simplistic in outward appearance, it is a highly complex undertaking that
  may well require accomplishment at night, in rain or snow, or even in a chemically contaminated envi-
  ronment. This volume is all about repairing the airfield operating surface so that sortie generation can
  start as expeditiously as possible.
  1.6.6. Air Force civil engineers have repaired airfield damage since World War II and many changes
  and improvements have come and gone. However, we cannot rest on our laurels; we must continue to
  strive for better and quicker ADR methods to meet the Joint For ce Commander’s aircraft launch and
  recovery needs.

                                                  TRAINING

2.1. General. Mission success in all theaters of operation depends upon th e level of individual and unit
training. Ideally, engineer personnel should train the way they expect to fight whenever possible, and their
training should be comprehensive and realistic. Conduct and document ADR training in accordance with
AFI 10-210, the source document for Prime BEEF training.
     2.1.1. Airfield damage repair personnel must train for wartime constructio n and maintenance and
     must learn to be innova tive to deal with potentia l shortages of supplies, equipment, and ma npower.
     Their training should stress flexibility and multi-skill capabilities to offset the effects of casualties and
     unforeseen situations (i.e., training in contingency engineering skills, as well as in their primary duty
     Air Force specialty). Integrated exercises should tax their physical and mental limits to build stamina,
     to minimize wartime trauma, and to acquaint them with the friction of war. Engineer personnel should
     prepare for a variety of missions in all kinds of weather and climates throughout the spectrum of war-
     fare, from low-intensity conflict to theater conventional war, and in a chemical environment if neces-
     sary.
     2.1.2. As stated in Chapter 1, we have no real-world air attack ADR lessons-learned. The little data
     we do have comes from repairing damage to enem y airfields after we se ized their airbases. We
     repaired damage inflicted from our own attacks, and from our coalition partners, and damage resulting
     from base denial operations inflicted by the retreating enemy.
     2.1.3. Leadership techniques, equipment operation capabilities, and basic knowledge of ADR proce-
     dures are areas to co ncentrate training. Such tr aining cannot be acc omplished solely in a c lassroom
     environment—extensive hands-on activities must be performed. Teamwork, skill proficiency, individ-
     ual task accuracy, and overall opera tional responsiveness must be the key elements of this hands-on
     effort. The complexity and criticality of the ADR task demand that every unit establish and maintain
     a viable and aggressive ADR training program. This program must include the ADR aspects of all
     existing training avenues; namely, home station training, of ficer field education, regional equipment
     operator training site (REOTS), and specialty training site (STS) instruction.

2.2. Limitations. While Prime BEEF category (CAT)-I knowledge-level ADR classroom training is con-
ducted at home station, hands-on ADR training is not always attainable at most Continental United States
(CONUS) units, and many ove rseas units, because they typically do not possess ADR assets or have an
area where craters and spalls can be repaired. For that reason, ADR is not required in CAT-II training.
     2.2.1. To overcome this training shor tfall, CAT-III training, conducted at Silver Flag Exercise Sites,
     provides hands-on ADR training. Units are schedu led for CAT-III training to align with their AEF
     cycles. In addition, personnel may receive “just-in-time” hands-on ADR training at a special training
     site/location identified in AFI 10-210, paragraph 4.6.
     2.2.2. The lack of assets and a training area is no excuse to disregard all facets of ADR training. Skills
     such as command and control, damage assessme nt, minimum operating stri p (MOS) selection, and
     RQC determination can be trained and practiced during the home station field training exercises with-
     out ADR equipment or a dedicated ADR training area.

2.3. ADR Training Concept.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 21


  2.3.1. To accomplish ADR in the envisioned intense postattack environment, the base civil engineer
  (BCE) in a high th reat location should train forces as t hey expect them to pe rform during wartime.
  This approach requires the unit’s ADR team be able to:
     2.3.1.1. Opera te each item of ADR equipment at a consistent, hi gh level of individual operator
     proficiency.
     2.3.1.2. Execute coordinated crater repair team efforts to ensure that individual units of equipment
     are optimally employed in and around each crater, and that fill hauling, debris removal, and other
     support tasks are accomplished when needed without conflicting with other equipment operations.
     2.3.1.3. Conduc t simultaneous repair of multiple craters at di spersed runway a nd taxiway loca-
     tions.
     2.3.1.4. Protect the forces and equipment so they will survive the attack and be able to work in the
     high-threat postattack environment.
     2.3.1.5. Endure the demanding phys ical requirements of perfor ming ADR tasks while wearing
     individual protective equipment (IPE), and compensate for the degraded performance in the gear.
     2.3.1.6. Integrate any arriving Prime BEEF forces into the host organization to achieve the opti-
     mum ADR organization.
  2.3.2. Auxiliary Training Requirements. These skills permit each ADR team member to survive and
  operate in the postattack environment. These skills include physical conditioning, chemical agent
  awareness and contamination avoidance, IPE wear and care, small-arms proficiency, UXO identifica-
  tion, and self-aid and buddy care. Each team member must also learn to recognize the marking signals
  used in explosive and chemical ha zardous areas. Provide these skil ls through the unit’s home station
  training program.
  2.3.3. Individual ADR Skills. These areofficer and enlisted skills tailored to each individual’s respon-
  sibility in the ADR or ganization. The objective is to train to the level of proficiency needed to meet
  performance requirements. For example, train exca vator operators in upheaval removal, blade level-
  ing, and aggregate compaction. Train managers of multiple tasks at all levels in both task accomplish-
  ment and task sequence requirement s. Also, train all managers to perform the next higher-level task
  and train individual operators in job sequencing (what to do next or who to ask once the task is com-
  pleted). Communications procedures; radio discipli ne (including “comm-out”), attrition; and perfor-
  mance in IPE, coupled with both day and nighttime exercises should be important instructional blocks
  of each training package.
  2.3.4. Unit ADR Skills. These are bu ilding block, task-integration skills geared to establish profi-
  ciency of the overall ADR effort. First-level training skills include individual team efforts, such as sin-
  gle-crater repair, spall-group re pair, MOS marking, debris clear ance, and other crater support
  operations. Second-level training consists of combining these units into simultaneous crater and spall
  repair operations. Third-level training consists of on-scene crater evaluation and rapid team reorgani-
  zation or tasking to cope with a large number of small craters and spalls. Reach this final level of unit
  skills by employing multiple teams to train in an integrated base recovery environment that includes
  all facets of recovery, from damage assessment through final sweeping, MAAS installation, and air-
  field lighting installation. Due to environmental and equipment constraints, much of this training is
  accomplished at MAJCOM operated STSs and Silver Flag Sites. Un its conduct firs t-level training
  where they have the capability.
22                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     2.3.5. First-level training is provi ded at each unit’s home station. To meet these demanding require-
     ments, make every effort to incorporate base-wide engineer training scenarios into wing-level training
     plans, and integr ated base recove ry exercises, to demo nstrate the coordination and integration rela-
     tionship between the engineer wartime response capabilities and the operational mission. Prime BEEF
     units in CONUS tasked with lead and follow team mobility dockets should train at least annually
     using both the AM-2 mini kit and FFM training kit. At high-th reat overseas MOB, conduct extensive
     hands-on integrated exercises quarterly that involve s as many aspects of the ADR concept as plausi-
     ble. MAJCOM operated STSs provide second- and third-level ADR training.
     2.3.6. Whenever feasible, focus training towards a combination of both hands-on and formal instruc-
     tion. Attempt to include the topics below in the course of instruction at a MAJCOM operated STS.
        2.3.6.1. Short-notice responses.
        2.3.6.2. Site selection, and equipment/personnel dispersal.
        2.3.6.3. Damage assessment, day and night (including ADAT training with the runway reference
        marker system).
        2.3.6.4. MOS selection.
        2.3.6.5. MOS layout.
        2.3.6.6. Unexploded explosive ordnance safing in repair areas and UXO removal actions.
        2.3.6.7. Crushed stone large crater repair.
        2.3.6.8. Folded fiberglass mat positioning and anchoring.
        2.3.6.9. Personnel and equipment attrition (before and during repairs).
        2.3.6.10. “Comm out” procedures (before and during repair).
        2.3.6.11. Radio discipline.
        2.3.6.12. Repeat attack during repair and reconstitution of repair resources.
        2.3.6.13. Clearance and sweeping.
        2.3.6.14. RQC evaluations/calculations and crater profile measurements.
        2.3.6.15. Crater maintenance procedures.
        2.3.6.16. MAAS site selection and installation.
        2.3.6.17. EALS installation.
        2.3.6.18. Final clearance and sweeping.
        2.3.6.19. MOS marking system installation.
        2.3.6.20. MOS painting and blackout procedures.
        2.3.6.21. Personnel protection trench selection procedures and construction techniques.
     2.3.7. Realistic Training. When placed in the postattack scenario, Prime BEEF personnel can expect
     that nothing will happen according to plan. Chaos mo st likely will pr evail. This environment of real
     damage, debris, injured people, chemical warfare-impaired personnel, UXO, little or no communica-
     tions, and confusion will be far different from the pris tine, single dug-crater situation in which they
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 23


   train at home station. T o be effective in the real postattack environm ent, personnel must train in full
   chemical warfare equipment and remain in the equipment through crew-change periods; practice in a
   blown, multi crater environment, inte grated with all other base recovery activities; and train in attri-
   tion, communication outages, integrated nighttime exercises, and repeat attack during repair. Person-
   nel should train in and become acc ustomed to their wartime or ganization. Such realistic training can
   only be provided at dedica ted training sites, such as those ope rated by the MAJCOMs. T o train, as
   they fight, is as necessary to the engin eer repair teams and related base recove ry teams as it is to the
   front-line tactical fighter aircrew member. A less challe nging training format will result in less than
   adequately prepared personnel and teams.
   2.3.8. Repeat Attack. A repeat attack with only a few minutes warning may occur during the recovery
   effort. Consequently, both training and planning actions should consider this threat.
   2.3.9. During peacetime training , the BCE must be alert to a ll interfaces impac ting ADR and must
   ensure that those functions and related training are standardized and thorough. An example of such an
   interface follows.
       2.3.9.1. Peacetime EOC tr aining should include sp ecific and consistent ADAT procedures for
       damage assessment training. Develop concepts concerning how to conduc t damage assessment.
       This concept should include, but not be limited to, the following:
           2.3.9.1.1. Description of the team’s function, collectively and individually.
           2.3.9.1.2. Performance requirements.
           2.3.9.1.3. Personnel sources and training responsibilities.
           2.3.9.1.4. Team chief identification.
           2.3.9.1.5. Team equipment identification.
           2.3.9.1.6. Training requirements.
           2.3.9.1.7. Reporting format.
           2.3.9.1.8. Procedures for communication blackout s (comm-out), vehicle malfunction, attri-
           tion, and other contingencies.
       2.3.9.2. Actual hands-on EOC exercises should involve use of the following functions/activities:
           2.3.9.2.1. Runway reference marker system.
           2.3.9.2.2. RQC system.
           2.3.9.2.3. MOS selection.
       2.3.9.3. Similar procedures should be developed for individuals from base organizations that will
       be acting as initial reconnaissance personnel immediately following an attack. Give specific atten-
       tion to the scope and type of reported damages.

2.4. Summary. Mission success may depend upon the level of individual and unit ADR training. Ideally,
engineer personnel should train the way they expect to fight whenever possible, and the training should be
comprehensive and realistic . Training should stress fl exibility and multi-skills to offset casualties and
unforeseen situations. Training should focus on leadership techni ques, equipment operation capabilities,
and basic knowledge of ADR procedures. Classroom training alone cannot prepare engineers for the ADR
24                                                                    AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


mission—extensive hands-on activities must be performed. Integrated exercises should tax their physical
and mental limits and prepare them for a variety of missions in all kinds of weather and climates, through-
out the spectrum of warfare. The complexity and criticality of the ADR task demand that every unit estab-
lish and maintain a viable and a ggressive ADR training program that includes all existing ADR training
avenues; namely, home station training, officer field education, REOTS, and STS instruction.

                                               Chapter 3

                                    COMMAND AND CONTROL

3.1. General. Nothing has a more negative impact on a unit’s capability to accomplish its mis sion than
weak command and control. It can “rip the heart out” of an organization’s motivation and esprit de corp.
Simply put, without ef fective command and control, nothing will wor k. The best-trained and equipped
ADR team will never reach its true potential if saddled with ineffective leadership. Command and control
of an engineer team is a tough job, and it will be especially tough immediately following an attack. Good
leadership can contribute greatly towards overcoming training and resource shortfalls; unfortunately, the
opposite is not true. For a unit to have strong command and contro l, individuals within the command
structure must be completely knowledgeable and comp etent in their position—to accept anything else is
unconscionable.

3.2. Overall Organization. The EOC is the hub of ADR activities. From the EOC, the Mission Support
Group (MSG) Commander, BCE (or designated repres entative), and other ke y support commanders or
functional chiefs provide overall di rection and guidance to the field fo rces accomplishing base recovery.
In particular, the BCE passes EOC information and decisions to the CE DCC. The MOS selection team is
located in the EOC and the ADR damage assessment and EOD teams report to the EOC. The overall orga-
nizational concept for ADR operations is shown in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. ADR Organizational Concept.




3.3. Command and Control (C2). All MOB assigned forces (in-place and deployed) are under the opera-
tional control of the local wing commander or equivalent. The wing commander controls assigned forces
and all air base operability (ABO) operations through the ICC using the battle staff and existing radio and
telephone communications. The ICC monitors status and location of personnel, resources, communi ca-
tions, damage, and other factors impacting mission-capability.
   3.3.1. EOC Organization. The EOC is established, in accordance with AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emer-
   gency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, and AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biolog-
   ical, Chemical, and Conventional (N BCC) Defense Operations and S tandards, specifically to direct
26                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     ABO survivability and recovery ope rations. As addr essed earlier, the EOC is the focal point for all
     base recovery operations. It also provides command and control of most ABO forces to ensure conti-
     nuity of operations during preattack, transattack, and postattack operations.
        3.3.1.1. The MSG commander , or equivalent, direct s activities in the EO C and coordinates the
        efforts of the supporting staff to collect, analyze, prioritize, display, and report information on the
        status of the base. The EOC, whic h is subordinate to th e ICC, is the focal point for determining
        and tracking the extent of base damage. As damage inputs are received, the EOC staff then devel-
        ops a recovery strategy for ICC approval, implements and directs the recovery activity, and moni-
        tors recovery progress. As an integral part of the ICC, the EOC actively coordinates with other
        ICC cells (logistics, operations, reports, etc.), and reports d irectly to the C ommander’s Senior
        Staff. The EOC usually is colloc ated with, or adjacent to, the ICC battle st aff work area (Battle
        Cab) to allow the battle staf f easy viewing of EOC displays. W ithout a close proximity arrange-
        ment with the ICC battle staff, the EOC will find it difficult to perform its base recovery mission
        effectively. The EOC is responsible for determining the scope of damage; determining its impact
        on the base mission; and maintaining the status of personnel, casualties, and material resources. It
        develops a recovery strategy, directs recovery actions, and tracks progress.
        3.3.1.2. An alternate EOC is establis hed at another facility (prefera bly, the alternate ICC) which
        affords at least the same degree of protection as th e primary EOC. The alternate EOC personnel
        track and record information plotted at the primary EOC, so it will be capable of assuming the pri-
        mary EOC functions with little or no notice.
        3.3.1.3. The EOC staff composition may be established to fit local base requirements, but, gener-
        ally, it is organized into standardized emergency support functions (ESF) from the agencies iden-
        tified in Figure 3.2. ESFs are groupings of capabilities th at provide the su pport, resources,
        program implementation, and services that are most likely to be needed during emer gency
        response. ESFs serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that provides support during an
        incident. Table 3.1. lists the ESFs and their scope of responsibilities. See AFI 10-2501 to learn
        more about ESFs.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                             27

   3.3.2. Civil Engineer EOC Duties and Responsibilities.
      3.3.2.1. BCE. The BCE or designated representative is the senior advisor to the EOC commander
      on engineering matters. At theater bases, the base recovery concept of operations requires the BCE
      (or a senior designated representative) and member s of the M OS selection team to be located in
      the EOC. From the EOC, the BCE provides direction to the ADR crews and ADATs, directs facil-
      ity and utility repair, and provides fire protection and crash rescue capability. As mentioned ear-
      lier, much of the BCE’s direction is executed through the DCC staff. As a member of the EOC, the
      BCE is the command and contro l link between the EOC and the DCC. From the EOC, the BCE
      receives, reviews, and evaluates damage assessment reports, and assists the commander in devel-
      oping and implementing the base recovery strategy.
      3.3.2.2. Readiness and Emergency Management Flight Officer or Superintendent. This individual
      is responsible for oversight and administration of the EOC, coordinates activities of the remaining
      staff, and recommends priorities f or emergency response forces. He/she advises the commander
      and battle staff on CBRNE defense matters and ex ercises operational control of CBRNE survey
      teams. This person is also re sponsible for monit oring activities of the sh elter management and
      contamination control teams through their respective functional control centers.
      3.3.2.3. Explosive Ordnance Disposal Representative. The EOD representative controls the UXO
      safing teams’ activities an d advises the commander and battle staff on all matters concerning
      UXO.
      3.3.2.4. Controllers and Plotters. To support EOC operations, controller and plotter positions are
      filled as needed according to AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, and base Com-
      prehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. These indivi duals will record, plot, and
      track attack damage inputs received from individuals and organizational control centers. They will
      also conduct MOS selectio n based upon inputs from airfield da mage assessment teams (ADAT),
      weather and aircraft loading factors, and other mission data from the ICC.
   3.3.3. The CE DCC, which is subordinate to the EOC, is established in accordance with AFMAN
   32-4004. The recovery priorities and strategy are established in the EOC, then implemented, executed
28                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     and controlled by the DCC. The D CC normally controls all CE re covery activities and is usually
     headed by the squadron’s Chief of Operations.
     3.3.4. Resources . If available, tracking and plotting tools c an be el ectronic, but shou ld have a hard
     copy/paper back-up system at th e EOC and DCC (pri mary and altern ate). Resources that should be
     available include:
        3.3.4.1. BCE contingency response plan, including checklists.
        3.3.4.2. Personnel accountability tracker.
        3.3.4.3. Tracker depicting vehicle status, by category, such as snow removal, ADR, base recovery,
        damage assessment, EOD, etc., and special-purpose equipment, ge nerators, water supplies, and
        materials.
        3.3.4.4. Base layout map (1” = 400’)to mark and track UXO, damage and contamination, location
        of remote stockpiles, disperse d personnel and equipment, and the location of recovery teams;
        paper copy should be in acetate.
        3.3.4.5. Runway damage plotting map (1” = 100’) wi th a subdued 10’ x 10’ grid on runway sur-
        face. Mount paper copy behind plexiglass.
        3.3.4.6. MOS selection and RQC kits.
        3.3.4.7. Base master plan tabs (C & G) showing location of utilities, drainage, etc. If not already,
        this feature will be a function of Expeditionary GeoBase.
        3.3.4.8. CEMP 10-2.
     3.3.5. Precedence of Command and Control. Normally, the wing commander directs operations from
     the ICC. After the EOC is activat ed, the preattack and recovery operations are managed from this
     command cell. In the event of is olation, attrition, or loss of e quipment, CE and ADR command and
     control would pass as follows:
        3.3.5.1. EOC (BCE).
        3.3.5.2. Alternate EOC.
        3.3.5.3. DCC.
        3.3.5.4. Alternate DCC.
        3.3.5.5. Senior BCE Officer.
        3.3.5.6. ADR officer in charge (OIC).
     3.3.6. Communication loss with the EOC/DCC. If the ADR OI C loses contact with the DCC and
     alternate DCC, it must be assumed that they either have been damaged beyond operational capability
     or have inoperative communications equipment. In either case, the OIC will attempt to verify the sit-
     uation by dispatching a runner to check their status. Once verified, or until directed otherwise by com-
     petent authority, the ADR OIC wi ll continue working toward pr oviding a repaired MOS in the
     required time. Similarly, ADATs and EOD teams must be trained in the command sequence to auto-
     matically report to the DCC if they lose contact with both the EOC and its alternate.

3.4. Engineer Organization. The DCC is the focal point for engineer activities during base recovery. The
ADR team receives its direction fr om the DCC. The team functions under an area repair group concept
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                  29


wherein an essentially equal effort is applied to both MOS and access taxiway repair requirements. Typi-
cally, three crater repair crews are designated for MOS support and another three crews are assigned to
taxiway requirements. For par allel runway bases, th e installation may have more crews, or assign two
crews to each runway and two for ta xiways. In either case, the inst allation should exercise according to
their installation’s specific plan. In addition, the installation's In-G arrison Expeditionary Support Plan
(IGESP or ESP) should reflect their approach to allow incoming forces to train accordingly. Crews should
be flexible in order to focus on specific areas driven by the actual damage and the air tasking order (ATO)
requirements. Each crew will repair craters according to the priority established by the EOC. The hauling
crew supports the six repair crews with fill and FOD cover deliveries. The support team accomplishes all
the ancillary, but equally important, tasks of FOD removal, spall repair, airfield marking, airfield lighting,
and aircraft arresting system installation. Th e ADR OIC and noncommissione d officer in char ge
(NCOIC) lead this entire operation.

3.5. Organizational Responsibilities. Many difficult decisions must be made quickly and accurately dur-
ing an actual airfield recove ry situation. Recognizing the need for decisive response to a wide variety of
situations, base recovery calls fo r a standard or ganizational structure and assigns resp onsibility accord-
ingly. Briefly summarized, these responsibilities are:
   3.5.1. EOC. The EOC, as describedpreviously, is responsible for managing overall installation recov-
   ery operations, including ADR. The BCE and engine er members of the MOS selection team are
   located in the EOC. During ADR operations, the EO C staff directs the airfield damage assessm ent
   effort, receives and plots damage and UXO data, and selects thre e MOS candidates to present to the
   ICC Commander. After MOS selection by the ICC Commander, the EOC orders EOD forces to begin
   UXO safing operations and instructs the DCC to initiate ADR operations.
   3.5.2. Airfield Damage Assessment Teams. Chapter 6 of this volume provides detailed information
   on the responsibilities of the ADATs. The ADATs receive direction from the EOC and report airfield
   damage and UXO data.
   3.5.3. M OS Selection Team. Chapter 6 of this volume outlines pro cedures for selecting the MOS.
   The MOS selection team plots damage and UXO data received from the ADATs, and after MOS selec-
   tion is complete, continues to monitor and record damage repair and EOD progress. The MOS selec-
   tion team also performs all RQC calculations as outlined in Chapter 7 of this volume.
   3.5.4. DCC and ADR OIC. The DCC is manned by keyBCE supervisory personnel, and serves as the
   focal point for manage ment of CE recovery ef forts. During the initial stag es of damage assessment
   (from the advantage point of the DCC), the ADR OIC monitors the logging and plotting of all incom-
   ing damage and UXO data reported by the ADATs. After all reports have been received and the ICC
   Commander has selected the MOS, the EOC annotates the MOS coordinates, MOS operations (bi- or
   unidirectional), identifies the location of craters to be repaired, record s MAAS and distance-to-go
   marker locations, an d designates w hich taxiways and access ro utes are to be cleared and repaired.
   Once this data has been received, the ADR OIC normall y will join the ADR team at either their dis-
   persed sites or staging area and outline specific duties and areas of responsibility. From this point on,
   the ADR OIC will usually remain on-scene and as sume immediate control of the operation. If dam-
   ages to be repaired are considerably different from those upon which ADR operations are preplanned,
   the ADR OIC alters team assignments as necessary. For example, the ADR OI C may have to shift a
   crater repair crew from the MOS to the access taxiways or perhaps release crews to other taskings if
   damages are lighter than expected. Much of the exte nt of this adjustment can be deter mined in the
30                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     DCC prior to the A DR OIC leaving the control center. Once the overall scope of the ADR operation
     has been identified, the OIC directs crews to craters, designates haul routes to be cleared, and deter-
     mines which stockpiles are to be used. In the DCC, plotters continue to update wall displays as repair
     progress reports are received. In addition, these plotters maintain the status of material usage, person-
     nel casualties, and equipment losses. Display boar ds in the DCC (whether manual, projected com-
     puter-based, or semi-automated LCD displays) should include, but not be limited to, the following:
        3.5.4.1. Airfield map showing damage, crater identification numbers, MAAS location, distance to
        go marker locations , planned or actual MOS and ta xiing patterns, haul ro utes, and areas where
        work is in progress or completed.
        3.5.4.2. Tasking board listing each team’s task, and start and estimated completion time.
        3.5.4.3. Equipment status i ndicating each team’s equipment allocation and performance limita-
        tions due to breakdowns, malfunction, or war damage.
        3.5.4.4. Material usage to show qua ntities of ballast rock, crus hed stone, AM-2 mats, and FFMs
        remaining at each stockpile location.
     3.5.5. Support Team OIC and ADR NCOIC. The support team OIC’ s primary responsibility is to
     ensure that the several crews assigned under him/her accomplish their taskings on time and correctly.
     While the crews thems elves are not large, they are diverse in natu re and somewhat specialized. Any
     individual has the potential to delay launch and recovery operations if the performance of their portion
     of the ADR effort is lacking. This is particularly true of the FOD removal and spall repair teams. The
     support team OIC will act in a roving controller capacity during the entire ADR operation to ensure all
     teams are providing the required support. Also having to serve as a roving controller is the ADR
     NCOIC. This individual must maintain close oversight of both the MOS and taxiway ADR operations
     and the associated hauling team support. The ADR NCOIC’s primary function is to act as an on-site
     problem solver and to provide technical and control assistance to the ADR OIC. The ADR NCOIC
     must facilitate the coordination of requirements between all ADR cr ews to ensure de lays in repair
     progress are avoided.
     3.5.6. ADR Crater Crew Chiefs. Crew chiefs carry out their task of managing the crater crew’s oper-
     ations and reporting progre ss to the ADR OIC. Sample s of the type of progress information to be
     reported are shown in Table 3.1. and Table 3.2.

3.6. Communications.
     3.6.1. Communication Equipment. The host BCE’ s communications equipment will provide suf fi-
     cient assets to accomplish the ADR mission. However, mobility forces should deploy with two-way
     radios to enhance the ADR capability further. When possible, the deployment team’s radios should be
     adjusted to correspond to the frequency of the host. However, without such modifications the useful-
     ness of the deployed team’s radios will be constrained a nd communication interaction between host
     and deployed personnel could be greatly impaired.
     3.6.2. ADR Essential Communicati ons. The ADR OIC and NCOIC mu st maintain communications
     not only with the various ADR team ch iefs, but also with the CE DCC. Table 3.3. serves as a quick
     visual reference of suggested ADR team radio requirements. This list is not cardinal, but presented as
     a general guide. Each unit should formulate their ADR communications requirements predicated upon
     the anticipated situation. Factors to consider when doing so include team expe rience, threat assess-
     ments, leadership expertise, and available equipm ent resources. Radio authorization levels are out-
     lined in allowance standard (AS) 660, Non-Weapons Systems Communications Requirements.

Table 3.3. Suggested ADR Team Radio Requirements.
Function                                         Requirement*
ADR OIC and NCOIC                                Portable & vehicle mounted, jam-resistant units

Fill Site(s) Personnel                           Single-channel, jam-resistant unit
Equipment Operators (as required)**              Single-channel, jam-resistant unit
*Each ADR situation should be assessed individually. The above suggested radio requirements will
most likely not prove ideal for every scenario. Make necessary adjustments accordingly.
**Care must be taken to avoid having too many radios in use. Excess chatter on the frequency can only
serve to create confusion and discord.

     3.6.3. Alternate Communication Fo rms. Radio communication is the ideal method; however , due to
     any number of variables, radios may be partially or totally unusable. Therefore, establish some alter-
     nate form of communication, such as field phones, base phones, runners, et c., to pass information,
     such as si mple status reports, requests for essent ial services or supplies, a nd passing directions and
     guidance.
     3.6.4. DCC. Communications with th e following essential primary a nd alternate agencies should be
     available to relay damage reconnaissance and to manage ADR activities from the engineering DCC:
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               33


       3.6.4.1. EOC.
       3.6.4.2. Fire operations center.
       3.6.4.3. Base defense operations center (BDOC).
       3.6.4.4. Logistic readiness center (LRC).
       3.6.4.5. Medical services.
       3.6.4.6. Sheltered engineer teams.
       3.6.4.7. ADR operations.
   3.6.5. Both ADR OIC/NCOIC should have a portable (hand held) and vehicle-mounted, multi-chan-
   nel, jam-resistant (if available) frequency modulation (FM) radio for communications with engineer-
   ing DCC and ADR teams.
   3.6.6. The MOS crater team, taxiway crater team, haul team, should each have a portable (hand held),
   two-channel, jam-resistant (if available) FM radio for intercommunications.
   3.6.7. The airfield management and ramp net should have a single-ch annel that is jam-resistant for
   contact with the ADR OIC/NCOIC.
   3.6.8. The MAAS team, airfield lighting team, FOD clearance team, MOS marking team, EOD ADR
   support team, shelter managers, and equipment opera tors of sweepers, excavators, graders, paint
   machine, ordnance clearance equipment, dump trucks, stockpile loader, etc., should be provided a sin-
   gle-channel, jam-resistant (if available) radio for contact with their respective team chief.

3.7. Summary. Without effective command and control, ADR operations are not likely to meet mission
requirements. The wing commander controls assigned forces and all ABO oper ations through the ICC
using the battle staff and existing radio and telephone communications. The ICC monitors status and loca-
tion of personnel, resources, co mmunications, damage, and other fact ors impacting miss ion-capability.
The next level of ADR command a nd control is the EOC, which is controlled by the MSG Commander
and is the hub of ADR activities. From the EOC, functional chiefs provide overall direction and guidance
to the field forces accomplishing base recovery. In particular, the BCE passes EOC information and deci-
sions to the CE DCC. T he DCC is the focal point for engineer activities during base recovery. The ADR
team receives its direction from the DCC. It is im portant that each control ce nter have an alternate loca-
tion to assume responsibility if the primary becomes disabled. Ne xt, the ADR OIC and NCOIC direct
numerous ADR teams. Effective and secure communication is critical between the various teams and con-
trol centers. Alternate communication procedures must be established in case the primary methods
become disabled to ensure effective control and reporting continues.

                                        SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

4.1. Peacetime Planning and Actions.
     4.1.1. Preattack Planning Phase. This phase of recovery operations is very critical. Meticulous plan-
     ning, realistic training, extensive checklists, pre-selected dispersal sites, h ardened facilities/equip-
     ment, and other such planning m easures will prepare CE forces to perform quickly and ef ficiently
     during the subsequent phases.
        4.1.1.1. All preattack preparatio ns, including ADR, must be lis ted, disseminated, and exerc ised
        properly. These tasks are generall y listed in MAJCOM/base recovery directives/checklists, base/
        joint support plans, reception plans, medical wartime plans, and communications support plans.
        Disseminate such plans to the lowest level necessa ry to ensure rapid execution. Consolidate the
        BCE’s preattack planning efforts into the CEMP 10-2.
        4.1.1.2. As a norm, hostility buildup can be expect ed to provide several days warning during
        which the base should improve its defensive posture. However, to prevent surprises, write a mini-
        mum alert preparat ion plan (short notice) and implement, practice, and i ncorporate it into the
        CEMP. Specific reaction standards (times) should be established to measure satisfactory perfor-
        mance. Time will be of the essence.
     4.1.2. Peacetime Acti ons. During peacetime, at bases with defined threat probabilities, the BCE
     should accomplish the following actions:
        4.1.2.1. In conjunction with the EMP and Emergency Action File checklis ts, develop specific
        checklists itemizing essential ADR actions for the preattack phase. Implement these checklists,
        along with those provided by higher headquarters, when directed by the ICC or EOC.
        4.1.2.2. Conduct integrated traini ng in full chemical warfare de fense (CWD) gear, so crews are
        proficient in the environment and are accustomed to working in full CWD equipment. To add real-
        ism, conduct at least one integrated nighttime exercise annually.
        4.1.2.3. Determine and preposition an adequate supply of needed repair materials, identify strate-
        gic locations for stockpiles, and establish several suitable alternative haul routes from these stock-
        piles to potential MOS. The repair fill material quantities are based upon the perceived threat and
        dictated by theater and MAJCOM directives. Locate repair materials for rapid access to the
        expected repair areas. S tockpile aggregate in th e immediate vicinity of runways and taxiways to
        minimize haul times, yet separate far enough from each other to increase survivability. Ensure pile
        heights and locations comply w ith aircraft obstructi on and cl earance requirements. Maintain
        access to buried utilities. S tockpile locations must provide reasonable al l-weather access and,
        when possible, should not require haul routes that use the MOS. Otherwise, trucks may track mud
        and possibly spill rocks and debris on to the MOS surface, complicating th e runway and taxiway
        sweeping and clearing efforts.
        4.1.2.4. Determine requirements and preplan stoc kpiles of emergency water supplies since nor-
        mal base utilities may be disrup ted during the attack . Water for drinking and personal hygiene
        should be pre-identified and available at the dispersal site or in protected areas, such as basements.
        After an attack that may includ e chemical weapons, c onsider unprotected base w ater unsafe for
        consumption until proven otherwise.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               35


     4.1.2.5. Install an accurate and survivable runway reference marker system to be used by ADATs
     in reporting airfield damage and UXO, and by the MOS marking team for MOS layout.
     4.1.2.6. Plan for beddown and integration of augmentation forces.
     4.1.2.7. Identify support requirements, such as tran sportation, from the shelters to the dispersed
     equipment locations, vehicle mechanics to assist in postattack vehicle repairs, and EOD personnel
     to stand by at the repair site for potential UXO safing. These requirements should be coordinated
     with appropriate tasking agencies, and incorporated into the EMP.
     4.1.2.8. Determine suitable dispersal locations fo r ADR equipment, materials , and people. This
     may include programming collaterally protected personnel shelters; building berms; or modifying
     existing natural protection, such as ditches, hillsides, etc., into some means of splinter protection,
     and improving the surface and/or drainage to preclude a mud problem in a rainy season. In select-
     ing these dispersal sites, consider the proximity of possible targets, natural cover and concealment,
     security, access in inclement weather, etc.
     4.1.2.9. Ma ke plans to improve and expedite airfield damage ass essment and repa ir procedures
     during peacetime. Accomplish by utilizing all available base assets, not just CE’s, in assessing air-
     field damage. The focus should be on getting the presumptive MAOS to leadership as quickly as
     possible.
         4.1.2.9.1. Where possible, utilize existing visualization tools, such as remotely operated cam-
         eras, to ef ficiently manage ADATs and dam age assessment process. Using these tools can
         allow the MOS selection team to guide the ADATs and prevent wasting time by running the
         entire airfield when some areas are too damaged to repair.
             4.1.2.9.1.1. Expediting damage assessment can be accomplished by such things as plan-
             ning and exercising use of existing airfield security camera systems, which may be config-
             ured to feed video into the EO C. If there is not a feed to the EOC, local procedures might
             be to send a person to the SF control center to view the camera system while guiding the
             ADATs.
             4.1.2.9.1.2. An individual can be dispatched to th e control tower, if it is not damaged, to
             retrieve digital photos of ai rfield damage. Digital camera s can also be pre-positioned
             around the airfield on existing tower type structures to provide complete coverage. Photos
             taken by these cameras can be used by the MOS selection team.
             4.1.2.9.1.3. If av ailable, partner with S F to deve lop an agreement for use of their
             mini-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to conduct preliminary damage assessments of the
             airfield through use of real-time camera fe eds or photographs. NOTE: At publishing time
             of this pamphlet, actions were underway to integrate processes between SF Common Rel-
             evant Operating Picture (CROP) and CE Common Operating Picture (COP).
         4.1.2.9.2. Develop grids for ramps and taxiways as well as the primary runway so larger dam-
         age areas can be properly plotted. If GPS assets are available, use the Military Grid Reference
         System (MGRS) as the primary method to locate damage.
  4.1.3. Probable Targets. Probable targets, other than the runway , include communication facilities;
  utility plants; petroleum, oil, and lubricant areas; liquid oxygen (LOX) storage; munitions storage; air-
  craft shelters and hangar s; exposed aircraft; and headquarters buildings. He aviest bomb or missile
36                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     groupings occur on the runway/alternate launch and recovery surfaces, aircraft shelters, and industrial
     areas.
     4.1.4. Dispersal Area Considerations. Disperse personnel, equipment, and materials at least 1,000 feet
     from probable primary fixed targets. The areas off the ends of the runway and the housing area a may
     provide candidate dispersal areas. Coordinate with the loca l intelligence section (wing director of
     operations) for the most likely targets.
        4.1.4.1. When possible, plan for cover and concealment that blends with the background and sites
        that provide natural cover, such as trees, foliage, ditches, or hillsides. Improve protection by hard-
        ening with drive-through trenches, berms, sandbags, etc.
        4.1.4.2. Sites that are accessible in inclement weather should be selected, and the effects of drain-
        age, mud, icy inclines, or snowdrifts should be considered.
        4.1.4.3. If the housing area is clear of occupants, dispersal into the housing area should also be
        considered. Park equipment as clos e as possible to the sides of bui ldings (preferably in the shad-
        ows) located away from the flight line and industrial areas. Use basements for personnel protec-
        tion. If feasible, use a top-story window for an observer with a radio to report to the DCC after an
        attack. Be sure to provide as much splinter protection to that position as possible.
     4.1.5. Personnel Dispersal Area Consider ations. The following are gene ral guidelines for selecting
     personnel dispersal areas.
        4.1.5.1. In general, lo cation considerations used in shelte ring the equipment from attack also
        should be applied when sheltering personnel. However, when sheltering personnel, the first option
        should be for a hardened, filtered-air, over pressurized shelter. If such a shelter is unavailable, the
        next option should be to wear the ground crew ensemble (GCE) inside a collective protected facil-
        ity. If collective protection is no t available, personnel should don IPE and take sh elter in places
        away from primary bomb impact areas, as depic ted in Figure 4.1. Expedient shelters would
        include trenches, berms, basements, behind build ings, or other such splinter protection. During
        peacetime, assigned personnel shelters, install comm unications capability between shelters and
        the EOC/DCC, and establish and practice postattack reporting procedures.
        4.1.5.2. Once the crews are in GCE and the gear becomes contaminated, there is presently no way
        for people to partially remove individual pieces, such as the hood and mask for food intake, or the
        trousers for bodily functions. Water intake is possi ble through the water -intake port in the mask,
        but do not break the mask seal. Rest or relief outside the contaminated clothing can take place only
        at a hardened, filtered-air, over pressurized shelter or at a processing facility with positive filtered
        airflow. There is not a chemical threat-level requiring only a partial ensemble. The BCE’ s preat-
        tack planning should include the following:
            4.1.5.2.1. Total number of individual protective garments and masks assigned.
            4.1.5.2.2. Decontamination cycle and time requirements.
            4.1.5.2.3. Processing and decontamination responsibilities.
            4.1.5.2.4. Work/rest cycle—instead of 12-on/12-off, a 4-on/4-off or similar schedule may be
            required if the wet-bulb globe temperature index dictates in order to provide sustained capabil-
            ity.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                37


       4.1.5.3. S urvey the area to determine several su itable alternative routes from the selected dis-
       persal sites to potential staging areas. Present candidate routes to the EOC for approval.
   4.1.6. Training. Peacetime training should be comprehensive an d thorough, and should be in accor-
   dance with existing training guidance outlined in AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
   (BEEF) Program.

4.2. Preattack Actions. During th is phase, the base should make final preparations to survive an attack.
When directed by higher headquarters, the wing commander, through the ICC, should initiate emergency
action file measures, such as activating the EOC; implementing the base recall; coordinating the evacua-
tion and travel of noncombatants; directing issue of field equipment, weapons, CWD equipment, rations,
and individual equipment; and placing the base on wartime duty hours.
   4.2.1. EOC Responsibilities. The EOC is responsible for establishing alert postures and directing all
   combat support organizations to take appropriate action in coordination with the established alert pos-
   ture. When activated, the EOC staff assembles, runs the appropriate checklists, deploys the necessary
   teams and equipment, and generally , ensures that all recovery personnel a nd activities are ready to
   perform their base recovery functions.
   4.2.2. Airfield Damage Assessment Teams. ADATs should establish contact with the EOC and report
   to their sheltered dispersal loca tions. Each team chief should en sure team equipm ent operability,
   account for team composition, and secure assigned vehicle and equipment near each team’s shelter.
   4.2.3. EOD Personnel. The EOD team chief should brief team personnel, make EOD assignments to
   ADATs, keep the EOC informed of EOD activities, and secure assigned vehicles and equipment near
   the team’s sheltered dispersed areas.
   4.2.4. BCE Preattack Actions. At this point, the BCE’s efforts should be directed toward protecting
   people, equipment, and vehicles, and to ensure that CE resources are ready to start base recovery as
   soon as the attack is over. The BCE should establ ish a base of wartime ope ration; assemble, account
   for, brief, and disperse CE troops and equipment; prepare expedient hardening; ensure that communi-
   cations equipment is in commissi on; and see that all personnel unde rstand their jobs. The following
   actions are included:
       4.2.4.1. Execute the preattack checklists.
       4.2.4.2. Place personnel on appropriate shift schedules; establish duty hours and crew changeover
       procedures; move the off duty personnel into assigned shelters to st art their crew duty cycle; and
       plan for messing, rest and re lief, and for chem ical contamination processing. As planned, ADR
       teams should be dispersed between shelters and transported so one shelter or vehicle loss will not
       eliminate an entire functional capability (e.g., all excavator operators or team chiefs should not be
       located in one shelter or vehicle).
       4.2.4.3. Issue all required individual protective equipment.
       4.2.4.4. Prepare ADR equipmen t and vehicles for re covery operations. Mount blades on desig-
       nated vehicles, install armor, and check fluid levels. Identify emergency sources of water for refill
       and confirm travel routes from dispersal sites to the pre-designated staging area. Establish prede-
       termined travel route checkpoints for teams to call in their stat us. This enables the EOC to know
       where to continue the route should a replacement team be required.
       4.2.4.5. Beddown and integrate the augmenting ADR forces, if appropriate.
38                                                                   AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     4.2.4.6. Plan for building berms or similar structures at the preplanned UXO holding areas. Iden-
     tify locations for shallow ditches at predetermined intervals along the aircraft operating surfaces.
     Use these ditches as sub-munitions holding ar eas for EOD clearance operations. The purpose of
     these ditches is to get the munitions below grade; therefore, the ditches should be between 1 to 2
     feet deep and 2 to 3 feet wide. Rather than di gging trenches at this time, identify areas where
     trenches can be dug without cutting utility lines. Also, identify locations for possible construction
     of expedient trenches near the run way. Airfield damage repair team members working on the
     MOS use these trenches when suf ficient time is not available to reach a hardened shelter facility
     during no-notice follow-on attacks.
     4.2.4.7. Inspect stockpiles and haul routes. Ensure th at adequate spall repair material and associ-
     ated dry aggregate are available.
     4.2.4.8. Review plans for refueling and servicing equipment, on-site maintenance, and spare parts
     availability. Leave keys in vehicl es and ensure that spare keys are available. However, do not
     leave keys in vehicles if enemy special operation forces (SOF) engagement is expected.
     4.2.4.9. Review vehicle status board and discuss the consequences of any known equipment lim-
     iting factors (LIMFACs).
     4.2.4.10. P erform regular status -checks to account for personnel and ens ure teams are fully
     manned.
     4.2.4.11. Ensure that communications equipment (two-way radios) are issued, checked for proper
     operation, and that an ample supply of spare batteries is available. If plans call for more than one
     frequency, make sure all involved parties understand the reasons for such. Also, make sure that the
     battery chargers function properly.
     4.2.4.12. I f required, when the ADR crews ha ve completed their preat tack actions, have them
     assist other engineer recovery crews in such activities as utility isolation; hardening; sandbagging;
     camouflage, concealment, and deception; and beddown of arriving forces.
     4.2.4.13. If possible, ADR vehicles, stockpiles, and haul routes should be high priorities on DAT
     routes. Designate specific ADR personnel to a ssess ADR resources and routes if DA Ts are
     delayed. Personnel must be in the appropriate mission oriented protective posture (MOPP).
     4.2.4.14. Load dump trucks with appropriate fill material and water trucks as required.
     4.2.4.15. Load appropriate ADR matting kits and dozer (if required).
     4.2.4.16. Inventory and inspect the EALS and MAAS.
     4.2.4.17. Coordinate with other support agencies providing services and assets to the ADR effort.
     This includes vehicle maintenance teams ensuring their stock levels are full, assigning mechanics,
     and collocating vehicles with ADR equipment.
     4.2.4.18. Arrange for fuel services to top-of f all dispersed vehicles and equipment. Never leave
     ADR assets idle with their fuel tank less than one/half full.
     4.2.4.19. Plan for weapons issue a nd work party security based on the state of alert and the per-
     ceived threat.
     4.2.4.20. Move ADR sets and associ ated equipment to dispersal locations and shelter all person-
     nel.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 39


       4.2.4.21. Normally, the ADR OIC and NCOIC report tothe DCC in order to observe damage plot-
       ting activities as they are received from the EOC. This will allow both the OIC and NCOIC to
       obtain first-hand knowledge of the true extent of damage to the MAOS and better prepare them to
       make on-scene decisions once the team is on the MOS.

4.3. Transattack Actions.
   4.3.1. General. The effort at this point is to ensure that all needed actions have been taken to rapidly
   place the base at a maximum level of protection to survive a full-scale attack employing conventional
   and chemical weapons. S tandardized USAF attack alarm signals (based upon international agree-
   ments) are used at all high-threat area bases. The decision to declar e a given attack alarm is made by
   the wing commander, based on an actual threat to the base, rather than on forecasted threats for large
   geographic areas. Information about the type and level of threat is obtained from intelligence reports,
   air defense radar, early warning systems, base CBRNE detection systems, individual reports, unit air
   traffic control organizations, security patrols, a nd civil/host nation agencies . Dissemination of the
   attack alarm is accomplished by the installation wa rning system which incorporates voice, siren, and
   other audible signals, as well as visual signals to ensure that a ll personnel are warned promptly of
   attacks. The base is expected to receive at leas t a 5-minute warning before the attack. All personnel
   should don the IPE, according to MAJCOM and base instructions, go to the nearest or assigned shel-
   ters, or take cover under or behind the nearest expedient shelter and wait for the “attack is over” signal
   with specific instructions.
   4.3.2. BCE Transattack Actions. Civil engineer personnel are well qualified to identify facility, utility,
   and pavement damage. Each ADR team, if not inside a “blind” shelter, should appoint an observer to
   watch the attack (if a suitable and safe vantage point is available) and immediately report to the DCC
   observed munitions, general-purpose, or sub munitions damage. The DCC quickly consolidates and
   passes this information on to the EOC for consideration. Such reports will assist the EOC in obtaining
   a quick picture of the postattack situation and wi ll enable them to focus EOD response and damage
   assessment efforts. Although not equipped to test and respond to chemical contamination, observers
   should watch for vapor-dispersing munitions and be especially watchful for animal reactions. If there
   are signs of birds dying or sma ll animals having convulsions and becoming incapacitated, with no
   apparent wounds, it is likely that chemical agents are present.

4.4. Postattack Actions. To ensure an airfield can quickly return to its operational role following an
attack, a well-organized ADR effort is essential. The value of the planning and training becomes evident
as the procedures are implemented during an actual attack. To address a sequence of events for ADR oper-
ations, a general scenario must be portrayed. In our case, we will be gin at the point where all preattack
actions have been completed, all command posts and c ontrol centers are functioning, dispersal require-
ments have been met, and personnel have been shelte red. The base has just been attacked and consider-
able damage has been sustained. Particularly hard hit were the runway , taxiways, and major aircraft
parking areas. After the attack, personnel occupyi ng observation posts and or ganizational units begin
reporting damage, fires, a nd UXO sightings to the EOC and/or D CC. Reports confirm major damage to
the airfield with numerous craters on the main runway, taxiways, aprons, and access routes from the air-
craft shelters. Spalls are prevalent throughout the pavement system and UXO are in abundance.
   4.4.1. Damage Assessment. Damage assessment is normally the first function performed after an
   attack. It is extremely important to rapidly obtain a damage picture of the entire area of interest (run-
   way, taxiways, shelter access, etc.) by using all tools available. Integration of flightline cameras, ele-
40                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     vated observation posts, and mini-UAVs as planned during peac etime actions should help the EOC
     MOS selection team expedite and focus airfield damage assessment. The ADATs initially survey
     assigned sections of the airfield in order to locate craters, spalls and utility breaks, and make an initial
     UXO reconnaissance. However, they must be under positive control of the EOC's MOS selection team
     to focus them on likely MOS areas and expedite MOS selection. In the absence of a suitable armored/
     hardened vehicle, the assessmen t team must proc eed on foot. The numbe r of ADATs required is
     dependent upon the size of the airfield; however, most bases will posture three teams.
        4.4.1.1. Quick initial reconnaissance to provide assessment of installation damage after an attack
        is a key part of recovery. All base personnel and organizations have a responsibility to report to the
        EOC, through their respective control centers, any facility damage, casualties, suspected contami-
        nation, and unexploded ordnance within and around their specific areas. Each organization should
        identify and train specific dama ge reconnaissance personnel for this purpose. While base organi-
        zations report damage in and around their immediate areas, DATs assigned to the EOC perform
        damage assessment in specific areas, such as airfield surfaces.
        4.4.1.2. Damage assessment te am manning normally involves one engineering technician
        (3E5X1), one EOD technician (3 E8X1), and one augmentee (any AF specialty [AFS]). These
        teams, under the EOC direction, should survey the runways and taxiways using pre-assigned
        routes until given direction to specific areas based on th e MOS selection teams quick assessment
        using remote cameras/observation means to na rrow the likely MOS locations. The engineering
        technician will determine th e location and size of cr aters and spal ls while the EOD technician
        identifies UXO by type, location, and, when possibl e, by fuse. Generally, the augmentee will be
        trained as a driver/observer and will serve as a data recorder. The team uses a grid-reference sys-
        tem and available visual refere nces, such as prepositioned pave ment reference markers, runway
        distance markers, centerline, runw ay edge, taxiway locations, runway lights, etc., to estimate the
        location of damage and UXO. Th e team also monitors vehicle- mounted detectors and M-8 paper
        for the presence of chemi cal agents. During this damage assess ment period, speed is of the
        essence. All findings uncovered by the team are immediately passed to the EOC. Damage assess-
        ment procedural details are presented in Chapter 6 of this volume.
     4.4.2. Locating a MOS. Immediately following the attack, the EOC dispat ches the airfield damage
     assessment teams to determine the extent and sever ity of dama ges to airf ield operating surfaces.
     Based on initial damage reports from remote observation tools (flightline cameras, mini-UAVs, etc.),
     observers, and base agencies, the EOC directs the ADATs (using preplanned routes) to the least dam-
     aged areas of the airfield paveme nt complex to provide feedback on the size, type, and location of
     damage and UXO. At the same time, DATs make a quick inspection of ADR equipment and stockpiles
     reporting the results of their findings to the DCC where the ADR OIC is initially located. If the DATs
     designated to assess ADR resources and routes are delayed, designated ADR personnel outfitted in the
     appropriate MOPP are dispatched to assess ADR resources and routes. As reports from the ADATs are
     received, the MOS selection team in the EOC record and plot th e damages sustained. In due course,
     the full extent of the attack becomes apparent. The critically important decision at this juncture is to
     determine which areas of the airfield pavement su rfaces require immediate repair to conduct aircraft
     generation. The MOS location will normally be the section of airfi eld requiring the least amount of
     repair and disposal of unexploded ordnance and meets the requirements for aircraft launch and recov-
     ery. The MOS must satisfy mission requirements for sustained operation and must be suitable for the
     type aircraft speci fied by the ICC. The ICC provides aircraft mission requirements and the MOS
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                             41


  selection team, using RQC technical order (T O) procedures, makes a cro sscheck of the MOS length
  requirement.
     4.4.2.1. Repair Time Estimates. Develop repair time estimates and strategies now. Prior to attack,
     the EOC plotter shall contact the DCC and verify what R-Set (R1, R2, or R3) is available for
     ADR. Obtain UXO safing time estimates from the EOD representative on the EOC staff.
     4.4.2.2. MOS Candidate Selection. Shortly after receiving the last bit of relevant airfield damage
     information, the MOS selection team identifies the three best MOS candidates and presents them
     to the Wing Commander for final approval. After the ICC Commander selects a MOS, EOD teams
     start UXO safing and removal actions and ADR personnel begin recovery efforts as soon as appro-
     priate UXO clearance is afforded.
  4.4.3. Mobilizing Repair Forces and Materials. The EOC informs the DCC of the selected MOS
  details and directs the commencement of ADR opera tions. The DCC, in tur n, directs the ADR team.
  Since the ADR OIC is normally in the DCC during the MOS selection phase of the ADR operation
  and has the opportunity to observe the plotting of da mage inputs, he/she should be fully aware of the
  overall ADR recovery requirement. With this knowledge in hand, th e ADR OIC then takes on-scene
  control of the ADR operation, assi gning tasks to the various ADR crater crews; designating travel
  routes of vehicles, equipment, an d personnel from dispersal sites; an d coordinating the efforts of the
  ADR crews, hauling crews, and s upport teams. Vehicles are moved fr om dispersal sites to a staging
  area in preparation for convoying to the repair sites, a last chec k of equipment is made, and the word
  is passed back to the DCC that the ADR teams are ready to proceed. If the team can follow the same
  preplanned route(s) used by the ADATs to the MOS, most apparentUXO hazards on such route(s) will
  have already been identified and the potential for incurring subsequent UXO damage should be
  noticeably reduced.
  4.4.4. Accomplishing ADR Operations. When EOD t eams have sufficiently cleared or safed any
  impinging munitions, the EOC clears the ADR forces for entry to the repair sites. As ADR teams con-
  voy to their respective work areas the team’s OIC and NCOIC conduct a quick final check of the MOS
  to ensure ADR operations can actually commence as planned. If circ umstances that might invalidate
  MOS selection are identified, the OIC should immed iately advise the DCC and inf orm the teams to
  hold position until the situation is reevaluated. Some conditions that might invalidate MOS selection
  include: 1) excessive damage; 2) too lar ge a repa ir area; 3) unchecked brok en fuel lines; 4 ) missed
  area-denial weapons; and 5) damaged utility lines.
     4.4.4.1. If no problems are found, the ADR crews continue the convoy to each of the repair loca-
     tions. Airfield damage repair crews travel to their sites in small, mixed increments so explosions,
     accidents, or contamination will not cripple the ADR effort through the loss of an entire crew. The
     vehicles contain “mixed loads” of people so al l excavator operators or other highly specialized
     personnel will not be attrited by a single explosion. Convoy the vehicles individually at no le ss
     than 60-second intervals. Crews from the support team, such as ai rfield lighting installation, air-
     craft arresting system installati on, FOD removal, and spall repair are also traveling to the repair
     locations.
     4.4.4.2. Convoys a re arranged so that the first groups to arrive on scene are those tasked with
     MOS layout. Minimum operating strip layout usually involves location identification, or layout,
     of the locations identified in Table 4.1.
42                                                                          AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


         4.4.4.3. As crater repair crews arri ve at their work sites, they perform the repair operations fol-
         lowing detailed procedures outlined in UFC 3-270-07. It is up to the crater crew chiefs to ensure
         their repairs progress smoothly and rapidly and that no equipment stands idle. The ADR OIC and
         NCOIC closely monitor the overal l progress of the entire operatio n and ma ke necessary adjust-
         ments as required. Flexibility, resourcefulness, and leadership ability will be required here.

                                      10. Approach lighting

     4.4.5. Any damaged utility lines found in the crater repair area should be reported to the DCC. If the
     broken utility line creates a hazar d, the ADR crew may work in othe r areas until the hazard is elimi-
     nated. Otherwise, do not delay MOS crater repairs because of da maged utility li nes. If the utility is
     mission-critical, undamaged sections on either side of the runway/taxiway crater may be located, and
     a bypass repair accomplished at a convenient time.
     4.4.6. Installi ng the Aircraft Arresting System. Most ai rfield recovery situations will require the
     installation of a MAAS; since it is likely the permanently installed systems are ei ther damaged or
     located in an area unsuitable for the selected MOS. Details concerning arresting systems are addressed
     in Volume 5 of this Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) series and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222, Vol-
     ume 8, Guide to Mobile Aircraft Arresting System Installation. If an arresting system is necessary, its
     location will have been marked by MOS layout personne l prior to the arrival of the aircraft arresting
     system installation team. Prior to initial movement of the ADR fo rces, the support t eam chief ascer-
     tains from the team’ s OIC whether th e arresting s ystem will be unidirectio nal or bidirectional as
     directed by the EOC. This informat ion is passed to the arresting system installation tea m chief. As
     soon as possible after the arresti ng system location has been marke d, the aircraft arresting system
     installation team starts its ef forts. If debris clearance is required at the installation site, the arresting
     system team chief requests such assistance thr ough the support team OIC. Once the arresting system
     is installed, the arresting system team chief checks the tape sweep area for cleanliness. If debris has to
     be moved out of the tape sweep a rea, this is also coordinated through th e support te am OIC. The
     arresting system team chief retains the responsibility for ensuring the tape sweep area is usable even
     after requesting debris removal support. He/she must not declare the arresting system serviceable until
     the tape sweep area is completely clear of any object that could in terfere with the arresting s ystem
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 43


  operation and can certify that the installation is in accordance with T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Arresting Sys-
  tems, Aircraft, Mobile (MAAS). NOTE: For new inst allations or for cases where major civil works
  have been accomplished that may affect system alignment, a task-certified Power Production 7-level
  technician or the civilian WG 5378 equivalent must certify the system ready for use (AFI 32-1043).
  4.4.7. Installing Emergency Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting may not be important for daytime air-
  craft operations, but it is essential for flight in an environment with limited visibility. Restoration of
  the existing permanent lighting system may not be feasible due to the extent of damage or location of
  existing lighting relative to the MOS; if this is the situation, install an EALS. Procedures for installing
  portable lighting systems, as well as guidance on salvaging the exis ting system, are provided in Vol-
  ume 5 of this pamphlet series and AFH 10-222, Volume 7, Emergency Airfield Lighting System
  (EALS) describes the EALS installation process.
     4.4.7.1. In most cases, the question will be when to install the lighting system, not whether one is
     necessary. If considerable daylight will be available after all other ADR operations are anticipated
     to be complete, airfield lighting should not prove to be immediately critical to aircraft launch and
     recovery efforts. On the other hand, if the onset ofdarkness or limited visibility due to bad weather
     is a factor, start airfield lighting installation as soon as possible. The ADR OIC will have to decide
     the timing for this operation based on inputs from the EOC and ICC and the situation at hand.
     4.4.7.2. If it is necessary to inst all the lighting system concurre ntly with othe r ADR operations,
     the lighting installation te am starts the task as so on as possible. Because the edges of the MOS
     may not be marked and considerab le debris may be remaining in the area, final placement of the
     fixtures probably will not be possible when the team first starts its efforts. The cabling and fixtures
     can be assembled 25 feet or so off of the probable MOS edges and moved into place once all major
     debris has been removed from the final installation area. Placement of the airfield lighting regula-
     tor and generator can also be accomplished early . The support team OIC must also make a con-
     certed effort to dovetail the heavier debris clearance activities with the lighting installation. Since
     access to the areas around crater repair activities will usually be limited, the airfield lighting team
     should initially concentrate its activities on ot her areas where access is not hampered by either
     debris or equipment operations. Obviously, such decisions are on-scene judgments with the poten-
     tial of involving unlimited variations. The basic poin t here is not to expect the airf ield lighting
     team to be able to start at one end of the MO S and work to the other end without interruption—
     there usually will be too many other major activities on and around the MOS to allow this. While
     the support team OIC will have much coordination to do with respect to airfield lighting installa-
     tion, the lighting installation team chief retains the primary responsibility for proper installation
     and performance of the system. This individual should not permit the installation team to leave the
     MOS area until the system is fully functional and correctly installed.
  4.4.8. Debris Removal. Debris will be abundant and removal may take cons iderable effort. Expect
  debris removal activities to continue throughout the entire ADR operation time frame. The debris
  removal equipment is responsible for clearing all areas of the MOS and access taxiways that are not in
  the immediate vicinity of crater operations. Th e crater repair teams will clear areas immediately
  around craters; however, final sweeping by the FOD removal team will be required when repairs have
  been finalized.
     4.4.8.1. The debris removal equipment may be divided into se parate teams, each working an
     assigned area, or may remain together working the same area at once. The support team OIC will
     decide the assignments based on the size of the areas to be cleaned and the situation at the time.
44                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        4.4.8.2. Firs t, the FOD removal team clears debris for a clean access rout e for vehicl es to use
        while traveling between craters and while traveling to and from stockpiles or equipment storage
        areas. The team then starts cl earing undamaged areas not containi ng spall fields. Since the spall
        repair operation creates debris, the debris clearance equipment waits until spall repair is complete
        before cleaning spall field areas. Debris should always be pushed at least 25 feet off the MOS. To
        avoid possible aircraft wing contact, never pile material more than 3-feet high. The support team
        OIC will have to oversee this operation closely since its timi ng impacts MOS marking, airfield
        lighting installation, and aircraft arresting system installation progress.
     4.4.9. Spall Repairs. The support team OIC receives information relative to the scope and location of
     spall repair requirements from the ADR OIC at the onset of ADR operations. Based on this informa-
     tion, the support team OIC determines the assignments of the spall repair crews. Unless a spall field is
     located near a crater wh ere there is heavy debris, spalls shoul d be easy to find. Spall crews initially
     start their repairs in thes e areas and move on to the debris-covered area later. This approach allows
     time for the support team OIC to arrange for the necessary debris removal actions to take place. Debris
     covered spall fields are cleared by a single pass of a grader, excavator, or front-end loader—the intent
     is to clear enough debris to enable easy identification of spall locations. Once all spall repairs are com-
     plete, final clearing and sweeping actions are accomplished.
     4.4.10. Airfield Marking. Marking of the MOS is nor mally accomplished before aircraft launch and
     recovery operations commence. Th e MOS marking ef fort includes striping the MOS centerline and
     ends; placing edge, distan ce-to-go, and arresting sy stem location markers; and obliterating existing
     paint markings that are no longer applicable. Undamaged sections of the selected MOS can be marked
     and old markings obliterated while repairs are ongoing in other areas . The support team OIC coordi-
     nates the MOS marking team’ s activities with those of the FOD removal team to prevent marking
     team delays due to a lack of cleared pavement. The goal of the MOS marking team is to have all MOS
     marking complete by the time ADR operations are nearing completion, except for areas where crater
     repairs are in progress on the MOS centerline. As ADR efforts near completion, it is preferred that the
     MOS marking crew is waiting for the crater repair crews to finish, not vice versa. Detailed procedures
     on proper marking of the MOS are presented in AFH 10-222, Volume 16, Guide for Use of the Mini-
     mum Airfield Operating Surface Marking System.
     4.4.11. Moving Off the MOS. The DCC, in coordination with the EOC, determines the next steps in
     the base recovery strategy while initial ADR ef forts are underway. Upon completion of these initial
     ADR recovery tasks, the ADR OIC notifies the DCC of the situation and requests further instructions
     with respect to pavement repair requirements. In all likelihood, th e recovery strategy will include
     numerous additional taskings for ADR team support. These could ra nge from returning to dispersa l
     locations in anticipation of follow -on attacks to continuation of pave ment repair activities to expand
     airfield capabilities. Upon receipt of the applicable instructions, the ADR OIC dispatches the majority
     of the ADR team to its next series of taskings. A portion of the FOD removal team (primarily sweep-
     ers) remains until the final inspection of the airfield pavements is accomplished. If no further sweep-
     ing is required, release the remainder of the FOD removal team.
        4.4.11.1. Before declaring the MOS open, the ADROIC and NCOIC, along with the support team
        OIC, inspect the MOS, taxiways, and access routes to ensure:
            4.4.11.1.1. All craters have been repaired and meet RQC.
            4.4.11.1.2. AM-2 mats and/or FFM are anchored in place.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                   45


           4.4.11.1.3. All necessary spalls have been repaired.
           4.4.11.1.4. Operating surfaces have been satisfactorily swept.
           4.4.11.1.5. Airfield lighting and arresting system, if required, are operational.
           4.4.11.1.6. Markings on the MOS and taxiways are completed and conflicting (old) markings
           have been obliterated.
           4.4.11.1.7. All tools, equipment, and unused components of AM-2 mats and FFMs have been
           removed from the operating surfaces.

4.5. Maintenance of ADR Repairs. Expedient crater and spall repairs are temporary and require periodic
inspection and maintenance. Whenever possible, post observers near the MOS to obs erve deflection of
crater repairs and to note the respons e of aircraft while passing over th e repaired surfaces. Increased air-
craft bounce will be an i ndication of deteriorating serviceability of the repair. Check for rutting and sag-
ging and inspect anchor bolts after 10 to 20 aircraft passes. When the repaired crater has settled, rutted, or
sagged by 2 inches (at its worst point) below the original flat surface of the repair where the mission air-
craft are fighters (3-inches where the mission aircraft are heavies), it must be re-leveled. An obvious
exception would occur if a flush repair is required; in this situation the sag cannot exceed .75 of an inch.
The inherent rigidity of fo lded fiberglass mats to bridge irregularities in the surface of the crushed stone
layer beneath can result in inaccurate readings duringRQC checks. To ensure that the mat conforms to the
shape of the stone surface beneath it, park a vehicle on the mat while taking crater profile measurements.
Surface roughness checks to determine the need for maintenance are identical to the RQC checks accom-
plished at the completion of the init ial repairs. The same st anchions and sight rod ar e used. Take at least
three profiles of each crat er along obvious ruts or al ong equally spaced lines parallel to the ex isting run-
way centerline.
   4.5.1. Maintena nce of AM-2 Mat Repairs. Conduct the following step s when performing mainte-
   nance actions on a failed crater repair involving an AM-2 FOD cover:
       4.5.1.1. Remove all of the nuts from the anchor bolts and inspect bolts.
       4.5.1.2. Remove ramp units from both ends of the mat.
       4.5.1.3. Tow the AM-2 mat away from the crater.
       4.5.1.4. Grade of f any high spots where the stone ha s been pushed up, fill ruts with additional
       crushed stone, and compact the surface.
       4.5.1.5. Check surface roughness to ensure that the repair surface is within tolerance.
       4.5.1.6. Cut off the tops of the old anchor bolts so that they are flush with the MOS surface.
       4.5.1.7. Tow the AM-2 mat over the crater. Replace the ramp units and drill new holes in the pave-
       ment for new anchor bolts. Offset the patch so that new holes are at least 6 inches from the original
       anchoring holes.
       4.5.1.8. Re-anchor the AM-2 mat to the pavement.
   4.5.2. M aintenance of FFM Repa irs. Conduct the following steps when performing maintenance
   actions on failed crater repair involving a FFM foreign object damage protective cover:
       4.5.2.1. Remove and inspect all anchor bolts and bushings.
46                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        4.5.2.2. Tow the FFM away from the crater.
        4.5.2.3. Grade of f any high spots where the stone ha s been pushed up, fill ruts with additional
        crushed stone, and compact surface.
        4.5.2.4. Check surface roughness to ensure the repair surface is within tolerance.
        4.5.2.5. Tow FFM mat over the crater. Realign the mat so the holes in the mat are at least 6 inches
        from the original pavement anchor holes.
        4.5.2.6. Drill new holes in the pavement and re-anchor the mat into position.
     4.5.3. Maintenance of Spall Repairs. Conduct the following steps when performing spall maintenance
     actions:
        4.5.3.1. Remove loose spall repair material and other debris.
        4.5.3.2. Make a new spall repair using cold mix asphalt or quick setting cement.

4.6. Sustainment Crater Repair. Repair efforts designed to upgrade e xpedient repairs for incr eased air-
craft traffic are known as sustainment repairs. Sustainment repairs should be initiated as soon as the oper-
ational tempo permits, considering that expedient repairs are only designed to support 100 aircraft sorties.
Sustainment repairs to an MOS/MAOS are expected to support the operation of 5,000 C-17 passes with a
gross weight of 227,707 kg (502 kips), or 5,000 C-130passes with a gross weight of 79,380 kg (175 kips),
or the number of passes required to support mission aircraft at th e projected mission weights throughout
the anticipated operation, if other than the C-17 or C-130. “Expected to support…” means that these num-
bers of passes can be conducted before additional maintenance is required. While construction time is
important for conducting sustainment repairs, quality control is even more important so that further main-
tenance will be minimized. It is recommended that sustainment repairs commence not later than 12 to 20
hr after expedient repairs are completed; however , mission requirements and the operational tempo will
generally dictate level and direction of the repair effort.

4.7. Summary. The airfield runway ha s always been a vulnerable tar get for enemy air attack. The wide-
spread use of hardened aircraft shelters to prot ect aircraft on th e ground has made the runway an even
more desirable target of an enemy intent on dominating the sky. To counter this threat, CE forces must be
capable of completing rapid runway repair in the shortest time possible.
     4.7.1. This chapter provided inform ation and guidance on organization, equipment, materials, and
     methods for rapid runway repair. The chapter was designed to be used as a ready reference, as well as
     a guide when conducting training.
     4.7.2. By using the material pr esented in this chapter and the references listed in Attachment 1, CE
     units should be able to build a viable ADR home station training program.

                              DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

5.1. Introduction. From an engineering pe rspective, damage assessment activities are categorized into
two distinct areas: airfield damage assessment and facility/utility damage assessment. Resources permit-
ting, both assessment operations should be conducted si multaneously and, depending on the situation at
hand, may be of equal importance. Airfield assess ments include evaluation of damage involving runway
surfaces, taxiway surfaces, and other facilities which directly support aircraft operations. Facility damage
assessment includes evaluation of damage to all other air base facilities and utility systems. This volume
will be limited to airfield damage assessment procedures. Facility da mage assessment, which is con-
ducted by teams referred to as dama ge assessment and res ponse teams (DART), is presented in-depth in
Volume 3 of this series. Airfield damage assessment is the vital first step toward restoring a war-damaged
runway. Since major recovery tasks cannot be star ted until damage assessment and MOS selection are
completed, speed and accuracy during damage assessment are essential. Dedicated ADATs determine and
report the location, types, and numbers of UXO, and the location, types, and quantity of airfield pavement
damage to the EOC. A qualified team in the EOC, known as the MOS selection team, uses this informa-
tion to select candidate MOSs. After the ICC Comm ander selects the MOS, it must be cleared and
repaired in order to launch and recover aircraft. In addition, this team must also take into consideration the
damage to the entire airfield operating surface, which could possibly impact aircraft generation. This
entire airfield area is commonly referred to as the MAOS. Simply put, the MAOS consists of a MOS and
supporting taxiways or access routes.

5.2. Overview. This chapter provides guidance for accomplishing airfield damage assessment operations.
Organization, team composition, and equipment are described as well as assessment techniques and dam-
age recording and reporting procedures.

5.3. General Information. During base recovery, the EOC is responsible to the ICC for all base recovery
and base support activities. The mission support group commander and a r ecovery staff of essential base
support organizations typically man the EOC—including CE representatives, such as EOD, CBRNE, and
MOS selection personnel.
   5.3.1. Civil engineer functions pe rformed in the EOC include dire cting damage assessment opera-
   tions, recording and evaluating da mage reports, plotting airfield damage locations, accomplishing
   MOS selection, developing repair plans, and directing recovery operations.
   5.3.2. To shorten airfield restoration time, engineer damage assessment operations and explosive ord-
   nance disposal/assessment operations will usually be accomplished jointly. Thus, the damage assess-
   ment team is organized to conduct ground assessments of UXO locations; pavement and navigational
   (NAVAID) damage; and aircraft arresting system condition. The assessments are conducted either on
   foot or from hardened vehicles.

5.4. Team Composition. An ADAT normally consists of one EOD technician, one engineering specialist
(usually an engineering craftsman), and one or more augmentees to assist in vehicle operation, recording
information and communicating data to the EOC. Due to the length and width of the asse ssment areas,
more than one ADAT will usually be required; three teams are typical. The exact number of teams neces-
sary is a decision made by the BCE. Each ADA T works to locate and identify UXO and pavement dam-
48                                                                     AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


age. Explosive ordnance disposal expertise is necessary to accurately identify and classify UXO, perform
limited “render safe” procedures on selected ordnance, and oversee activity in the hazardous UXO envi-
ronment (as a ge neral rule, “render safe” proced ures are not performed un less two EOD members are
present). The engineering craftsman will identify UXO coordinates and determine the location and size of
craters, camouflets, spall fields, and other airfield pavement damage. Normally, the ranking member will
be the team chief. Howeve r, regardless of rank the EOD technician is responsible for the team’ s move-
ment where UXO exists. Field test results have proven that, with pract ice, the damage assessment teams
can estimate short distances (less than 100 feet), crater diameters, and spall counts with acceptable accu-
racy without tape measurements.

5.5. Equipment. ADAT equipment requirements will depend on the means by which they conduct dam-
age assessment operations. For ex ample, a team conduc ting damage assessment activities on foot will
have different requirements than a team conductin g assessment activities from a vehicle. In addition to
chemical warfare defense ensembles, each team member may require specific equipment to perform a
particular function. Explosive ordnance disposal personnel shoul d reference appr opriate operating
instructions and technical orders to determine equipment requirements . The following equipment is rec-
ommended for engineering craftsmen and should be preassembled as part of the ADAT deployment kit:
     5.5.1. Safety ropes for approaching a camouflet.
     5.5.2. Data recording and reporting equipment to include base grid maps (both a 1” = 400’ crash grid
     map and a 1” = 100’ airfield pavement map with runway and station posts indicated), damage assess-
     ment forms, clipboards, writing instruments, radios, and spare radio batteries. When possible, include
     current site development tools, such as GPS syst ems and laser equipment, to allow both faster and
     more accurate recording and reporting of pavement damage.
NOTE: Before using equipment that emits signals for damage assessment (such as GPS syste ms and
lasers), get approval from the EOD technician.
     5.5.3. Binoculars and night vision devices to improve detection capabilities in low visibility condi-
     tions.
     5.5.4. Other damage assessment enhancing equipment to include explosion-proof plastic-cased flash-
     lights; nonmetallic measuring tapes; marking tape; flags and UXO markers.
     5.5.5. The damage assessment team should also develop a non-electronic reporting system (runner)
     and should include any additional items needed for this purpose in the equipment list.

5.6. Pavement Reference Marking System. Use current tracking tools such as GPS and geobase maps to
the greatest extent possible to quickly identify damage and UXO locations using the MGRS. When such
tools are not available, or if EOD technicians recommend against using them, use the pavement reference
marking system for successful postattack communications when locating damage. This reference system
should be in place prior to the atta ck and be able to withstand the ef fects of an attack. Furthermore, to
achieve maximum effectiveness, the pa vement reference system should be employed on all takeof f and
landing (TOL) surfaces and their associated access r outes and used as a manual back-up system when
GPS is the primary source.
     5.6.1. A zero point is established for each pavement surface. Dama ge and UXO can be located with
     this reference system by identifying how far down the pavement they are from the zero point and how
     far they are right or left of the centerline. T o eliminate the need for ti me-consuming measurements,
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               49


   markers provide a visual cue th at ADATs use to locate the da mage and UXO. These markers are
   painted on the pavement surface at 50- or 100-foot intervals along the centerline and along each pave-
   ment edge starting at the zero point . Additionally, raised markers are placed at 50- or 100-foot inter-
   vals at a distance between 25 to 50 feet from the edge of the pavement. This duplication and spacing
   away from the pavement edge helps ensure the reference sy stem remains usable following an attack
   and actual recovery operations. Norm ally, placement of these raised markers is accomplished as part
   of preattack preparation and is included on the engineer DCC checklists. Three basic rules need to be
   followed when using the pavement reference marking system:
       5.6.1.1. Zero Poin t Rule. For an airfield pave ment section, the zero po int is fixed. It does not
       switch from one end of the pavement to the other. The zero point is usually established at the run-
       way threshold where normal aircraft operations occur.
       5.6.1.2. Centerline Rule . All distances along th e length of the paveme nt section are measured
       along the centerline from the zero point for that pavement.
       5.6.1.3. Right/Left Rule. Right and left of the centerline are determined as the ADAT faces down
       the centerline of the pavement and moving away from the zero point. Figure 5.1. illustrates a typ-
       ical pavement reference marking system and how the three basic rules are employed.

5.7. Damage Assessment Data. During damage assessmen t, ADATs must gather two types of informa-
tion—location of pavement damage caused by bombs, rockets, etc., and UXO data. Unexploded ordnance
must be accurately located, reported, and recorded in sufficient detail for the EOC explosive ordnance dis-
posal representative to determine the risk to aircraft operations. Include the following information in the
UXO report: location, quantity, size, shape, color, distinctive markings, and fu se type and condition. All
UXO within 300 fee t of repair op erations or aircraft ope rating surfaces must be identified and reported
(and any obvious visible hazard at a greater distance that may threaten ADR operations). Holes of entry
for subsurface UXO and camouflet craters must also be reported. Thus, scaled drawings must show suffi-
cient adjacent area to include a 300-foot UXO radius-of-effect zone for paved su rfaces and crater mat
assembly areas.
   5.7.1. Pavement damage within potential MOS candidates will also be recorded on the same drawings
   as the UXO reports (Figure 5.2.). NOTE: Figure 5.2. shows limitations associated with each possible
   class of pavement damage. However, for airfield ADAT reporting purposes, a crater has a sole identi-
   fication of “C.” This added information has been provided for those who are interested in seeing a pic-
   torial of the limitations associated with each class of pavement damage.
50                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


Figure 5.1. Typical Pavement Reference Marking System.




     5.7.2. The following information should be included ineach ADAT report: damage type (crater, spall,
     crater, spall or bomblet field, et c.); location (by grid coordinates or in rel ation to known reference
     markers); size (crater diameter; crat er, spall, or bomblet field dime nsions, etc.); and number (of cra-
     ters, spalls or bomblets in a field).

5.8. Assessment Technique. Current base recovery planning is based on a two-phased damage assessment
activity: Phase I: initial reconnaissa nce; and Phase II: detailed damage a ssessment. In Phase I, an initial
gross assessment is made from prepositioned locations around the airfield. These locations can be manned
locations which are usually splinter protected and elev ated to afford clear visibility or unmanned tools
such as camera systems, mini-UAVs, or other remote tools to get a runway "quick look." From these van-
tage points, trained personnel can quickly locate areas with UXO and pavement damage on the airfield.
The results of the preliminary surv ey help the EOC quickly direct the ADA Ts to those areas requiring
detailed damage assessment or avoid areas which are apparently too heavily damaged to warrant consid-
eration in MOS selection during the initial efforts. In Phase II, where detailed damage assessment is con-
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 51


ducted, the damage assessment teams follow a pred etermined EOC-directed tr avel route from their
staging location to their area of responsibility. When the MOS selection team has analyzed the data from
Phase I, they will exercise posit ive control of the ADATs. The ADATs, then under the direction of the
EOC, report the extent and location of damage from the areas directed to or along th eir predetermined
route. Detailed damage assessment requires locating damage more accurately than the initial reconnais-
sance, because these reports are the basis for MOS selection.

Figure 5.2. Types of Pavement Damage.




5.9. Initial Reconnaissance (Phase I). The purpose of Phase I, initial reconnaissance, is to assess the post-
attack environment quickly in order to identify the areas of pavement damage
   5.9.1. Precise damage locations or measurements are not expected because most of the Phase I obser-
   vations are made at some distance from the damaged area. Personnel trained in MOS selection should
   make the initial reconnaissance from pre-select ed manned observation posts and/or from camera
   feeds, pictures, or other remote devices. Examples of observation t ools and locations are the control
52                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     tower, flightline camera systems, air base point defense positions, aircraft shelters, overflights,
     mini-UAVs, or other specific airfield vantage points. When hostilities are imminent, personnel will be
     assigned to those observation posts. After the attack, these individuals make visual observations and
     report the size and location of all damage as quickly and accurately as possible. Reporting procedures
     will depend on preattack instru ctions and available communications. Some observers may report
     directly to the EOC, while others report to their organizational control center. For example, security
     forces observers may report direct ly to the security forces base defense operations center , which
     would then relay the damage report to the EOC.
     5.9.2. For any UXO threatening the launch and recovery surfaces, individuals should attempt to pro-
     vide information regarding the size, location, color, condition, etc., of the munition. Also, the extent of
     pavement damage should be reported. From these observations and the resulting initial reports, pave-
     ment areas showing promise as possible MOSs may become readily apparent.

5.10. Detailed Reconnaissance (Phase II). Phase II dama ge assessment will be extremely hazardous and
may be time consuming, depending on the level of damage. Since the extent of potential damage is most
likely an unknown, several damage assessment teams (usually at least three teams) are designated prior to
an attack and dispersed to protected locations on the base. Dispersal is importa nt to ensure ADATs are
available following an attack to conduct the vital first step in establishing an operational runway. Immedi-
ately after an attack, the EOC relays damage assessment instructions to each ADAT. This message is nor-
mally transmitted by radio and will include initial reconnaissance information, any changes to assigned
damage assessment routes (to include new checkpoints), and any special instructions necessary to define
the task at hand. ADAT travel routes are normally identified during preattack planning. Preplanned routes
prevent wasted time by ensuring different teams do not assess the same areas. If appropriate, the EOC can
modify the routes based upon the incoming initial as sessment information. Since the primary purpose of
airfield damage assessment is to ascertain the status and repair requirements associated with airfield pave-
ment surfaces, the preplanned rout es (and any successive modification s by the EOC) should take the
ADATs from their personnel shelters to the ADR staging area and then to the airfield areas. This approach
ensures ADR teams have a relatively safe and clear path from their dispersed locations to the staging area
and subsequent entry to damaged airfield locations. To achieve this outcome logically, the ADATs should
be sheltered close to the ADR team dispersal sites and the ADR equipment should be dispersed with easy
access to ADAT routes. These are not difficult feats to achieve, but they do entail some degree of preplan-
ning.
     5.10.1. The success of the damage assessment operation depends on dedicated communication links
     and strict communication procedures to ensure accurate transmission of damage information. The cur-
     rent concept calls for separate EOD and CE radio nets for transmission of this information. The EOD
     and CE representative on each ADAT will transmit UXO and damage information to the EOC. With
     several DATs passing information to the control center over these radio nets, as well as other CE and
     EOD personnel around the base, the pot ential for confusion is great. It is essential to use clear and
     concise radio transmissions while maintaining strict radio discipline. Unnecessarily keying the mike,
     transmitting unorganized thoughts, and interrupting other transmissions will necessitate the repeat of
     transmissions, which results in the delay of MOS selection and repair operations. Radio communica-
     tions are usually quick an d generally effective, but can be jamme d or intercepted if not secured. If
     secure communications are unavailable, procedures, such as a runner system, should be preplanned to
     address these problems. The use of runners will increase the time to pass information to the EOC, but
     will still get the job accomplished.

  5.10.2. Detailed reconnaissance may be conducted using two possible damage assessment tech-
  niques—vehicular or manual. Both require substantial CE support.
     5.10.2.1. Vehicle Damage Assessment System (VDAS). The VDAS provides the most speed and
     protection for the ADAT and is the primary method of detailed reconnaissance. Ideally, the VDAS
     uses armored vehicles to transport ADATs between UXO and crater locations while providing pro-
     tection from UXO blast and frag mentation effects. These benefits are not provided without some
     cost to system ef fectiveness. Visibility from inside the vehicle is restricted by the armor protec-
     tion. This may require ADATs to use binoculars in order to locate and identify UXO and damage
     from greater di stances. This limitation co ntributes to errors in repo rting the size, position, and
     identification of UXO and damage. The accuracy of this method will vary from person to person.
     Observation distance, weather co nditions, time of observation (nig ht or day), and other human
     factors such as fatigue and fear will affect the accuracy.
        5.10.2.1.1. Hardened Vehicles. Hardened vehicles, such as the M1 13A2 armored personnel
        carrier and the up-armored high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) shown in
        Figure 5.3., provide protection from the UXO environment. If a hardened vehicle is not avail-
        able, substitute with dump trucks or a hardened rapid runway repair vehicle. Pickup trucks and
        similar vehicles do not provide the same measure of protection as do hardened vehicles; how-
        ever, these vehicles may be r einforced with sand bags, plex iglass, plywood, e tc. The ADAT
        composition for the VDAS will vary with vehicle capacity, but should generally be the same as
        the MDAS team composition discussed ear lier. As is the case with a MDAS team, the EOD
        experts are responsible for identifying UXO and safest travel routes. The engineering crafts-
        man is responsible for identifying the damage to airfield pavements, airfield lighting, aircraft
        arresting system, utility systems, etc. Augmentation personnel will assist the other team mem-
        bers as needed and usually are trained to serve as the vehicle operator for the team.

Figure 5.3. VDAS in Up-Armored HMMWV.




        5.10.2.1.2. VDAT General Guid elines. Some ge neral guidelines for ve hicle-based damaged
        assessment are as foll ows. The best travel route will nor mally be along the pavement center-
54                                                                   AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


         line. This route gives equal visibility to both sides of the runway and allows ADAT personnel
         to sweep the area visually forward and t o the sides of the vehicle. Obviously, a meandering
         path may be required to avoi d UXO or pavement dama ge. When this is necessary, the team
         must be careful not to miss damage or UXO on the side of the runway. Because the vehicle is
         used for protection, the damage assessors should remain inside except for extreme cases where
         remaining in the vehicle would gravely hamper the ass essment effort. An exam ple of such
         would be a scenario where extr eme damage has destroyed the pavement reference system. In
         this case, the assessors would have to estimate the distance from the nearest remaining refer-
         ence marker to assure the required accuracy . Specific procedures fo r vehicle-based damage
         assessment of various types of UXO and damage are detailed in the following paragraphs.
             5.10.2.1.2.1. Large UXO. When the ADAT sights a large UXO on the runway surface, the
             damage assessment vehicle will move of f the runway centerline and approach on the f ar
             runway shoulder edge (Figure 5.4.). The ADAT will then stop and record as much of the
             following information as possible: location, number, shape, color, weight, markings, coor-
             dinates, and estimated render safe time.

Figure 5.4. Single Large UXO Assessment.




             5.10.2.1.2.2. UXO Field. When the ADAT sights a bomblet , or group of bomblets, they
             should approach the closest ordnance ( Figure 5.5.) at a safe distance and record the fol-
             lowing information: number, shape, location, field width, field length, color, markings, and
             render-safe time. When this information is recorded and reported to the EOC, the ADA T
             should drive past the f ield in such a mann er to provide the max imum standoff distance
             between the UXO field boundaries and the team.
             5.10.2.1.2.3. Bomb Crater/Camouflet. Craters are gene rally divided into two broad cate-
             gories, large (greater than 20 feet [6 meters] in diameter) and small (20 feet in diameter or
             less). In either case, when bo mb craters or camouflets are detected during vehicular dam-
             age assessment, the ADAT should approach the area with caution. If the area appears to be
             free of UXOs, move close enough to the crater(s) to perform damage assessment and ver-
             ify there is not UXO in the bottom of the crater.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               55


Figure 5.5. UXO Field Assessment.




                5.10.2.1.2.3.1. Large Craters. Coordinates for the center of each crater and the appar-
                ent crater diameter will be recorded. If a camouflet is discovered, its coordinates and
                the size of the entry hole will be recorded. Data on craters, UXO, and camouflets will
                be immediately relayed to the EOC. This immediate reporting procedure not only aids
                in hastening the MOS selection process but also serves to keep the EOC staff aware of
                the team’s position on a frequent basis.
                5.10.2.1.2.3.2. Small Craters. Small craters may be numerous or few, depending on the
                weapons system employed. If there are only a few, follow the same guidance as for
                reporting large craters. However, if there is a large number of small craters, such as
                would be caused by sub-munitions, the team should consider calling them in as a field,
                like a spall field, or mix of a field and individual craters. The decision of which method
                to use must reflect the balance between speed (calling in many grouped small craters
                individually will use a lot of time and tie-up radio frequencies) and accuracy of the pic-
                ture in the EOC (if the field is too broad or spread out, it will not give the ICC enough
                information to make a good MOS selection). A rule of thumb is that if the crater is fur-
                ther than 2 ft from the adjoining craters, it should be called in individually, and if they
                are clumped together closer than 2 ft apart, consider the grouping as a small crater field
                and report it as you would a spall field by counting the number and type(s) of craters
                and approximate apparent depth and report the data. Be careful to observe likely UXOs
                in the field as well as spalls and record/report this data as well. Provide the MOS plot-
                ters with as much of a picture as possible; for instance, if the field is 100 feet wide, but
                80% of the craters are in the left-of-center 50 foot section, say so in your report.
             5.10.2.1.2.4. Crater Fields. Small craters located close together where there upheaval joins
             the neighboring crater should be reported as a crater field. Crater fields are similar to bomb
             craters and should be carefully examined from a distance fo r the presence of UXO. If no
             UXO is sighted, the ADAT should move the vehicle into the area and record the following
             information: center coordinates for the leading and trailing edges, leading and trailing field
             widths, and number of craters within the field.
56                                                                   AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


             5.10.2.1.2.5. Spalls. Spall fields are similar to bomb craters and should be carefully exam-
             ined from a distance for the presence of UX O. If no UXO is sight ed, the ADAT should
             move the vehicle into the area and record the following information: center coordinates for
             the leading and trailing edges, leading and trailing field widths, and number of spalls
             within the field. Because spalls are not highly visible even at close range, spall counts and
             field dimensions may be difficult to determine, especially since spalls are likely to be cov-
             ered with debris.
             5.10.2.1.2.6. Bomblets. Bomblet fields are similar to spall fields and should be carefully
             examined. The ADAT should record the following information: center coordinates for the
             leading and trailing edges, leading and trailing field widt hs, and number of bomblets
             within the field.
             5.10.2.1.2.7. Multiple Ordnance/Damage Sites. It is also possible that a ADA T will
             encounter a situation where damage and UXO pr esence are so severe that continuation of
             the planned assessment run is impossible. Before attempting a circuitous route to reach the
             other side of the blocked area, the ADAT should inform the EOC of the situation. The EOC
             may see a pattern developing, based on the da mage reported, which allows adjustment of
             travel routes to have a different ADAT finish assessing the affected pavement area (Figure
             5.6.). In this type of situation, both ADA Ts would assess damage from their respective
             sides of the blockage and report their findings back to the EOC. The EOC, in turn, would
             plot a composite of the area and, in all likelihood, develop a reasonably accurate picture of
             the damage sustained.

Figure 5.6. Multiple UXO/Damage Assessment.




      5.10.2.2. The manual da mage assessment system (MDAS) is a slow and hazardous damage
      assessment method that requires the runway- taxiway surface t o be surve yed on foot. Dam age
      assessment team members walk specified areas of the runway to identify and locate UXO, pave-
      ment damage, and damage to support systems. Normally, this is accomplished with help from the
      pavement reference marking system. Make distance measurements by visual estimation or pacing,
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 57


       whichever is most appropriate for the situation, from known runway or taxiway locations, by esti-
       mating crater dimensions, and by visually determining UXO identifying features. In addition, the
       team should specify if there is adequate pavement for taxing aircraft to bypass taxiway damage so
       repairs can be delayed until a more opportune time. Although the MDAS is the most accu rate
       damage assessment method, it is extremely time consuming and exposes ADAT members to UXO
       fragmentation and blast hazards. Actions of the individual team members are outlined in the fol-
       lowing paragraphs.
           5.10.2.2.1. As a ddressed earlier, the EOD expert is responsible fo r the overall definition of
           safe travel routes through hazardous areas. The EOD member assigns areas or lanes of respon-
           sibility to each of the augmentees. As the team progresses through its area of responsibility, the
           EOD representative assists the augmentees in the proper identification of UXO and relays per-
           tinent information to the EOC.
           5.10.2.2.2. The engine ering team member has the overall responsibili ty for damage assess-
           ment. The engineering craftsman may be assisted in damage location and recording by one or
           more augmentees. However, as stated earlier, in areas of extreme bomb damage, the EOD rep-
           resentative typically takes charge of the damage assessment team to ensure all pertinent infor-
           mation is gathered, recorded, and relayed back to the EOC.
           5.10.2.2.3. Augmentees are responsible for following the sa fe routes identified by the EOD
           member and identifying all pa vement damage and UXO locations in the assigned area. Any
           identification problems are reported to the EOD or CE representative for resolution. Augmen-
           tees may also assist the EOD and CE members in tr ansmitting information to the EOC. If a
           runner system must be implemented because of communication difficulties, the augmentees
           are usually called upon to serve as runners.

5.11. Priorities. As mentioned earlier , ADAT travel r outes are normally predeter mined to star t at the
ADAT personnel shelters, move to the ADR staging area, and then head toward the more critical aircraft
pavements. These routes ar e updated or altered as required based on initial damage assessment reports.
Generally, the EOC will have selected ADAT travel routes so that the airfield is surveyed in the following
priority:
   5.11.1. Takeoff and Landing Surfaces. This includes runways, alternate launch and recovery surfaces,
   and taxiway segments that are long enough to permit aircraft launch and recovery.
   5.11.2. Access pavements to launch and recovery surfaces.
   5.11.3. Aircraft shelters and parking areas.
   5.11.4. NAVAIDS.
   5.11.5. Aircraft arresting systems.
   5.11.6. Aircraft maintenance, rearming, and refueling areas.
   5.11.7. Other EOC specified locations.

5.12. Locating Damage. Specific crater locations on the takeoff and landing surfaces and the primary
taxiway access are critical to restoring the flyi ng mission. When available, use GPS and the MGRS to
accurately locate and repo rt damage. Installations al ready have very specific grids for the takeof f and
landing surfaces and use the crash gr id for large craters and installa tion damage much as they use in
58                                                                     AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


peacetime that may be used as a manual back-up system, or the primary system if GPS assets are unavail-
able. The overlay grid is very useful for locating problems any place on base, especially when the precise
location is not critical. Simply put, it is a base map with a grid over-lay—usually in a 1:4,800 ratio. How-
ever, bases need to have a more a ccurate grid system for taxiways a nd ramps to plo t/report small crater
fields. This system would provide a link between the airfield s ystem and the crash grid and be used to
allow taxi routes through crater fiel ds with only partial pa vement repairs to enable flying operations to
continue quicker.

5.13. Recording and Reporting Damage. As the damage is assessed, it must be recorded and immediately
reported to the EOC for damage plotting and MOS selection. The speed of reporting depends on the com-
plete understanding of the information being relayed and strict adherence to radio discipline by both EOC
and ADAT personnel. A written list of the reported damage should be kept by each ADAT and provided
to the EOC for verification purposes upon their return. Each damage item is recorded as shown in Figure
5.7. and is reported as a series of letters and numbe rs. A plot of these dama ge items on a 150-foot wide
runway is shown in Figure 5.8. Each plotting item is as follows:

   5.13.1. Type of Damage or Ordnance. Enter damage or ordnance type here, using a letter coding such
   as “C” for crater, “X” for UXO, “S” for spall, and “B” for bomblet.
   5.13.2. Distance Down Pavement. Distance from the ze ro pavement reference point to the center of
   the crater, UXO, or to the closest leading edge of the spall or bomblet field.
   5.13.3. Direction L or R of Centerline. “L” stands for left, “R” stands for right. They denote the direc-
   tion from the pavement centerline to the damage/UXO center point.
   5.13.4. Distance Left or Right. This is the numerical distance expressed in feet.
   5.13.5. Diameter or W idth. For craters or circular spall and bomblet fi elds, enter the letter “D.” For
   rectangular spall or bomblet fields, enter the letter “W.”
   5.13.6. Size of Diameter or Width. This is the numerical estimation of the apparent diameter or field
   width for that point along the pavement.
   5.13.7. Field Identifier. If required, enter the letter “F” to alert the EOC that the following information
   completes the leading edge description of a spall, small crater , or bomblet field. The next alphanu-
   meric group after “F” stands for the same as above and describes the trailing edge of the field.

     5.13.8. Number Identifier (N). The letter “N” alerts the EOC that the field identifier is completed and
     that the next number is the number of spalls, small craters, bomblets, or a mix.
     5.13.9. Number of Bomblets, Small Craters, or Spalls. The numerical es timate of the number of
     bomblets, small craters, or spalls in the field previously identified. If it is a mix, show the total number
     first followed by the breakdown by type. For instance, if the spall field in Figure 5.8. was a mix of 50
     small craters, 25 spalls, and 25                       UXOs; it would be reported as:
     C320R50W40F520L40W60N100(C50X25S25). Note the field designato r to the more challenging
     problem of craters.
     5.13.10. Description. Record any additional information that would be helpful in accurately identify-
     ing the pavement dama ge (diameter, depth, and type of smal l crater) or ordnance (i.e. color, shape,
     bands, size, features, etc.).

5.14. Double Point Damage Plotting S teps. Once the information iden tified by the damage assessment
teams is forwarded to the EOC, it must be correctly plotted in order to determine its impact on the MOS
selection process. Normally, a process called double-po int plotting is used for spall and bomblet fields.
The steps involved in con ducting double-point plotti ng are shown below and in Figure 5.9. Additional
information regarding damage plotting and specific considerations applied during the MOS selection pro-
cedure are presented in Chapter 6 of this volume.

   5.14.1. Step 1—Identify specific type of damage (usually spalls or bomblets) and determine distance
   down the runway for the first point, distance left or right of centerline, and locate the point.
   5.14.2. Step 2—Determine distance down the runway for second point , distance left or right of cen-
   terline, and locate point.
   5.14.3. Step 3—Construct centerline of field by connecting first and second points.
   5.14.4. Step 4—Plot beginning width, centered and perpendicular to centerline of the field.
   5.14.5. Step 5—Plot ending width, centered and perpendicular to centerline of the field.
   5.14.6. Step 6—Connect corners of end lines.
   5.14.7. Step 7—Label the report.

5.15. Chapter Summary. Damage assessment forms the foundation for prompt and effective base recov-
ery actions. Two primary types of teams that involve civil engineers are used in this activity. ADATs, con-
trolled by the EOC, concentrate on airfield pavement damage assessment so that ADR teams can provide
a MOS and access taxiways for combat aircraft as quickly as possible. On the other hand, teams called
DARTs are controlled by the engineer DCC and resp ond to damage assessment requirements associated
with base facilities and utilities. If effective damage assessments are to be realized, both ADATs and
DARTs must be comprised of qualif ied, experienced personnel; be pr ovided adequate communications,
transport, and protective equipment; and be completely knowledgeable of damage assessment procedures.
In addition, a pavement reference marking system, used to identify the locations of damage and UXO on
airfield pavements, must be employe d if the airfield damage assessme nt process is to be within the
required accuracy. The success of subsequent ADR activities, to a large degree, hinge upon the accuracy
of the damage assessment teams efforts.

               MINIMUM OPERATING STRIP (MOS) SELECTION PROCEDURES

6.1. Introduction. If an enemy attacks an air base, the commander's imme diate problem is to launch and
recover mission aircraft as soon as possible after the attack. The BCE must recommend the “best” airfield
surfaces to repair—those that require the least repair time but still provide adequate launch and recovery
surfaces for mission aircraft. The launch and recovery surface selected for repair is called the MOS. The
MOS is the area where airc raft actually takeoff and la nd and its dimensions are determined by the ICC
Commander. The actual dimensions of the MOS vary with aircraft type, operation, and weights as well as
environmental conditions. When a MO S is combined with access taxiwa ys from aircraft staging areas
such as shelters and parking ramps, the entire areabecomes the MAOS. Most of the information presented
in this chapter will focus upon MOS considerations. However, be aware that a MOS cannot be selected
without a full appreciation of the extent of damage throughout the entire MAOS. For example, if an ideal
MOS is identified that involves a minimum repair effort, finding acceptable access routes to that location
should also be taken into account. If necessary, transitional taxiway r outes may have to be cons tructed,
assuming that the tradeoff in resource expenditure justify the efforts. In addition, RQC should be consid-
ered as part of the s election process. This is not to imply that the MOS selection team will include RQC
calculations as part of their MOS selection process. Rather, it mean s that the team should be familiar
enough with the RQC process to be able to apply fundamental RQC requisites indirectly when seeking the
best MOS candidates. Confusion can often be avoided between the cl osely related acronyms MOS and
MAOS, if you do not become a “definition purist.” Wh en used to describe situations, both terms fre-
quently overlap one another. Keep these points in mind as you progress in this chapter.

6.2. Overview. This chapter serves as a guide for Airm en who must choose cand idate MOSs. Divided
into two major parts, th e chapter provides a broad picture of th e MOS c andidate selection process, to
include concept of operations, team organization, sequence of the selection steps, and characteristics of a
good MOS. The second major part of this chapter contains detailed procedures for MOS selection. An
illustrated example of M OS selection is also presented. Common MOS sele ction terms are contained in
Attachment 1 (Terms Explained).
     6.2.1. Engineer Activ ities. When an airfield is attacked, engine er personnel will respond with four
     kinds of activities:
        6.2.1.1. Damage assessment.
        6.2.1.2. Identification of candidate MOSs.
        6.2.1.3. Safing and disposal of explosive ordnance.
        6.2.1.4. Repair of attack damage.
     6.2.2. Event Order . Damage asse ssment, covered in the precedi ng chapter, provides information
     about the location and extent of damage to the surfaces of the airf ield. The ICC provides other infor-
     mation on operational requirements and expected operating conditions following the attack. Using all
     this information, the MOS selection team locates potential operating strips to be repaired and recom-
     mends MOS candidates to the ICC commander. After the ICC commander approves a specific MOS,
     the EOC commander directs the explosive ordnance disposal teams work on the areas designated to be
     cleared. Finally, the ADR t eams begin to repair crater s and spalls, clear debris, repair airfield collat-

   eral damage, and mark the MOS location. These activities are discussed in depth in subsequent chap-
   ters of this document. Since much of the success of the MOS selection procedure depends on advance
   training, personnel should be thoroughly prepared. All engineer, EOC, and DCC team members must
   be familiar with MOS selection procedure and understand each of its phases. Suggested MOS selec-
   tion kit contents are outlined in paragraph 7.7. of this volume.

6.3. Concept of Operations. The current base recovery concept calls for a primary and an alternate EOC.
Both EOCs will have a MOS selec tion team assigned and will simult aneously perform MOS selection.
This provides a double check on propose d MOS candidates and allows smoot h transfer of control in the
event that the primary EOC is incapacitated.
   6.3.1. The MOS selecti on team will receive th e damage and UXO inform ation provided by the
   ADATs and then identifies accept- able MOSs. In the pr imary EOC, a CE repr esentative will record
   data items, such as crater and spall damage. Using a different radio frequency, the EOD representative
   in the primary EOC will record UXO type, loca tion, and fuse data. Airf ield damage and UXO loca-
   tions will be plotted on the MOS selection map. In the alternate EOC, the same information is
   recorded by the CE representatives and plotted on their equivalent MOS selection map. The ICC pro-
   vides other information on operati onal requirements, such as expe cted weather conditions , aircraft
   loads, desired MOS length and width, and arresting system requirements. In today's basing strategies,
   installations often support a variety of aircraft which may have different MOS requirements and prior-
   ities which must be co nsidered in MOS select ion recommendations. Therefore, the EOC should
   request an OG representative to help with MOS selection who understands the current and near-future
   ATO requirements and the aircraft characteristics for the currently assigned aircraft to help determine
   the right MOS requi rements. As da ta is reported, MOS sel ection procedures are co nducted so that
   when the last ADAT reports are received, the MOS candidate selection process is nearing completion.
   Upon completion, three candidate MOSs are recommended to the ICC commander, of which the best
   candidate of the three is typically chosen. It is a good idea to have a couple of alternate MOS possibil-
   ities available in case previo usly unknown operational requirements surface which impact the suit-
   ability of the originally recommended MOS. At bases where there are two (or more) runways/primary
   takeoff and landing surfaces, MO S selection should consider bot h surfaces. The team should work
   with the operators to provide the ICC with the greatest post attack capability in the shortest time. This
   could mean two MOSs, one on each runway, for different aircraft types (e.g. fighter and cargo), or one
   launch and another for recovery in order to get planes in the air quickly and then focus on recovery on
   a timeline to support their return.
   6.3.2. After the MOS has been selected by the ICC commander, the BCE will direct the DCC to pre-
   pare relocation of the ADR equipment from the dispersed locations to the appropriate staging area and
   prepare for the commencement of a irfield repair activities. At the sa me time, the EOC commander
   will direct EOD personnel to begin the safing, removal, and/or the “leave alone” UXO activities. This
   will invoke the employm ent of EOD teams for render-safe procedures a nd clearing sub munitions
   from the MOS and other areas of repair . Once AD R activities are underway, primary and alternate
   MOS selection teams will commence RQC calculations for the c hosen MOS. It should be noted that
   the sequencing of the aforementioned activities is not essential. Many situations may develop that will
   necessitate adjustments. For example, it is plausible that a delay in the actual decision of which MOS
   to repair may allow the MOS selection team sufficient time to conduct RQC calculations on all MOS
   candidates beforehand. On the other hand, a route used from one of the ADR dispersal areas may be
   ladened with UXO problems resulting in a noticeable delay before that equipment will be available to
64                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     contribute toward the recovery ef fort. Flexibility is essential to success of any complex undertaking
     and ADR is by no means an exception.
     6.3.3. In addition to repa iring the pavement damage, CE personne l will mark the MOS, install the
     EALS, and if necessary, install a MAAS. Minimum operating strip marking is normally required prior
     to launching sorties. Installing the lighting and arresting systems may be accomplished after air oper-
     ations have begun, providi ng initial operations are in daylight hours and takeoff and landings can be
     accomplished without an arresting system. Both of these stipulations require approval by the ICC.

6.4. Team Composition. As a minimum, the MOS selection team is comprised of two personnel—one of
which should be an engineering te chnician (AFS 3E5X1). The sec ond team member serves as a radio
operator and data recorder , while th e engineering technician act s as a da ta plotter. CE le adership in the
EOC should pay particular attention during this phase to ensure the MOS selection team does not become
overwhelmed. Multiple ADAT teams, or large numbers of craters, ma y require augmenting the team to
expedite plotting or recei ving data by radio. If UXO is light, consider using the EOD frequency for one
ADAT team's data reporting. Likewise, if other frequencies are underused at this phase of recovery, con-
sider chopping them to the ADAT team/MOS Selection team to expedite MOS selection. The EOD repre-
sentative in the EOC supports the two CE personn el by receiving and reco rding EOD related data from
the ADATs and providing technical expertise on how UXO information should be displayed on the air-
field maps. Both the primary and alternate EOCs will be staffed with similar teams. Table 6.1. provides
further details on the EOC team’s composition, skill requirements, and responsibilities. Be aware that the
manning shown in Table 6.1. represents an ideal arrangement. Local situations may dictate a number of
other manning configurations. NO TE: Additional information regard ing the composition of the EOC
team, of which the MOS selection team is a component, is outlined in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, Contin-
gency and Disaster Planning.

6.5. MOS Characteristics. Simply stated, the goal of MOS candidate selection is to locate the best avail-
able MOS t hat can be repa ired in the least amount of time. A good MOS has ma ny characteristics, the
ranking of which will depe nd upon the situation at a pa rticular base that is attacked. Consequently, the
MOS selection process must be flexible to identify the best option under a wide variety of circumstances.
Generally, a good MOS will allow rapi d restoration of launch and recovery capability. With either of the
two currently approved ADR techniques, crater repair is a lengthy pr ocess. Thus, initially it is important
to repair no more damage than nece ssary. This is the reason that it is worthwhile waiting for completion
of airfield damage assessment before finalizing MOS selection. The MOS selection procedure is designed
to choose a takeof f and landing area that is compar atively low in crater and spall damage. Repair time,
therefore, is saved at the cost of initial delay caused by accurately identifying and plotting damage and
selecting a MOS. While in the majority of cases the MOS with the least damage will be selected, this may
not always be the situation—other consequential considerations could come into play.

   6.5.1. Resource Limitations. An ADR team’s capability may be hampered by resource shortages and
   equipment deficiencies. The MOS selection team should cons ider any noticeable limitations when
   determining candidates. As reconna issance reports are received in the EOC, the selection team must
   make a conscious decision to monitor the status of ADR equipment and materials and keep this infor-
   mation in mind during the MOS selection process. Engineer personnel in the alternate EOC and DCC
   should also monitor equipment and material status as a crosscheck for accuracy. As airfield damage
   assessment nears completion, a quick verification on equipment and ma terial status between all con-
   trol centers should be accomplished to ensure the most current information is being considered.
   6.5.2. Sortie Capability. Aircraft should be able to get to a nd from the MOS quickly . If a MOS is
   selected without regard to sortie generation capability, aircraft operations could be restricted after
   MOS repair. The launch or recovery (LOR) status of an airfield measures sortie generation capability,
   independent of variables such as mis sion time, aircraft attrition, and origin of aircra ft (aircraft may

     launch at one air base and be recovered at another). A few examples of how various restrictions can
     reduce LOR capabilities are shown in Table 6.2. The example in Table 6.2. shows that a MOS with
     two access taxiways that requires an aircraft to backtrack more than 2,000 feet will have an LOR capa-
     bility of only 50%. Additional explanations of other common LOR restrictions are described below.

        6.5.2.1. LOR Status. The LOR status of a MOS is the total number of launches and recoveries the
        surface can handle per unit time compared to the number that could be handled by the same
        undamaged airfield. An LOR status of 100 per cent simply means that the MOS and its access
        route(s) are not restricting sortie capacity. Even if its LOR status is substantially less than 100 per-
        cent, this does not necessarily mean that the MOS is limiting sortie capability. Normal operations
        may not use the entire capability, and other factors in the base stat us after an attack may be even
        more limiting.
        6.5.2.2. MOS Location. A MOS may be located on th e main runway, on a parallel taxiway , or
        even on an alternate launch and recovery surfa ce on or of f base. The MO S location affects LOR
        status in various ways by limiting access and egress, by limiting air traffic control, or by restricting
        the flight approach of aircraft.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                           67


       6.5.2.2.1. Air Traffic Control Limitations. The avai lability of NAVAIDS to control air traffic
       can significantly improve the LO R capability of a MOS. NA VAIDS provide pilots with the
       information necessary to locate the air base and th e operating strip efficiently. NAVAIDS are
       also necessary to support operations when visibility is poor (including foul weather and night-
       time).
          6.5.2.2.1.1. Loca tion Consequences. Location of th e MOS has no ef fect on vi sual
          NAVAIDS such as emergency runway and airstrip lighting systems, since all these are por-
          table and can be installed wh erever the MOS is located. Ho wever, location of the M OS
          does affect the use of non-visual aids. If non-visual NAVAIDS are not present, aircraft can
          be recovered only when weather conditions are good.
          6.5.2.2.1.2. Minimum NAVAID Requirements. The minimum NAVAID requirements for
          a MOS are tactical air navi gation (TACAN)—a radio tran smitter emitting 360 degrees,
          which the pilot uses to locate the airfield; and ground control approach (GCA)—a system
          which guides the aircraft onto a particular strip. The TACAN for the airfield will support
          any MOS, regardless of its location on the field. Ground cont rol approach support can be
          provided to a MOS so long as neither the MO S threshold nor departure is located within
          3,000 feet of the original runway threshold of any GCA-supported runway. If a MOS was
          selected on an airfield surface that did not meet t his criterion, or if the T ACAN or GCA
          facilities were damaged in the attack, LOR status could be degraded by as much as 25 per-
          cent. If both systems were inoperable, landing capacity would be reduced by as much as 50
          percent. If a M OS falls outside the air tr affic control range a nd portable equipment is
          unavailable or take s a long t ime to set up, the MOS selecti on team should be aware that
          LOR status may be further degraded.
       6.5.2.2.2. Access/Egress Limitations. Inadequate access or egress forces aircraft to taxi on the
       MOS, resulting in excessive runway occupancy. At least two access routes are desired, prefer-
       ably one at each end of the MOS. More limited access/egress may reduce LOR rates. Some of
       the more common access route limitations include:
          6.5.2.2.2.1. Cul-de-Sac. The term cul-de-sac refers to the limiting fact or whereby a taxi-
          way access route requires an aircraft to taxi back on the MOS before takeoff or after land-
          ing.
          6.5.2.2.2.2. Only One Access Route. A MOS with a single access route requires aircraft to
          taxi the length of the MOS before takeoff or after landing.
          6.5.2.2.2.3. Taxi Distance. Selecting a MOS that is located off base or has a long taxiway
          route will reduce LOR capability and time to first launch. In addition, overheating of
          brakes could mean higher maintenance problems, and taxiing aircraft will spend more time
          in an exposed, vulnerable condition.
       6.5.2.2.3. Arresting System Limita tions. Operational requirements, landing with battle dam-
       age, shorter than desired landing surface, wet or icy conditions, or other emergencies may dic-
       tate arrested landings. Normally, the MAAS is used for wartime supp ort of MOSs, since the
       probability of an in-place syst em being serviceable and in the correct place after an attack is
       low. The MAAS is capable of an aborted takeoff or arrested landing every 3 to 5 minutes. If an
       existing arresting system remains functional, is located longitudinally correct on the MOS, and
       is situated within the crater free restrictions, its pendant must span the MOS properly to pre-
68                                                                    AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


          vent an aircraft from being pulled to one si de or the other after engagement. Off-center
          engagement capability for the MAAS and BAK-12 is half the distance to the runway edge
          from each s ide of the runway centerline. If the centerline of the selected MOS is within the
          off-center engagement capability of the existi ng system, the existing system can be used, but
          pilots must be cautioned to engage as near to MOS centerline as possible. If the MOS center-
          line is not within the off-center engagement capability of the existing system, the existing sys-
          tem cannot be used (see Figure 6.1.). Regardless of whether a MAAS or an in-place system is
          operated, the compulsory use of an arre sting system will reduce LOR status due to the time
          involved in arresting system recycling operations.

Figure 6.1. Requirements for Use of Existing AAS.




          6.5.2.2.4. Other LOR Factors. Many other variables outside the control of the MOS selection
          team affect LOR status. A few examples include aircraft ma intenance, fueling, arming, and
          pilot briefings.
      6.5.2.3. Limitation Examples. Table 6.2. gives the LOR cap ability of a MOS for various access
      limitations. Use it to help identify the impact your MOS candidate has on sortie capacity. As was
      addressed earlier, inadequate access forces the aircraft to taxi the length of the MOS, which results
      in excessive runway occupancy t ime. If taxiway repairs can be ma de while aircraft are using the
      MOS, you will probably recommend that the strip be declared operational after one access route is
      repaired. However, it may be that craters are located such that safety cons iderations preclude
      repairs to ac cess taxiways during operations. In this ca se, your briefing to the wing commander
      should point out the tradeof f between increased LOR status and decreased recovery time. The
      commander can decide what perc entage of full launch and recovery cap acity is immediately
      required.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                   69


   6.5.3. Low Probable Aircraft Damage. In spite of an earnest effort, the repaired MOS will most likely
   not be as smooth as the original runway. Restoring the surface to its original condition is too time-con-
   suming. However, if the repairs ar e too rough, damage to aircraft st ructures and strut systems may
   result. The acceptable roughness of a MOS depends upon many factors: type of aircraft using it, air-
   craft weight and configuration, repair location length and spaci ng, and environmental conditions.
   Given these conditions, acceptable r oughness for a particular repair depends upon location of the
   repair, the aircraft operation (takeof f or landing), an d the velocity of the ai rcraft as it traverses that
   repair. Each of these factors is in cluded as part of RQC addressed in detail in the next chapter of this
   pamphlet. However, a couple of ke y considerations are worthwhile discussing now since they sub-
   stantially impact MOS operational characteristics.
       6.5.3.1. Density Ratio (DR). De nsity ratio, a relationship betwee n air te mperature and pres sure
       altitude, provides a baseline for potential aircraft performance. For high DRs (on cool days), air-
       craft performance will be good; during takeoffs, aircraft accelerate quickly, achieve high velocity
       and lift in a relatively short distance. Consequently, a MOS may be shorter when the DR is high.
       How quick an aircraft accelerates, decelerates, and generates lift are factors regarding how rough
       of a crater repair an aircraft can tolerate. These factors are taken into account during RQC calcula-
       tions.
       6.5.3.2. Repair Spacing. Another item to consider is the distance between repairs on the MOS. To
       avoid over-stressing the aircraft, vibrations caused by encountering a crater repair must be allowed
       to dampen before the craft encounters another cr ater repair. Selecting a MOS with craters spaced
       far apart will increase the am ount of time available for damp ing the vibrations and usually
       decreases the need for high quality repairs and the need for frequent maintenance and subsequent
       repairs.
   6.5.4. Expansion Capability. The MOS is an expedient operating surface selected to support a specific
   combination of aircraft under specif ic conditions. A larger operating surface, or one that can be rap-
   idly expanded, is always highly desirable. In somesituations, the commander may choose to delay ini-
   tial recovery in order to provide a more flexible MOS. The MOS selection team should keep these
   factors in mind as it se arches for a candidate MOS . Avoid boxing-in the MOS with large craters at
   both ends. If an expansion option with equivalent or slightly longer repair time is available, that option
   should be included in the briefing to the wing comm ander. Also, be aware that expansion of a MOS
   may affect the repair qualities required. If you are planning on later MOS expansion, you may want to
   make the initial RQC calculations adequate to support both the initial and expanded MOSs.

6.6. MOS Selection Kit.
   6.6.1. Each CE squadron at an overseas MOB and uni ts within the CONUS th at have a deployment
   docket should develop a MOS selection kit. If the installation performs peacetime damage assessment
   and tracking using au tomated mapping tools such as G eoBase/GIS, the kit may include these same
   tools; but sufficient backup capability must be available, such as duplicating information on a differ-
   ent hard drive/server at the alternate EOC. However , the team should look at depl oyability of this
   capability and exercise it to ensure wartime-unique tools are not overlooked. In addition to the neces-
   sary GIS equipment, the kit should include, as a minimum, the items listed below.
       6.6.1.1. Transparent material for making MOS templates (e.g., clear acetate or Plexiglas).
       6.6.1.2. Plotting board.
70                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        6.6.1.3. Critical resource charts.
        6.6.1.4. Straight edge, engineer scale, and transparent circle templates with decimal units match-
        ing the airfield map scale.
        6.6.1.5. RQC T.O. 35E2-4-1, Repair Quality Criteria System for Rapid Runway Repair.
        6.6.1.6. Markers, pens, and pencils.
        6.6.1.7. Damage reporting/recording forms.
NOTE: Transparency material, markers, pens/pencils, and circle templa tes should be obtained through
either local purchases or normal supply channels.
     6.6.2. In addition to the items above, the following additional MOS selection kit augmentation items
     must be available at each MOB or deployment location for MOS selection team use:
        6.6.2.1. Base map - 1:4800 (1” = 400’) scale.
        6.6.2.2. Airfield map - 1:1200 (1” = 100’) scale with the r unway identifier and station marker
        posts indicated. Ideally, the runway portion of the airfield map should be lightly partitioned in 10'
        increments to ease and expedite plotting.
        6.6.2.3. Plotting board.

6.7. MOS Selection Phases. Minimum operating strip selection is accomplished in four phases: (1) Alert
status preparation—gathering the team equipment an d basic information for use during MOS selection;
(2) plotting the damage and searching for candidate MOSs and access/egress routes; (3) evaluating candi-
date MOSs; and (4) briefing the MOS candidates to the ICC commander for final MOS approval.
     6.7.1. Phase 1—Alert Status Preparation. After declaration of an alert condition, MOS selection per-
     sonnel report to their assigned base recovery du ty position to acquire information on MOS dimen-
     sions, aircraft types and missions, direction of takeof f and landing, weather conditions, and possible
     use of an aircraft arresting syst em. This information should be recorded on the airfield map where it
     can easily be seen by the entire EO C staff. The information should al so be relayed to the alternate
     EOC and the DCC by the MO S selection team located in the primary EOC and posted on the RQC
     Worksheet #1. NOTE: Repair quality criteria Instructional Guidelin e Steps 1 and 2 can be accom-
     plished during the preattack period. This is also the best time to contact the DCC and verify what R-set
     (R1, R2 or R3) is available for ADR.
        6.7.1.1. MOS Dimensions. The ICC will determine the dimension of the MOS it needs following
        an attack. These dimensions will be based on the known requireme nts of aircraft expected to use
        the MOS, mission objectives, weather, aircraft performance, and environmental conditions. After
        obtaining the MOS dimensions, make the MOS templa te to create a “picture” of the MOS in the
        same scale as the airfield map. When the installation has multiple types of aircraft and missions, a
        MOS template should be developed for each with an ICC-provided mission priority . This will
        allow the ADR teams to focus on the most pressing MOS while having si tuational awareness of
        the overall requirement. An example would be a MOS needed as quickly as possible for fighters
        and a C-17 MOS needed within 12 hours. This would drive the t eam to focus on the MOS to get
        fighters operating and then plan to expand or develop the C-17 MOS in concert with the ICC's
        ATO to provide the C-17 MOS for on-time resu pply without delaying offensive operations.
        NOTE: Generally, the dimensions of a basic MOS for fighter aircraft are considered 50 ft. x 5,000
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               71


     ft. However, a number of factors, such as weathe r conditions, can necess itate that a lar ger MOS
     width or length is desirable. Consequentially, do not be surpri sed if a wing commander insists
     upon greater MOS dimensions.
     6.7.1.2. Aircraft Requirements. Ask the ICC to pr ovide the MOS operationa l requirements, i.e.,
     what type(s) of aircraft will use the landing surface, and will each type be landing only, taking off
     only, or both. Under certain circ umstances, an evacuation strip may be required. Evacuation is a
     minimum gross-weight takeoff, requiring a minimal amount of pavement. NOTE: Post this infor-
     mation on RQC Worksheet #1.
        6.7.1.2.1. Aircraft Braking. A decision must be made for certain aircraft as to whether the air-
        craft will brake during landing. The trade-off here is that when braking is allowed, less pave-
        ment is required, but repairs must be smoother. If braking is not allowed, a rougher repair
        quality may be acceptable, but a longer MOS is required.
        6.7.1.2.2. Aircraft Arresting System. For fi ghter aircraft equipped with a rresting hooks, t he
        possibility exists for using an AAS when landing. This is only an option if your base has a
        MAAS available, or if the in stalled arresting systems and sufficient surrounding pavement
        remain undamaged. In wet and especially in icy conditions, the arresting system substantially
        reduces the amount of pavement required to land. If a system is available and wet or icy con-
        ditions exist, plan on using it to recover fighter aircraft.
     6.7.1.3. Weather Conditions. Consult the ICC or base weather regarding present and forecasted
     (48-hour) weather conditions. Always use the most critical weather forecasted in your computa-
     tions. In wet and icy conditions, most aircraft will require more than 5,000 feet to land. An arrest-
     ing system may be needed to r ecover aircraft when insufficient cleared pavement is available.
     Furthermore, weather information must be updated as actual c onditions change. The three main
     weather indicators are runway condition readi ng (RCR), runway surface condition (RSC), and
     DR. Each will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.
     6.7.1.4. Unidirectional or Bidirectional MOS. A MOS can be used for unidirectional (takeoff and
     landing in only one direction) or bidirectional (takeoff and landing in both directions) operations.
     Repairs in landing zones will usually require higher RQC. Ask the ICC for the directional require-
     ments (compass heading) for the MOS. W ind conditions also affect the direction requirement,
     since it is desirable for aircraft to takeoff with a head wind. If high changeable winds are expected,
     a bidirectional MOS may be required.
     6.7.1.5. Taxiway Widths. Minimum operating strip selection by its very nature concentrates on
     determining desirable MOS characteristics. Taxi access to the MOS must not be forgotten. Data on
     taxiway requirements should also be gathered early in the selection process. Of primary concern
     are the required taxiway widths to support the various types of a ircraft expected to be using the
     MOS. Table 6.3. provides minimally acceptable taxiway widths for common aircraft. Choose the
     largest width from those which a pply to aircraft that will be using the MOS. In addition, request
     data from the ICC regarding aircraft turning radius requirements. Consider the problems presented
     if an aircraft should breakdown on a taxiway that is too narrow for the aircraft to be turned around.
     Though not a “ show stopper,” this information should be part of the evaluatio n process. Supply
     the ADATs with this information so that they can judge whether access routes are open or require
     repair. Also, do not forget to pass the same information to the alternate EOC and the DCC.

     6.7.2. Phase 2—Plotting the Damage and Searching for Candidate MOSs. Selection of candidate
     MOSs is based primarily on the data provided by ADATs. However, the data is gathered under adverse
     conditions and is not precisely m easured; therefore, it may include some amount of error . Initial
     detailed airfield damage information comes into the EOC from the ADAT reports. The radio operators
     log it on an appropriate form and plotters subsequently annotate th e base map accordingly. The goal
     should be to have MOS candidate selection completed within 30 minutes after the last damage assess-
     ment reports on the potential LOR pavement surfaces are received. Ho wever, much of the work can
     proceed while receiving damage assessment reports. The following guidance describes the general
     process for MOS plotting by hand; it does not prevent automation of the process so long as the same
     general steps are followed to arrive at MOS candidates for presentation to and evaluation by the ICC
     and EOC leadership.
        6.7.2.1. Plotting. When the ADATs begin calling in pavement surface reports, plot damage on the
        1:1200 (1” = 100’) scale airfield map.
            6.7.2.1.1. Craters. The most critical damage data are the location and size of craters. The cir-
            cle template used for crater plotting should have a decimal sc ale (e.g., a 0.40-inch circle will
            represent a 40-foot circle on 1:120 0 scale airfield maps). The apparent crater diameter called
            in by the ADATs should be doubled when plotted to represent the approximate required repair
            diameter. The apparent diameter should be noted inside the ci rcle. The actual repair diameter
            will depend on how mu ch upheaval lip has to be re moved during the actua l repair process.
            This obviously will be unknown unt il the ADR crews pe rform their upheaval measurements.
            However, the doubling of the apparent diameter gives a reasonable approximation and allows
            some room for both plotting and assessment error.
            6.7.2.1.2. Spalls and Bomblets. A spall or bomblet field is shown on the airfield map by mark-
            ing its perimeter and noting the approximate number of spalls to be repaired or bomblets to be
            removed. Bomblet and spall field counts are estimates and probably will not be exact; a factor
            to consider when determining overall recovery time. However, spall and bomblet fields nor-
            mally are not as difficult as craters to repair in terms of searching for candidate MOSs.
            6.7.2.1.3. Utility Damage. Utility dama ge affecting MOS selection must also be plotted.
            Examples include damaged petroleum, oil, and l ubricant (POL) lines; ai rfield lighting; water
            lines; or electrical lines. Utility damage is especially critical when it occurs near runways and
            taxiways, since it could lead to pavement washout or deterioration or present a serious hazard
            to aircraft maintenance crews and firefighters.
            6.7.2.1.4. UXO. Individual large unexploded ordnance should be marked with reasonable pre-
            cision on the airfield map. They should also be cross-referen ced with the EOD incident list.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              73


         Exact position of a UXO is not critical, due to the large radius of effect upon detonation. Once
         a UXO is plotted, the EOD representative should determine the radius of effect on the airfield
         map. De-pending upon what areas are covered by this radius, the prioritization of EOD recov-
         ery actions could be influenced.
         6.7.2.1.5. Other. During plotting, you should also assess potential access/egress routes using
         the required taxiway width as determined in Phase 1. As me ntioned earlier, access/egress to
         both ends of the MOS is an important factor when it comes to sortie capacity. A single access
         route could cut your launch and re covery capacity to 40 percent or lower. If damage is high,
         operations may begin with one access route; a nother route can be clear ed as repair teams
         become available. This strategy is particularly good if repairs to the second access route can be
         made while the MOS is in use. Figure 6.2. shows an example of various types of damage plot-
         ted on the runway.

Figure 6.2. Example of Damage Plots.




      6.7.2.2. MOS Candidate Selection Considerations. The primary aim of MOS selection is to iden-
      tify the best launch and recovery strip candid ates for recommendation to the wing commander .
      However, always remember to check for MOSs that have the same centerline as the runway ini-
      tially and begin or terminate at the threshold of the existing runway. If the same centerline cannot
      be used, the selected MOS must be parallel to the centerline of the runway. A skewed MOS is not
      desirable and should be used only as a last resort when no other option is available. Other prime
      considerations in the selection process include:
74                                                                AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     6.7.2.2.1. Craters and Spalls. How many and what size are the craters? Likewise, how many
     spall repairs are required? A MOS involving the least number and smalle st size craters and
     spalls will probably be the most attractive option. Start by avoiding areas with dense clumps of
     damage. Remember that the ADATs may not be reporting the damage accurately . Damage
     assessment reports are only “b est” estimates made under dif ficult circumstances; they could
     easily be off by several feet. However, there is some leeway, since the cr aters are plotted to
     represent repaired rather than apparent diamet er. Nevertheless, if po ssible, avoid butting the
     MOS right up against the edge of plotted craters. These craters may not be exactly where you
     think they are. Also, attempt to find a MOS th at does not have crater s in the landing (touch-
     down) zones—roughly the first and last 1,000 feet of the strip.Besides requiring a higher qual-
     ity of repair, craters in thes e areas will demand considerable maintenance since the landing
     zones receive the most abuse from aircraft traffic.
     6.7.2.2.2. MOS Access. Always look for a MOS with good taxiway access/egress. Search for
     candidates with routes by which aircraft from shelters can readily taxi to and from both the
     takeoff and landing ends of the MOS. Access routes are best when positioned close to each end
     of the MOS.
     6.7.2.2.3. Expansion Potential. The commander may opt for a MOS that requires a somewhat
     longer repair time if it can be readily expanded to support additional aircraft or poorer weather
     conditions. Always look for a MOS that is longer and wide r than the minimum requirement
     provided by the ICC. Do not forget the possibility of using parallel taxiways as a primary
     MOS.
     6.7.2.2.4. UXO. Are there any lar ge buried bombs that will require careful excavation, or
     bomblet fields that exclude a candidate MOS from consideration? Are bomblets mixed with
     crater debris, making clearance too slow? Will an in-place defl agration of an UXO make the
     MOS candidate option worse? A deflagration is an accelerated burnout of explosive material
     within an item of ordnance. An EOD technician hitting the munition with a rifle round usually
     causes this situation. The resulting reaction (deflagration) is normally less destructive than that
     caused by allowing the ordnance to detonate—but some damage to the pavement surface will
     usually result.
     6.7.2.2.5. Resource Limitations. Consider any li mitations in resources that might impinge
     upon a repair ef fort. For example, if the stocks of spall repair material have been depleted, a
     MOS with few spalls will be at a premium. Likewise, if ADR equipment has been damaged,
     the impact on repair techniques and time must also be taken into consideration.
     6.7.2.2.6. MOS Identification. Once candidate MOSs are selected, the threshold and departure
     ends and edges should be bracketed ([ ]) on the airfield map. The MOS threshold is designated
     at the lowest numbered pavement reference ma rker. Conversely, the highest numbered pave-
     ment reference marker indicates the MOS departure. Be sure to coordinate the designation of
     the MOS threshold with the ICC.
     6.7.2.2.7. Other Factors. Minimum operating strip selection requires a compromise of all the
     aforementioned considerations. For this reason, the EOC staff must have an intimate knowl-
     edge of ADR procedures, capabi lities of the repair teams and availabilit y of all of the ADR
     assets and materials . The EOC s taff must al so have a basic unde rstanding of operational
     requirements in terms of weather, NAVAID support, and aircraft operating characteristics. The
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                            75


          EOC staff must be able to discuss all the tradeof fs knowledgeably and effectively with the
          BCE and the wing commander to select the best repair plan. Table 6.4. provides a MOS selec-
          tion checklist highlighting a few of both th e desirable and undesira ble MOS features. Good
          MOS selection is an acquired sk ill attained through training and operational readiness exer-
          cises. In the next procedure phase, candidate MOSs will be evaluated based on time for repair
          and assessment of various opera tional limitations. During MOS candidate selection the EOC
          staff will have time to evaluate only a fe w MOS candidates. The MOS selectio n team must
          have practiced enough to know the trade-offs without stopping to figure them out.

Desirable MOS Selection Aspects
___ 1. Crater locations on MOS that facilitate repair in pairs rather than single repairs may be
          desirable to reduce crater repair times. (RQC will normally be more restrictive for closely
          spaced craters.)
___ 2.   MOS aligned on existing centerline to reduce marking time and take advantage of surviving
         NAVAIDS.
___ 3. MOS with one end (either threshold or departure) situated on threshold of the original runway.
___ 4. A MOS that can utilize an existing in-place arresting system system.
___ 5. Craters which are located close to material stockpiles.
___ 6. A MOS with access/egress routes at each end.
___ 7. A MOS with a minimal number of crater repair locations.
___ 8. A MOS with dimensions longer and wider than the nominal 5,000’ by 50’.
Undesirable MOS Selection Aspects
___ 1. Craters located so close together that there is no clear working space around them.
___ 2. More craters, spalls, & UXO than a full ADR team can handle in a 4-hour time frame.
___ 3. Craters within the first & last 1,000 feet of the MOS (these are the takeoff/landing touchdown
         zones; repair RQC in these zones are more restrictive).
___ 4. Boxed-in MOS, one that has large craters situated at the ends that limit expansion potential.
___ 5. Craters in either an aircraft arresting system's cable approach or fixed tape sweep areas.
___ 6. Only one access route with no potential of developing a second route.

   6.7.3. Phase 3—Evaluating a Candidate MOS. Once th e MOS candidates have been identified, sev-
   eral factors must be considered before making the final selection. Many of these are somewhat subjec-
   tive; therefore demand a wide experience base on the part of the engineer members of the EOC staff.
         6.7.3.1. Engineering Repair T imes. Equipment availability must be a prime consideration when
         selecting MOS candidates. Both vehicular and equipment availability directly impact upon an
         ADR team’s crater repair times, regardless of operator expertise. Three equipment packages (R-1,
         R-2, and R-3) have been deve loped to manage ADR requireme nts. Each package supports a
         defined crater repair requirement. For example, the R-1 set will only provide enough vehicles and
         equipment to repair three 50-foot (large) bomb craters within a 4-hour period; whereas, an R-3 set
         will provide enough assets to allo w a properly manned team to repa ir a total of 12 lar ge craters
         within the same 4-hour time limit. Details regarding ADR equipment sets are outlined in Chapter
         8 of this volume. If your ADR team has been training consistently, the data presented in Table 6.5.
         should provide reasonable crater repair time es timates. If not, your estimate will have to be
         adjusted to be more subjective . Field tests have shown that an untrained team will nor mally
         require at least twice as much time to perform ADR as compared to what is illustrated in the table.
         Times obtained during training exercises may also prove helpful in estimating actual repair times
         required by your team. However , take into consid eration that time esti mates from training situa-
         tions normally involve conditions that are much better than those faced in a wartime environment.
78                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        Furthermore, you will need to te mper your estimates with the following considerations. Most of
        these factors will lengthen the ADR process to various degrees.
            6.7.3.1.1. What is the phys ical and mental condition of ADR team members? Are the troops
            fresh or have they been subjected to previous attacks and subsequent ADR operations?

Table 6.5. Estimated Crater Repair Times For a Dual Crater Repair.
                              Repair Time              Additional Time          Total Repair Time
     Apparent Diameter
                              First Crater             For 2nd Crater           For Both Craters
     5-20 feet                65 minutes               35 minutes               100 minutes
     >20 feet                 155 minutes              65 minutes               220 minutes
     NOTE: Times reflected are for both AM-2 and folded fiberglass mat repairs conducted under
     ideal environmental conditions with a complete vehicle/equipment complement utilized by a
     highly trained and capable team. Estimates do not include travel times to repair locations.

            6.7.3.1.2. What attrition has ta ken place? How many personnel have been lost or vehicles
            damaged?
            6.7.3.1.3. What type of repairs ar e to be performed? Field experience has shown that AM-2
            repairs typically go faster than FFM repairs due to less stringent quality requirements.
            6.7.3.1.4. What is the current or expected CBRN stat us? Will the ADR crews have to wear
            portions or all of their ground crew ensembles during repair activities?
            6.7.3.1.5. What are the environmental factors that will be present during repair? Will it be hot,
            cold, dark, wet, etc.?
            6.7.3.1.6. What is the possibility of a reattack and what will be the time lapse? This type of
            information could be vital in deciding whether to repair an expanded MOS or stick with the
            minimum requirements.
            6.7.3.1.7. How experienced are the ADAT members at estimating crater sizes and locations?
            An inexperienced team could be providing data that are prone to recurring errors.
        6.7.3.2. EOD Time Estimates. The EOD representative in the EOC will estimate the EOD clear-
        ance time for candidate MOSs. In addition, this individual will decide which EOD activities must
        be completed before ADR can begin and estimates “safing” times for each UXO. The EOD tech-
        nician will also estima te the time needed for in-place UXO deflagration and/ or bomblet field
        removal from the MOS and UXO clearance on routes from ADR dispersal sites to the MOS. The
        input from the EOD representative is critical to MOS selection and evaluation. It is entirely possi-
        ble that the MOS with the least crater repair work could be negated by extensive UXO safing and
        clearing requirements.
        6.7.3.3. NAVAIDS. The availability of NAVAIDS must be considered. If NAVAIDS are inopera-
        tive, what will it take to put them back in se rvice? Are mobile NAVAID units available and can
        on-base communications personnel install them quickly? If NAVAIDS will be out of service for an
        extended period, other factors may become more important. For example, two access taxiways to
        the MOS rather than only one may be required, th ereby speeding ground flow of aircraft to com-
        pensate, to some extent, for the loss of air traffic control abilities.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              79


     6.7.3.4. LOR Capability. The MOS selection team must assess any LOR limitations pertaining to
     each MOS candidate. Usi ng the LOR table and the base layout map, the team must evaluate the
     various trade-offs associated with numbers of access taxiways, availability of arresting systems,
     aircraft traffic flow, fueling and maintenance locations, etc.
     6.7.3.5. Collateral Damage Repairs. Damage to in-place arresting systems, airfield lighting, vicin-
     ity utility lines, and NAVAIDS may have to be repaired before a MOS can become operational.
     Therefore, repair times for these systems involved with a particular candidate MOS must be con-
     sidered. Some collateral damage may affect all possible MOS sel ections (i.e., when an ai rfield
     lighting vault has been destroyed). Other collateral damage may affect only a few of the possible
     MOS candidates, such as a ruptured POL line crossing under the pavement at 1,000 feet from the
     south end of the runway . Repairing collateral damage will normally not be an overriding,
     time-critical factor, since crews other than ADR teams will be assigned to repair collateral dam-
     age. However, the MOS selection team must analyze all collateral damage for its potential impact
     on MOS selection.
     6.7.3.6. Other Factors. As part of the evaluation process, MO Ss identified by the alternate EOC
     are also reviewed, particularly if they differ from the ones developed by the team in the primar y
     center. This action provides a “c heck and balance” capability for MOS selection, thereby lessen-
     ing the possibility that important factors have been overlooked. In addition, both the DCC and its
     alternate are als o transcribing damage reports provided by th e ADATs and plotting candidate
     MOSs. By using this “cross-feedi ng” approach, the DCC can become aware of the true extent of
     the airfield damage incurred and attain a realistic insight to the extent of the ADR effort they will
     have to mount.
  6.7.4. Phase 4—Recommending MOS Candi dates to the Commander. In the last phase of the MOS
  selection procedure, the MOS sele ction team chief checks the work of the team and briefs the com-
  mander and BCE on the candidates.
     6.7.4.1. Presenting Options. The MOS selection team chief recomm ends one or more candidate
     MOSs, estimates the comparative recovery times, and describes the advantages and disadvantages
     of each selection. The commander may request more information, such as an estimate of the time
     needed to expand a given MOS. In any case, the commander will be required to select a MOS on
     the basis of the data pr ovided, while at the same time considering many fa ctors that are hard to
     quantify. All decisions ha ve some risk. Even with precise information, a less-than-the-best MOS
     may be selected. The MOS selecti on team’s job is to provide an accurate and timely summary of
     necessary information to the commander , whose job it is to define what “best” means in a given
     situation.
     6.7.4.2. Commencement of Activities. Once th e commander has selected a p articular MOS to
     repair, the BCE will advise the DCC so ADR teams can be dispatched. At the same time, the EOC
     will direct the EOD technician to dispatch th e UXO safing and bomb removal teams to clear the
     ADR team’s route to the MOS, and the MOS itself, of munitions. The EOC staff also provides the
     details of the selected MOS to the DCC and alt ernate EOC. Besides the basi cs such as length,
     width, and location of the MOS, in formation on aircraft turning ra dii, access/egress route width,
     sweeping width, time frames for ancillary equipment installation (e.g., airfield lighting, etc.) must
     be provided. The method of identifying the basi c information pertaining to a selected MOS is
     shown in Figure 6.3. The EOC and DCC staffs must effectively communicate between each other
     to ensure recovery instructions and requirement s are clearly and totally understood. As airfield
80                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


        recovery progresses, the MOS sele ction team calculates RQC for the MOS repairs, monitors the
        repair process, and updates the appropriate maps and charts to indicate the airfield’s current condi-
        tion. NOTE: When forwarding MOS information to th e DCC, it is important to include data that
        indicates the direction of t ravel for a unidirectional MOS. The best method for doing so is to
        include the compass heading. Fo r example, on a 06-24 runway , the indication would be either
        “compass heading 060” if aircraft travel i s from the 06 end to the 24 end, or “compass headi ng
        240” degrees if aircraft travel is from the 24 end to the 06 end.

6.8. Review of MOS Selection Steps. The following is an abbreviated step-by-step review of the primary
steps that members of the MOS selection team should take prior to and during the selection process.
     6.8.1. Verify availability of all necessary MOS selection maps, documents, materials, and equipment.
     6.8.2. Obtain information from ICC on aircraft requirements, MOS dimensions, taxiway dimensions,
     operational parameters, environment conditions, NAVAIDS, arresting system requirements, etc.
     6.8.3. Construct a MOS template to the prescribed measurements provided by the ICC. Be sure that
     the template is made in the same scale as the airfield maps used to plot the damage.
     6.8.4. Inform ADATs of require d MOS a nd taxiway dimensions and pertinent operational needs s o
     that they can apply this data during their assessment process.
     6.8.5. Record and plot damage and UXO data on the airfield map.
     6.8.6. Select candidate MOSs to include access and egress routes.
     6.8.7. Evaluate candidate MOSs in terms of repa ir times, LOR capabilitie s, and collateral damage
     impacts.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               81


   6.8.8. Recommend MOS candidates to the wing commander (typically at least three, but do not delay
   excessively if a third is not realistic). Report the comparative recovery times, and describe advantages
   and disadvantages of various courses of action.
   6.8.9. Relay commander’s decision on MOS to the DCC and alternate EOC.
   6.8.10. Have DCC dispatch ADR crews to relocate from their dispersed locations to the staging site.
   6.8.11. Dispatch ADR crew to theMOS after sufficient EOD safing/clearing operations are complete.
   6.8.12. Perform RQC calculations and monitor progress of recovery efforts.

6.9. Situation Example. The following example is presented to walk-thr ough some of the thought pro-
cesses involved in the MO S selection process. The example is overly simplified, but it outlines a few
MOS selection considerations likely encountered in an actual postattack environment.
   6.9.1. Circumstance. United States forces are deployed to a theater operating location. The base run-
   way measures 9,000 by 200 feet wi th three access taxiways ( Figure 6.4.). In-place aircraft arresting
   systems are located 1,200 feet from each end of the runway and airfield lighting exists. One MAAS is
   in war readiness material (WRM) storage on base. The UTCs identified in Table 8.4. are in place and
   an R-3 ADR set (see Chapter 8) is available. Considerable quantities of AM-2 matting are available,
   but due to heavy structural damage to a storage facility, folded fiberglass mat quantities are available
   to repair only three craters. Training records reflect that a typical ADR crew ha s had training in both
   methods of ADR; however, such a crew will require a minimum of 4 hours to repair two craters using
   the fiberglass mat technique. The base has just experienced an initial attack.
82                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


Figure 6.4. Airbase Layout.




     6.9.2. Phase I—Alert Status Preparation.
        6.9.2.1. Preattack Actions. Prior to the attack, the wing operations center informed the EOC of the
        following:
            6.9.2.1.1. MOS dimensions of at least 4,800’ by 60’ are required to support the fighter aircraft
            deployed to this location.
            6.9.2.1.2. Support of cargo or other wide-body aircraft is not an initial consideration.
            6.9.2.1.3. The use of an arresting system is highly desirable.
            6.9.2.1.4. The weathe r is expected to be fair for an ex tended period, therefore, rain and ice
            should not be a limiting factor.
            6.9.2.1.5. A bidirectional MOS is desirable.
            6.9.2.1.6. Access/egress route width needs to be at least 25 feet.
            6.9.2.1.7. Maximum use of combat quick turn areas will be made.
            6.9.2.1.8. Eventual expansion of the MOS (width and length) should be a consideration since
            resupply will be by air.
        6.9.2.2. Preparatory S teps. Prior to the attack, the EOC engineer staf f also ensured they had all
        appropriate equipment, materials, maps, and doc uments necessary. Once the ICC identified the
        required size of the MOS, the MO S selection team made a template to correspond in scale to the
        desired criteria. All MOS selection related da ta was annotated on the ai rfield map and relayed to
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                           83


      the alternate EOC and DCC. Engineer information pertaining to ADR capabilities, material avail-
      ability, and personnel and equipmen t status was updated and verifi ed. Lastly, a radio check was
      accomplished to ensure communication with the ADATs.
   6.9.3. Phase 2—Plotting Damage and Searching for a Candidate MOS.
      6.9.3.1. Plotting Procedures. As the ADATs report airfield pavement damage, the information is
      plotted on the airfield map. Figure 6.5. lists the runway pavement damage locations the ADATs
      encountered on their survey. Additional damage information reported by the DART, ADATs, and
      other base personnel that could impact launch and recovery operations are listed below:

Figure 6.5. Runway Damage Listing and Damage Plot.




         6.9.3.1.1. Substantial structural damage to the airfield lighting vault.
         6.9.3.1.2. Aircraft quick turn area appears intact.
         6.9.3.1.3. A POL line crossing under the north taxiway is ruptured.
         6.9.3.1.4. Roads from the ammunition storage area appear passable.
         6.9.3.1.5. South taxiway is cratered in six locations.
         6.9.3.1.6. A sizable bomblet field is near the center of the parallel taxiway.
84                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


            6.9.3.1.7. The TACAN facility is destroyed.
            6.9.3.1.8. Both BAK-12 arresting systems are severely damaged.
            6.9.3.1.9. The parallel taxiway is heavily cratered and spalled at the 2,000’ and 6,000’ points.
        6.9.3.2. Information Crosschecking. W ith the lo cations of airfield damage plotted, the MOS
        selection team now attempts to find candidate MOSs that fulfill the operational requirement. The
        selection team uses the MOS template to identify potential candidates. Engineer representatives in
        the alternate EOC and, if the situation permits, the DCC also perform the MOS candidate search.
        Information is continually cross-fed between these command centers both for operational continu-
        ity purposes and as a crosscheck of MOS selection accuracy and options. Many MOS candidates
        are possible; three are shown in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.6. Candidate MOSs.




     6.9.4. Phase 3—Evaluating a Candidate MOS. Once MOS candidates have been identified, each must
     be evaluated to determine the be st choice for support of launch and recovery operations. Each of the
     chosen MOSs in our example meet the length and width cr iteria, yet each have differing characteris-
     tics.
        6.9.4.1. MOS Candidate #1. This MOS is part of a connecting taxiway . It has access from both
        ends and requires repair of only two craters in addition to thos e on any access routes. One of the
        two craters on MOS #1 is within the first 1,000’ ofpavement; this usually will require a high qual-
        ity repair. Bidirectional use of this MOS is possible. Suf ficient undamaged pavement along this
        MOS exists to enable installation of the MAAS in a crater free area, if necessary. For night opera-
        tions, installation of an airfield lighting set will be required. Access to the quick turn area is avail-
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 85


       able without extensive maneuvering of aircraft. Primary drawbacks of this MOS are its proximity
       to structures (control tower) which pose s a flying safety ha zard and its nearne ss to t he aircraft
       maintenance area, which limits expandability and could hinder airc raft taxi flow due t o aircraft
       congestion. Explosive ordnance disposal UXO safing and bomb removal prior to establishment of
       this MOS appear to be minimal, since bomblet fields do not present immediate problems. The
       number of craters to be repaired does not appear to be excessive. Folded fiberglass mat r epairs
       would be per formed on the MOS and AM-2 re pairs on access routes. Time frames for engineer
       repair efforts should be approximately 4-5 hours.
       6.9.4.2. MOS Candidate #2. This MOS is located on the western edge of the original runway. Like
       MOS #1, it has access and egress routes, suf ficient undamaged pavement for MAAS installation,
       bidirectional capability, and relatively easy access to and from the quick turn area. On the other
       hand, it requires the repair of three craters on the MOS surface itself plus those on the access
       routes and a portion of a spall fi eld. Additionally, two of the three craters on the MOS are within
       1,000 feet of each threshold, wh ich usually results in higher RQC requirements. Near term
       expandability is limited due to additional craters and a bomblet field south of the MOS. For a
       south to north takeoff some back taxiing on the MOS is necessary, since the southern access route
       intersects the MOS at about the 500-foot mar k. One UXO on the south end access route must be
       safed and the POL line adjacent to the north access route, as a minimum, must be isolated. Using
       folded fiberglass mats for the MOS crater repairs and AM-2 matting for taxiway craters, the time
       frame for repair should also be in the neighborhood of 4-5 hours. Ample resources exist in terms
       of manpower, materials, and equipment to meet this time estimate.
       6.9.4.3. MOS Candidate #3. This MOS is located on the eastern edge of the original runway. Sim-
       ilar to MOSs #1 and #2, it has access and egress routes, adequate clear pavement for arresting sys-
       tem installation and a bidirectional capability. However, there is a little problem with access to the
       quick turn area. Like MOS #1, it only requires repair of two MOS craters, does not have to rely on
       back taxiing, and has a crater located in the first 1,000 feet from its south end. It, however, shares
       with MOS #2 the requirements for UXO safing and POL line isolation or repair on or along the
       access routes. Unlike the other two MOSs, it of fers an expand ability feature. By repairing one
       more crater and removing two UXOs and the bomb let field, an additiona l 2,300 feet of MOS
       length can be gained. The repair time estimate should be similar to both of the other MOSs.
       6.9.4.4. Candidate Comparisons. Comparing the three MOS candi dates, MOS #3 se ems to pro-
       vide the preferred solution. Repa ir time estimates are equal am ong all MOSs and MOS #3 of fers
       expandability and less aircraft taxi traffic flow interference with the maintenance area.
   6.9.5. Phase 4—Presenting MOS Candidates to the Commander. All candidate MOSs shall be briefed
   to the ICC Commander for final decision. Based on the evaluation of all three candidates, MOS #3
   appears as the best choice. If asked, MOS #1 would be recommended to the wing commander as the
   alternative.

6.10. Chapter Summary. Minimum operating strip selection is a critical phase of the total effort required
to establish a launch and recovery surface for aircraft. To those involved, it can be time consuming, con-
fusing and somewhat complicated if not practiced often. As indicated earlier, the selection process is not
an exact science, bu t top quali ty personnel t hat are properly organized and trained c an do the job in an
effective manner. The need for high competency in, and thorough understandi ng of, the MOS candidate
selection process cannot be over emphasized. The speed with which MOS candidate search and selection

must be accomplished, coupled with the pressures and confusion of a postattack situation will not permit
methodical, detailed, step-by-step evaluations of airfield pave ment conditions. Minimum operating strip
selection must be second nature to the selection team and the only way to gain this degree of efficiency is
through constant, repetitive, realistic training. Remember, the mission of the entire air base after an attack
is hostage to MOS selection. All pe rsonnel involved in MOS selection mu st be prepared to perform this
process rapidly and accurately—nothing less is acceptable.

                                REPAIR QUALITY CRITERIA (RQC)

7.1. Introduction. While modern ai rcraft are mul ti-capable, versatile, and extremely lethal i n a com bat
environment, they are nevertheless highly dependent upon an airfield operating surface which must be in
“near perfect” condition. This is pr imarily because the landing gear conf igurations of mo st aircraft are
highly intolerant of pavement irregularities. Historic ally, aircraft designers ha ve traded-off landing gear
upgrades and undercarriage strengthening for decreased weight and improved avionics and weapons car-
rying capacities to increase the combat functions of aircraft. This sensit ivity to the condition of air field
operating surfaces makes the ADR task more difficult in that we must not only be attuned to the time it
takes to accomplish repairs, but also capable of acco mplishing high quality re pairs. These two features
often oppose each other and can only mesh if sufficient training and preattack preparation are performed.
Included in this training and preparation are the physical tasks of ADR, MOS selection, and the subject of
this chapter—the determination of RQC.

7.2. Overview. In this chapter we will discuss the procedural aspects of determining RQC for MOS crater
repairs in a wartime situation. Incl uded will be the purpose of RQC, the use of va rious charts and tables
associated with RQC development, the interface between RQC and MO S selection, and the general con-
cept of operations and timing of RQ C activities. Although this chapte r will address the details of RQC
calculations and provide an example based on the MOS chosen in the previous chapter on MOS selection,
obtain a copy of TO 35E2-4-1 before fully training on RQC procedures. The TO contains additional air-
craft related charts that are not provided in this pamphlet; the TO also contains additional examples which
can be used for training purposes.

7.3. Purpose. The purpose of RQC is to provide guidance to the wing command and control staff, the
DCC, and ADR crews regarding the suitability of wartime pavement repairs for aircraft launch and recov-
ery operations. The criteria determines whether a crater repair is sufficient enough to allow aircraft use.
   7.3.1. Current USAF concept of oper ations calls for repairing a MOS for aircraft operations after an
   airfield attack. Airfield damage repair teams will attempt to make all repairs flush (plus or minus 3/4
   of an inch) with the adjacent undamaged pavement surface by primarily usi ng the FFM repair tech-
   nique. However, such repairs are difficult to achieve due to hindr ances like poor weather conditions,
   equipment failures, personnel attrit ion, or the presence of chem icals and/or une xploded ordnance.
   When ADR teams do not obtain flus h repairs, RQC becomes extremel y critical. The criteria ans wer
   crucial questions, such as “must non-flush repairs be upgraded,” or “can they be used as is?” The cri-
   teria also provide information about when and if periodic maintenanceto repaired craters is necessary.
   7.3.2. Repair quality criteria calculations result in either an F, indicating a flush repair requirement, or
   a single number expressed in inches for each MOS crater repair. This number represents the maximum
   allowed height that a finished repair can have in relationship to adjacent undamaged pavement. Deter-
   mining RQC for each repair is critical. Incorrect RQC can result in certification of an unacceptable
   runway surface as usable . Operations on improper ly certified surfac es could damage aircraft and
   endanger personnel. Proper use of the RQC system provides a pass/fa il assessment for expediently
   repaired pavement surfaces that alleviates the potential of certifying an unacceptable MOS.
88                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


7.4. Concept of Operations. Repair quality criteria determination parallels, to some extent, and then fol-
lows MOS selection activities. Th e MOS selection team in the prim ary EOC has the responsibility for
RQC calculations. As a crosscheck, CE representatives in the alternate EOC should also perform the cal-
culations. If it is locally determined that CE D CC personnel will concurrent ly perform MOS selection,
they should act as another RQC safety check. Re gardless of how many control centers perform RQC
determinations, the ultimate responsibility rests with the primary EOC engineer staff. Figure 7.1. depicts
how the RQC process typically interfaces with MOS selection and ADR activities. As a minimum, RQC
calculations must be accomplished after the wing commander chooses the MOS to be repaired and again
after MOS repairs are completed if crater locations, lengths, and spacing have ch anged during the repair
process. Crater changes are entir ely probable since damage assessm ent inputs are field estimates rather
than precise measurements. Ideally, RQC determinations should start as early as possible.

7.5. Activities Sequencing. As mentioned in the previous chapter, one of the initial actions required with
respect to MOS selection is to ensure the necessary maps, charts, materials, and equipment are available
in all appropriate control centers prior to an attack situation. This is equally important with regard to RQC
components. A copy of the RQC techni cal order and extra copies of a ll worksheets and aircraft charts
must be available. As a necessity, a reasonable estimate on what aircraft charts to have on hand would be
to consider charts associated with any in place aircraft and all potential aircraft that may arrive as identi-
fied in the operations plan (OPLAN) time phased force deployment data (TPFDD).
     7.5.1. Also, as described in the previous chapter on MOS selection, certain initial steps must be taken
     once the alert level dictates command centers are to be fully activated. The MOS selection team in the
     EOC immediately begins to gather data from the ICC such as types of aircraft to be operated, need for
     an arresting system, anticipated weather conditions , desired MOS length, etc. Besides being used in
     MOS selection, these data also form the basis for RQC calculations. It is imperative that this informa-
     tion be obtained as soon as possible.
     7.5.2. Once the initial information is obtained from the ICC, the EOC MO S selection team should
     gather the applicable aircraft charts and start filling in the worksheets.
        7.5.2.1. Particular attention should be paid to the required MO S length and width. The ICC will
        provide required MOS dimensions based on knowledge of aircraft characteristics and operational
        requirements. While the MOS length is probably adequate since it came from the Operations com-
        munity, it is worthwhile to make a cros scheck using the RQC air craft charts. The MOS length
        determination is greatly af fected by weather and pavement surf ace conditions and the consider-
        ation of takeoffs or landings of a particular type aircraft. Fo r planning purposes, a nominal MOS
        length has commonly been considered 50 feet by 5,000 feet, but these dimensions may not hold
        true for all situations, particularly if environmen tal conditions tend to be variable. Once all rele-
        vant information is obtained fro m the ICC, the MOS selection t eam should calculate required
        MOS lengths for both takeof fs and landings for all applicable aircra ft. If disparities with dimen-
        sions provided by the ICC are found, these should beresolved before further MOS selection activ-
        ities take place.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 89


Figure 7.1. MOS Selection—ADR/RQC Interface.




      7.5.2.2. Once the ICC and EOC agree upon a MOS length, the appropriate MOS template can be
      made for the MOS selection process with the assurance that MOS length will be adequate. If this
      action is not accomplished, MOS selection and subsequent ADR efforts might be based on a MOS
      length that may be too short to meet all desired operational requirements. Airfield damage repair
      crews may then be faced with a situation of having to repair additional pavement damage beyond
      that originally planned. This obviously causes a delay in aircraft sortie generation.
      7.5.2.3. Once the ini tial information is received from the ICC and the MOS selection team has
      verified MOS length and width, all such data must be relaye d to the alternate EOC and the DCC,
      if appropriate.
   7.5.3. After damage has b een plotted, MOS candidate s will be identified and the most appropriate
   MOS selected. If EOC staffing and time permit, RQC calculations should be accomplished for the
   most promising MOS candidates at th is time as well. This informatio n will give an indication of the
   degree of accuracy needed during ADR operations. Although all MOS crater re pair techniques are
   meant to yield flush repairs, unles s an ADR team is well trained a nd competent, it could have dif fi-
   culty in meeting the flush criteria in a responsive timeframe. All else being equal, it is often better to
   recommend MOS candidates having greater latitude of repair tolerance, thereby to some degree coun-
   tering the inexperience of an ADR team. This is a situation where the BCE and his or her staf f must
   have an in-depth knowledge of th e capabilities of the ADR team in order to make sound operational
   recommendations to the ICC staff.
90                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     7.5.4. Once the wing commander has selected the MO S for repair and the DC C has dispatched the
     ADR teams, the MOS selection team performs the mandatory portion of the RQC process. RQC cal-
     culations are performed using the initial data obtained from the ICC and the crater location, size, and
     spacing information pertaining to the chosen MOS. When completed they ar e compared wi th those
     obtained at the altern ate EOC and the DCC (if app licable) as a crosscheck for accuracy. As repairs
     progress and actual repair patch locations, lengths , and spacing are identifi ed, the ADR team chief
     relays this information back to the DCC and EOC. Repair quality criteria are then recalculated to see
     if criteria have been altered due to changes in actual crater locations, lengths, and spacing found dur-
     ing the repair process. The results of these calculations are provided to the ADR team chief. If crater
     repairs are within tolerance, the ADR team completes MOS cl eanup and progresses to its next
     assigned tasking. If repairs are not within toler ances, the wing commander is informed of the situa-
     tion. The commander must make the decision as to whether ai rcraft operations will be attempted
     under such conditions. If the decision is “no-go,” the ADR team must continue working until the
     repairs meet RQC tolerances.
     7.5.5. After repairs are complete and the MOS is us able, RQC calculations continue to apply for
     maintenance purposes. The tolerance measurements for each repair patch also provide information for
     maintenance purposes. With sustained aircraft use, the repaired cr aters on the M OS will most likely
     begin to settle. This settlement, called sag, could be just as damaging to aircraft landing gear as origi-
     nal crater repairs that are out-of-tolerance. Theref ore, periodic checks of th e repair patch quality on
     sag must be made to ensure their suitability for continued aircraft use. If a patch is found to be nearing
     an out-of-tolerance condition, an arrangement must be made with the airfie ld operations function to
     allow MOS downtim e for cr ater repairs. It is also import ant to note changes in weather conditions.
     Wide temperature changes and precipitation will re quire RQC to be recalculated. According to the
     technical manual, MOS repairs that fall within a numbered area on the appropriate chart (0” to 6”) are
     allowed to have a maximum 2- inch sag for fighter aircraft, or a 3-inch sag for heavy aircraft. How-
     ever, craters that call for a flush (F) repair can have maximum sag of only 3/4-inch.

7.6. RQC Procedures. In its most basic form, the RQC system is a set of charts and tables that allow quick
and accurate determination of allowable crater repair roughness. Different aircraft can withstand varying
levels of runway roughness. In addi tion, weather and runway conditions ma y affect an aircraft’s perfor-
mance and consequently, its tolerance to pavement irregularities. Furthermore, the type of aircraft opera-
tions also affects RQC, since different operations call for different procedures and aircraft configurations.
All of these parameters are taken into account in the RQC system.

7.7. Terminology. An understanding of the terminology used in the RQC system is critical. The following
are definitions for some of the more important terms common to the RQC process. It is imperative that all
CE command center perso nnel and ADR team leade rs thoroughly understand the meanings of these
terms.
     7.7.1. Apparent Diameter. The extent of visi ble damage associated with a crater ( Figure 7.2.) mea-
     sured from upheaved lip to upheaved lip. This is the information that is forwarded to the EOC by the
     ADAT.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              91


Figure 7.2. Apparent Crater Diameter.




   7.7.2. Repair Length. The length of a repaired crater, measured parallel to the MOS centerline, from
   undamaged pavement to undamaged pa vement. Repair length is expre ssed in feet and is plotted as
   double the apparent diameter during the damage-plotting portion of MOS selection (Figure 7.3.).
   7.7.3. Repair Height. This is the maximum height of the repair surface above the original undamaged
   surface (Figure 7.3.).
   7.7.4. Sag. The maximum amount, in inches or fraction thereof, that a repair surface drops below the
   maximum repair height is sag. Allo wing sag permits a repair to degrade with ai rcraft traffic without
   requiring excessive maintenance dur ing sortie generatio n. Allowable sa g depths on RQC c harts are
   constant (2-inches for fighter aircraft or 3-inches for heavies) for numbere d repairs. Allowable sag
   depth for flush repairs is only 3/4 inch, since by definition flush means plus or minus 3/4 inch. These
   restrictions apply for each profile line overall portions of a repair surface (Figure 7.3.).
   7.7.5. MOS Threshold. The MOS threshold is the starting point of the MOS ( Figure 7.4.). It corre-
   sponds to the end of the MOS with the lowest numbered stat ion marker on the pavement reference
   marking system.
92                                                                    AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


Figure 7.3. Repair Terminology.




Figure 7.4. MOS Terminology.




     7.7.6. Departure End. This is the end of the MOS opposite the MOS threshold ( Figure 7.4.). This
     point corresponds to the highest nu mbered station marker location on the selected MOS. All aircraft
     operations must begin at either the threshold or the departure end of the MOS.
     7.7.7. Operation Threshold. T his is the point on the MOS where aircraft begin their takeof f roll or
     touchdown on landing. For bidirectional operations, aircraft can operate from either the MOS thresh-
     old or the MOS departur e, depending upon which direction aircra ft will be flying when operations
     commence (Figure 7.4.). As will be described later in this chapter, bidirectional operations will
     require two RQC calculations—onc e for operations starting from th e MOS threshold and once for
     operations starting from the MOS departure end (typically driven by prevailing wind and given as run-
     way headings).
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 93


   7.7.8. Repair Patch. A repair patch is an area on th e MOS that may include a single repair, part of a
   repair, or any combination of repair s, or parts of repairs. A repair patch is an area fix ed as a s ingle
   repair (Figure 7.4.).
   7.7.9. Repair Patch Location. The location of a repair patch center relative to the operation threshold.
   The location is measured parallel to the MOS centerline and is expressed in feet (Figure 7.4.).
   7.7.10. Repair Patch Spacing. Repair patch spacing is the distance from one repair patch center loca-
   tion to the next repair patch center location. Spacing is measured in feet parallel to the MOS centerline
   (Figure 7.4.).
   7.7.11. Repair Patch Length. This is the length of a repair patch, measured parallel to the MOS cen-
   terline. Repair patch length is expressed in feet (Figure 7.4.).

7.8. RQC Chart Description. Technical Order 35E2-4-1 contains a number of different RQC charts
designed to support various aircraft and operating situations. For exam ple, Chart D1 governs F-16B air-
craft during takeoff, whereas Chart D2 applies to F-16B aircraft during landings. Charts also exist for
other variations like evacuation (the expedient departure with the lightest load possible). All RQC charts
are divided into four major areas: location baseline, environmental shift area, uncorrected RQC area, and
correction factor area (Figure 7.5.). RQC charts will be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.

Figure 7.5. Example RQC Chart.




   7.8.1. Location Baseline. The locatio n baseline is the starting point for RQC calculations. The base-
   line is at the bottom of an RQC chart. Marking the location of each crater repair on this line begins the
   RQC determination process. All locations are measured from the operation threshold.
   7.8.2. Environmental Shift Area. The environmental shift area includes the boxes above the baseline
   that compensates for aircraft performance changes under varying weather and runway surface condi-
   tions. These conditions are depicted using DR, RCR, and RSC numbers.
94                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     7.8.3. Density Ratio. DR is the relationship between air temperature and pressure altitude which gives
     a measure of probable aircraft performance. On co ol days the density ratio will be high and perfor-
     mance will be good. This means takeoff distances will be shorter. Ask the base weather office for the
     expected high temperature and the pressure altitude. With these figures the DR can be found by using
     the chart shown in Figure 7.6. Enter the temperature along the X-ax is. From this temperature value,
     go vertically until the appropriate pressure altitude line is reached. Then go horizontally to the Y-axis
     and read the DR value. For example, at 59 degrees Fahrenheit, at the sea level pressure altitude, the
     DR value is 1.0. Note that as temperature and altitude increase, the DR value decreases. Density ratio
     affects all aircraft on takeoff and landing.
     7.8.4. Runway Condition Reading. RCR affects the landing distance of aircraft by influencing wheel
     braking effectiveness. It can be measured as a specific number, but for purposes of RQC calculations
     it is subjectively expressed in terms of three choices: wet, dry, or icy.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                95


Figure 7.6. Density Ratio Chart.




   7.8.5. Runway Surface Condition. RSC is a measure of the precipit ation standing on the runway . It
   affects only multi-wheeled wide body aircraft during takeoff. Because of the large tire footprint area
   of cargo aircraft, precipitation can cause significant additional friction, resulting in a lengthening of
   the takeoff roll.
   7.8.6. Uncorrected RQC Area. This area is located on the RQC char t just above th e environmental
   shift area. It is used to assign an initial value for maximum repair height, based on patch spacing. For
   example, “F” means the repair must be flush; “FF” means the next repair down the MOS must also be
   flush. Areas identified by the numbers 1 through 6 reflect maximum repair height in inches. As men-
   tioned earlier, all numbered repair heights can allow maximum sag of 2 inches for fighter aircraft and
   3 inches for heavy aircraft. No sag is allowed with flush repairs beyond the + or - 3/4 of an inch nor-
96                                                                         AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


     mally accepted as part of flush repair criteria. These restrictions apply over all portions of a repair sur-
     face. The vertical axis on the RQ C chart represents crater repair patch spacing. When a number is
     missing, as the number 3 is in Figure 7.5., the variance between numbers was too small to indicate.
     7.8.7. Correction Factor Area. The correction factor area is at the top section of the RQC chart. It
     assigns a correction factor to the repair height, based on repair le ngth. Here, the vertical axis repre-
     sents crater repair length. The correction factor is algebraical ly added to the uncorrected RQC to
     obtain the final required RQC. A quick look at Figure 7.5. should tell you that the RQC for the F-16A/
     B will never exceed 6 in ches. The correction factor either reduces the repair qua lity height or has no
     affect. NOTE: No correction factor is allowed for “F” or “FF” repairs in the uncorrected RQC area. If,
     however, the correction factor is la rger than the uncorrected RQC a nd the resultant RQC is negative,
     the RQC becomes “F.”

7.9. Worksheets. There are three worksheets used in the RQC process. They are used sequentially for data
collection as the RQC process progresses. The exam ple that will be worked shortly will show you the
details of how the forms areused; we will only briefly address the data that goes on the forms at this point.
     7.9.1. Worksheet 1, (AFTO Form 71). This sheet is used to record much of the “given” data received
     from the ICC and base we ather at the onset of the MOS selec tion and RQC determination processes.
     Information such as aircraft weights, weather, DR, operational parameters , required pavement
     lengths, and RQC chart numbers are entered.
     7.9.2. Worksheet 2, (AFTO Form 72). This sheet is used to record the repair patch locations, lengths
     and spacing, and calculate the RQC values obtained from the aircraft RQC charts.
     7.9.3. Worksheet 3, (AFTO Form 73). This sheet serves as a summary chart for the various crater
     repair RQC values and enables the determination of the final RQC requirements. It is most important
     when calculating RQC for bidirectional MOSs.

7.10. Example. The following example illustrates procedures for determining RQC.
     7.10.1. Figure 7.7. shows the airfield map, plotted damage, and the selected MOS. Figure 7.8. pro-
     vides an expanded picture of the MOS candidate itself and illustrates how RQC determination factors
     are measured. The information following the figures is assumed to have been obtained from the ICC:

       7.10.1.8. Evacuation requirements not probable.
       7.10.1.9. Aircraft arresting system capability desirable.
   7.10.2. The above information is transposed onto Worksheet 1 (Figure 7.9.). Because a bidirectional
   feature is desired, landings and takeoffs from both the MOS threshold end (operations 1, 2, and 3) and
   the departure end (operations 4, 5, and 6) are identified. Both variations must be addressed, since cra-
   ter patches will be at different locations relative to aircraft roll, depending upon the direction of travel.
   In our example, an aircraft traveling south to north (360 degree heading) on the MOS will reach crater
   patch number 1 before an aircraft traveling north to south (180 degr ee heading) will reach the same
   patch. This difference could influe nce RQC values resulting in the possibility that the same patch
   could have different values depending on the aircraft ’s direction of travel. Investigate both situations
   to ensure the more stringent requirement is applied.

     7.10.3. DR is determined using the DR chart (Figure 7.10.). A temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit
     and a sea level pressure altitude equates to a DR of approximately .97. Request from the ICC the
     ranges of RSC and RCR expected fo r the day. Since the weather is expected to remain fair for an
     extended period, the RCR will be considered “dry,” resulting in an RSC of 0.0.

   7.10.4. The MOS threshold has been designated at the 4,000-foot point and the departure end at the
   9,000-foot point corresponding to the desired 5,000-foot MOS required by the ICC. A crosscheck on
   the adequacy of this length will be made shortly using the RQC aircraft charts.
   7.10.5. The next step is to determine what aircraft charts are needed. All such charts are contained in
   T.O. 35E2-4-1; therefore, we must have a copy of this T .O. readily available. Table 7.1. provides a
   summary of some the available RQC aircraft ch arts. The summary indicates th at for F-16B takeoffs,
   Chart D1 is required and for F-16B landings , Chart D2 is necessary. Because the ICC indicate d a
   desire for an aircraft arresting system, Chart D3 is also gathered. These chart numbers are noted in the
   Chart # column of Worksheet 1 (Figure 7.11.).

   7.10.6. The data and charts gatheredso far enable us to make determinations of operation lengths nec-
   essary for F-16B sortie generation from the selected MOS. The determination of operation length for
   the takeoff of the F-16B is determined by using aircraft Chart D1 (Figure 7.12.). A horizontal line is
   drawn across the DR section corresponding to the .97 DR value until it intersects the section’s shaded
   area. A vertical line is then dropped to the location baseline and a reading taken. For our example, the
   takeoff operation length is 3,525 feet. Enter this number in the operations length column of Worksheet
   1 for operations 1 and 4.

Figure 7.12. Operational Lengths Identified on F-16B Takeoff Chart.




      7.10.7. Using Char t D2 for landings, a hor izontal line is drawn across the entire DR section corre-
      sponding to the .97 DR value (Figure 7.13.). Now, find the point where the line intersects the shaded
      part of the DR section.
         7.10.7.1. From this point of intersection, a vertical line is drawn up to the RCR section until it
         intersects the horizontal line representing “dry” conditions. Because no shift is caused by the RCR
         section under “dry” conditions, another vertical line is drawn from the R CR intersection point
         down to the location baseline. The reading at the intersec tion of this second ve rtical line and the
         location baseline is the operation length required for MOS landings in dry conditions. This value
         is approximately 4,400 feet in our example.

      7.10.7.2. If “wet” conditions were expected to be prevalent, the horizontal line on the RCR sec-
      tion representing “wet” conditions would be used. In this case, th e vertical line f rom the DR
      shaded area intersection that was drawn up to th e bottom of the RCR section would be shifted to
      account for “wet” conditions (Figure 7.13.). This shift would follow the guidelines proportionally
      from the bottom of the RCR section until the horiz ontal line representing “wet” conditions was
      reached. In drawing the shift line from the bottom of the RCRchart up to the “wet” conditions hor-
      izontal line, it is important to stay between the guide lines in proportion to the starting location at
      the bottom of the RCR sec tion. From this new inte rsection, a vertical lin e would the n be drawn
      down to the locatio n baseline and the a ppropriate operation length read (approximately 7,100
      feet). As would be expected, the new operation length under “wet” conditions would be consider-
      ably longer than that obtained when under “dry” conditions. The dry and wet distances are entered
      in the operational length column of Worksheet 1 for operations 2 and 5. Note that the landing oper-
      ation lengths for wet c onditions are more than the 5,000-foot length requested by the ICC, there-
      fore the 5,000-foot length is obviously inadequate . This would require th at all landings in wet
      conditions use the aircra ft arresting system until the MO S length can be extended beyond 7,100
      feet. This inf ormation must be pas sed to the ICC since flight safety and mission ef fectiveness
      would be involved.
   7.10.8. Now the operation distance must be found for arrested landings. Chart D3 indicates that at
   least 2,034 feet of pavement length is required for an arrested F-16B landing (Figure 7.14.).
104                                                                    AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008

      7.10.9. Entries in Worksheet 1 shown in Figure 7.15. illustrate the operat ion distances determined
      above for aircraft traveling south to north (360 degree heading) on the selected MOS.

         7.10.9.1. After determining operation lengths in th e South to North direction (360 degree head-
         ing), the next steps in the RQC process involve defining repair patches and identifying the repair
         patch locations, lengths, and spacing. Accomplish the graphics work to support these activities on
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                             105


      the same air base maps wher e airfield damages were pl otted in the EOC and DCC. Figure 7.8.
      depicts the repair patch definition for the two craters on the MOS in our example. T o define the
      repair patches, the following actions are taken.
          7.10.9.1.1. To define the repair patches, draw lines the entire width of the MOS on both sides
          of each crater on, or partially on, the MOS.
          7.10.9.1.2. Shade the areas on the MOS between the lines for each repair.
          7.10.9.1.3. Number each crater consecutivel y starting from the MOS threshold. T wo points
          pertaining to repair patch definition need to be mentioned before we move on. First, if two or
          more shaded areas are within 25 feet of each other , treat them as one la rge repair patch. Sec-
          ondly, for bidirectional MOSs, RQC will be determined from both directions and the operation
          threshold will shift from one end of the MOS to the other. The crater numbers, however, do not
          change when the RQC from the other direction is calculated. Once a patch is numbered, it will
          retain that number throughout the RQC process.
      7.10.9.2. Once the repair patches are numbered, patch locations, lengths, and spacing are deter-
      mined; Worksheet 2 is used to record this data and the MOS plotti ng map should be updated
      accordingly. Figure 7.16. depicts the data for south to no rth (360 degree heading) flying opera-
      tions.

Figure 7.16. South to North Flying Operations (360 degree heading).




          7.10.9.2.1. The first step is to draw double lines, perpendicular to the sides of the MOS, indi-
          cating the operation threshold and the operation lengths determined earlier using the aircraft
          charts. Then, record the opera tion number a nd patch number on Worksheet 2 for each patch
          between the operation threshold and double lines of each operation. For a south to north (360
          degree heading) direction, the takeoff operation only includes Pa tch 1 and the landing opera-
          tion would include both patch 1 and 2 in this example. However, there are no patches between
          the threshold and the double lines for the arrested landing operation.
          7.10.9.2.2. The center of each repair patch is determined next—this corresponds to the station
          location of the crater reported during damage assessment operations. The center of Patch 1 is
          at the 6,300-foot point and patch 2 center is at the 7,900-foot point. Subtracting the operation
          threshold location point (4,000 feet) from the pa tch center locations provides the patch loca-
          tions on the MOS. Repair patch spacing is determined by calculating the distances between the
106                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


             centers of adjacent patches going in the direction of aircraft tr avel (i.e., patch 1 to patch 2,
             patch 2 to patch 3, etc).
      7.10.10. When the last patch within the operation length is reached, the maximum value on the patch
      spacing axis on the uncorrected RQC area of the applicable aircraft chart is us ed as the spacing dis-
      tance. In our example, the repair patch spacing between patch 1 a nd patch 2 is 1,600 feet. The maxi-
      mum value on the patch spacing axis is 1,000 feet on Charts D1 and D3, and 1,500 on Chart D2.
      NOTE: The Air Force Institute of Technology determines patch spacing distance differently, because
      finding the “maximum value on the patch spacing axis on the uncorrected RQC area of the applicable
      aircraft chart” becomes quite cu mbersome when dealing with seve ral aircraft and a bi-directional
      MOS. They teach to ins ert the infinity symbol (8) and go to the top of the Uncorrected RQC portion
      of the chart.
      7.10.11. Patch length is twice the apparent diamet er as reported by the damage assessment teams.
      Remember from the MOS selection chapter, this was the dimension used when plotting craters on the
      airfield map. When two patches overlap, or are within 25 feet of each other, a composite length must
      be calculated. In our ex ample, the repair patche s are individual, measuring 60-foot (patch 1) and
      50-foot (patch 2). Figure 7.17. depicts the above data for landings and takeoffs under a south to north
      (360 degree heading) flying operation.

Figure 7.17. Worksheet 2—South to North Landing/Takeoff Data (360 degree heading).




      7.10.12. Now that the patches have been defined and patch location s, lengths, a nd spacing deter-
      mined, we can decide if the sel ected MOS meets the arresting system requirements. Of equal impor-
      tance to the minimum arrested landing operational length is the need for having a substantial amount
      of undamaged pavement available prior to th e arresting system location. Chart D3 ( Figure 7.14.)
      shows that approximately 550 feet of undamaged pavement is required. This distance allows a fighter
      aircraft to “stabil ize” its movement prior to engaging the arre sting system cable. This harmonics
      dampening is critical if the aircraft tail hook is to function properly.
         7.10.12.1. In addition, Chart D3 indicates that at least 50 feet of undamaged pavement must exist
         beyond the arresting system. Thus , to meet the T .O. requirements, the arresting system must be
         placed in an area with a minimum of 600 feet of undamaged pavement for unidirectional arresting
         operations, or 1,100 feet of undama ged pavement for bidirectiona l arresting operations. To meet
         ACC’s requirement, no less than 1,050 feet of undamaged pavement is required for unidirectional
         arrested landing opera tions, and 2,000 feet of undamaged pavement fo r bidirectional arrested
         landing operations.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                            107


      7.10.12.2. Looking at the example, if the arresting system was installed at the 1,250-foot position
      from the operation threshold in the 360 degree heading, there would be 1,250 feet of undamaged
      pavement prior to the arresting system and 1,020 feet beyond the arresting system. These dis-
      tances meet the more stringent ACC requirements for bidirectional operation of the arresting sys-
      tem (Figure 7.18.); subsequently, its operation would be recommended. A change in the landing
      threshold location for operations in the 180-degree heading may be necessary to prevent the air-
      craft’s tail-hook from snagging on the edge of Patch 1 before e ngaging the arresting system. The
      threshold location change will have to be a decision made by the wing command element.

      7.10.12.3. Due to the complexities introduced by offsetting the operation threshold for operation
      6, the ICC Commander made the decision to eli minate that operation. During the MOS selection
      process, the MOS briefer identified that shifting the operation 6 threshold to the 6500’ point would
      severely decrease the ef fectiveness of the visual/instrument landing aids, as well as a failed
      MAAS engagement would not give the pilot enough time to get the aircraft back in the air.
   7.10.13. Because a bidirectional operation is desired, the same data that was determined above must
   also be determined for a north to south (180 degree heading) flying operation. Figure 7.19. shows the
   dimensions for this situation and Figure 7.20. illustrates the resulting entries on Worksheet 2.

      7.10.14. The dimensional data obtained so far allows determination of the RQC for all repair patches
      for each individual aircraft operati on over the selected M OS. Beginning first with th e takeoff opera-
      tion from the south to north (360 degree heading) direction, the patch lengths, locations, and spacing
      are marked on the D1 aircraft chart. If the value for any length or spacing is greater than the maximum
      or less than the minimum shown on the RQC aircraft chart, the maximum or minimum dimension on
      the chart will be marked. The DR and RCR values should also be marked on the chart and horizontal
      lines drawn as was done during the operation length determinations.
      7.10.15. RQC must be determined for one repair patch within the takeoff operation length. Since air-
      craft chart D1 has no RCR section, the RCR value is ignored.
         7.10.15.1. Starting at the 2,300-foot poi nt, a vertical line is drawn until it intersects with the DR
         value (Figure 7.21.). The guidelines are then followed proportionally to the top of the DR section.
         From this point a vertical line is again drawn to the top of the RQC aircraft chart and the resulting
         line marked as 1/1 (represents Operation 1/Patch 1).
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               109


Figure 7.21. Patch Repair Locations, Spacings, Lengths and DR Markings.




      7.10.15.2. When the vertical line is completed, the uncorrected RQ C value for Patch 1 is deter-
      mined. Starting at the 1,000-foot poi nt of the patch spacing axis, a horizontal line is drawn inter-
      secting the vertical line of Patches 1. The 1,000-foot point is used since Patch 1 is the last patch in
      the operation length. The reading obtained at the intersection is 4, and W orksheet 2 is annotated
      accordingly.
      7.10.15.3. Moving up to the correction factor area, a horizontal line is drawn from the repair patch
      length (60-foot) until it intersects with the vertical line; the reading is -3. The reading is algebra-
      ically added to the uncorrected RQC value and th e resulting value (1) is ente red in Worksheet 2
      (Figure 7.22.). Repair quality criteria calculation for Operation 1 is now complete; however, sim-
      ilar calculations must also be determined for Operations 2 thru 6.
110                                                                     AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


Figure 7.22. Operation 1 RQC Values (Worksheet 2).




      7.10.16. Unlike the takeoff operations, both repair patches are encountered within the south to north
      landing operation length and RQC must be determined for both.
         7.10.16.1. Starting first with Patc h 1, from the 2,300-foot mark on th e patch location line at the
         bottom of the RQC aircraft chart D 2, a vertical line is drawn until it intersects with the DR value
         line on the DR portion of the chart. The guidelines on the DR chart are then followed proportion-
         ally until the top of the DR portion of the chart is reached (Figure 7.23.).

Figure 7.23. Patch Lengths, Locations, and Spacings Marked on D2 Chart.




         7.10.16.2. From that point, a vertical line is again drawn until it intersects the current RCR value
         (dry) on the RCR portion of the chart. The gui delines are once again followed proportionally to
         the top of the RCR section.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                               111


      7.10.16.3. From this point a vertical line is drawn through the two remaining sections to the top of
      the RQC chart itself. The line that has been drawn is then labeled 2/1.
      7.10.16.4. Now, a horizontal li ne is drawn from th e patch spacing value (1,500 feet) on the
      un-corrected RQC area of the chart until it intersects the vertical line previously drawn and a read-
      ing is taken. In this case the value is 6, and this figure is entered into the uncorrected RQC column
      of Worksheet 2 for operation 2/1.
      7.10.16.5. The last step for operation 2/1 involves determining the correction factor for the uncor-
      rected RQC value just obtained. Using the correction area portion of the chart, a horizontal line is
      drawn from the patch length value ( 60-foot) until it intersects with the vertical line drawn earlier.
      The value obtained at this intersection repres ents a number which must be algebraically added to
      the uncorrected RQC value determin ed in the previous step. In th e case of this example, the cor-
      rection value is negative 3 (-3) re sulting in a R QC of 3. Enter this value in the RQC co lumn for
      operation 2/1.
      7.10.16.6. Perform the same step s above to determine the RQ C value for operation 2/2. The
      uncorrected values, correction fact ors, and the resulting corrected RQC values are entered in the
      appropriate columns of Worksheet 2 (Figure 7.24.). Since there are no repair patches in the oper-
      ation length for Operation 3, no RQC determinations are required. Note that all correction values
      are either zero or negative numbers. This means that the maximum value ever obtained for a final
      repair patch RQC will never be greater than the uncorrected RQC value.

   7.10.17. Operations 4 through 5 pertain to the north to south (180 degree heading) component of the
   bidirectional flying operation. The RQC determinations for oper ations 4 and 5 are shown in Figure
   7.25. and Figure 7.26. The resulting Worksheet 2 entries are depicted in Figure 7.27.

Figure 7.27. RQC Entries on Worksheet 2.




   7.10.18. As is readily apparent, both patches 1 and 2 have differing RQC values depending on mode
   and direction of operation. Our final step is to summarize these values and determine which one gov-
   erns the overall situatio n for each patch. Worksheet 3 is us ed for this purpose and is populated by
   entering data from worksheet 2.
      7.10.18.1. MOS threshold end operations (south to north 360 degree heading in our example) go
      on the top part of the form; those from the departure end go on the bottom part of the form (Figure
      7.28.). Once these figures are entered, fill in the summary lines by comparing the RQC values for
      each individual patch and select the most stringent (the lowe st) as the summary value. While our
      example did not have one, an “F” (flush) value is lower than any numeric value.
      7.10.18.2. Once this step is complete, compare the summary va lues for each repair patch and
      enter the most stringent of thes e in the “combined” line on Worksheet 3. The RQC values on the
      “combined” line of Worksheet 3 represent the level of quality that the ADR crews have to meet for
      each repair patch during ADR oper ations. In our example, 1-inch RQC is th e lowest figure
      obtained. This means that a repair patch with this value can have a +1-inch bump and still be
      acceptable. Remember, the sag for any numbered re pair (RQC#) can never exceed 2 inches for
      fighter aircraft and 3 inches for heavy aircraft.
   7.10.19. Once all RQC data have been determined, they must be presented to the BCE in a straight-
   forward manner. Figure 7.29. illustrates one method of presenting this data using a MOS map. The
   RQC values for both MOS threshold and departure end operations are shown along with the combined
   values for each repair patch. In most cases, the MOS will have already been chosen by the wing com-
   mand element. This summary permits a quick way of informing the CE command section of RQC
   requirements so they can rapidly forward them to ADR crews.

      7.10.20. The following factor s could influence the wing commander' s decision with respect to final
      MOS selection:
         7.10.20.1. Bidirectional vers us Unidirectional Operation. In mo st cases, operating in a unidirec-
         tional mode will result in less stringent RQC values, which, in turn, could permit greater latitude
         in repair exactness. This is especially important if an ADR team is not thoroughly trained in a par-
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 115


       ticular repair method. Assuming identical aircraft types and operations, a unidirectional MOS will
       usually have less restrictive RQC than a bidirectional MOS.
       7.10.20.2. Use of Aircraft Arresting Systems. In ma ny situations, the landing of an aircraft will
       require more pavement length than takeof f—especially in wet or icy conditions. If an arresting
       system is available, the landing length can be shortened with an accompanying decrease in the
       ADR effort needed. Be sure, however, that sufficient undamaged pavement exists before planning
       on the use of an arresting system. ACC desires about 2,000 feet of undamaged pavement to use the
       arresting system in a bidirectional mode.
       7.10.20.3. Displacing Operation Thresholds. There ma y be occasions, partic ularly with bidirec-
       tional operations, when moving an operation threshold could decrease the RQC value for a repair
       patch. Look for the takeoff or landing operation that drives the lowest RQC value for a particular
       patch and see if moving the applicable threshold for that operation results in a less restrictive RQC
       value. Chances are the need for the repair patch will not be eliminated, but the degree of exactness
       will be lessened; thereby decreasing the potential for the repa ir to be out of tolerance once com-
       pleted.
   7.10.21. The previous paragraphs have addressed the “first round” determination of RQC values. As
   mentioned earlier, once repairs ar e completed and more accurate dime nsions (repair lengths, loca-
   tions, and spacing) are obtained, it is extremely critical to rep eat the RQC process to ensure aircraft
   operations can safely continue.

7.11. Final Considerations. As brought out early in this chapter, repair quality criteria determination is an
integral part of the ADR base re covery effort and its importance cannot be overshadowed by the pace of
recovery activities and pressures of the postattack environment. A single mistake in the RQC process can
be catastrophic with respect to the aircraft sortie generation capability. Some key points and responsibili-
ties deserve final mention.
   7.11.1. A current copy of T.O. 35E2-4-1 with all up to date changes must be readily available. RQC
   determination cannot be accomplished without this publication.
   7.11.2. Specific personnel must be fully trained inRQC determination procedures. As a minimum, all
   officers and Engineering (AFS 3E5X1) personnel should be capable of performing this task.
   7.11.3. Training on RQC procedures must be extensive. Personnel must be able to perform RQC
   determinations without hesitation. There will be no time for practice or OJT during base recovery.
   7.11.4. Airfield damage repair team chiefs must know and understand the importance of RQC deter-
   mination. They must obtain and report accurate dimensions on repair patch sizes and locations as soon
   as they are available in the fiel d. Furthermore, they must organize and use their res ources in such a
   manner that the most critical repairs receive the most attention.
   7.11.5. Senior civil engineer of ficers must be able to explain and defend the importance of RQC
   determinations to the base and wing command elements. This must be practiced in peacetime during
   training exercises; otherwise, it wi ll be difficult to tell the comma nder that his/her aircraft cannot be
   flown during wartime due to the results obtained from a series of charts and dimensions.

7.12. Chapter Summary. This chapter has presented the concept and procedures for repair quality criteria
determination. The RQC process forms the link between completed ADR efforts and the commencement
116                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


of flying operations after an attack. As such, it must receive close attention from the command element of
a civil engineer unit.
      7.12.1. Once the MOS repair locations have been identified, airfield damage repair teams attempt to
      make flush repairs on MOS surfaces, but this level of pr ecision is difficult to obtain under wartime
      conditions. The RQC process provide s a method of determining the degree of tolerance allowed for
      each repair that will permit launch and recovery operatio ns without aircraft damage. Repair quality
      criteria procedures account for differing aircraft characteristics; weather and pavement surface condi-
      tions; dimensions and spacing of repair areas; and the types of operations aircraft are expected to per-
      form. The end result of RQC determ inations is a value for each re pair area, normally expressed in
      inches, which provides the ADR teams with pass/fail criteria to apply against their crater repair activ-
      ities. These values can range from perfectly flush up to 6 inches above adjacent undamaged pavement
      surfaces. If completed crater repairs do not meet RQC values, the repairs must normally be reaccom-
      plished before aircraft operations can commence.
      7.12.2. Repair quality criteria determination provides a go/no go decision situation to the wing com-
      mand structure. Accuracy in performing the RQC process is therefore critical, since faulty data could
      mistakenly delay aircraft launch or create extremely dangerous flying conditions. The appropriate
      engineer personnel respon sible for RQC deter mination must be highly tr ained and capable of per-
      forming RQC calculations quickly and flawlessly.

                                                Chapter 8

                                   RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

8.1. Overview. Engineer forces require proper equi pment and adequate personnel to accomplish rapid
repairs to war damaged airfield pa vements after seizing an enemy’s airbase, when assuming or sharing a
friendly host nation’s airfield, or at a US Air Force MOB overseas.
   8.1.1. After seizing an enemy’s airbase, it is anticipated that an airborne RED HORSE and CRGs will
   accomplish initial airfield pavement repairs with their own equipment and personnel. Afterwards,
   Prime BEEF units will deploy towards the tail end ofthe “open the airbase” force module to establish,
   operate, and sustain the flying mi ssion with additional airfield repa irs. Prime BEEF personnel and
   equipment UTCs will be tailored to accomplish th e required repairs. Use of local materials, equip-
   ment, and labor to augment US fo rces often provide repairs that meet mission needs while reducing
   costs and demands on logistic support systems.
   8.1.2. When assuming or sharing a coalition partner’s airfield, pavement repairs are often required to
   meet US flight safety requirement s. Prime BEEF units will be brought in to establish, operate, and
   sustain the flying mission with required airfield repa irs. As in the “seize the base” scenario above,
   Prime BEEF personnel and equipment UTCs will be tailored to accomplish necessary repairs. Again,
   use of local materials, equipment, and labor to augment US forces often provide repairs that meet mis-
   sion needs while reducing costs and demands on logistic support systems.
   8.1.3. To fulfill the MO B recovery requirement, the Air Force has develo ped equipment sets for
   accomplishing airfield pavement repairs at MOBs. Furthermore, Air For ce Prime BEEF teams are
   configured to provide suf ficient numbers of pers onnel to adequately man these equipment sets. The
   following paragraphs describe the equipment sets a nd provide recommendati ons on use of Prime
   BEEF forces for optimum manning for ADR operations.

8.2. Heavy Equipment Requirements for Recovery After Attack. The Air Force has developed standard-
ized equipment and vehicle sets for accomplishing expeditious airfield pavement repairs. At present, there
are three fielded ADR sets (R-sets) in a building-block manner to provide a designated crater repair capa-
bility.
   8.2.1. R-Sets. The minimum ADR package designed to deal with a possible air attack threat to an air
   base is the R-1 set. This set provides the vehicles, equipment, and material needed by a base to form
   three crater crews, each capable of repairing one crater in 4 h ours. If the threat an alysis for a given
   base indicates that an R-1 set capability is insu fficient, additional vehicles and equipment should be
   obtained to bring the unit’s ADR recovery package level up to an R-2 set. The R-2 set gives the base
   the capability to form six crater r epair teams each able of repairin g one crater in 4 hours. Conse-
   quently, an R-2 set provides a base the ability to repair six craters in 4 hours. However, if the enhanced
   R-2 set capability is still inadequa te to meet the percei ved threat, the base should posture an R-3 set.
   An R-3 set provides yet more vehicles and equipment, enabling six crater repair teams to repair two
   craters each, or 12 craters in 4 hours.
       8.2.1.1. Basic (R-1) ADR Set. The basic set was de veloped by the Air Force to provide an expe-
       dient bomb damage repair capability to theater air bases. This set supports the repair of three
       50-foot bomb craters with an AM-2 or FFM FOD cover within 4-hours. The basic ADR set is cur-
118                                                                   AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


       rently in place at most high-threat theater MOBs. The vehicle and equipment items of the R-1 set
       are shown in Table 8.1.

8.3. Personnel Requirements. Air Force Prime BEEF teams are configured to provide sufficient numbers
of personnel to adequately man the equipment sets described above. In a situation that dictates the use of
the full R-1 through R-3 equipment and vehicle p ackages, present Prime BEEF planning and force
employment concepts envision that personnel identified in Table 8.4. be used. While the full 189-person
engineer complement of these UTCs will not be employed solely in the ADR role, the vast majority of
personnel will be dedicated to this tasking. Normal exclusions include individuals involved in command
center (EOC/DCC), damage assessme nt, facility/utility recovery activities, CBRN defense assessment,
EOD safing operations, and firefighting functions.

      8.3.1. Figure 8.1. depicts an example of how this multi- Prime BEEF team configuration could be
      organized to satisfy a six-crater ADR requirement employing only an R-1 and R-2 set. In particular, it
      illustrates the ADR team configur ation using f olded fiberglass mats for both MOS and taxiway
      repairs. However, employing this same configuration, AM-2 matting could be used on the taxiways in
      place of FFM, and still achieve satisfactory results within the same 4-hour time constraint.
         8.3.1.1. With the multi-s killing features of ou r training programs, many AFS co mbinations are
         possible. In this example, 36 i ndividuals remain untasked (primarily in the utilities areas) whom
         could be used to support utility/facility damage recovery identified by the DARTs.
         8.3.1.2. However, when it comes to ADR, one discipline where lati tude is notoriously limited is
         construction equipment operators (3E2X1). This is one field where the ADR command and con-
         trol functions must be fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of their personnel in order to
         realize optimization of the resource.
      8.3.2. When theater intelligence indicates that the anticipated threat will en tail repairing twelve or
      more craters, an R- 3 set will be required and team manning must be increased by ab out 20 per son-
      nel—mainly for equipment operation purposes. With an R-3 set and proper manning, each crater crew
      is expected to repair two crater s within the same maximum 4-hour ti me frame. However, if the con-
      flict situation results in a less than six crater repair requirement, various subsets of thes e configura-
      tions should be employed. For the most part, this simply involves decreasing the number of crater
      repair crews and proportionally downsizing the personnel strength of the hauling team.

      8.3.3. As a general rule of thumb, use the follow ing numbers for planning purposes: adequate man-
      ning of an R- 1 set requires approximately 100 pe rsonnel, while an R-1/R-2 combination requires
      approximately 125 personnel, an d an R-1/R-2/R-3 combination re quires approximately 140 person-
      nel. When it comes to rapid ADR, the conseque nces of inadequate training cannot be over empha-
      sized. An ill-prepared ADR t eam properly manned and equippe d will have great dif ficulty
      accomplishing their mission within the mandated 4-hour time requirement. Furthermore, keep in mind
      that these figures are only for the ADR team; addi tional personnel will be required for staf fing com-
      mand and control centers as well as manning the various airfield and base-proper damage assessment
      teams. Details regarding additional team manning requirements are presented in volume 1, chapter 4
      of this pamphlet series.
      8.3.4. R-Set Manning. T eams assigned with R-sets should be manned as depicted in Table 8.4. and
      Table 8.5. respectively. The tables re flect only dedicated manning. Fo r instance, FFM personnel are
      used on both taxiways and the MOS, whereas, AM -2 mat personnel are usually employe d only on
      taxiway and ramp repairs.

                                           SPALL REPAIR

9.1. Overview. Spall damage should be expected after any conventional airfield attack. Spalls are gener-
ally defined as pavement surface damage that does not pe netrate through the pave ment surface to th e
underlying layers and may be up to 5 feet in diameter (see Figure 9.1.).

Figure 9.1. Spall Damage.




   9.1.1. During an attack, they are most commonly caused by ordnance impact (e.g., strafing and bomb-
   let detonation; bomb fragmentation impacts; and pavement ejecta).
   9.1.2. During extended operations in overseas locations, spalling is often the result of a combination
   of heavy operational use and substandard pavements (such as former Soviet Union or other areas
   without stringent pavement specifications and construction controls) resulting in a rapid rate of dete-
   rioration and increased maintenance requirements. In addition, the incidence of repairs to previous
   patches may also be high because of material failures or poor repair practices.
   9.1.3. During peacetime, spalling is generally caused by incompressible materials present in the joints
   and cracks that prevent the necessary movement of the slab due to thermal fluctuations, thereby caus-
   ing breaks in the concrete adjacent to the joint or crack. Spalls may also be caused by snowplows, over
   working, or pop-outs. Incompressible materials must be removed from the joint or crack, the spalled
   area patched, and the joint sealant replaced.
126                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


      9.1.4. As a norm, spalls are easier to correct than crater damage, providing the numbers are not over-
      whelming. Repairing of a spall requi res a few procedures: 1) squaring of the edge s; 2) cleaning out
      and removing debris; 3) applying bonding agent if required; 4) placing the fill material; and 5) finish
      the surface to provide a smooth load bearing surface for aircraft traffic.

9.2. Purpose and Objective of Spall Re pairs. The primary purpose of re pairing spalls on airfield pave-
ments is to reduce aircraft damage due to FOD, continue to provide a flush surface for aircraft operations,
and to prolong the service life of the pavement. The objective of spall repair is to reduce FOD and prevent
moisture or incompressible material (rocks, sand, othe r pieces of concrete, etc.) from entering into the
joint around the spall repair . Unsealed joints will allow mo isture to penetrate un der the slab causing an
increase in the moisture content in the base and sub-base. As thermal cycling occurs and the joint expands
and contracts, incompressible materi al such as rocks, chunks of concre te, sand, or ice in the crack may
cause stress to build in the slab. Such stress can result in more spalling or cracking and further damage to
the slab, thereby increasing the potential for FOD.

9.3. Areas of Concern.
      9.3.1. Manufacturer ’s Instructions. Ensure that the manufacturer’s instructions, or rules of common
      practice, are strictly followed.
      9.3.2. Bonding. The spall area must be prepared thoroughly. Sides should be vertical, loose material
      removed, and the repair surface clean or coated with a bonding agent if applicable. Bad bonding will
      result in the patch coming loose.
      9.3.3. Safety. Follow all safety precautions. Some of the rapid setting materials are toxic and flamma-
      ble. Wear protective clothing and dispose of excess material properly.
      9.3.4. Debris. Sweep all areas to be trafficked by aircraft even if debris appears minimal.

9.4. Personnel Requirements. For planning purposes, three spall repair teams consisting of four personnel
each are usually established as part of the overall ADR team complement. This number of pers onnel is
sized to respond to a potential requirement of repairing up to 400 spallswithin a 4-hour period. Obviously,
if fewer spalls are encountered, the team sizing can be adjusted accordingly by the engineer command and
control element.

9.5. Equipment Requirements. The equipment generally needed for each spall repair team consist of the
following: 1) one 5-ton dump truck or similar vehicl e; 2) portable radio; 3) protective masks; 4) mixers,
tools, and materials appropriate to the type of repair product being used; 5) concrete saw; and 6) joint use
of the ADR team jackhammer and compressor.

9.6. Spall Repair Procedures. For specific spall repa ir procedures, see UFCs 3-270-03, Con-crete and
Partial Depth Spall Repair.

                                               Chapter 10

                                           CRATER REPAIR

10.1. Overview. Craters represent damage that penetrates through the pavement surface into the underly-
ing base and sub grade soil, which uplifts the surrounding pavement and ejects base, sub base soils, rock,
and pavement debris around the impact area. Craters represent much more seve re damage than spalls.
Large craters have an apparent diameter equal to or greater than 6 m (20 ft). Small craters have an appar-
ent diameter less than 6 m (20 ft). Typical crater configurations are shown in Figure 10.1.

Figure 10.1. Large and Small Craters




10.2. Expedient Repair. Repairs to the MOS/MAOS must be completed within four hours after an enemy
attack to allow aircraft laun ch and recovery operations. These repair s must provide an ac cessible and
functional MOS/ MAOS that will sust ain 100 passes of the particular airc raft identified by the ICC at its
projected mission weight, or the number of passes required to support the initial surge mission aircraft.

10.3. Mobilization After Attack. After an enemy attack, repair materials and equipment will have to be
delivered to the damaged runway and taxiways before ADR operations can begin. The chaos common to
any postattack environment requires close coordina tion between the hauling team NCOIC and the crew
chiefs of the crater repair crews. This prevents delivery of excess materials to one repair area while
another area is left without adequate repair supplies. It is up to the ADR OIC and NCOIC to oversee this
entire delivery operation, making adjustments as necessary to ensure a steady progression of ADR activi-
ties. The ADR delivery operation is a major tasking in logistics flow, more dependent on organization and
timing than ability to operate specifi c pieces of equ ipment in a prescribed manner. Repair teams, equip-
ment, and materials were dispersed to several locations p rior to the attack . These as sets must now be
brought from dispersal sites and properly combined and configured to perform the ADR operation. Trans-
port vehicles, repair materials, and equipment are not always collocated during dispersal.
   10.3.1. Assembly. After an airfield attack, airfield damage as sessment teams are dispatched by t he
   EOC to gather information for MOS selection purposes. Between the times these teams are dispatched
   and the final selection of the MOS is made, ADR cr ews must assemble; assess their equipment and
   material status; and prepar e for movement to the repair sites. At this time the re pair crews are nor-
128                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


      mally formed and the c onvoy order of progression is established. If for some reason vehicles are
      attrited, adjustments must be made predicated on how long the vehicle will be out of service, its
      importance to the flow of ADR activities, and what other “work-arounds” may be available.
      10.3.2. Loading. The complexity of the loading operation will depend on the type of materials and
      equipment to be loaded and their stockpile or dispersal locations. For example, crushed stone and bal-
      last rock loading operations will require the support of front-end loaders or similar equipment to place
      these materials into dump trucks. Bulldozers and other tracked vehicl es may have to be loaded onto
      flatbed trailers for transport if they are located a significant distance from the runway. AM-2 matting,
      folded fiberglass matting, and the va rious component kits will all re quire forklift support for loading
      onto tractor-trailer units. To the maximum extent possible, repair materials and equipment should be
      loaded prior to the attack and dispersed in this fashion. For example, the initial loads of crushed stone
      should be in dispersed dump trucks and the matting materials should be loaded onto tractor-trailers.
      10.3.3. Establishment of a Haul Route. Establishment of a good haul route at th e very beginning of
      the ADR operation is essential to avoid traffic congestion and to ensure rapid movement of trucks and
      equipment between locations. The haul route should be selected as soon as possible after initial dam-
      age assessment. The haul route is normally designated by the DCC or the ADR OIC based on the loca-
      tion of pavement damage and UXO. All drivers must know the route and they must be warned not to
      deviate from it unless forced to by subsequent attacks or similar emergencies. A good haul route will
      have the following characteristics:
         10.3.3.1. Be wide enough for two trucks or heavy equipment to pass one another.
         10.3.3.2. If possible, a one-way travel circuit.
         10.3.3.3. Be connected to all crater repair sites. This is required in case one of the stockpile sites
         is depleted and the supply of ma terials must be shifted to anot her stockpile location. This also
         allows C2 and vehicle maintenance personnel access to all repair and stockpile locations.
      10.3.4. Debris Clearance. Haul route clearance is the fi rst priority of the crat er repair operation. All
      front-end loader and grader operat ors should assist by trave ling to their crater site with buc kets and
      blades down in ar eas where debris is present. Where the debris is heavy, front-end loaders should
      move debris to the side of the haul route trying not to leave a thick, compacted layer which could be
      too deep for graders to remove.
      10.3.5. Traffic Congestion. For ease of control, each repair team should deploy with all its equipment.
      This ensures required equipment does not become separated from the team. However, serious conges-
      tion occurs around the crater if e quipment waiting to star t work is parked in places that hinder other
      phases of the repair operation. Normally, it is recommended that teams move with all their personnel
      and equipment, but that equipmen t not required at a particular time be moved of f of the MOS and
      parked about 100 feet away from the crater. However, be aware of potential hidden UXO—never
      move equipment outside the EOD cleared zone without proper clearance. Unnecessary vehicles on the
      MOS seriously hinder foreign object damage clearance and sweepin g, and muddy tires or a spilled
      load of crushed stone can easily contaminate cleared areas. Dump trucks can be a main cause of con-
      gestion along the haul route and ar ound craters. If they must park to await an opportunity to dump
      their load, they should not get in theway of other trucks or equipment. It is preferred to have the trucks
      discharge their loads near the crat er repair area to prevent dela ying the total delivery activity . This
      stockpiling approach can pay dividends in t ime saved when craters are si gnificant distances apart.
      Once the stockpiled crushed stone starts to be pushed into the crater, it is best to have the trucks dump
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 129


   their payloads directly into the crater . Regardless of the approach taken, it is the crater crew chief ’s
   responsibility to take steps to regulate vehicular traffic around his/her immediate operations area.
   10.3.6. Precise Identification of Runway Locations. Without a system for identifying locations on the
   runway, misunderstandings between the DCC and crews are bound to occur. The hauling team drivers
   will have difficulty finding the right crater to deliver their load. As a result, frust rated crater crew
   chiefs may “hijack” passing trucks, and the team at the far end of th e MOS will be seriously delayed
   while waiting for crater fill materials to be delivered. The pavement reference system marker posts set
   out on the grass adjacent to the runway just before the start of hostilities serve as more than just loca-
   tion stations for the damage assessment teams (Figure 10.3.). They also can be used as identifiers for
   delivery locations for the hauling team.

Figure 10.2. Raised Pavement Marker System Post.




   10.3.7. Off-Load Materials and Equipment. Areas in the immediate vicinity of craters must be cleared
   of debris so FFM or AM-2 matt ing, support kits and equi pment, and stockpiles of crushed stone can
   be off loaded.
      10.3.7.1. Special areas must be id entified and cleared for both AM-2 and FFM assembly. Unlike
      most other areas, these m ust be totally cleared and sw ept since even relatively small pieces of
      debris can interfere with mat assembly. One of the first tasks for the crater crew chiefs upon arrival
      at the repair site is to identify these stockpiling and assembly areas.
      10.3.7.2. Delivery of material must continue until the crater crew chief determines that sufficient
      quantities are at the crater sites. Not all fill requires stockpili ng near or at the crater’s edge; some
      can be dumped directly into the crater void. If there is too much fill delivered to the crater, it can
      be pushed quickly to the runway edge; but if there is not enough ma terial, the repair process will
      be delayed.
130                                                                     AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


         10.3.7.3. Dump truck tailgates shoul d be unlatched by a “spotter” fr om the crater repair team as
         the truck backs up to offload.
         10.3.7.4. Dozers and other tracked vehicles should be unloaded from transporters as quickly and
         safely as possible to re duce traffic congestion. Where to unloa d the dozer will be determined by
         each crater crew chief based upon the situation at hand. The dozer operator should minimize pave-
         ment damage by driving the do zer along the grass be side the airfield pavement when moving
         between craters. M inimizing sharp turns and the use of street pads can al so be h elpful when a
         porous friction surface (asphalt) overlay of the runway surface is involved.
      10.3.8. Lighting the Work Site. Be sure to bring and set up portabl e light sets when ADR operations
      are conducted during hours of darkness.

10.4. Determining Repair Method and Clearing Crater Site. The crater repair method must be determined
and the crater area must be cleare d of debris to permit uph eaval identification. One of four crater repair
methods can be utilized: debris backfill, choke ballast over debris , choke ballast, or sand grid. The
sand-grid repair method must have a foreign object damage (FOD) cove r and is only suitable for fighter
aircraft and C-130 operations. Foreign object dam-age covers are not currently approved for C-17 Globe-
master, C-5 Gala xy, KC-10 Ex-tender, and KC-135 S tratotanker operations. Fo r airfields with a mix of
aircraft that includes those not approved for FOD covers and ones that require FOD covers (i.e. fighters),
multiple MOS' should be selected, if possible, to allow for a MOS with FOD covers and one without. This
will prevent the time consuming and maintenance intensive removal and replacement of FOD c overs
between operations of dif ferent aircraft. It is criti cal in either case to ensure the ADR teams understand
which type mission has higher priority to the ICC and repair that one first; likewise, it is critical that the
ICC understands the limitation impo sed by the variety of aircraft and the different ADR methods each
demands. See T.O. 35E2-5-1, , Crushed Stone Repair and Line-of-Sight Profile Measurement for Rapid
Runway Repair, and UFC 3-270-07 to determine which repair method to use and crater repair site clearing
procedures.

10.5. Initial Upheaval Determinatio n. The determination of how mu ch upheaved pavement must be
removed at the s tart of a crater re pair is accomplished by a process called crater profile measurement
(CPM). The same process is used after repairs are complete to see if repairs have been performed within
the tolerances specified by the RQ C discussed in the prev ious chapter. Crater profile measurement will
also be employed at various times following aircraft trafficking in order to de termine if crater mainte-
nance is necessary due to base course compression. It is of paramount importance that engineering com-
mand and control pers onnel know the exact extent of the upheaval damage as well as the quality of a
completed repair effort. Without this information, ADR repairs will be relegated to “seat of the pants
guesswork” and aircraft sortie generation damage is almost a certainty. Figure 10.4. provides an example
of upheaval around a crater. NOTE: Procedural details regarding upheaval determination are provided in
T.O. 35E2-5-1.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                  131


Figure 10.3. Upheaval Around Crater.




10.6. Removing Upheaval, Exca vating and Filling Crater. With the extent of upheaval determined, the
next step in the ADR process is the removal of unsound and upheav ed pavement. Unsound pavement is
pavement that has been damaged to the point where there is a reasonable possi bility that it might break
apart under traffic and present a FOD problem. Based on the repa ir method chosen, the crater must be
excavated or filled with useable de bris. Since AM-2 and FFM repairs are compatible with irregularly
shaped craters, the pattern of upheaval breakout is not critical. Removing more pavement than necessary
will increase the time to complete th e repair and could enlar ge the crater to the extent where additional
FOD cover sections are required. See T.O. 35E2-5-1 for specific upheaval removal, crater excavating and
filling procedures.

10.7. Intermediate Crater Profile Check. As upheaval is being removed, intermediate upheaval measure-
ments are required to ensure all upheaval has been identified and removed. Use the same method as used
when performing initial upheaval determination. Check multiple points as upheaval is being removed.
Follow the procedures described in T.O. 35E2-5-1.

10.8. Crater Edge Cleaning, Leveling Fill Material, and Overfilling Crater. Clean edges of the crater by
making the top 18 inches of the sidewalls as vertical as possible. Then, level the top layers of fill material.
Use shovels to level areas near th e crater’s edge. Next, f ill and compact the crater with crushed stone
material using six-inch lifts. Over fill the crater by app roximately three inches above the original pave-
ment surface height. See UFC 3-270-07 for specific details regarding these procedures.
132                                                                      AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


10.9. Rough Leveling and Initially Compacting the Filled Crater. When the crater has been filled with the
top layer of crushed stone, it requires leveling and compacting to achieve its greatest load bearing capac-
ity. Perform crater rough leveling and initial compacting as described in UFC 3-270-07.

10.10. Final Grade and Compaction. To ensure the final crater surface is flush and not below the original
pavement height, final grade and compaction procedures must be performed. This step is essential before
a FOD cover can be installed. Follow the procedures in UFC 3-270-07.
NOTE: The crushed stone layer should have a minimum 25 California Bearing Ratio (CBR) to support
C-17, C-130, and/or fighter operations.

10.11. Dual-Crater Repair. It is more efficient to repair two craters concurrently than to complete one cra-
ter before beginning the second crater. Command and control has the single greatest impact in a dual-cra-
ter repair scenario. Refer to dual-crater repair procedures in T.O. 35E2-5-1.

10.12. FOD Covers. After an air attack, runways and taxiways must be repaired to a standard that allows
operations to be resumed with minimal risk to the aircraft. Since the folded fiberglass mat repair method
can be accomplished in a flush manner, this method is the primary one used for MOS repairs. AM-2 mat-
ting method inherently has a 1.5-inch rise due to the thickness of the matting. As a result, AM-2 repairs
are normally relegated to taxiways where aircraft speeds are much slower and less aircraft damage is lia-
ble to result. B oth of these repair systems essentially requi re the same basic crat er preparation prior to
installing the repair surfa ce. These steps include a simple su rvey to determine the ex tent of upheaval,
removal of unsound pavement and upheaval, backfilling with debris and/or rock, leveling and compaction
of crushed stone fill material, and lastly, placement and anchoring of the FOD cover.
      10.12.1. AM-2 Mat. AM-2 aluminum matting is hand-assembled and anchored over a crater prepared
      with crushed stone. This repair surface is the most manpower intensive of the two primary techniques
      (Figure 10.5.). Once the mainstay of rapid runway crater repairs, AM-2 has now been mostly rele-
      gated to a secondary use for taxiway repairs and parking apron expansion. It does, however, represent
      an option for runway repairs if other methods cannot be used. A limited number of AM-2 aluminum
      mat kits are prepositioned at sel ected airfields overseas for ADR. The size of a standard AM -2 patch
      is 54 feet wide by 77 feet, 6 inch es long. Mat size can be reduced fo r small craters and increased for
      larger ones by simply decreasing or increasing the number of panels used. For example, when using
      AM-2 for t axiway repairs, a patch is usually only 30 feet by 60 feet , since taxing aircraft normally
      only require a 25-foot width. T o this end, it may be worthwhile to configure some AM-2 bundles to
      support such activities. By doing this, time could be saved when actual taxiway crater repairs are
      required. Obviously, such modified bundles would have to be marked conspicuously to avoid possible
      confusion with those AM-2 bundles configured in the standard manner. AM-2 mat repairs must meet
      the RQC for its location on the runway. AM-2 mat repairs are generally acceptable for fighter aircraft
      and C-130s but inadequate for jet cargo aircraft landing strips. AM-2 mats can be used to repair taxi-
      ways and aprons if braking and tight turns are limited on the mat. Procedural details regarding AM-2
      installation are provided in T.O. 35E2-2-7, AM-2 Landing Mat and Accessories and UFC 3-270-07.

   10.12.2. Folded Fiber glass Mat. The second FOD cover to be discussed is the FFM (Figure 10.6).
   This procedure, which is currently the primary MO S repair method, involves the installation of an
   anchored FFM over a crater that was prepared with a top layer of well-compacted crushed stone. Cra-
   ter preparation is essentially identical to that us ed with the AM -2 matting system. The folded fiber-
   glass mat has several advantages; it is air transportable, can be moved more easily by vehicle, can be
   positioned at greater distan ces from airfield pa vement surfaces, and can be stored indoors out of the
   elements. Procedural details regarding FFM installation are provided in T.O. 35E2-3-1, Folded Fiber-
   glass Mats for Rapid Runway Repair, and UFC 3-270-07.

         10.12.2.1. Specific ation. A standard folded fiber glass mat weighs about 3,00 0 pounds and con-
         sists of nine fiberglass panels, each 6 feet wide, 30 feet long, and about 3/8-inch thick. Elastomer
         hinges, approximately 3 inches wi de, connect the panels. When folded, the mats are 6 feet wide,
         30 feet long, and 8 to 10 inches thick. In addition to the folded fiberglass mats, this ADR system
         also includes joining panels and two mat support kits. The joining panels come in 24- and 30-foot
         lengths. One of each size is needed to connect two 30- by 54-foot mats together . The resulting
         54-foot long by 60-foot wide mat is the normal size suitable for most crater repairs. If larger FOD
         covers are required, additional mats may be spliced together to form almost any size. Mat kit “A”
         contains all the necessary tools and hardware required to assemble, install, and maintain the sys-
         tem. Mat kit “B” contains the anchor systems required to attach the mat to a range of airfield pave-
         ment surfaces.
NOTE: Although FFM is the preferred FOD c over on the MOS primary takeof f and landing surface,
flush crushed stone repairs without FFM will be used for C-17 Globemaster, C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter,
and KC-10 Extender operations until more permanent repairs can be made.

10.13. Sweeping the Crater Area. Regardless of what type of FOD cover is used, sweeping and clean up
of the repair area is a mandatory final step. All equipment mu st be removed and eith er sent to other job
sites or sent back to dispersal s ites. Excess materials must be reclaimed or moved out of the immediate
MOS area. The crater and its surroun ding area must be thoroughly swept to eliminate the potential of
FOD damage to aircr aft which will be using the MOS immediately afte rwards. Lastly, ensure that all
debris resulting from the initial bombing attack and that generated from the crater preparation process is
off of the MAOS and does not present a hazard to flying operations or the functioning of aircraft arresting
systems and airfield lighting systems.

10.14. Repair Activity Sequencing . Although this chapter has looked at crater re pair as an individual
step-by-step process, if ADR is physically performed as described, recovery teams will never be capable
of meeting the t ime frames dictated by the Oper ations community. To reduce ADR tim e, five basic
requirements involving ADR team members need to be met. Each member of the ADR team must: 1)
know his or her individual tasks and re sponsibilities; 2) be fully proficie nt in his or her individual tasks;
3) know how his or her tasks interface with the ADR process as a whole; 4) know the steps and sequenc-
ing of ADR activities; and 5) receive extensive hands-on training and practice on the ADR process.
      10.14.1. If these five requirements are satisfied, ADR time frames can be drastically shortened since
      people will anticipate their next actions, assist others without hesitation, and be able to do their jobs
      right the first time. To see how these requirements apply, let us look at the efforts involved in a dual
      crater repair.
      10.14.2. As stated earlier, many ADR activities must overlap or performed concurrently to cut down
      on ADR oper ation time. Table 10.1. graphically illustrate s a two-cr ater repair effort using folded
      fiberglass mats. When studying this table, several instances where tasks overlap can be seen. If ADR
      team members know where and when these occur, they can respond accordingly and the ADR process
      will be accelerated. A few examples include:
         10.14.2.1. Transportation of FFMs occurs while crater upheaval is being removed.
         10.14.2.2. Clearing areas for mat assembly occurs simultaneously with upheaval removal.

         10.14.2.3. Backfilling of craters starts before upheaval removal is completed.
         10.14.2.4. Grading and compacting of crushed stone can be concurrent events.
         10.14.2.5. Final clean up and debris clearance may begin before the FFM is fully anchored.
      10.14.3. These examples just relate to the repair of one of two craters assigned to a crater repair crew.
      However, about 80% of the time two craters will be worked concurrently. For a smooth operation, all
      ADR team members must thoroughl y know the procedure and sequenc ing of ADR activities. These
      “knowns” must be mastered if the “unknowns” of wartime equipmen t losses and personnel attrition
      are to be faced with any degree of success.

10.15. Debris Clearance. The peacetime s tandard of cleanliness for runways an d taxiways requires that
they be kept free of any debris th at could cause FOD to aircraft. In wartime, the runway surfaces will be
extensively covered with debris after each air attack, and no equipment available can rapidly clear the sur-
face to peacetime standards. In any case, the risk to aircraft being launched from a “dirty” runway is much
less than if aircraft were caught in an air attack while sitting on the ramp waiting for sweeping operations
to be completed.
      10.15.1. Clearance Procedures. Dif ferent standards of cleanliness can be achieved by using various
      combinations of equipment in the ADR equipment sets. Tests have shown that very littl e benefit is
      achieved by making more equipment coverages than the following recommendations:
         10.15.1.1. The cleanest surface is achieved by making one “fast” (4-to-5 mph) sweep of the area
         with a grader, followed by two coverages with a vacuum sweeper traveling at 3.5- to 4-mph.
         10.15.1.2. A clean surface is achieved by conducting one fast (4 -to 5-mph) grader coverage fol-
         lowed by one coverage of the tractor with a front-mounted br oom traveling at approximately 5.5
         mph. These speeds are ef fective only if the debris is mostly dry. If the debris is wet and sticky, a
         broom cannot produce a good clean surface.
         10.15.1.3. A slow (2- to 3-mph) grader coverage followed by a second, faster (3-to 5-mph) cover-
         age will leave a “dirty” surface, because more large stones are left on it.
         10.15.1.4. The “dirtiest” surface, but fastest opera tion, is left by condu cting one “fast” (4-to
         5-mph) coverage with a grader only.

10.16. Clearing and Sweeping Recommendations. Reco mmendations for clearing and sweeping activi-
ties include:
      10.16.1. Sweep all ar eas to be trafficked by aircraft even if debris appears minimal. It is essential to
      remove as much shrapnel as possible since even small pieces of sharp metal can damage tires.
      10.16.2. Clear taxiways and a strip about 25 feet wide on both sides of the MOS with one fast grader
      coverage. Also ma ke a single coverage about 15 feet wi de with the grade r down the center of what
      will be the overruns of the MOS to provide open access for airfield lighting placement. The length of
      this run will depend on the type of expedient lighting system available. A better standard of sweeping
      is required on parking aprons and uphi ll sections of the taxiway where the aircraft needs to use more
      power and is therefore likely to suck up more debris. Use a kick broom sweeper or second grader cov-
      erage at these locations.
      10.16.3. Clear the first 300 feet of the MOS (the most critical area) with a vacuum sweeper.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              137


   10.16.4. Clear the next 800 feet of the MOS with a vacuum sweeper, if possible.
   10.16.5. Clear remainder of MOS with kick broom sweeper or by two passes with the grader.
   10.16.6. The above recommendations should be considered just that—recommendations. They are
   not the minimum requirements. As time and vehicles permit, remove as much FOD as possible from
   all airfield pavements to be used for launch and recovery purposes. Rest assured that sweepers will be
   running continuously and requests for sweeper support will be never-ending. Plan on making frequent
   trips to the MOS for FOD clea n up—aircraft activity and winds will cont inually blow additional
   debris across the airstrip. Once ai rfield pavement debris clearance is under control, you can expect
   demands from wing leadership to clean base thoroughfares leading to the flightline from maintenance
   facilities, munitions storage areas, and POL storage sites.

10.17. Equipment Repair and Recovery Planning. Considering the magnitude of ADR, vehicular equip-
ment will experience breakdowns during operations. Planning for such an eventuality will avoid lengthy
downtime that could seriously delay repair efforts. Petition the vehicle maintenance section to provide a
minimum of two ADR dedicated sp ecial purpose vehicle mechanics to support operations. Where this
support can be provided, the two-person team should be equipped wi th a mobile maintenance vehicle of
some sort, a means of two-way radio communication (radio/cellular phone), tool boxes, a supply of com-
mon replacement spare parts, and remain on the MAOS during the ADR operation to quickly respond to
equipment break-downs. In addition, all front-end loaders and dozers should be equipped with towing
straps to recover any equipment stuck in a crater or to remove any disabled vehicles from the MOS area.

10.18. Equipment Substitution. When a specific item of equipment does break down, do not let the ADR
operation grind to a halt. There are many cases where other pieces of equipment may substitute and per-
form a task almost equally as well. Table 10.2. provides an equipment hierarchy illustrating what types of
tasks various pieces of equipment can perform. The equipment items are listed in descending order of pre-
cedence. For example, for grading the primary vehicle to use would be the grader, followed by a front-end
loader and then the excavator. The point to remember is that there are alternatives. You are not locked into
following a strict set of procedures. Use initiative, be innovative, and be flexible.

                                        AUXILIARY SYSTEMS

11.1. Introduction. Repairing damaged pavement is no t the only tasks involved in ADR operations. T o
bring the MOS to its full capability, support crews must perform MOS marking and paint striping, install
aircraft arresting systems, and install airfield lighting systems.

11.2. Overview.
   11.2.1. This chapter will briefly described the MO S marking system, to include marking procedures
   that may be required if a grass, dirt, or other unimproved landing strip is developed to support contin-
   gency operations. In addition, marking of obstructions, damaged areas, or other hazards that may have
   been caused by an attack will be discussed.
   11.2.2. The importance of having an aircraft arrestment capability will also be discussed in this chap-
   ter. After an aerial bombardment, the probability that the permanently installed aircraft arresting sys-
   tem of the base will be either functional or properly situated on the new MOS is highly remote at best.
   11.2.3. Finally, the chapter will discuss the necessity of airfield lighting for nighttime operations. Res-
   toration of the existing permanent lighting system may not be feasible due to the extent of damage or
   location of existing lighting re lative to the MOS. If this situation prevails, an EALS will have to be
   installed.

11.3. Airfield Marking Procedures. The marking of an ai rfield must adhere to precise guidelines. AFI
32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, and USAF Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 04-2, Standard
Airfield Marking Schemes, outline very specific requirements for marking airfield surfaces to conform to
recognized standards for aircraft operations. While these markings are considered ideal under normal cir-
cumstances, it is unlikely that sufficient time will exist to restore the markings to their original condition
following an enemy attack. Repair crews will be rapidly repairing craters and ot her attack damage. The
marking team must be ready to apply expedient techniques that willmark the usable runway surface in the
shortest possible time if combat aircraft are to be launched and recovered in a timely fashion. For a more
detailed description of the various system components, discussions of preattack and postattack activities,
and the basic layouts for marking a nd striping a MOS, see T .O. 35E2-6-1, Minimum Airfield Operating
Surface Marking System (MAOSMS) and AFH 10-222, Volume 16, Guide for Use of the Minimum Air-
field Operating Surface Marking System.
   11.3.1. Restrictions. The methods discussed in this chapter are intended for use during extreme emer-
   gencies, such as enemy attacks, to restore a runway to some degr ee of usefulness quickly. The tech-
   niques described must not be employed as re placements for standard runway markings during
   peacetime. Specifically, these expedient procedures and marking c onfigurations should be employed
   only when marking a MOS under ba se recovery after attack conditi ons, or a contingency scenario
   where a damaged enemy airbase has been seized.
   11.3.2. MAOS Marking System (MAOSMS). The di mensions of the MOS repaired by ADR crews
   will vary primarily according to the type of aircraft the base will support and the environmental con-
   ditions to be expected following an attack. Although the nominal MOS dimensions for fighter aircraft
   operations are 50- by 5,000-feet, the length and width of the selected MOS could be greater. The ADR
   MOS marking crew must be flex ible enough to respond to any number of MOS marking require-
140                                                                       AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


      ments. The MOS mark ing system that this crew employs provides much of this flexibility . This sys-
      tem includes four major components: edge markers, distance-to-go markers, aircraft arresting system
      markers, and a paint striping system . Each of the components can be used separately or in combina-
      tion with each other, depending upon the extent of need. The components can also be installed in any
      order in case time does not permit the entire system to be installed all at once. The MOS marking sys-
      tem contains sufficient material and equipment to mark a 10,000- by 150- foot MOS. Although it is
      doubtful that a MOS of this length will ever be a requirement for fighter operations, a system with this
      capability provides material redu ndancy for shorter MO S needs and the potent ial for expansion to
      support aircraft that may require much longer landing and takeoff surfaces.
      11.3.3. Marking of Unimproved Landing Strips. Under some conditions it may become necessary to
      use grass, dirt, or othe r unimproved landing zone s for military opera tions (usually involving C-130
      aircraft). When the area in use is large and relatively uniform, it may not be crucial to define specifi-
      cally the limits of the landing ar ea. Where the lateral and longitudi nal limits of a runway do require
      visual definition, single markers are placed within 15 feet of the edge of the runway, and opposite each
      other on both sides of the runway at intervals not to exceed 300 feet. Double markers are provided on
      each side of the runway at both ends, and at 100 feet inward from the runway in the direction of land-
      ing. The outer of the two m arkers are located not more than 15 fe et laterally from the inner row of
      markers. Detailed instructions fo r construction and placement of these markers are covered in ETL
      04-7, C-130 and C-17 Landing Zone (LZ) Di-mensional, Marking, an d Lighting Criteria, dated 29
      March 2004, and AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.
      11.3.4. Marking of Obstructions/Hazardous Areas. An extensive enemy attack on an air base is sure
      to damage airfield surfaces beyond what can quickly be repaired. Even after a MOS has been selected,
      repaired, and marked, damage will remain which could cause hazards to aircraft operating in and out
      of the airfield. ETL 04-2 outlines procedures that are to be used to identify pavements that are closed
      or hazardous to aircraft traffic. Although these procedures may not apply following an enemy attack,
      they do serve as excellent guid es for the development of method s for marking hazardous pavements
      during emergencies.
         11.3.4.1. Closed Areas. According to ETL 04-2, mark closed runways, taxiways, and aprons with
         a non-reflective yellow capital “X.”
         11.3.4.2. Hazardous Areas. Where a hazardous area, such as a bomb crater, exists in or adjacent to
         an active pavement that cannot be closed to aircraft traffic, the area should be outlined with mark-
         ers and lights. At all co rners and ends, dual ma rkers and lights should be used. A single ma rker
         and light should be positioned every 50 feet or less between the corners. The markers may be
         either low (1-foot or less in height) or high (2 to 3 feetin height) profile barricades (see ETL 04-2).

11.4. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). Under most circumstances, an arresting system must be
in place for the possible engagement of high-speed fighter aircraft returning to the base with battle dam-
age and other emergencies. This is where the MAAS comes into play. It was specifically designed to ful-
fill the need for an expedient aircraft recovery which is capable of high-cycle arrestment (up to 20 aircraft
engagements per hour) of arre sting hook equipped tact ical aircraft on bomb-damaged surfaces. The
MAAS is a self-contained system that can be installed in less than 40 minutes by a crew of six trained per-
sonnel on a concrete, asphalt, or soil surface. Additional details regarding specific applications and capa-
bilities of this system are discusse d in length in T .O. 35E8-2-10-1, Arresting Systems, Aircraft, Mobile
(MAAS) and AFH 10-222V8, Guide to Mobile Aircraft Arresting System Installation.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                  141


  11.4.1. If an existing arresting system remains functional, is located longitu dinally correct on the
  MOS, and is situated wit hin the cr ater free rest rictions, its pendant must span the MOS properly to
  prevent an aircraft from being pulled to one side or the other after engagement. Off-center engagement
  capability for the MAAS and BAK-12 is half the distance to the runw ay edge from each sid e of the
  runway centerline. If the centerline of the selected MOS is within the off-center engagement capabil-
  ity of the existing system, the existing system can be used, but pilots must be cautioned to engage as
  near to MOS centerline as pos sible. If the MOS cen terline is not within the of f-center engagement
  capability of the existing system, the existing system cannot be used (see Figure 6.1.). Regardless of
  whether a MAAS or an in-place system is operated, the compulsory use of an arresting system will
  reduce launch or recovery (LOR) status due to the time involved in arresting system recycling opera-
  tions.
  11.4.2. Use of Aircraft Arresting Systems. In many situations, aircraft landing operations will require
  more pavement length than takeof f—especially in wet or icy conditions. If an arr esting system is
  available, the landing length ca n be shortened with an accompanying decrea se in the ADR ef fort
  needed. Be sure, however, that sufficient undamaged pavement exists before planning on the use of an
  arresting system. About 2,000 feet of pavement with no repair patches is necessary to use the arresting
  system in a bidirectional mode. In wet and icy conditions, most airc raft will require more than 5,000
  feet to land.
  11.4.3. Original System Limitations. The original MAAS was configured and intended to be used pri-
  marily for ba se recovery after atta ck (BRAAT). This operation scenario allowed for only unidirec-
  tional engagements and did not provide for bo th approach and depa rture end engagements.
  Furthermore, since the trailer s were installed 7.5 feet from the runway ed ge, the rel atively narrow
  cross-runway span did not allow for wide-body aircraft operations—an undesirable limitation.
  11.4.4. System Upgrades. Since the MAAS is essentially a trailer-mounted BAK-12, these initial sys-
  tem limitations could be overcome. Making the system bidirectional simply involved adding 12 addi-
  tional cruciform stakes (per trailer) and extendin g the tape run out from 990 feet to 1,200 feet.
  Furthermore, by also adding a light weight fairlead beam (LWFB) or a Mobile Runway Edge Sheave
  (MRES), the MAAS trailers could be set back as much as 200 feet from the runway edge, thus allow-
  ing the room required for wide-body aircraft operations.
  11.4.5. If an arresting system is necessary, its location will have been marked by MOS layout person-
  nel prior to the arrival of the arresting system installation team. Prior to initial movement of the ADR
  forces, the support team chief ascertains from th e team’s OIC whether the arresting system will be
  unidirectional or bidirectional. Th is information is passed to the arresting system installation team
  chief. As soon as possible after the arresting system location has been marked, the arresting system
  installation team starts its ef forts. If debris clearance is required at the installation site, the arresting
  system team chief requests such assistance thr ough the support team OIC. Once the arresting system
  is installed, the arresting system team chief checks the tape sweep area for cleanliness. If debris has to
  be moved out of the tape sweep a rea, this is also coordinated through th e support te am OIC. The
  arresting system team chief retains the responsibility for ensuring the tape sweep area is usable even
  after requesting debris removal support. He/she must not declare the arresting system serviceable until
  the tape sweep area is completely clear of any object that could in terfere with the arresting s ystem
  operation and can certify that the installation is in accordance with T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. NOTE: For new
  installations or for cases where major civil works have been accomplished that may af fect system
142                                                                        AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008


      alignment, a task-certified Power Production 7-level technician or the civilian WG 5378 equivalent
      must certify the system ready for use (AFI 32-1043).

11.5. Installing Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting may not be important for daytime aircraft operations,
but it is essential for flight in an environment with limited visibili ty. Procedures for installing portable
lighting systems, as well as guidance on salvaging the existing system, are provided in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1,
Lighting System, Airfield, Emergency A/E82U-2, and AFH 10-222V7, Emergency Airfield Lighting Sys-
tem.
      11.5.1. In most cases, the question will be when to install the lighting system, not whether one is nec-
      essary. If considerable daylight will be available after all other ADR operations are anticipated to be
      complete, airfield lighting should not prove to be immediately critical to aircraft launch and recovery
      efforts. On the other hand, if the onset of darkness is a factor , airfield lighting installation must be
      started as soon as possible. The ADR OIC will have to decide th e timing for this operation based on
      inputs from the EOC and ICC and the situation at hand.
      11.5.2. If lighting installation crew s can wait until final MOS clear ance is completed before begin-
      ning their operations, ease of operation would be enhanced and de-conflict ing activities would be
      reduced significantly. Two consequential examples of potential problems can be brought about by
      attempting to install the system too early in the scheme of things. First, personnel attrition may be
      experienced since the airfield lighting regulator, generator, and associated connecting cables are posi-
      tioned very close to the fringes of the initial UXO cleared zone (EOD personnel initially clear only
      100 feet out from each side of the MOS). Second, debris clearing operations conflicts may develop,
      since the debris-clearing zone extends well beyond the area where airfield lighting is actually
      installed. All MOS debris must be removed a minimum of 25 feet beyond each MOS edge.
      11.5.3. If it is necessary to install the lighting system concurre ntly with other ADR operations, the
      lighting installation team starts the task as soon as possible. Because the edges of the MOS may not be
      marked and considerable debris may be remaining in the area, final placement of the fixtures probably
      will not be possible when the team first starts its efforts. The cabling and fixtures can, however, be
      assembled 25 feet or so off of the probable MOS edges and moved into place once all major debris has
      been moved from the final installation area. Placement of the airfield lighting regulator and generator
      can also be accomplished early. The support team OIC must also make a c oncerted effort to dovetail
      the heavier debris clearance activit ies with the lighting installati on. Since access to the areas around
      craters that are being repaired wi ll usually be limited, th e airfield lighting team should initially con-
      centrate its activities on other areas where access is not hampered by either debris or equipment oper-
      ations. Obviously, such decisions are on-scene judgments with the potential of involving unlimited
      variations. The basic point here is not to expect the airfield lighting team to be able to start at one end
      of the MOS and work to the othe r end without interrup tion—there usually will be too ma ny other
      major activities ongoing on and around the MOS to allow this. While the support team OIC will have
      much coordination to do with resp ect to airfield lighting installatio n, the lighting installation team
      chief retains the primary responsibility for proper installation and performa nce of the system. This
      individual should not permit the installation team to leave the MOS area until the system is fully func-
      tional and correctly installed.
      11.5.4. Planning Factors. Ideally, if the situation permits, light assembly and installation can be con-
      ducted simultaneously with aircraf t takeoff and landing. However, regardless of whe n the system is
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                 143


   installed, the following factors should be considered when planning an airfield lighting system instal-
   lation:
      11.5.4.1. Personnel Requirements. Four people (at least two electrical systems [3E0X1] person-
      nel) are needed.
      11.5.4.2. Equipment Requirements. One 6-passenger (4 by 4) pickup truck with a pintle hook to
      tow the EALS.

11.6. Summary.
   11.6.1. The need to mark the MOS quickly following an attack by hostile forces requires that expedi-
   ent runway marking procedures be used. There is not time to restore the entire airfield to the standards
   required during peacetime operations. The MOS mark ing system provides th e basic components for
   establishing the minimum ma rkings required for comb at aircraft launch and r ecovery. Any existi ng
   runway markings that c ould cause confusion regard ing the location of the MO S must be obliterated.
   The information provided in this chapter is intended as general guidance for expedient marking of air-
   field surfaces. The specific tasks re quired to mark a runway surface quickly following an attack will
   vary with each situation. Use AFI 32-1042, T.O. 35E2-6-1, AFH 10 -222V16, ETLs 04-2 and 04-7,
   and your experience and engineering knowledge to accomplish runway-marking requirements.
   11.6.2. An arresting system must be in place for the possible engagement of tail hook equipped
   fighter aircraft returning to the base with battle dama ge and other emer gencies. Additional details
   regarding specific applications and capabilities of this system are discussed at length in T O
   35E8-2-10-1 and AFH 10-222V8.
   11.6.3. Airfield lighting is essential for flight in an environment with limited visibility. If the onset of
   darkness is probable before or upon the completion of ADR activities, airfield lighting installation
   must be started as soon as possible. The ADR OIC will have to decide the timing for this operation
   based on inputs from the EOC and ICC and the situat ion at hand. Detailed pr ocedures for installing
   emergency airfield lighting systems are provided in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1 and AFH 10-222V7.

Terms
access route—The route aircraft must take from the parking area/shelter to the MOS. Typically the route
will meander to avoid dama ge. The time to clear or repair the access route is a consid eration in MOS
selection. The terms “transition path , taxiway, and transition route” are sometimes used to indicate an
access route on a launch/recovery surface.

actual crater diameter—Opening in the airfield surface after a ll the debris and upheaved surface have
been removed. Also measured from lip-to-lip, and in mo st cases is significantly larger than the apparent
diameter.
air base operability (ABO)—The integrated capability of an insta llation to defend ag ainst, survive the
effects of, and recover from hostile action, thus s upporting effective wartime employment of air power .
Air base operability provides the sustained operational capability to wage war.
airborne RED HORSE (ARH)—Combat engineer capability to “assess , prepare and establish”
contingency airbases in remote locations through airdrop, air-insertion, or air-delivery.
airfield—An airfield may be c aptured, constructed, or provided by the host na tion, and may consist of
any suitable aircraft operating surface.
agile combat support (ACS)—An Air Force cor e competency which encompasses the process of
creating, sustaining, and protecting all aerospace capabilities to accomplish mission objectives across the
spectrum of operations. (AFDD 1-2)
alarm black—An alert condition signifying that the attack is over, but that chemical agent contamination
is possible. Personnel are cleared to leave the shelters, but they must wear chemical protective ensembles.
apparent crater diameter—Opening in the airfield surface that can be s een before any work is
accomplished on the crater; measured from upheaval lip-to-lip.
area-denial weapons—Weapons designed to deny personnel acce ss to an area. They usually are
delayed-fusing munitions, such as mines or submuni tions, that explode from time delay , disturbance,
movement, or other such target activation.
base defense operations center (BDOC)—A command and control facili ty established by the base
commander to serve as the focal point for base security and defense. It plans, directs, integrates,
coordinates, and controls all base defense ef forts and coordinates a nd integrates into area security
operations with the rear area operations center/rear tactical operations center. (JP 1-02)
base recovery after attack (BRAAT)—A theater concept of recoveri ng a base a fter a conventional
attack where resumption of flying operations is th e first priority. Other recove ry activities may be
conducted concurrently; however, these activities must not impede the resumption of flying operations.
camouflage—The use of natural or artificial material on personnel, objects, or tactical positions with the
aim of confusing, misleading, or evading the enemy.
camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD)—The use of concealment, disguise, and decoys to mini-
mize the possibility of det ecting or identifying troops, material, e quipment, and installations. It includes
taking advantage of the natural environment, as well as applying natural and artificial materials.

concept of operations (CONOPS)—A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a commander ’s
assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or se ries of ope rations. The conce pt of operations
frequently is embodied in ca mpaign plans and operation pl ans; in the latter case, particularly when the
plans cover a series of c onnected operations to be carried out simultaneous ly or in su ccession. The
concept is designed to give an overall picture of th e operation. It is included primarily for additional
clarity of purpose. (JP 1-02)

conventional weapon—A weapon that is not nuclear, biological, or chemical.
crater—The pit, depression, or cavity fo rmed in the surface of the earth by an explosion. It may range
from saucer shaped to conical, depending largely on the depth of burst. In the case of a deep underground
burst, no rupture of the surface may occur. The resulting cavity is termed a “camouflet.”
crater-actual diameter—The actual crater di ameter is the diameter across the crater after the heaved
pavement has been removed; in other words, the actual size of the required repair.
crater-apparent diameter—The apparent crater diameter is the visible diameter of the crater , inside

be measured from pa vement edge to pavement e dge. Apparent diameter is the information forwarded to
the EOC by the damage assessment teams.
Crater-large—Pavement damage from conventional weapons that penetrate or disturb the sub grade,
resulting in a pavement damage area in excess of 20 feet in diameter.

proper; but can also be employed elsewhere as deemed necessary. The airfield damage assessment team
(ADAT) usually will consist of one engineering technician, one EOD technician, and one or two
augmentees. The ADAT should be equipped with an armored vehicle and communications enabling them
to report their observations to the EOC. The ADA T must be accurate in their runway damage reports
because this information is used in MOS selection.

three crater repair crews, each capable of repairing one crater in 4 hours.
R-2—Equipment and vehicles, that when added to the R-1 set, provide thecapability to form mixed repair
teams (three teams for the runway MOS; three teams for the taxiway), each capable of repairing one crater
in 4 hours. Thus, R-2 equates to a capability for six crater repairs in 4 hours.
R-3—Additional equipment and vehicles, when added to the R-1 and R-2 sets, provide the capability for
six crater repair teams to each repair two craters within 4 hours. Thus, R-3 e quates to a capability for 12
craters repairs in a 4-hour period.

magnification of the blast pressure from reflection of f vertical s urfaces. Examples of this method are
sand-filled metal bins, eart h berms, and mo dular concrete sections, i.e. the Bitburg revetment. When
coupled with dispersal, splinter protection can provide a relatively high degree of survivability for short-
and long-term deployments.
Tactical air navigation (TACAN)—An ultrahigh frequency electronic air na vigation system, able to
provide continuous bearing and slant range to a s elected station. The term is derived from tactical air
navigation.

                                                Attachment 2

                                    SEQUENTIAL ADR FUNCTIONS

A2.1. General. Functional areas in postattack repair operations remain similar for either the AM-2 mat or
the folded fiberglass mat repair systems. Howeve r, functional procedures will differ depending upon the
system employed. The intent of this attachment is to present ADR postattack activities in an abbreviated,
sequential format. The topics covered are:
      A2.1.1. Airfield Damage Assessment.
      A2.1.2. MOS Selection.
      A2.1.3. UXO Safing.
      A2.1.4. UXO Removal.
      A2.1.5. Temporary MOS Markers (if needed).
      A2.1.6. Crater and Spall Repair.
      A2.1.7. MAAS Installation.
      A2.1.8. MAOS Clearing and Sweeping.
      A2.1.9. MOS Marking System Installation.
      A2.1.10. Airfield Lighting Repair/Installation.

A2.2. Damage Assessment System. Damage assessment is normally the first function performed after an
attack. It is extr emely important to receive a damage picture of the entire area of interest (runway , taxi-
ways, shelter access, etc.). The ADAT typically use an armored vehicle to survey assigned sections of the
airfield in order to locate craters, spalls and utilitybreaks, and make an initial UXO reconnaissance. In the
absence of a suitable vehicle, the as sessment team proceeds on foot. The num ber of ADATs required is
dependent upon the size of the airfi eld; however, most bases will post ure three of these teams. T oday’s
threats dictate that the damage assessment and UX O reconnaissance reports ne ed to be received quicker
than what has been acceptable in the past.
      A2.2.1. Quick initial reconnaissance to provide assessment of installation damage after an attack is a
      key part of recovery. All base personnel and organizations have a responsibility to report to the EOC,
      through their respective control centers, any facility damage, casualties, suspected contamination, and
      unexploded ordnance within and around their specific areas. Ea ch organization should identify and
      train specific damage reconnaissance personnel for this purpose. Whil e base organizations report
      damage in and around their immediate areas, DATs assigned to the EOC perform damage assessment
      in specific areas, such as airfield surfaces.
      A2.2.2. Airfield damage assessment team man ning normally involves on e engineering technician
      (3E5X1), one EOD technician (3 E8X1), and one or two augmente es (any AFS). These teams, under
      the EOC direction, should survey the runways and taxiways using pre-assigned routes. The engineer-
      ing technician will determ ine the location and size of craters and s palls while the EOD techn icians
      will identify UXO by type, location, and, when po ssible, by fuse. Genera lly, the augmentee will be
      trained as a driver/observer and wi ll serve as a data recorder. The team uses a grid-reference sys tem
      and available visual references , such as prepositioned pavement re ference markers, runway distance
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              161


   markers, centerline, runway edge, taxiway locations , runway light s, etc., to estima te the location of
   damage and UXO. The team also monitors vehicle-mounted detectors and M-8 paper for the presence
   of chemical agents. During this damage assessment period, spe ed is of the essence. All findings
   uncovered by the team are immediately passed onto the EOC. Damage assessment procedural details
   are presented in Chapter 2 of this volume.

A2.3. MOS Selection. The EOC receives the damage information by radi o, telephone, or runner; and
plots the data on the MOS selection maps. Key MOS selection elements are plotting data, selecting the
MOS, designating damage to repair, designating the area to clear of UXO, assigning RQC, and estimating
recovery time. Damage plotting and MOS selection are usually accomplished simultaneously . Repair
quality criteria are normall y accomplished after MOS candidates have been ascertained. The damage to
repair then may be worked with charts containing aircraft loading information and RQC for the appropri-
ate aircraft. This information is used to determine the minimum acceptable repair qualities for each crater,
depending on the crater ’s location, length, and spacing. The MOS is se lected and recommended to the
wing commander for approval. Af ter MOS selection is approved, the EOC passe s MOS loca tion and
repair instructions through the engineer DCC to the ADR OIC who makes appropriate team assignments.
The EOC also will direct UXO teams to begin sa fing and clearing the selected MOS. Details regarding
MOS selection procedures are presented in Chapter 3 of this volume.

A2.4. UXO Safing/Removal. Various render-safe procedures w ill be used to ne utralize UXO on the
MOS, access routes, and near the repair areas. Large UXO and some sub munitions may be attacked with
the standoff munition disrupter (S MUD) technique, if possible; othe rwise, manual procedures will be
used.
   A2.4.1. Buried UXO, identified by an entrance hole with no ac companying upheaval, usually will
   remain undisturbed, depending on the situation and location. Holes of entry and camouflets normally
   will be filled or covered on the MOS or access routes. These will be recorder and the ordnance will be
   attended to as operations permit.
   A2.4.2. Removing the safed UXO is accomplished by bomb-removal teams who haul or drag the
   UXO to a designated holding area(s).
   A2.4.3. At best, UXO sa fing is dangerous and time-consuming, but it mu st be conducted before
   beginning repair operations. Unexploded explosive ordnance removal can and, in many instances, will
   be conducted in conjun ction with ADR operations. The UXO te ams should concentrate their initial
   efforts on the access routes and areas immediately adjacent to the cr aters and spalls, so repair teams
   can begin work as soon as possible. During repair operations, at least one UXO safing crew will be
   available in the repair area to support ADR in case UXO are uncovered during crater excavation, or
   discovered in the crater or debr is. In such situations, personnel and equipment will move away from
   the crater area, and the EOC will be notified. The EOC will dispatch the nearest UXO team to mini-
   mize repair delay.

A2.5. MOS Layout. Identification of an undamaged us able MOS that is immediately available will
require outlining and marking with temporary MOS markers to desi gnate its boundaries. However , if
MOS damage requires repairs, the MOS may still need outlining to identify boundaries for repair crews.
The MOS marking team’s first step is to locate the MOS centerline references. A MOS centerline is then
marked with traffic cones or paint. The MOS edges are established by measuring from the centerline, and

an outline is laid using portable edge markers. Details regarding MOS layout are included in TO 35E2-6-1
and AFH 10-222, Volume 16.

A2.6. Crater Repair. FFM is the primary FOD cover for all MOS repairs. Use AM-2 matting only on taxi-
ways unless FFM is not av ailable for MOS repairs. Ext ensive spacing between patches is required and
transitional ramps are a must if AM -2 caps the MOS re pairs. Procedural details regarding both systems
are included in T.O.s 35E2-5-1, Crushed-Stone Crater Repair and Line-Of-Sight Profile Measurement for
Rapid Runway Repair, 35E2-2-7, AM-2 Landing Mat and Accessories, and 35E2-3-1, Folded Fiberglass
Mats for Rapid Runway Repair.
NOTE: Foreign object damage covers ar e not currently approved for C- 17 Globemaster, C-5 Galaxy,
C-141 Starlifter, KC-10 Extender, and KC-135 Stratotanker operations (see paragraph 10.4.).
      A2.6.1. FFM FOD Cover Method. A FEL, excavator, or grader will clear debris from around the cra-
      ter and then extent of upheaval measured and mark ed using the line-of-sigh t technique. Upheaval is
      broken from the crater lip by creating a break line wi th the moil point attached to the e xcavator. The
      fractured pavement is removed using the excavator bucket attachment, dozer, or FEL. Next, an inter-
      mediate profile measurement is performed to ensure all upheav al pavement was removed. The crater
      is then backfilled w ith debris if conditions are dry or w ith ballast rock and a geotextile membrane if
      wet, and topped with cr ushed stone. A vibratory roller compacts the fill and a grader then grades it
      level with the surrounding paveme nt. The team chief designates a mat delivery and assembly team
      that concurrently assemble s the mat near t he crater, having it ready when crater repair is complete.
      The team ens ures the crater repair does not exceed RQC limits with a final crater profile measure-
      ment. The last step is to cap the repair by towing the folded fiberglass mat over the repair and anchor-
      ing it in place.
      A2.6.2. AM-2 FOD Cover Method . When cappi ng a crater wi th an AM-2 FOD cover , the crater
      repair procedures are the same as those outlined for the FFM above.An AM-2 FOD cover is not likely
      used on the MOS because of a tran sitional bounce problem created by aircraft traffic. AM-2 matting
      will more commonly cover taxiway cr ater damage. Here, repair criterion is not nearly as stringent as
      that for a MOS. According to the RQC technical manual (35E2-4-1), a taxiway crater repair can have
      up to 6 inches of “bump” and a maximum 2-inch sag for fighters an d a 3-inch sag for heavy aircraft
      operations not exceeding 5 knots. Other procedural differences involved in taxiway repair include:
         A2.6.2.1. Anchoring AM-2 matting may not be necessary on taxiwa y repairs unless at pivot and
         brake points.
         A2.6.2.2. Often, the actual patch is reduced to a width of only 30 feet.
         A2.6.2.3. Aircraft braking over the patch should be avoided as much as possible.
         A2.6.2.4. A taxiway patch can be constructed with or without a key lock.
         A2.6.2.5. AM-2 matting can be employed as a tran sitional taxiway when damage to the original
         taxiway is extensive.
NOTE: A new rapid ramp expansion kit designed to re place AM-2 matting is under development. The
intent of this effort is to produce a much lighter and thinner mat that has comparable strength to the orig-
inal AM-2 product and requires less maintenance. If the composite mat research and development ef fort
is successful, the new system would prove effective for the construction of expedient landing strips, air-
craft parking ramps, and other projects that require covering of a large surface.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                              163


A2.7. Spall Repair. Compressed air blows small debris and moisture from the spall. Rapid-setting mate-
rial is hand mixed according to ma nufactures instructions and poured into each spall, and then leveled
with a trowel. A bonding agent may be necessary beforeadding the rapid-setting material. Pea gravel may
be suitable as an extender if authorized by manufac turers’ instructions. The mixture should support air-
craft operations within minutes. UFC 3-270-07 contains detailed spall repair procedures.

A2.8. MAAS Installation. The MAAS provides a capability for relatively quick arresting system installa-
tion configured on a soil or paved surface. Under ideal conditions, the MAAS can arrest an aircraft every
3 to 5 minutes. The MAAS installation team usually concurrently installs the arresting system with crater
repair operations. Procedural details regarding MAAS installation are contained in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1 and
AFH 10-222, Volume 8.

A2.9. Debris Clearance and Sweeping. While repairs are being completed, undamaged areas of the MOS
and access taxiways are cleared and swept of fragments and debris . As soon as repairs are completed,
FELs and graders clear remaining heavy debris on the MOS. Dozers and FELs level the cleared debris so
it is no closer than 25 f eet from the edge of th e MOS and no higher than 3 feet. Graders, front-mounted
sweepers, or vacuum sweepers clear the remaining foreign object damage material.

A2.10. MOS Marking. The MOS must be marked suf ficiently to identify at least the thresholds, center-
line, edges, and remaining distances. A paint machine, edge markers, distance-to-go markers, and arrest-
ing system markers are included as part of the MOS marking system. The MOS marking team must work
at a speed that allows completion of all marking shortly after the last MOS crater repair. This effort must
also include obliteration of any orig inal runway markings no longer usable. T.O. 35E2-6-1 and AFH
10-222, Volume 16, contain MOS marking procedures.

A2.11. Airfield Lighting. The EALS provides temporary lighting for ADR. When possible, disperse the
system as part of preatta ck activities. Once the a ttack is over, move the EA LS trailers with other ADR
assets to the staging area. Factors such as UXO clearance, night versus daytime operations, and MOS lay-
out will directly impact the start of the EALS installation. However, the airfield lighting team should plan
to have the EALS operational when the MOS is ready to support aircra ft generation. To accomplish this,
initial installation may have to commence about 25 to 75 feet off the edge of the MOS. Once debris clear-
ance is complete, relocate and an chor the assembled lights and wires into th eir proper position 4-10 feet
off the MOS edge. Procedural deta ils regarding EALS installation are included in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1 and
AFH 10-222, Volume 7.

NOTES:
1. Many of the activities listed should overlap during actual ADR operations--this checklist is meant to
   provide a general orde r for these activities. Deta iled folded fiberglass mat installation procedures
   are outlined in TO 35E2-3-1 and UFC 3-270-07.
2. Though the ADR concrete cutting sa ws were primarily procured for the now obsolete concrete slab
   repair technique, they can be effectively employed in both the AM-2 and fiberglass crater repair pro-
   cedure in certain circums tances. An example of the saws usefulness is when there is a s hortage of
   available excavators, the ADR concrete saws can make heaved lip removal much easier and faster
   for the substitute FELs by scoring the heaved material to be removed.

NOTES:
1. Matting is usually loaded on a “lowboy” or the 22-ton tilt trailer.
2. The assembly location must be swept of all loose debris. Furthermore, the assembly area should be
   located as near as possible to the crater that the patch is to be used on, but far enough out of the way
   as to not cause interference with crater repair activities.
3. For ease of installation, bundles should be spaced to minimize walking. T o do this, the bundles
   located closest to the keylock are positioned 10 feet from the keylock; all subsequent bundles should
   be spaced at 8-foot intervals.

   HINT: Always place the first two bun dles on the long (2 0-row) side. Al so, place bun dles with
   female lip towards the keylock. To ease the removal of metal strapping and end-plates and preclude
   damaging the bottom mat during placement, set bundles on wooden dunnage.

4. When working with standard tubes, use one long and five short mandrel connectors on each side of
   the keylock. However, when working with reverse tubes, use two long and four short mandrel con-
   nectors on each side of the keylock.
5. Starter tubes are 1-inch shorter than standard tubes and do not have a hole for installation of a tow-
   ing clamp. Tubes on the left side of the keylock will have the prongs facing outside the mat and are
   rotated 180 degrees to install locking bars. Whereas, tubes on the right side of the keylock will have
   prongs facing inward toward the mat and are rota ted 180 degrees before in stalling a locking bar in
   the previous row.
6. It is important that the first row is straight on the keylock—double check to be sure.
7. This alternating procedure prevents the joining seams of one row from be ing aligned with those of
   an adjacent row. Once the second row is properly placed, install a locking bar in the same manner as
   was accomplished in the first row.
8. Once a three row buffer has been established, alternate removing and adding T-Spacers between the
   oldest and newest rows of matting. This additi on/deletion procedure is conducted on both the long
   and short sides of the keylock.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
1. AM-2 mats are packaged in pallets (bundles) for storage and shipping. Each AM-2 bundle contains
   16 full sheets and 4 half sheets.
2. The matting contained in one bundle of AM-2 matting will provide 4 rows (8 feet in length) on a
   standard AM-2 FOD cover. A standard patch is 54 feet wide x 77 feet 6 inches long.
3. Keylock sections are fastened together using keylock connectors and associated bolts.
4. Tow clamps provided with the kit are used for side pulling. A locally fabricated pull assembly built
   from a piece of AM-2 matting or commercial version (Pull Fixture) must be used for an end pull.

NOTES:
1. Matting is usually loaded on a “l owboy” or the 22-ton til t trailer. Use two forklifts to load (and
   unload) mat assembly onto trailer. Forks should be long enough to support width of mat assembly .
   Dunnage is required under and between mat assemblies.
2. The mat assembly area can be any area near the crater repair. This area must be cleared of all debris
   and swept. It must be lar ge enough to accommodate the unfolding of both ma ts, allow equipment
   operations around the mat, and not interfere with crater repair activities. This area should be
   approximately 100 foot by 100 foot square, and located a minimum of 100 foot from the crater.
3. Attach nylon straps by inserting shovel point under edge of mat panel.
4. Resin flaking at the mat hinge can occur and create a FOD problem with mats procured from the ini-
   tial manufacturing techniques. On e pass with a vibratory roller down each hinge, followed by a
   sweeper, normally loosens and removes the flaking material from the hinges.
5. Any debris picked up under the mat while towing could damage the matting and af fect smoothness
   of the repair.
6. The mat should not be more than 5 degrees off parallel.
7. The three different anchoring surface types are concrete, asphalt over concrete, and asphalt

NOTES:
1. Kick each bushing on right side while walking over it. If the bolts are loose, this shoe-to-hardware
contact will cause a counterclockwise motion of the bolt and/or bushing.
Notes continued on next page.
AFPAM10-219V4 28 MAY 2008                                                                                  177


2. Any damage or deterioration that allows crater repair material/FOD to escape to the top of the mat
shall be cause to halt flight operations. Mat must be removed for replacement or repair in accordance
with the appropriate maintenance section in TO 35E2-3-1.
3. When a new mat is placed over a crater, the inspection sequence will start again.
4. If sealer has recently been applied to aircraft operating surface, raise mat edges to break the mat free
from sealer before towing mat. Failure to do so may cause damage to mat.
5. In most cases, replacing a damaged mat with a new or previously repaired mat is quicker than making
a repair. The damaged mat can be towed to another location for repair.
6. Ensure that all new holes are drilled in sound pavement.
7. Do not tighten anchor bolts in polymer plugs as a damage hazard could be created. If obvious
loosening of bolts has occurred, the bolts should be removed, holes drilled, and new anchor bolts
installed.
8. A loose bolt is not a hazard unless it creates a tire-cutting hazard, or allows jet blast to lift the mat
sufficiently to create a FOD hazard.
9. The only limit to how many bolts can be added is the area of sound pavement beneath the mat.
Although it is desirable to locate a new bolt in line with the original bolt, it also can be placed inside the
original bolt (toward the crater) if sufficient sound pavement exists. The bolt must also be at least 6
inches from the mat edge, the edge of the pavement and at least 1 foot from the crater edge.
