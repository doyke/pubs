from LMR systems are fixed radio-alarm monitoring systems and low power systems as defined
in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-118, Radio Frequency Spectrum Management. For definition
of terms, see Attachment 1.

                             PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:

3.1. Frequency Assignments - the allowance for an LMR network does not include
frequency assignment. Frequencies will be assigned according to AFI 33-118 and must be
assigned before purchasing radios requiring a new frequency. Organizations requiring a new
radio frequency will contact the base frequency manager before submitting WOMS request or
AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, for LMRs. Frequencies will be shared, when
possible.
3.2. The equipment custodian will submit requirements through the 92 CS/SCOS (509-
247-1124). WOMS, C4 Systems Requirement Document, and AF Form 601/AF Form 9 will
be used for upgrades, new requirements, and replacement requirements not previously validated
in the base 5 year replacement program. Only an AF Form 601/AF Form 9 is required for
replacement requirements that have been previously validated in the 5-year replacement plan.
   3.2.1. Department of Defense (DD) Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition
   System Document, used to ensure sufficient data is available for base supply/contracting to
   procure proper LMR equipment and supplies.
   3.2.2. AF Form 9, used to purchase LMR equipment directly from the vendor through the
   base contracting squadron.
   3.2.3. AF Form 601, used to purchase LMR equipment through the standard base supply
   system (SBSS).
   3.2.4. AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-in Request, used for requesting expendable equipment or
   supply items.
   3.2.5. WOMS.
3.3. The CSO or designated representative will evaluate each request for standardization,
technical adequacy and compatibility, and cost effectiveness. All new requirements will be
engineered to fulfill the requirements stated in WOMS. If the requirement will be approved at
base level, engineering is the responsibility of the 92 CS/SCOS. Requirements to be validated at
base level and forwarded to the host MAJCOM or higher will include preliminary engineering
documentation. This documentation should include such things as antenna gain, transmit and
receive frequency power output, site elevation above mean sea level, antenna height above
ground , and power and frequency of antennas to have co-located with other LMR equipment.
3.4. The 92 CS/SCOS-A and 92 CS/SCOT offices will continually analyze local LMR
requirements and ensure local procedures restrict acquisition of LMR equipment to
mission-essential requirements. No equipment will be procured or added to existing LMR nets
without proper need and justification. The base CSO will validate, approve, or disapprove LMR
requirements.
   3.4.1. Replacement requirements are approved by the CSO. The PWCS equipment
   custodian will submit WOMS request to 92 CS/SCOS-A. The requiring unit must provide
   funding for LMR assets. The unit resource advisor will place a funds availability statement
   on the AF Form 601/AF Form 9 prior to submitting to the 92 CS/SCOS.

                                      OPERATIONS

4.1. LMR nets will be operated in accordance with Allied Communications Publication
(ACP) 125, Communications Instructions-Telephone Procedures. Transmission should always
be brief, concise and accurate. Operating procedures in ACP 125 and AFKAO-1, USAF Voice
Call-Sign Instructions, will be used.
4.2. Net impairment can be caused by equipment failure. Report problems to the PWCS
equipment custodians, Communications Focal Point or 92 CS/SCOS for diagnosis prior to SIR
reporting.
4.3. LMRs are extremely vulnerable to interception by third parties. All users must follow
proper INFOSEC techniques. Never discuss classified information on any LMR other than
those using Type 1 encryption. Some of our nets require protection of information by Data
Encryption Standard (DES). The DES equipment will be used to protect sensitive, but
unclassified, national security-related information. It cannot be used to protect classified
transmissions.
4.4. LMRs, other than intrinsically safe LMRs, should not be used in or near hazardous
operating areas, such as aircraft alert areas; munitions storage and handling areas;
petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) refueling zones; and other areas outlined in AFMAN
91-201, Explosive Safety Standards. Only intrinsically safe certified, operated, maintained,
and marked LMRs will be operated within 50 feet of fuel or refuel environments.
4.5. A Citizens Band radio is a citizen's service and should not be used to conduct official
government business. The use of Citizens Band radio by the AF is generally not authorized.

                                       LMR CALL SIGNS

5.1. LMR call signs will be used IAW AFI 33-217.
   5.1.1. Use a spoken English language dictionary word as the basic call sign with a single- or
   two-digit suffix. Aircraft call signs are restricted to four- to six-letter words; other call signs
   use one or two words with a maximum of 15 characters. Air Force Cryptological Aids
   Operations (AFKAO-1)(H) and Voice Call Sign List Instructions (VCSLI), Annex A, permit
   certain minor deviations.
   5.1.2. Use Voice Call Signs (VCS)s to identify military aircraft, organizations, activities,
   bases, units, operational facilities, staff personnel, and geographical locations when
   establishing and maintaining voice communications.
   5.1.3. Use changing call signs to the maximum extent practicable to enhance the security of
   AF operations.
   5.1.4. Direct the mandatory use of changing call signs for classified operations and missions;
   during exercises and contingency operations; and while conducting research, and
   development testing and evaluation programs.
   5.1.5. DO NOT use the term "Air Force" (e.g., "Air Force One," "Air Force Rescue," etc.) or
   the acronym of a MAJCOM’s name, or any other acronym, abbreviation, or phonetic
   alphabet as a call sign prefix except as specifically authorized in AFKAO-1(H) and VCSLI.
   NOTE: Commanders must ensure operations security is considered before requesting static
   call sign assignments or other unchanging variations outlined in AFKAO-1(H) and VCSLI,
   Annex A, instead of changing call signs (see AFI 10-1101, Operations Security (OPSEC)).
   5.1.6. Submit call sign requests only to meet mission requirements.
   5.1.7. Coordinate with the Air Force Voice Call Sign Program Management Office
   (VCSPMO) if an unusual circumstance dictates obtaining a call sign from the FAA.
5.2. 92 CS/SCOS-A will have the final saying in approval/disapproval of all call sign
