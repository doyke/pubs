SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 16-603 by (1) adding the Waiver Authority Statement and Tier
waiver guidance from AFI 33-360 in the opening paragraph and (2) adding tier waiver authority
markings for each requirement mandated for compliance at the Wing level in accordance with
AFI 33-360. In addition, it updates MAJCOM requirements to allow MAJCOM Supplements in
place of Implementation and Compliance Plans. Finally, Wing-level training was changed from
suggested to mandatory, and six Wing-level TCO training tasks were eliminated in deference to
current HQ USAF and MAJCOM training guidance for TCOs.
