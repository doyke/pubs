1. RESPONSIBILITIES.
   1.1. The 512 AW Commander and subordinate squadron commanders will continually
   screen their assigned personnel in order to recognize outstanding support of the wing
   mission.
   1.2. Discretion and judgment will be exercised in the issuance of these awards to preclude
   the degradation of the recognition factor and to preserve their integrity. However, these
   awards can and should be used as a medium for expressing recognition for a “job-well-done”
   that is less formal and more personal than other existing awards.
2. AWARD CRITERIA.

    2.1. Military personnel and civilian employees are eligible to receive the Mission
    Accomplishment Award.
       2.1.1. Non-DoD personnel are not authorized to receive this type of award.
    2.2. Award Criteria:
       2.2.1. The award items may be issued for work above and beyond the call of duty. Such
       work may be outside one’s routine job description, for performing one’s duties in an
       exceptional manner and as an informal reward for successful accomplishment of a
       particular program, function or mission.
       2.2.2. The award items may be issued as a token of thanks to recognize those agencies
       and individuals who perform selfless acts of benefit to the wing, service and/or the
       community.
       2.2.3. The award items will not be used for special incentive programs, motivation
       awards, mementos or signifying membership in an organization or squadron.
       2.2.4. The award items may be issued for completion of specific mission
       accomplishment milestones.
       2.2.5. Award items may be purchased with appropriated funds as authorized by AFI 65-
       601, Volume 1, Chapter 4, Budget and Guidance Procedures.
           2.2.5.1. Awards may include trophies, plaques, emblems, certificates, organizational
           coins and similar items that are clearly designed for display purposes.
           2.2.5.2. Items of utilitarian nature, having intrinsic value such as brief cases, coffee
           mugs, key chains, ashtrays, luggage tags and similar items are not authorized to be
           purchased with appropriated funds.
       2.2.6. Since these types of awards are intended to be informal recognitions, personalizing
       the award items by including the presenter’s name is prohibited. If the presenter feels the
       award item should be further embellished with his or her name engraved, it should be
       done with personal or private fund, not appropriated dollars.
3. MAINTENANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
    3.1. Commanders may purchase a reasonable supply of an award item to ensure availability
    when needed and to realize a cost savings for buying in quantity.
    3.2. All items must be secured and must be inventoried periodically, as needed to support the
    frequency of issue.
    3.3. A record of issuance must be maintained. This record will include the name of the
    recipient and the date reason for issuance. The record must be made available for audit by
    the wing financial analysis office, upon request.
