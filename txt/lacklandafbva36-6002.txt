ARE YOU SURE?




       A person cannot consent to sexual relations if he or she is
    asleep, intoxicated or underage. You can’t coerce consent.
    Know the law and ask yourself…

      Do I really have consent? What does the law say?
                        What would my partner say?

For more information about sexual assault and consent, please call our confidential hotline at 671-SARC.
