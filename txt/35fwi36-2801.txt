they held during the majority of the award period.
4.4. Annual award winners must have one year of retainability in the Air Force.
NOTE: Annual award nominations need to explicitly capture the “whole person, whole career”
concept. Individuals selected as 35 FW annual award winners will be forwarded to PACAF for
consideration at the MAJCOM Level (their entire career may be scrutinized). Enlisted winners
(including first sergeants) will compete at AF level as part of the 12 OAY program.
5. Nomination Procedures
     5.1. The five award periods are based upon a calendar year (1 Jan through 31 Dec). The
     award periods are as follows: 1st quarter, 1 Jan through 31 Mar; 2d quarter, 1 Apr through
     30 Jun; 3d quarter, 1 Jul through 30 Sep; 4th quarter, 1 Oct through 31 Dec; and annual, 1
     Jan through 31 Dec.
     5.2. All quarterly and annual packages flow from individual squadron/FW staff agencies,
     through the group or staff agency boards, to the wing board.
     5.3. Groups and staff agencies may submit one nominee per category for the quarterly and
     annual awards.
     5.4. Submit specific accomplishments for the award period on the latest version of AF Form
     1206, Nomination for Award, using the following guidelines:
        5.4.1. Bullets will start on the line below the category; do not add superfluous
        information after the category heading.
        5.4.2. For quarterly awards there are no restrictions to the number of lines per category,
        but the total cannot exceed 15 lines (excluding category headings).
        5.4.3. For annual awards use no more than 27 lines (excluding category headings).
        5.4.4. Use the following three categories for quarterly and annual awards:
            5.4.4.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. Describe significant
            leadership accomplishments and how well the member performed assigned primary
            and additional duties. Define the scope and level of responsibilities and the impact on
            the mission and unit.
NOTE: This category is the foundation for any quarterly or annual award and should focus on
exceptional job performance and contribution to the mission. While not weighted heavier than
the other two categories, a package that does not CLEARLY demonstrate superior job
performance and leadership in primary duties should not be considered as competitive.
            5.4.4.2. Significant Self-Improvement. Include on and off duty education, PME,
            formal training or any other activity the member undertook to improve their own
            knowledge or abilities. Consider only improvements that were made during the
            award period.

          5.4.4.3. Base or Community Involvement. Define the scope and impact of the
          member’s positive leadership and involvement in both the military and civilian
          community. Primary duty accomplishments should not be considered unless they
          clearly support the community.
      5.4.5. Submit packages in accordance with Attachment 1, How to Submit Packages,
      however, also ensure that all requirements from AFI36-2805 and AFI36-
      2805_PACAFSUP1 have been met.
   5.5. The 35 FW/CCC is responsible for the enlisted categories. The 35 FW/DS is

      member will serve as board president. All annual enlisted boards will consist of the 35
      FW/CCC, and all group and tenant unit superintendents or their designee. Group and
      tenant unit representatives and the wing staff POC will provide name, rank, duty section,

      6.1.3. The board president conducts and controls the board, ensuring board members are
      judging packages without prejudice or favoritism. Board members must read and score

      6.1.4. The board president will compile the rankings from each board member’s sheet.
      Board members will break their own individual ties. Once the rankings are compiled the
      board president will screen for significant disagreements (a difference of more than
      two in rankings on a nominee). Significant disagreements that could affect the overall
      outcome of the boards will be discussed among the members who are in disagreement. If
      the significant disagreement cannot be resolved, the board president will make the final
      decision on the rankings.

        6.2.2. Each board member and chairperson will score the AF Form 1206, using, 35 FW
        Form 42, taking into consideration the whole-person concept, then rack and stack in rank
        order (i.e., #1, #2, #3, #4 and so forth) prior to board start time. The board president will
        break all ties.
     6.3. Civilian Board Composition and Scoring

        representative from each 35 FW group, 35 FW staff and 373 ISRG. The board president

        members will be Lt Cols, preferably deputy group commanders. Exceptions are made by
        the board president only.
        6.3.2. Each board member will score the AF Form 1206, using, 35 FW Form 42, taking
        into consideration the whole-person concept, for quarterly packages only. Yearly

8. Functional awards, special awards and trophies
     8.1. Functional awards requiring 35 FW/CC endorsement will be routed through the normal
     wing coordination and returned to the unit for submittal, once approved. Awards not
     requiring 35 FW/CC endorsement will be routed through the respective group commander.
     8.2. Special awards and trophies typically require 35 FW/CC endorsement and will be routed
     through the normal wing coordination cycle. Wing suspense date will be two weeks prior to
     HQ PACAF’s ( or 5AF’s, when applicable) suspense or one month prior to AF suspense,
     whichever is earlier, unless otherwise directed; see 35 FW SharePoint site
     https://misawa.eim.pacaf.af.mil/35FW/default.aspx Awards Information, for a listing of
     functional awards, special awards and trophies. NOTE: All civilian functional awards,
     special awards, and trophies involving civilian member recipients will be coordinated
     through 35 MSG/DD prior to being submitted to the 35 FW/CC for endorsement.
     8.3. 35 FW/DS will compile packages for wing special awards and trophy nominees from
     among group nominees and provide them to 35 FW/CV and 35 FW/CCC for review and
     recommendation. 35 FW/CC is the final decision-making authority in all cases. 35 FW/DS
     or their designated representative will compile final packages for submittal to 35 FW/CV to
     HHQ through normal wing correspondence.

  winning packages from other units and wing nominee packages as provided.
