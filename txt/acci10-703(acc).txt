This instruction implements AFPD 10-7, Information Operations and CJCSI 8910.01A, Joint Blue Force
Situational Awareness Operations Guidance. This instruction provides guidance for protecting and con-
trolling Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability (including hardware, software, data and networks) for
Combat Air Forces (CAF) units. CAF units are all units assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC), as
well as fighter, attack, combat search and rescue, command control intelligence surveillance reconnais-
sance and bomber units assigned to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE). It applies to all ACC, USAFE, and PACAF units, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units
under ACC oversight, and Air National Guard (ANG) units that operate and maintain BFT devices. Main-
tain records created as a result of prescribed processes IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records,

1. Introduction.
   1.1. Background. Blue Force Tracking describes Department of Defense programs that provide sys-
   tems for locating, tracking and determining the status of blue (US, allied, coalition) forces. BFT sys-
   tems are part of the larger Blue Force Situational Awareness (BFSA) concept. These systems use
   Global Positioning System (GPS) to calculate the BFT device position and transmit that information
   to space-based, airborne, and ground-based receivers. Fielded forces and commanders at Command
   and Control (C2) nodes receive the data through a Tactical Display Processor (TDP), SIPRNET or
2                                                                         ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008


    Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC). Some BFT devices also can send limited status
    and intention information via brevity codes.
    1.2. Objectives. This instruction provides guidance to ACC units on protection of information asso-
    ciated with BFT and proper control and accounting of BFT devices. Because of the sensitive nature of
    BFT technology, and the potential danger to all Service personnel should sensitive BFT information
    be compromised, ACC personnel must protect BFT devices and information. Currently, the only ACC
    forces that use BFT devices are combat search and rescue (CSAR) forces. This instruction provides
    guidance to those forces issued BFT devices from ACC, including PACAF, USAFE, ANG, and AFRC
    CSAR forces.
    1.3. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) BFT Device. ACC CSAR forces use the Mayer Minia-
    ture Transmitter (MTX). The MTX is a US-controlled device incorporating sensitive technologies.
    Currently, ACC units use MTXs to aid in C2, prevent fratricide and provide situational awareness.
    Additionally, CSAR forces use BFT information in the tactical environment to execute CSAR mis-
    sions. BFT is an integral part of CSAR operations.

2. Device Accountability and Security Protection Requirements.
    2.1. General. Some BFT devices utilize highly sensitive technologies and contain cryptographic
    keys. The MTX is an unclassified device but contains sensitive technology. The following paragraphs
    outline BFT device accountability requirements and responsibilities. MTXs must be stored in a phys-
    ically controlled area and accounted for in storage as “sensitive items”. Refer to the Collection of
    Broadcasts from Remote Assets (COBRA) Operational Support Message #3 for more details on MTX
    security and accountability, found on the Mission Management Center (MMC) web site. MMC con-
    tact information is provided in paragraph 2.5.
       2.1.1. The current ACC CSAR BFT device (the MTX), National Stock Number (NSN)
       5820-01-545-6448, is a serially controlled and accountable item. The Government Controlling
       Authority must grant buyer approval prior to purchase of an MTX unit. Units interested in obtain-
       ing additional/replacement MTXs should contact ACC/A3CS for guidance through their Wing/
       Group BFT Point of Contact (POC).
       2.1.2. Shipping. The only approved carriers for the MTX are Federal Express® and DHL. When
       shipping MTX units within the continental United States (CONUS) they will be sent Federal
       Express® or DHL next day as a minimum. They should be shipped Monday through Thursday
       and not on Friday. Senders should always call the receiving end on the day the shipment is due to
       verify receipt. If the MTX unit is going outside of the CONUS, these CONUS precautions apply
       with the added constraint of extended shipping times. If at all possible, ship MTX units via official
       pouch system. If the MTX unit is going to or coming from an overseas remote location where Fed-
       eral Express®, DHL, or official pouch services are not available, it must be hand-carried.
    2.2. BFT Device Accountability.
       2.2.1. Since MTX devices are an accountable, equipment item, units will track MTX devices on
       their Custodian Authorization / Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) using allowance source code
       (ASC) 049ABFT. To do this, the custodians need to have their Supply Customer Service area create
       a detail on their account with ASC 049ABFT and total quantity on hand for NSN
       5820-01-545-6448. This equipment is not tied to any UTC, but may be put on a mobility account.
ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008                                                                             3


     The authorized amount is based on how many MTXs a unit has on hand and not how many aircraft
     or crews it has.
     2.2.2. Units will not transfer or loan BFT devices between other units without prior approval from
     ACC/A3CS. For both permanent transfers and loans, units will follow accountability guidance in
     AFMAN 23-110, “USAF Supply Manual”, Volume 2, Part 13.
  2.3. Responsibilities and Tasks for Device Control:
     2.3.1. HQ ACC/A3CS will:
         2.3.1.1. Maintain a database of all ACC CSAR MTXs. The database will include: program-
         ming information associated with each BFT device, unit issued the BFT, current location of
         the BFT and other information as needed. This database will provide the MAJCOM and
         deployed BFT managers with crucial information on ACC’s BFT devices. Reporting informa-
         tion from the field will be managed in accordance with report control symbol (RCS): ACC/
         A3CS(AR)0801, BLUE FORCE Device Tracking. New records are not established with these
         reporting instructions.
         2.3.1.2. Provide BFT training and instruction materials to ACC units when devices are issued
         and on an as needed basis thereafter.
         2.3.1.3. Report compromised, missing or destroyed BFTs to the MMC.
         2.3.1.4. Act as the command’s Officer of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for CSAR BFT

         2.3.1.5. Act as the command’s OPR for requests for new or replacement BFT devices.
         2.3.1.6. Coordinate with ACC/A8YA (A4YA) for any request ACC/A3CS receives for BFT
         installations on ACC aircraft.
         2.3.1.7. Maintain a record of device transfers between ACC units.
         2.3.1.8. Provide units information on the process to repair malfunctioning or failed BFT
         equipment and coordinate replacement if needed.
         2.3.1.9. Maintain a website for distribution of BFT information.
         2.3.1.10. Act as liaison to the National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) and the MMC for
         all CSAR units.
     2.3.2. HQ ACC/A8YA (A4YA) will:
         2.3.2.1. Coordinate and manage all installations of new or replacement Kit-As for BFTs on
         ACC aircraft.
         2.3.2.2. Forward all information regarding installation or removal of BFT T-1 modifications
         on ACC aircraft (to include unit, type aircraft, and tail number) to ACC/A3CS.
     2.3.3. ACC units at home station in coordination with their Wing/Group BFT POC will (Note:
     deployed units will work through their home station):
         2.3.3.1. Appoint a BFT primary and alternate POC via memorandum to ACC/A3CS via
         NIPRNET e-mail. BFT POCs must have a SIPRNET account and access to a secure phone.
4                                                                         ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008


          2.3.3.2. Maintain accountability of their BFT devices on a CA/CRL as outlined in paragraph
          2.2.1.
          2.3.3.3. Report inoperative, malfunctioning, missing or destroyed BFTs to ACC/A3CS via
          SIPRNET e-mail within two duty days.
          2.3.3.4. Report compromised BFTs via SIPRNET e-mail to the MMC and inform ACC/A3CS
          within 24 hours.
          2.3.3.5. Notify ACC/A3CS when BFT devices are involved in mishaps or suspected to be
          involved in mishaps. Notification must occur within two duty days of the mishap. Make every
          effort to recover BFT devices involved in mishaps. Provide ACC/A3CS recovered BFT
          devices or destruction notification if devices are destroyed. Destruction notification must
          occur within two duty days of determination that the devices are destroyed.
          2.3.3.6. Maintain the MTX device in good repair IAW MTX Owner’s Manual, and return
          inoperative or malfunctioning BFTs to General Dynamics for repair using unit funds. Units
          may use the Government Wide Purchase Card (GPC) if the cost falls within allowable limits.
          2.3.3.7. Report all aircraft T-1 BFT Kit modifications to ACC/A8YA /A4YA.
          2.3.3.8. Designate via Memorandum for Record your unit BFT POC to ACC/A3CS for
          administrative purposes and 24 hour emergency/911 contact info. Currently, the theater Joint
          Personnel Recovery Centers are the focal point for the MMC to contact in the event of a “911”
          activation. Units may want to designate their command post or similar function within their
          unit as the secondary 24 hr contact point.
          2.3.3.9. Notify ACC/A3CS when MTX devices are being deployed to a theater of operations.
          One week prior to deployment, notify ACC/A3CS via SIPRNET e-mail of the following: unit,
          serial #s to be deployed, location of deployment and/or geographic area of operations, time-
          frame expected for deployment and mission design series type. Subsequently, upon redeploy-
          ment to the home base, notify ACC/A3CS of the same information.
          2.3.3.10. Install BFT devices as a T-1 aircraft modification only as tested and approved by the
          System Program Office (SPO). Approved modifications can be viewed on the CSAR C2 CoP.
          2.3.3.11. Contact ACC/A3CS before contacting the NRO or MMC.
          2.3.3.12. Refer to Attachment 2 for a snapshot of reporting events and timelines.
    2.4. Exercises and Training.
       2.4.1. For exercises and tests where the user is directed to use a different frequency other than the
       one to which their MTXs are programmed (e.g. DESERT RESCUE, JFEXs, etc), the user must
       contact ACC/A3CS (via SIPRNET message) a minimum of 1 month prior to the exercise with the
       following information. ACC/A3CS will build a file to reprogram the MTXs and forward it to the
       unit(s) requiring the change. The request must state the following:
          2.4.1.1. MTX serial numbers requiring change (e.g. MTX XXXXXX).
          2.4.1.2. Operation supported/Theater where MTXs will be operated.
          2.4.1.3. Geographic coverage requirements.
          2.4.1.4. Dates and time periods for coverage.
ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008                                                                                5


          2.4.1.5. POC.
      2.4.2. Local Training: Users may use their MTXs during local training for familiarization. Con-
      tact the Mission Management Center (MMC) for available coverage times or ACC/A3CS to
      request coverage. Under no circumstances will the BFT “911” call be used unless in an actual
      emergency.

3. BFT Information Control Requirements.
   3.1. Classification of BFT Information:
      3.1.1. The MTX used by ACC units is an unclassified device but contains sensitive technology.
      Association of MTX serial numbers with a CSAR squadron designation is unclassified. However,
      certain information associated with BFT devices and the means units use them may be classified
      for operations security (OPSEC). Classification during training and exercises will be in accor-
      dance with the security classification guidance of the training or exercise. Classification for con-
      tingency operations will be in accordance with the Combatant Commander’s OPSEC guidance. If
      OPSEC guidance is not provided, or unless otherwise specified, units will follow the guidance in
      Table 1.

Table 1. MTX Information Contingency Classification Guidance.
Element                   Associated with                                       Classification
MTX Serial Number         Specific location plus the fact that a “911” brevity Secret*
                          code has been transmitted
MTX Serial Number         Operational mission brevity code cross-matrix         Secret*
                          (brevity code meaning)
* Derived from Combatant Commander OPSEC guidance.

      3.1.2. If operating with USSOCOM/AFSOC units, adhere to their classification policies (see
      AFSOC Policy Letter on Classification of BFT Information located on the CSAR C2 CoP).
6                                                                         ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008


       3.1.3. Certain technical information associated with the architecture used to support some BFT
       devices is classified. For the MTX, refer to Collection of Broadcasts from Remote Assets
       (COBRA) Security Classification Guide, found on the ACC/A3CS SIPRNET website and the
       MMC website. For other BFT devices, i.e. Iridium devices, refer to the appropriate security clas-
       sification guide.
       3.1.4. Only ACC/A3CS can authorize CSAR personnel to change MTX programming. Unautho-
       rized changes could cause data from other devices not to be received properly from the national
       architecture. This could cause serious damage to the units involved.
    3.2. Naming Convention Requirements:
       3.2.1. The MMC in Colorado Springs is responsible for entering track names in the JUNIT table.
       These JUNIT track names then appear in the C2PC Common Operational Picture (COP) applica-
       tion. Various BFT using organizations coordinate naming conventions with the MMC to ensure
       that the track data is displayed in a consistent and understandable format for each user. When users
       do not pass naming information to the MMC, BFT track data will be seen in C2PC as unknown or
       incorrect tracks, which significantly reduces the usefulness of the data.
       3.2.2. ACC uses standardized naming conventions for global operations. These naming conven-
       tions are shown in Attachment 3. ACC/A3CS will coordinate with the MMC to ensure that all
       ACC CSAR devices are displayed via C2PC with these naming conventions. Theater BFT manag-
       ers must inform ACC/A3CS via SIPRNET e-mail of any changes made to the naming conventions
       for ACC BFT devices in their area of responsibility within two duty days of coordinating the
       change with the MMC. This is because ACC/A3CS maintains a database that must match the
       MMC records. Only the first nine characters in the naming convention will be displayed on the
       COP.
    3.3. Brevity Codes:
       3.3.1. Brevity codes are codes that can be transmitted from a BFT device in conjunction with its
       normal geo-position data. These codes can be useful for relaying status of forces information
       one-way from the BFT user to other users and/or appropriate C2 nodes. Different BFT devices
       have different numbers and combinations of brevity codes. The MTX, for example, can send up to
       16 different brevity codes based on the on or off status of four brevity code light emitting diodes
       (LEDs). Pressing the brevity buttons on the side of the MTX will toggle the corresponding LED
       on or off. All the LEDs in the on (illuminated) position defines an emergency condition, or “911”.
       All the LEDs in the off (unlit) position is normally considered “situation normal”. The other brev-
       ity codes can be defined per operation, and used to indicate a wide range of messages, including
       completion of execution checklist steps, etc. Similarly, other BFT devices may have permanently
       defined brevity codes, or may use no brevity codes at all. Users should pre-coordinate their con-
       cept of operations for brevity codes before operational use.
       3.3.2. When using brevity codes, users must be aware that any person with access to the COP
       through a TDP will be able to see brevity codes transmitted by devices (unless the track data for
ACCI10-703 25 APRIL 2008                                                                            7


     that device is kept in discreet COP channels). For unclassified exercises and tests, brevity code
     meanings are not classified.
