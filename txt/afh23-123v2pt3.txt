                           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

1.1. Purpose and Scope. Standard Base Supply System Reference gives reference guidance to
be used in conjunction with the 33-series instructions. This part specifies the functional and
technical processes applicable to computer operations within the SBSS. This publication may be
supplemented at the MAJCOM level or higher, but all Supplements must be routed to the OPR
of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. Note: In some cases
because of system protocols, terminology has not been updated within this part of AFH 23-123,
Vol 2. For example, while the term Defense Logistics Agency Distribution Service (DLADS)
has replaced the term Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO), the older term is still
used for operational reference when showing system output. The term has intentionally not been
updated because system users will encounter the older terminology in their interaction with
SBSS.
1.2. Relationship to Other Publications. The provisions of this part will be used in
conjunction with applicable procedures in other official publications, for materiel management
data processing system management. In cases where conflicting policy or procedures exists,
identify these issues to AF/A4LM for resolution.
1.3. Objective. The objective of this part is to provide, through systematic management
procedures:
   1.3.1. Effective, standard, and controlled automated data processing (ADP) support for
   Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) / Materiel Management Activity operations.
   1.3.2. Standard data processing system fundamentals, work processes, and methodology, for
   the training, development, and maintenance of functional ADP LRS / materiel management
   activity personnel.
   1.3.3. Accurate and timely SBSS ADS prepared management and operational products for
   LRS / Materiel Management Activities.
1.4. Reference Information. Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment
2 for reference information as well as identification of legacy AF supply chain functions with
updated terminology.
   1.4.1. The Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) system is the overarching term used
   to describe the system(s) used by base retail materiel management operations. The ILS-S is
   comprised of the SBSS, Enterprise Solution – Supply (ES-S), and the Air Force Supply
   Centralized Database (AFSCDB). In many cases the term ILS-S is used to identify system
   related functions/references. Where applicable, in some instances, specific identification of
   SBSS or ES-S is used for more detailed identification.

      AFMC SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY PROCESSES

Section 2A—-Standard Supply Programs and Documentation

2.1. Overview. This section provides general and specific procedures for distribution and
processing of programs and documentation. All programs are provided on magnetic tape by
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Specific processes applicable to special
purpose and utility programs/runstreams are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6.
Specific processes for report programs are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 & 6.
Notes: 1. Even though Standard Procurement System (SPS) has taken over Base Contracted
Automated System (BCAS) functions, the BCAS flag fields and coding terms will remain the
same.    2. The term Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working
Capital Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever DBOF is used in a systems output,
the older term is used to reflect the actual output. The term will be updated upon system
programmatic updates.
2.2. Types of Programs.
   2.2.1. Systems Support. Programs which establish and provide the operating environment
   for the SBSS/ADS are designated as systems support. These programs preposition the
   required constant/variable data in memory initialization; provide input/output capability via
   drivers for peripherals and communications subsystem; contain common subroutines such as
   DMSCALC (a system-provided randomizing algorithm), locate detail, decimal to
   binary/binary to decimal conversion; and allow for the orderly restore of records updated by
   transactions subsequently rejected.
   2.2.2. Application. Programs loaded to the program bank except system support and utility
   are designated as application. Application programs are called into memory to process
   specific inputs, produce reports, or other off-line products. Application programs perform
   input edits, make processing decisions, produce the memory buildup to change records,
   create transaction histories, output document and images. Interface with system support
   routines is accomplished to perform the input/output functions and access common
   subroutines.
   2.2.3. Utility. Self-contained programs, working independently of the system support, are
   designated as utility. Utility programs are documented in Ch 16. The program numbers
   NGV001 through NGV099 correspond to the paragraph containing the operating
   instructions. Most utility programs are self-adjusting and function as directed by the
   parameters provided.
2.3. Distribution of Programs and Documentation.
   2.3.1. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Release Tapes. Program release
   tapes are mailed directly to each Defense Mega Center (DMC) computer site from AFMC
   SCM-R Information Technology Activity Release Control. If the release is small, less than
   4000 tracks, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity electronically sends the
   release to the DMC sites. Each release is numbered chronologically. Should a release be
 50                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   received with a date prior to the most recent release, notify the AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity Field Assistance Branch (FAB) immediately.
   2.3.2. Receipt of Release. Upon receipt of the program release from AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity, the SBSS monitor at the DECC will copy the new software
   and produce a listing of the program changes affecting the SBSS which includes rationale
   and DIREP information. The SBSS monitor will forward the listing and all special
   instructions to the RPS operator, who will in turn provide a copy to AFMC SCM-R Quality
   Assurance Activity, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and satellite accounts, if
   applicable." Computer Operations will review the AF Form 636, Systems Change Release
   Document, rationale record for any special instructions that apply to the AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity. The release contains a brief resume of the program
   changes and advance documentation when required. Advance documentation serves as
   interim procedures and is effective until procedures can be published. In conjunction with
   AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity (host and satellites), the supply systems monitor
   will review the rationale portion of the AF Form 636 for software changes to determine the
   impact to the SBSS. AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity with the input from the
   Functional Systems Management (LGLOS) will coordinate with all affected branches and/or
   organizations to ensure the procedural changes and implementation instructions are
   thoroughly understood. This may be accomplished by a formal meeting or a written
   summary. The supply systems monitor will coordinate with AFMC SCM-R Quality
   Assurance Activity and the DMC/SBSS monitor to determine the date the programs will be
   loaded on the DMC. It is the responsibility of the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity supervisor to ensure all special instructions have been completed successfully before
   allowing any users to access the SBSS. Computer Operations must coordinate with the
   appropriate management office of each affected account on the changes received to ensure a
   compatible and correct operation. The LGLO, or other appropriate management office of
   each automated account, is responsible for timely distribution of advance documentation and
   instructions to affected sections of the account for proper implementation. A release number
   is assigned to each group of DMC SBSS Automated Data System (ADS) programs released
   to provide proper documentation control and for reference use between bases and AFMC
   SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Release numbers are constructed and assigned as
   follows. All releases will be loaded under strict timeframes. The following illustrates the
   timeframes to load the applicable releases:

Table 2.1. Release Timeframes.

RELEASE                      LOADED WITHIN
LOAD UPON RECEIPT            72 hours of receipt
EMERGENCY RELEASE            24 hours of receipt
OPR EFFECTIVE                After completion of end of month
   2.3.3. Air Force-Wide Releases. Air Force-wide operational programs are used at all bases
   and are modified/enhanced by release software. The releases can be either routine or special
   and are identified by assigning an alphanumeric designation to each release (e.g., R970701).
   The seven-digit number is assigned as follows: (a) R/S indicates the type of release as either
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   51


  routine (R) or special (S), (b) YYMM indicates the two-digit year and the two-digit month,
  and (c) SN indicates the sequence number. (Note: All block releases start with sequence
  number 01.)
     2.3.3.1. Special Releases: Emergency releases are generated as required and released
     through AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity with a higher priority. Quality
     Test & Evaluation Phase II (QT&E II) releases are made as required and are sent to
     specific bases for testing purposes. QT&E II release numbers begin with a T.
     2.3.3.2. Documentation Releases:
  2.3.4. Computer Operations Actions for Air Force-Wide Releases.
     2.3.4.1. All AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity/main site operators will
     read and electronically sign each release.
         2.3.4.1.1. Step 2 - Immediately after loading a program release, the AFMC SCM-R
         2.3.4.2. Information Technology Activity operator will print a current listing of the
         program bank. Process the Program Bank Index (PBI) by entering the following
         command:
         2.3.4.2.1. @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.PBI
     2.3.4.3. This PBI listing will be stored electronically. The following runstreams must be
     executed every time a new program release provided by AFMC SCM-R Information
     Technology Activity for the SBSS is uploaded. Each of these runs must be processed by
     Gang 1 of each unique access location number (ALN).
         2.3.4.3.1. @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.CREATE/GVEXECUT001                               Note
         1
         2.3.4.3.2. @START 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC                                Note
         2 Notes: 1. This run saves all Exempt files for all ALN accounts.           2. This run
         saves ALN unique user files.
  2.3.5. AF Form 636. This listing will contain the AF Form 636 and the applicable rationale
  list pertaining to the specific release and will be used to control the application of ADS
  programs in the SBSS operation. This file will be organized and maintained as follows:
     2.3.5.1. AF Form 636 program release listing and applicable rationale list for released
     software are maintained in release number sequence.
     2.3.5.2. Current block release (designated by an R in the first position of the release
     number) and two previous block releases to include all special (designated by an S in the
     first position of the release number) releases. To further clarify: (a) current block release
     and all special releases following it; (b) first previous block release and all special
     releases following it; and (c) second previous block release and all special releases
     following it.
         2.3.5.2.1. For baseline releases, the AF Form 636 and rationale listings will be held
         until a new baseline is received. Baseline releases will be identified in the
         documentation accompanying the release.
 52                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.3.6. Computer Operations Actions. Computer Operations should ensure the following
   steps are completed each time a program release tape is received/loaded:
       2.3.6.1. Step 1 - Arrange a meeting with the DMC/SBSS monitor, discuss any special
       instructions included on the AF Form 636, and develop a plan of action. Agree upon the
       time and date to load the release.
       2.3.6.2. Step 2 - Have knowledgeable personnel on duty during the load of the release to
       correct/resolve problems if they should arise.
       2.3.6.3. Step 3 - Ensure all gangs are in the proper posture to load software. Also, ensure
       all gangs have been properly dumped. When all databases are in proper posture, the
       AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator should notify the DMC
       operator to down the ADS through security and to load the new software.
       2.3.6.4. Step 4 - Resume normal processing when these steps have been completed.
2.4. Phrase Records. The term Phrase Records applies to reject notice, transaction, cargo, and
exception phrase records.
   2.4.1. Reject/management phrase load file 0GV00000*REJNOT. is required to establish the
   reject notice record which provides a plain language phrase that identifies specific errors in
   an input. Each base will be furnished a complete file at the time of conversion and any
   changes, additions, or deletions will be furnished by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity as required. These phrases will not be changed at base level. Para. 2.130 contains
   the input format, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8, lists current phrases used in the SBSS.
   A hash total is computed on all reject phrase load inputs. This is done to ensure the action
   and supplemental data location flags are correct. The flags control internal program
   decisions that could affect the validity of the account.
   2.4.2. Type transaction phrase load file contain phrases which print out to further identify
   specific transactions appearing on document and transaction registers. The Type Transaction
   Phrases and Codes (TTPC) are loaded to the database record area (DBRA) by processing
   TPH load inputs (see Para 2.130 for input format). A current listing of type transaction
   codes and abbreviated phrases are shown in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2. AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity will prepare load inputs to update database records as
   applicable, using the above referenced areas for format and current phrase data. If it is
   necessary to delete a phrase, an input is processed as a load with the phrase not used. Type
   cargo and exception phrase records are loaded as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
   Phrase load inputs must be processed through the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity pseudo reader before any users can access the SBSS database. The only outputs
   furnished are reject notices in the event of error conditions. If an error condition occurs, a
   printout of the appropriate database record area should be made and compared against the
   current listing of phrases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2. An input load image should be
   processed to correct any erroneous phrase in the DBRA. When multiple errors are detected,
   or the DBRA appears garbled, a prep of the area and a reload of the entire phrase file should
   be accomplished. Each new program release received should be closely reviewed to ensure
   all loads/changes/deletes of affected phrases are made in conjunction with new program
   loads.
2.5. Reporting Program Problems.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 53


   2.5.1. Sometimes questions or errors arise that just cannot be resolved at base or MAJCOM
   level. These questions and errors should be directed to the AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity Helpdesk at Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex AL, DSN: 596-5771, or
   commercial: 334-416-5771. Direct contact with analysts/programmers is not authorized.
   Before calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk, SBSS users
   must, at a minimum, first complete the checklist outlined in Para 2.134 for reports and
   system problems. The FAB is staffed by individuals who are willing to assist you. However,
   it is extremely difficult to give assistance when the basic problem has not been defined and
   the background of the events that led to the problem is not documented. The AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity Helpdesk is there to help you, but SBSS users should limit
   their calls to the serious situations that CANNOT be resolved at base level or with the
   assistance of the major command (MAJCOM). Each AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity supervisor must be contacted prior to any recoveries of the SBSS
   database that is performed.
   2.5.2. Once contact has been established with the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity Helpdesk, request a control number. Control numbers are a means of identifying
   your call for future reference. More than one call on the same problem will have the same
   control number. Therefore, if you are making an additional call on the same problem,
   provide the control number previously issued to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity Helpdesk controller working the call. In most instances, the controller who is
   working the call will ask for keyins to be made to give the controller a more descriptive
   analysis of the problem. For this reason, depending on the circumstances, have a demand
   terminal available in the event analytical inquiries are requested. During the course of
   resolving the problem the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk
   controller may determine that a program discrepancy exists. Operational Field Test (OFT)
   bases use procedures in Sec. 2F for the submission of DIREPs. Satellite supply accounts
   should report all program problems to the host accounts for resolution. However, if the host
   accounts are unable to help resolve the problems, satellite supply accounts are authorized to
   call the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk directly to resolve
   program discrepancies. The satellite should request assistance from the host account for
   system problems.
2.6. Satellite System Problem Reporting. The DMC support base is responsible for analyzing,
collecting, and reporting satellite system problems as follows:
   2.6.1. Anytime the satellite system is online with the DMC.
   2.6.2. Twilight. When receiving or transmitting data to satellites.
   2.6.3. Reports. When receiving or transmitting data to satellites.
   2.6.4. The problems experienced are not directly related to any known hardware or operator
   faults. To preclude meaningless reporting, the following steps should be taken to verify:
       2.6.4.1. Applicable operation modes of the DMC are established.
       2.6.4.2. Communication link between the DMC and applicable AFMC SCM-R
       Information Technology Activity is established.
 54                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       2.6.4.3. The satellite operator is responsible for initiating the problem definition process.
       The supporting AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is the initial point of
       contact for a satellite equipped supply satellite. The remote station device (RSD)
       operator can verify system status; that is, online, down, batch, etc.
2.7. Reporting Documentation Errors. Editorial errors, minor procedural or technical
inconsistencies, or requests for clarification which do not require immediate resolution will be
reported to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity by email, fax or in writing.
DIREPs will not be submitted for these minor changes. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity will coordinate with the OPR for the reference publication to accomplish the required
change, if appropriate. Normal lead time from initiation of a documentation change to its
publication is a minimum of 90 days. Documentation errors which require immediate resolution
may be called in to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk.

Section 2B—-AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Operating Guidelines.

2.8. Overview. The following documentation is used to provide the information and procedures
necessary to manage and operate the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.
Although used as a guideline, these procedures should be followed as closely as possible.
2.9. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Detailed information on the AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity components and operating instructions for individual
components can be obtained from this manual. Input will be processed and the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity operated according to the instructions contained in this manual.
2.10. System Maintenance. There are two categories of maintenance in this system.
   2.10.1. Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) maintenance covers all terminal
   functions, and all peripheral devices. Maintenance of the ADPE will be as specified in the
   current USAF contract and/or by Air Force military personnel specifically trained to perform
   maintenance. Operators and other personnel will not attempt to perform maintenance on this
   ADPE, except for the operator maintenance specifically defined in the operator's manuals.
   2.10.2. Site environment maintenance includes air conditioning, electrical power input to the
   point where the ADPE will be plugged in, etc. This type of maintenance will be the
   responsibility of the Base Civil Engineer. The LRS Commander/Accountable Officer (LRS
   CC/AO) and AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, will advise their Base Civil
   Engineer of the impact that site environment has on the ADPE operation and materiel
   management response.
2.11. Disposition of Products. Paper products no longer required will be disposed of according
to AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities,. A copy of the AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity console printout will be retained for a minimum of 90
days. Ensure that the printout is no longer required to post information to tape history records, or
for verification of reports processing completion prior to destruction.
2.12. Control of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Facility
Environment. AFI 33-112, Information Technology Hardware Asset Management, outlines
maintenance care requirements. These guidelines are specifically for computer hardware;
however, they should be reviewed and normal cleanliness and safety practices applied to AFMC
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    55


SCM-R Information Technology Activity /satellite facilities. The AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity /satellite can operate in an office environment.
2.13. Access and Restrictions in AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity /Satellite
Facility. There will be no smoking, eating, or drinking in the immediate vicinity or while
operating the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity or SATELLITE hardware. If the
facility is used for office space for Computer Operations personnel, precaution should be
exercised to ensure the office facility uses temporary partitions or is far enough away from the
hardware to preclude any damage to the hardware or hinder operations. The facility should have
limited access, which includes operations and supervisory personnel, personnel authorized by the
LRS CC/AO or personnel accompanied by an authorized person. When the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity /SATELLITE is unattended, sign off will be accomplished and
the facility secured.
2.14. Terminal Response Time. If poor terminal response time is suspected, the AFMC SCM-
R Information Technology Activity must investigate the following and take corrective action as
necessary:
   2.14.1. Retransmits need to cease. It takes a conscious effort to depress keyboard unlock
   and transmit. This builds more transactions queued for processing, creating duplicate
   transactions, and ultimately causing slower response time. The only reason to depress the
   transmit key a second time is if the keyboard is not locked, which means it did not take the
   first time.
   2.14.2. Query Language Program (QLP), Supply Users Generator (SURGE), reports
   processing, processing of Hand-Held Terminals (HHTs) and processing of NGV278 (CTH
   INQ) during prime time (0700-1800) should be held to an absolute minimum. These
   requirements should be processed during non-prime time (1800-0700).
   2.14.3. Review on a daily basis, current SBSS scheduling techniques to ensure only the
   minimum is being processed on the primary database. This will enable releveling, follow up,
   and file status to be accomplished prior to prime on-line time.
   2.14.4. Review the catalog statements in 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. and ensure that disk
   assignments are being utilized. Ensure that gang one, gang one's transaction history, and
   gang five have different disk assignments. Also ensure that there are no Integrated
   Maintenance Data System (IMDS) files on these drives.

Section 2C—-Standard Supply System (SBSS) Terminal Security System.

2.15. Overview. This section explains the security measures, controls, and responsibilities to
minimize the risks and vulnerabilities associated with fraud, theft, and sabotage of the SBSS.
The software controls described in this section along with other security controls already in force
provide a means for individual TIP transaction accountability and for controlling who can input
and process online. The examples in this section uses X to represent primary gang number
unless otherwise stated.
2.16. Responsibilities. Terminal security is an important function for the security of the system.
The primary and alternate Information Assurance Officer is appointed by the LGL and approved
by the host and satellite Operations Officer. These individuals at host sites will come from the
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Each Information Assurance Officer is
 56                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


responsible for the daily operation and maintenance of the terminal security system; that is,
processing 1SZ inputs in online mode. The host Information Assurance Officers for the primary
gangs (1-4) are responsible for all other actions associated with the terminal security system.
The satellite Information Assurance Officer is responsible for their system designators. Close
coordination with satellite Information Assurance Officers and other host Information Assurance
Officers is required during initial implementation, satellite rehoming, and recovery processing of
the terminal security utility programs. Authorization to load/change user identification (User-
IDs) must be approved by the LRS Logistics Manager or designated representative.
   2.16.1. Security Guidelines for workstations and network LRS/Materiel Management
   Activities.
       2.16.1.1. Workstations are considered to be any personal computer (stand alone,
       networked, or client/server), or dumb terminal used by any government employee or
       government contractor.
       2.16.1.2. Workstations should never be left unattended while open to an application, or
       signed on to a network or the SBSS. Workstations should be signed off whenever the
       user leaves the work area. It is the individual’s responsibility to ensure these security
       measures are applied.
       2.16.1.3. Security measures include the safeguarding of User-IDs, passwords, interface
       protocol (IP) addresses, and modem telephone numbers. These should be regarded as
       sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information and only be provided on a need to know
       basis. It is highly recommended that passwords be changed on a regular basis to help
       reduce the security risk. Specifically, IP addresses are managed by the local Base
       Network Control Center (BNCC) or a designated local office and provided on a
       necessary basis for connection to the local area network (LAN).
       2.16.1.4. Employees should consider all information entered or accessed on the computer
       as SBU. This includes government computers (stand alone; on a LAN; or peer-to-peer
       configurations). Individual users are responsible for the security of installed applications
       software and all data input through the workstations. Because most of these machines
       have electronic access to numerous database files and access to the SBSS security
       measures to ensure Class C2 compliance must be implemented to the best extent possible.
       This covers workstations locally purchased, brought in by outside agencies, or furnished
       by the government. It also applies to software developed by AFMC SCM-R Information
       Technology Activity, commercial off the shelf (COTS), locally developed, or developed
       and released by any government agency.
       2.16.1.5. Terminal area security should be applied whenever the areas of concern are
       accessible by unauthorized personnel. This includes limiting direct access to the
       terminal, using a COTS screen saver with password protection, and using the operating
       system (OS) security (access through the OS CMOS BIOS setup when the PC is turned
       on). Use of LAN security is also an available method to support in-place security. Due
       to the multitude of software packages, operating systems, and COTS products it is
       suggested you contact your local Information Assurance Officer, LAN administrator or
       small computer office to implement security procedures and/or activate security software
       features.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 57


       2.16.1.6. Other references include the Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI)
       5024, Volume I, The Certification and Accreditation (C & A) Process; AFSSI 5024,
       Volume II, The Certifying Official’s Handbook; and AFMAN 33-229, Controlled Access
       Protection.
2.17. Logistics Manager. The Logistics Manager or an appointed assistant is responsible for
review of part 8 of the Base Supply Surveillance Report (D20), which reflects unauthorized
attempts to process controlled Transaction Identification Codes (TRICs). Any abuses reflected
on the D20 must be resolved through administrative or disciplinary means.
2.18. Authorizing Transaction Processing. Transactions can be initiated by individuals
through the Enterprise Solution - Supply (ES-S) application hosted on the AF Portal. Flight
Chiefs (or Information Assurance Officer) will determine the need for ES-S transaction
processing. will determine the need for ES-S transaction processing. Requests from
organizations outside of LRS / materiel management activity to process transactions through ES-
S must be approved and validated by the LGLO (or designated representative). SBSS read-only
transactions, i.e., INQ, CTH, and ISN are exempt from these controls when processed through
ES-S, i.e., all ES-S users are allowed to process read-only transactions to the SBSS without any
need for further restrictions/management. All other transaction processing privileges will be
validated."
   2.18.1. Direct SBSS access. User-IDs and passwords for direct access to the SBSS are only
   provided for those functions that are not available in ES-S (to include Demand processing).
   Once the need for a user-ID is established, the Information Assurance Officer loads the user-
   IDs to the terminal security file according to Para 2.140. SBSS User-IDs to support ES-S
   processing will be established and maintained at the request of AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity. User-IDs to support ES-S processing should not be deleted or
   modified without the approval of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.
   2.18.2. Access through ES-S. Access to the SBSS through ES-S (including transaction
   processing privileges) will be controlled by the AF Portal’s Tivoli Access Manager (TAM)
   and internal ES-S administration. Users are granted access to ES-S (and thus the SBSS)
   through the AF Portal’s TAM.            Most users will be assigned the AF Portal’s
   “IL_Supply_ESS-User” role by an administrator in the requestor’s organization or parent
   organization(s). All users authorized access to ES-S inherit SBSS read-only transactions
   (INQ, CTH, and ISN). However, all other transaction processing privileges will be
   controlled through the assignment of Transaction Groups and/or Capabilities by authorized
   ES-S administrators. Transaction Groups contain common transactions associated with
   specific jobs/workcenters. Capabilities authorize access to certain functions within the ES-S
   application. Refer to the ES-S User’s Manual for more information on ES-S administration.
       2.18.2.1. ES-S controls access to specific SBSS transactions through the use of
       Transaction Groups and Capabilities assigned to specific Department of Defense
       Activity Address Codes (DoDAACs). ES-S requires that authorized users be associated
       with specific Transaction Groups/Capabilities against specific DoDAAC(s) to enable
       transaction processing against the DoDAAC(s). Specific DoDAACs will be associated
       with ES-S users by linking an individual AF Portal ID with a DoDAAC or DoDAACs in
       the ES-S application. Specific Transaction Groups will then be assigned to each
       DoDAAC as needed. DoDAACs and Transaction Groups associated with the user are
58                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


     assigned by any administrator authorized administration rights to the specific
     DoDAAC(s)/Transaction Group(s).
        2.18.2.1.1. Transaction Processing. Transaction Groups are created and maintained
        by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity based on input from AFMC
        SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOM staffs. Because of the
        limited number of Transaction Groups available in ES-S, some Transaction Groups
        may provide more transaction capability than required for an individual user. For
        example, a user may require access to ISU and DOC but these transactions may be
        bundled with DIT in a particular Transaction Group (because the majority of user’s
        require these transactions together). Any user assigned this group would also receive
        the ability to process DIT (against all DoDAACs the user has the Transaction Group
        assigned to). If a specific ES-S Transaction Group is not available to match the
        individual’s needs then administrators will either assign a lesser Transaction Group
        (restricting use) or a more comprehensive Transaction Group and direct the individual
        not to process the type of transaction in question (for example, the DIT in the
        example above). If the individual abuses the privileges then the authorization or
        transaction group will be removed. Users are responsible for any transactions and
        rejects they create using ES-S. ES-S includes an Audit Trail Component (ATC that
        records all transactions initiated through ES-S and links the transactions to a specific
        Portal ID. The ATC can be used to determine the source of SBSS transactions/rejects
        initiated through ES-S.
        2.18.2.1.2. Capabilities. Most Capabilities in ES-S grant access to specific privileges
        within the ES-S database. Granting access to any Capability allows users access to
        that Capability against all assigned DoDAACs. However, the GET IT and RELEASE
        ORDER Capabilities allow users to direct shipment (process SHP transactions) from
        any SBSS accounts (not just those DoDAACs specifically assigned to the user).
        Because of the powerful nature of these Capabilities, they will only be assigned to
        users with a verified need to perform these functions, e.g., MICAP, Stock Control,
        and AFMC Item Management personnel. User’s authorized access to the GET IT and
        RELEASE ORDER functions retain the responsibility for clearing any rejects
        associated with their transaction processing. The ATC of ES-S can be used to
        determine specific ES-S users that generated specific SHP transactions. Note: The
        RELEASE ORDER process was designed to augment the AF’s unreliable
        redistribution order (RDO) process that utilizes A2x/A4x transactions to redistribute
        AFMC assets. In lieu of A2x/A4x transactions, ES-S users with the RELEASE
        ORDER Capability will be allowed to process SHP transactions through ES-S to
        redistribute AFMC assets. Authorization to utilize the RELEASE ORDER process is
        controlled by administrators assigned to AFMC.
     2.18.2.2. Crossing MAJCOMs. When a user requests transactional access to a DoDAAC
     in another MAJCOM, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity or owning
     MAJCOM will be responsible for validating the needs of the requestor and granting
     access to the new DoDAAC. Close coordination is required between the AFMC SCM-R
     Information Technology Activity/MAJCOMs in order to provide and maintain the
     authorized level of access.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   59


2.19. Controlled TRICs. See AFI 23-101, Sec 7B, Supply Chain Materiel Management
Systems. The Information Assurance Officer loads the controlled TRICs to the applicable user-
ID according to Para 2.140 or Para 2.142. Controlled TRICs are listed in Para 2.137. All other
TRICs are uncontrolled.
2.20. User Access Validation. Once each quarter, terminal security validation is required. The
Information Assurance Officer provides all Flight Chiefs (host account) and all satellite accounts
(Operations Officer) a listing with names of personnel assigned to a flight, user-Ids and TRIC
authorizations or DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Report (SAAR), for review. After
review of the listing (or DD Form 2875), the Flight Chiefs and/or satellites MSOs annotate any
changes or deletions then signs the listing or DD Form 2875 and returns it to the Information
Assurance Officer. The Information Assurance Officer makes the required adds, changes or
deletions and maintains the listing or form until the next review. The user-ID listing is an
important document allowing SBSS users access to the operating system. The Information
Assurance Officer must ensure that those in "only a need to know" position have access to this
file. A listing with signatures matching DD Form 2875 or a DD Form 2875 must be submitted to
the LGLO for new user-IDs between quarterly reviews. For resetting passwords, see the
Controlled TRICs paragraph above. No additional list or forms will be maintained other than the
Information Assurance Officers for the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity or each
flight.
2.21. Programs and Files. The files and utilities programs which follow are used in the SBSS
Terminal Security System:
   2.21.1. Tip Common Bank (TCB) Security File. The TCB security file contains SBSS
   security data for all gangs. This file is updated during online mode when a 1SZ input is
   processed, and in the demand mode when the utility program NGVU02 is processed for each
   ALN. This file will contain the 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx. files for all gangs. That is why
   gang 1 for each ALN must be the point of contact.
   2.21.2. The Common Bank (NGVU02). The Common Bank is an area in memory that
   contains portions of the TIP security file. This area is used to validate user-IDs as they sign
   on the SBSS in the online mode. The area is also used to validate which controlled TRICs a
   user is authorized to process. This area does not use disk I/Os and will not slow down
   processing. NGVU02 loads the USERFILEx file (x = gang number) into the TCB file
   TIP$*<ALN>$$000231. This job is executed by processing:
       2.21.2.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU02
       2.21.2.2. This job will only print at the demand terminal that started the job. The output
       will be a return of the valid system designator (EXAMPLE: SYS 01, SYS A1, SYS A2
       etc.) and will return with an START-OF-ENTRY (SOE). Upon successful return from
       NGVU02, the security file will have been updated according to the information read from
       the USERFILE.
   2.21.3. Common Bank Load (NGVU03). Program NGVU03 is used to initialize the security
   common bank and load the TCB file TIP$*<ALN>$$000231. into the common bank. This
   job is executed by processing:
       2.21.3.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03
 60                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      2.21.3.2. This job will only print at the demand terminal that started the job. The output
      will be a message that says: LOAD OF ALN/GANG SUCCESSFUL. Upon successful
      completion of NGVU03, the security file information for the user's ALN will be loaded
      into the Fixed Gate Shared Subsystem (FGSS) .
   2.21.4. Display Utility Program (NGVU04). The utility program NGVU04 reads the TCB
   security file based on gang and creates a temporary sorted file called $USER$x (x = gang
   number). NGVU04 is only processed in the demand mode at the host site by the host
   security manager. This file is assigned the qualifier/project-ID of your current demand run.
   Also, you will be queried for output queue. Once NGVU04 has processed, NGVU04 will
   SYM a copy of your $USER$x file to the input queue. This listing will display the current
   security data (user-ID, TRICs, etc.) that is loaded to the common bank. This job is executed
   by processing:
      2.21.4.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU04
      2.21.4.2. Program NGVU04 displays the following prompts:
          2.21.4.2.1. >ENTER GANG NUMBER
          2.21.4.2.2. > ...(respond with the appropriate one digit)
              2.21.4.2.2.1. GANG NUMBER OF 1, 2, 3, 4.
      2.21.4.3. >ENTER NTR DEVICE (DEFAULT IS PR)
      2.21.4.4. > ...( respond with the appropriate print )
          2.21.4.4.1. DEVICE IDENTIFIER (I.E., NTR57P).
      2.21.4.5. >ENTER BY USER,NAME,INIT(INITIALS),SYMB(SYMBOL BY)
      2.21.4.6. > ...( respond with the appropriate sort )
          2.21.4.6.1. SEQUENCE IDENTIFIER OF USER, NAME, INIT, OR SYMB.
2.22. Special Instructions. Upon a successful return from NGVU04, TIP FILE #231 will be
retrieved, ordered into the specified sequence, compiled into a listing and SYM'D to the
specified print device. Program NGVU04 will also create a $USER$<GANG> FILE with all the
current security USER-IDs and TRICs loaded in the common bank. These latest changes from
$USER$<GANG>            must      be     copied     into   the  original     master    file
0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>. to provide a backup, in case the TIP security file is ever
destroyed.       EXAMPLE: @COPY $USER$<GANG>.,0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>.
Note: The qualifier of your $USER$x file is dependent upon your current qualifier. You may
check for your current qualifier by executing the @WHOAMI command on your demand page.
   2.22.1. 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx. Files. The 0GV0*USERFILEx. files are Standard
   Systems Data File (SSDF) flat files based on gangs 1 through 4. They are used anytime the
   SBSS TIP security file needs to be recovered. These files are initially created by using
   Interactive Processing Facility (IPF) or any ASCII editor. They can be updated with IPF or
   any American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) editor, or replaced in their
   entirety with the $USERSX file. The input of an online 1SZ will not update this file. Up to
   2,000 user-IDs can be maintained in each 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEX.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     61


2.23. TIP Sign-On Process. The SBSS terminal security system is initialized each time the
SBSS ADS is brought up. The TIP security file is read into a common bank where it is used to
validate user-IDs, 1SZ input, and TIP inputs. When signing on, the Common Bank is checked to
validate the user-ID. If the sign-on is successful, the position identifier (PID) number is attached
to the user-ID, the SBSS menu screen appears and online processing begins. The user can
process any of the uncontrolled TRICs, plus any controlled TRICs specified in the security mask.
2.24. Error Messages. The following is a description of errors displayed by the security
applications:
   2.24.1. STATUS = 0000000014, 0000000016, or 0000000018. Either of these errors may
   occur when processing NGVU03. NGVU03 loads file TIP$*<ALN>$$000231. to the
   common bank. If this file (#231) is not cataloged or assigned or the common bank is corrupt,
   one of these errors will occur. To clear error(s), correct file condition for file #231 and
   process NGVU03 with the ",S" option:                                                 @XQT,S
   0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03                  Note: This will affect all TIP users on your ALN.
   Ensure you coordinate with all applicable SBSS users before processing.
   2.24.2. STATUS = 0000000015. This error occurs when trying to sign on in tip.
   Process: <SOE>@XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03                      Note: The S option is
   omitted when processing job for this error. Process this program for each gang on your
   ALN. Any other nonstandard halt or errors will be accompanied by a console error message.
   2.24.3. NO SYSTEM DES CARD SUBMITTED FOR GANG # (WHERE # IS THE GANG
   NUMBER) - The input file 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>. did not contain a SYS

   user-ID is not loaded in the common bank. The terminal function is marked down when this
   notice is produced and the user should contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity operator to reinitialize the down function. This message does not apply to function
   057. The flight chief must inform the Information Assurance Officer if this user needs to
   access the SBSS database so the TSM can load the user-ID. This protects the SBSS database
   from unauthorized sign-on online.
   2.24.30. USER-ID ALREADY ACTIVE ON PID XXX PLEASE CLOSE TERMINAL.
   This message appears if the user attempts to sign on more than one terminal online. The user
   can $$CLOSE their original terminal and sign on the new terminal. The user can also
   acknowledge the message, $$CLOSE, and return to work on the original terminal. This
   message can also occur on a partial system crash, if the user was not allowed to close
   normally.
   2.24.31. USER-ID LOADED IN SYSTEM DESIGNATOR TABLE FOR SD PLEASE
   LOGOFF. Users may sign on only to the terminals configured to the same system designator
   as their user-ID. The message above appears when a user attempts to sign on a terminal
   which is configured to a system designator different from the user-ID loaded for the user.
   When a user has a need to sign on more than one system designator on a gang (each system
   designator has a separate terminal attached), the user must be assigned separate user-IDs and
   passwords for each.
   2.24.32. UNABLE TO LOAD SBSS SECURITY FILE. When the common bank does not
   contain the required fields of the TIP security file, this message appears. Steps 3 through 5 in
   Para 2.147 must be processed before online processing is allowed. Once these steps are
   complete, resume the sign-on process.
2.25. Terminal Configurations.
   2.25.1. Input/Input Configuration. This is the normal configuration. However, some users
   require two user-IDs/passwords so they can sign on both terminal pages at the same time.
   This configuration provides that capability since a terminal does not allow a user more than
   one terminal page at one time.
   2.25.2. Input/Output or Output/Input. Terminals with the two-page concept require a special
   user-ID/password for the output page. The 1SZI image to load the user-ID must contain
   OUT in positions 53-55 (TRIC code field) for the output page. This prevents any online
   inputs from processing on the output page. Therefore, this page can remain signed on for
   output under this user-ID as long as the work area is manned.
2.26. Processing TIP Inputs.
   2.26.1. Transaction Accountability. Once an authorized user signs on in the online mode,
   normal processing starts, and the user can process any uncontrolled TRICs and their
64                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  authorized controlled TRICs. After successful processing of online transactions, the user's
  initials are stored in the applicable transaction histories.
  2.26.2. 301 Rejects. A 301 reject notice occurs when a user tries to input an unauthorized
  controlled TRIC. When this happens, the user's initials and the time the input was attempted
  are automatically placed in the last eight positions of the input images. However, the user's
  initials are not reflected on the 301 reject notice for uncontrolled TRICs. The 301 reject
  notice for controlled TRICs are printed in part 8 of the Base Surveillance Report (D20).
  Currently, 301 reject notices are the only rejects that contain the user's initials. Some 301
  rejects can appear on the D20 due to security processing (NGVU02/NGVU03). These 301
  rejects do not contain user’s initials because security common bank is being initialized during
  the security process. Enterprise Solution – Supply (ES-S) sessions also will produce 301
  rejects due to their persistent connection. These ES-S 301 rejects can be identified by
  looking up the function number within the Base Constants Processor (NGV068A) to
  determine if they came from ES-S. If they came from ES-S, these 301 rejects can be
  disregarded because TRIC security is controlled within the ES-S application and not in
  SBSS.
  2.26.3. Terminal Security. There are two factors which cause an uncontrolled TRIC to reject
  with a 301 reject notice and print part 8 of the D20 Report without initials. The first is an
  unauthorized sign on in TIP. Security software rejects any input from an unauthorized user
  with a 301 reject, and the initials are blank because the user is not in the SBSS security file.
  The second is the terminal security mask is in the common bank and is corrupt. The mask
  for terminal security in the common bank corrupts when an uncontrolled TRIC appears with
  a 301 reject. To check for this condition, process:
     2.26.3.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU04
     2.26.3.2. If a good end-of-job is received, the security mask is not corrupt. If you are
     unable to get a good end-of-job, the Information Assurance Officer must coordinate with
     the DMC operator to do the following:
         2.26.3.2.1. @MSG PLZ DOWN SBSS ADS xGV
         2.26.3.2.2. Review your USERFILEx to ensure user-IDs are correct.
         2.26.3.2.3. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU02
         2.26.3.2.4. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03
         2.26.3.2.5. @MSG PLZ UP SBSS ADS xGV
  2.26.4. Processing 1SZ Inputs. The SBSS terminal security system should be updated in
  online mode with 1SZ inputs. These inputs are used to load, change, or delete controlled
  TRICs, user-IDs, and other data to the TIP Security File and Common Bank. The 1SZ will
  not process through pseudo. If the 1SZ processes successfully, INPUT PROCESSED is
  returned. If unsuccessful, one of the following notices is produced:
     2.26.4.1. INVALID USERID NOT FOUND IS SBSS SECURITY FILE. This means
     you are trying to process against a user-ID not loaded in the security file. Correct the
     user-ID in the input image or load the user-ID to the system.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 65


       2.26.4.2. INVALID TRIC NOT FOUND IN SBSS SECURITY FILE. This means you
       are trying to process against an uncontrolled TRIC. Correct the TRIC in the input image,
       or load the TRIC to the system.
       2.26.4.3. INVALID USERID ALREADY IN SBSS SECURITY FILE. This means you
       are trying to load a user-ID which has already been loaded. Discard the input.
       2.26.4.4. INVALID TRIC ALREADY IN SBSS SECURITY FILE. This means you are
       trying to load a controlled TRIC which has already been loaded. Discard the input.
       2.26.4.5. INVALID FORMAT CORRECT AND REINPUT. See Para 2.137 through
       Para 2.171 for correct format. Follow the format exactly.
       2.26.4.6. TIP IO ERROR OCCURED, REPROCESS INPUT. Try again. If this does
       not work, the TIP security file must be re-created. Go to Para 2.147 and process steps 2
       through 5.
       2.26.4.7. MAX NUMBER OF USER-IDS IN SBSS SECURITY FILE. This means the
       gang has reached the maximum number of USER-IDs that can be loaded to this gang.
       Process NGVU02 or delete USER-IDs that are no longer required from the USERFILEX.
       2.26.4.8. BIT VALUE FOR TRIC ALREADY IN USE IN SECURITY FILE. This
       means you are trying to assign a TRIC FLAG to a controlled TRIC, and the flag is
       already in use. Use next available number.
       2.26.4.9. INVALID GANG NUMBER VALIDATE AND REINPUT. This means you
       have the wrong gang number. The input file must contain primary gang 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2.27. Conversion/Implementation Procedures. Step-by-step procedures required to
implement the SBSS terminal security system are contained in Para 2.146 Para 2.147 contains
a sample for creating an 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx.
2.28. Processing NGV221 Through SBSS Security. Program NGV221 has been modified to
include SBSS security checks against images being loaded to the pseudo. Procedures are
contained in Sec. 2J.

Section 2D—-LRS / Materiel Management Activity ADP Personnel Requirements

2.29. Overview. This section outlines the procedures for selecting, training, and maintaining
proficiency of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity -II and DMC satellite operators.
2.30. Training.
   2.30.1. The continuing availability of trained, qualified AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity and DMC satellite operators depends upon the care and attention given
   to the training of those selected and the maintenance of proficiency. The criteria used are
   discussed in the paragraphs that follow:
   2.30.2. Except as explained in paragraphs below, it is mandatory that airmen basics, civilian
   employees and retrainees selected as AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
   operators successfully complete the formal Supply Systems Specialist Course prior to
   operating the standard AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity -II and satellite
   DMC terminal functions. A formal request for a quota to the training course will be
 66                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   submitted immediately upon selection of the individual for operator duty. On the Job
   Training (OJT) will begin upon assignment to Computer Operations. The training will
   consist of all tasks outlined in JTS 2S032, except those involving AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity operator duties.
   2.30.3. The following training conditions apply unless restricted by the MAJCOM:
       2.30.3.1. Personnel selected as AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
       operators and scheduled to attend the Supply Systems Specialist Course may operate the
       AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and/or satellite DMC input/output
       functions under carefully supervised conditions before completion of the mandatory
       course.
       2.30.3.2. SBSS input/output functions are currently utilized for two general applications:
       (1) as communications equipment for satellites of the Standard Base Supply System, and
       (2) as terminal functions in Receiving, Demand Processing, etc., at larger bases instead of
       terminals. Therefore, the amount of training required for each application is different.
          2.30.3.2.1. For SBSS input/output functions used to support satellites of the SBSS,
          operators may be trained by OJT and may possess a 2S071 AFSC. Parent commands
          should ensure that at least two personnel are assigned that have been provided
          familiarization training on this ADPE. OJT training provided to 2S071 AFSC
          personnel will suffice for familiarization training.
          2.30.3.2.2. For SBSS input/output functions used as terminal functions within the
          LRS CC/AO organization, operators may be trained by OJT and may have a 2S071
          AFSC. Bases must ensure that at least two 2S072 personnel are assigned in
          Computer Operations with specified training.
          2.30.3.2.3. To ensure continuation of proficiency, participation is a minimum of 1
          work week to include a complete normal end-of-month. Hands on AFMC SCM-R
          Information Technology Activity operation is required semiannually for personnel in
          the grade of E-6 (TSgt) and below, not performing the duty.

Section 2E—-Automated Data System (ADS) Production Control Procedures

2.31. Overview. This section outlines general and minimum production control procedures
required to satisfy the data processing needs of AF stock record accounts supported by the USAF
Standard Base Supply System. These procedures include the ADPE utilization requirements of
all functions involved in LRS / materiel management activity operations: that is, satellite and
Accounting & Finance (A&F). The provisions of this section are designed to implement the
MAJCOM and ADPE custodian responsibilities outlined in AFI 33-116, Long-haul
Telecommunications Management. The Host Standard Base Supply System (DMC) scheduling
directly affects the shift manning and efficient use of ADPE resources for all supported
activities. Under no circumstances will the SBSS/DMC processing be disrupted, or delayed to
compensate for satellite nonavailability.
2.32. Concepts. Usage of the SBSS ADS will be preplanned and systematically scheduled to
obtain maximum online time each workday. However, database integrity programs, (Data
Management Utility (DMU)-VERIFY, NDA500, IRU-DUMPS) will not be sacrificed for any
reason.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 67


   2.32.1. Processing Sequence. All USAF Standard Base Supply System programs/products
   will normally be processed prior to running MAJCOM, local, or as required programs.
   Exceptions to this policy will be held to the strictest minimum and will not be allowed to
   interfere with the mandatory, sequence controlled reports. Locally devised programs that
   duplicate data provided through standard programs or products may not be processed.
   2.32.2. Duties. The LGLO (Computer Operations) will be responsible for the compilation,
   ADS processing, publication, and distribution of SBSS ADS schedule data.
   2.32.3. Workload, shift manning, and all customer operations are directly regulated by SBSS
   ADS production schedules. Therefore, copies of the schedules must be furnished in advance
   to SBSS flight offices, satellite Materiel management officer, A&F, Fuels and all satellite
   accounts. The forecast and daily processing schedules should only be distributed as outlined
   above. Local conditions may require further distribution; that is, to section level, reducing
   the number of copies by joint use where possible.
   2.32.4. Although the LGLO is responsible for final production of SBSS ADS schedules,
   each function is responsible for ensuring their data processing requirements are included in
   the daily processing schedules.
   2.32.5. At least once each month, the LRS CC/AO should review the effectiveness of their
   local ADS production control. It is recommended that this review be made during a periodic
   How-Goes-It meeting. At this time, supported functions should brief the LRS CC/AO on the
   effectiveness of ADS schedules for their function, and apprise them of any major workloads
   anticipated for the coming month.
   2.32.6. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisor will assign ADS
   scheduling duties to an individual within Computer Operations. This individual will be
   known as the ADS scheduler, and will be the contact on all subjects related to ADS
   scheduling.
   2.32.7. Under no circumstances will a single individual, or function, attempt to accomplish
   ADS scheduling for all LRS / materiel management activity operations. This practice is
   known as scratch pad scheduling, and results in uncoordinated LRS / materiel management
   activity operations; that is, mismanagement of available manpower and ADPE caused by
   communication breakdowns between Computer Operations and supported activities.
2.33. ADS Production Control. The high real-time processing speeds, high costs, specialized
training, and concentration of human effort involved in this automated data processing system
require the most demanding attention from all supervisors. The use of the USAF Standard Base
Supply System will be regulated through production control methods. These methods are to be
implemented to ensure end products are obtained in a timely and orderly manner, and that ADS
utilization time is precisely fitted to meet the operational needs for maximum supply support.
2.34. Forecasting. There are three basic types of forecasting within the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity operations section. They are Monthly Forecast, Daily
Operations schedule, and the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Operations
schedule.
   2.34.1. Monthly Forecast. Once each month the ADS scheduler will prepare a forecast of all
   known SBSS jobs to be run the following month. This forecast will be prepared and
 68                                                         AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   distributed as specified by the 10th workday of the month. Each function will review the
   forecast with their sections to ensure that all regular and special processing jobs are listed and
   scheduled on the dates required. All change requests must be forwarded to the ADS
   scheduler by the 15th workday of the month. If the schedule is transmitted via satellites,
   satellite accounts may prepare change request to the schedule in the form of images and
   transmit them to the DMC SBSS ADS scheduler via satellites. This will reduce delays
   caused by mailing. In addition to forwarding the change request to the ADS scheduler, the
   monthly forecast schedule received must be annotated and retained as the anticipated daily
   operations schedule.
   2.34.2. Daily Operations Schedule. Upon return of the change request to the monthly
   forecast schedule, the ADS scheduler will make all necessary adjustments to the schedule. If
   the number of changes to the forecast warrant it, prepare the daily operations schedule and
   distribute it to the users. All change requests received by the ADS scheduler must be
   acknowledged by letter or telephone.
   2.34.3. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Operations Schedule. Along with
   daily operational plans, the ADS operator scheduler will also produce AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity operator schedules. Computer Operations shift leaders
   will review these schedules to ensure they contain sufficient instructions for Computer
   Operations and that all jobs are accomplished as scheduled. The ADS scheduler and the
   functional users will coordinate on such matters as implementation dates, data revisions, end-
   of-quarter/year jobs, and any other changes affecting both functions.

Section 2F—-Operational System Testing

2.35. Overview. This section provides procedures for bases supporting operational testing of
Integrated Logistics Systems-Supply (ILS-S) software releases. This includes “legacy”
maintenance releases for the SBSS, as well as releases for the Enterprise Solution – Supply (ES-
S). Operational testing usually involves a limited number of supply accounts (bases) working
closely together with the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity, A4R staff at the MAJCOMs (MAJCOM), Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) Oklahoma City, DISA Montgomery, and occasionally,
functional representatives from the Air Staff. Operational testing is the final phase of a
sometimes lengthy software development test and evaluation process all ILS-S releases undergo.
The objective of operational testing is to ensure release installation and configuration instructions
are accurate and provide an opportunity to observe system behavior under actual operating
conditions. During operational testing, the Air Force uses a variety of bases with various
missions and workloads to identify and repair as many software deficiencies (also referred to as
defects) as possible prior to releasing ILS-S software Air Force-wide. The importance of
operational testing cannot be emphasized enough – key to the success of operational testing is a
cooperative relationship with all operational test participants.
2.36. Designation of Test Bases. The retail supply system is complex yet robust – it supports
many very different missions in many countries. The ILS-S information systems the Air Force
uses to support these missions are just as complex – and robust. Therefore, no single base or
retail supply site can adequately provide all of the conditions required to fully test (both
functional and technical) every ILS-S supply software release. For this reason, the AFMC SCM-
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     69


R Information Technology Activity ILS-S Program Manager and ILS-S Test Director, with the
assistance of the MAJCOMs and AFMC SCM-R Activity identifies bases with the appropriate
missions and workload needed to adequately test the various features and capabilities provided in
upcoming ILS-S software releases. Concurrence of the appropriate MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-
R Activity is necessary before the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Test
Director will designate a base as an operational test site. Normally, only designated operational
test bases receive test releases; however, other bases may be included in operational testing as
the need arises. Including bases other than those that normally participate in operational testing
must be coordinated and agreed upon by all test participants.
2.37. Designation of Test Monitors. The AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test
Director will contact MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-R Activity staff requesting operational test
support for upcoming ILS-S releases that require operational testing. MAJCOM and AFMC
SCM-R Activity staff will assign a lead test monitor for each ILS-S release. Many ILS-S
releases (especially those for the SBSS) include system changes that in some way influence base-
level supply-centric functions. However, many ILS-S releases (to include the SBSS) also
influence other base-level organizations whose mission or workload relies heavily on a stable
and smoothly functioning supply system. Therefore, operational test monitors should work
closely with base-level organizations to ensure the operational testing of ILS-S releases
minimizes mission degradation or operational performance. Organizations such as the Defense
Finance & Accounting Service (DFAS) Field Site, Aircraft Maintenance, Vehicle Management,
Civil Engineering and other organizations where appropriate should be made aware of the
upcoming operational test and the anticipated system changes. In fact, all ILS-S users at the
operational test site should be made aware of the upcoming system changes and how it may
affect their workload. All operational testing discussions and coordination to include email
traffic, conference calls and other meetings will include at a minimum: representation from
AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity,
the MAJCOM, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and the operational test
sites. All AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity communication in regards to an upcoming
operational test will flow through the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and
MAJCOM test monitors to ensure AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and
MAJCOM staff are aware of all system testing issues and potential problems. The AFMC SCM-
R Information Technology Activity and/or the host LRS with satellite accounts will designate
individuals at each satellite account to monitor system behavior during operational testing –
these individuals should report any system performance or behavioral problems to the host LRS
LGLO and to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. The satellite account
monitors will also support operational release testing for those test scenarios that require support
from satellite operations. Normal duties as outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec 1C, Satellite Operations
and as designated by the AFMC SCM-R Commander/LRS CC/AO/Supply Management
Business Activity Chief (DFAS Field Site) apply to the designated host base monitor.
Additional duties for the operational test monitors are as follows:
   2.37.1. Coordinate system changes with interfacing systems such as IMDS, CMOS and
   DFAS Field Site.
   2.37.2. Ensure all AFMC SCM-R materiel management activities and DFAS Field Site
   personnel are operating the same as an operational test base.
 70                                                         AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.37.3. Review advance release documentation and ensure all affected sections and
   supported organizations are aware of upcoming system changes. Ensure system users at the
   test sites notify AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and LRS LGLO personnel
   of any system deficiencies that arise during the test.
   2.37.4. Ensure system users are aware of new operating procedures and trained if necessary.
   2.37.5. Recommend operational or procedural changes as required.
2.38. Loading Test Programs. DISA Oklahoma City system (legacy SBSS releases) or GCSS-
AF system administrators (ES-S releases) will coordinate test release loads with staff members
from the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity and MAJCOMs. Test releases are normally shipped by AFMC SCM-R Quality
Assurance Activity by Wednesday for installation on the following weekend to reduce system
unavailability (outages). Week-day (normal duty hours) release loads are kept to a minimum.
Depending on the application, some releases will have a specific effective date assigned – the
AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test Director will ensure all test participants are
aware of situations such as these. LRS test monitors/liaisons should notify the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity or MAJCOM staff if mission requirements or workload
prevent loading the release as scheduled by AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity.
2.39. Distribution of Release Documentation. The AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance
Activity Test Director in conjunction with the test manager from the AFMC SCM-R Quality
Assurance Activity will distribute advance test release documentation – various means are
available to include email and logistics communities of practice web sites. Arrangements for test
release distribution will be made by the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test Director
in conjunction with LRS, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOM test
participants. Test monitors must ensure advance release documentation is distributed to every
ILS-S system user to ensure system users are aware of the upcoming system changes and also
understand how the changes will affect their role and duties.
2.40. Special Requirements. At times, AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity may request
system information relevant to a particular operational test – these requests include output from
reports, inquiries and requests for special programs/processing. These requests will be kept to a
minimum and will be submitted by telephone or email to the test monitors.
2.41. Evaluation of Testing. During operational testing, test bases should attempt to operate
under normal conditions. However, at times it may be necessary to put a special emphasis on
testing certain aspects of a release – those tests will be coordinated with AFMC SCM-R Quality
Assurance Activity, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOMs.
AFMC SCM-R staff and other key functions on base should be fully aware of the upcoming
operational test and system changes. The LRS CC/AO should periodically inform other base
organizations (Aircraft and Vehicle Management, Civil Engineers, etc.) that their workload and
mission may be affected by a supply release undergoing operational testing. Feedback from
these organizations concerning their observations of the test release is highly encouraged. The
personnel who work with the ILS-S systems input/output products and use supply procedures on
a daily basis are usually the first to identify a software defect. Test monitors and system users
should be on the lookout for the type of errors listed below:
   2.41.1. Invalid rejects for a particular type of input processing.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     71


   2.41.2. Database key/set errors.
   2.41.3. Unexplained increase or decrease in output products.
   2.41.4. Invalid records.
   2.41.5. Abnormal increase/decrease in processing time.
   2.41.6. Inconsistencies between documentation and input/output formats.
   2.41.7. Erroneous data in output products.
   2.41.8. Terminals not being released.
   2.41.9. Terminals output being misdirected.
   2.41.10. Loss of audit trail.
   2.41.11. TIP hang-ups.
2.42. Reporting Program/Procedural Problems. Test bases will report all defects to the
AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity. To contact the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance
Activity Helpdesk, Team 4 call DSN 596-5771, options 1, 4, 2 or e-mail team4@gunter.af.mil.
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity level two help desk personnel will help
research potential problems and if necessary, create a DIREP (incident). Procedural problems
should be reported by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity test monitors but
feedback is highly encouraged from other work centers to include the LRS and other base-level
organizations. All test base personnel should be encouraged to make comments and
recommendations concerning these testing techniques. Also, operational testing conference calls
are held for most operational tests and include all test participants – these calls are an excellent
forum for identifying and discussing potential system problems.

Section 2G—-Modes, Preparation, and Initialization

2.43. Overview. This section describes the different modes of ADPE processing, method of
scheduling, and operating instructions for the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
and satellites. Anytime the system is received from the DMC from either a disk prep, JK-413, or
any system maintenance it is MANDATORY for the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity personnel to process NDA500 (all sets), DMU VERIFY, VERIFY CALC and to take an
Integrated Recovery Utility (IRU) safety dump. Failing to do so may result in bringing users
online with an unstable database.
2.44. Modes of Processing. The four basic modes of processing within the SBSS ADS are:
Online, Twilight, Reports, and Utility.
   2.44.1. Online. This mode covers all SBSS processing from the time the beginning-of-day
   (BOD) initialization image is processed until the END image is processed. The purpose of
   online processing is to post individual supply transactions, accomplish updating of internal
   supply and monetary records, create output documents, and store data required for later
   preparation of audit documents. Online processing presupposes the capability to handle
   input on a random basis without regard to type of document. Examples of transactions
   processed online are as follows: issues, receipts, turn-ins, shipments, and file maintenance.
   This mode also controls the collection of input requests, the distribution of output to terminal
 72                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   functions, and the initiation of read, output images, and print operations. The online
   environment is normally established with SETUP/HVTIP or existing runstreams with one
   copy of NGV208A for execution (single-thread).
   2.44.2. Twilight. This mode includes all SBSS processing from the time the END image is
   processed until the first report select RPT image is processed. Its purpose is to allow
   processing of batch input, or special runs that create transaction histories or update the SBSS
   database prior to the first report select image being processed. There is a capability to return
   to online processing from this mode.
   2.44.3. Reports. This mode covers all processing from the time the first report select image
   is processed until the RPTEON (report end-of-night) image is processed. Its purpose is to
   provide mandatory and optional reports, and management products. Once this mode is
   entered, the SBSS cannot return to online or twilight processing for that transaction date.
   2.44.4. Utility. This mode covers the period of time after reports processing and prior to
   initialization BOD for the next SBSS ADS processing day. The utility programs are
   activated by inserting the appropriate NGV select image into the SBSS runstream.
2.45. Preparation. When the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator is
ready to start processing, all SBSS ADPE to be used must be placed in a ready condition and the
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must establish its session with the host DMC.
For twilight, reports, and utility processing, the operating instructions for each program
described in this manual, specify the functions that will be used. Prepare the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity equipment as follows:
   2.45.1. Ensure all power switches are ON including the modems for all terminals, if
   applicable.
   2.45.2. Sign-on Procedures AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. To establish
   the sessions with the DMC, the following procedures must be followed:
       2.45.2.1. Sign PAGE 1 of the terminal on to the host in transaction mode as follows:
          2.45.2.1.1. Depress XMIT key. The $$SON (terminal-ID), $$OPEN T (system-ID),
          and LOGON are internally generated for bases processing under simple sign-on
          procedures. The response will be: ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD.
          2.45.2.1.2. Enter user-ID/password, depress XMIT key. The response will be: The
          SBSS System Status Screen or the Menu Screen. *OPEN is internally generated for
          bases operating under Simple Sign-on. The terminal is now ready to accept online
          transactions. If the response is ADS IS DOWN, contact host DMC for status of
          system.
       2.45.2.2. Sign on to PAGE 2 as follows:
          2.45.2.2.1. Depress PAGE key to gain access to PAGE 2.
          2.45.2.2.2. Enter $$SON (terminal-ID), depress XMIT key. The response will be:
          ENTER SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST.
          2.45.2.2.3. Enter $$OPEN D (system-ID), depress XMIT key. The response will be:
          SESSION PATH OPEN TO D (system-ID) ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    73


           2.45.2.2.4. Enter user-ID/password, depress XMIT key. The system will respond
           with successful sign-on messages. The page number will be indicated by the number
           1 or 2 in the lower left hand corner of the terminal (screen).
           2.45.2.2.5. SBSS System Menu Options ( AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
           Activity):
              2.45.2.2.5.1. $$CLOSE. Closes the terminal from the active TIP session.
              2.45.2.2.5.2. STATUS. Shows system and terminal status.
              2.45.2.2.5.3. SSW***. This selection is reserved for the console operator to set
              the three SBSS sense switches. To set the sense switches, modify the three
              asterisks using the following criteria. The first asterisk is for sense switch 1. The
              second asterisk is for sense switch 2. The third asterisk is for sense switch 3. A 1
              turns on applicable sense switch while 0 turns it off. To turn sense switches on
              for the secondary gang, place an S in position 8 of the input. An example
              showing how to turn on sense switch 2 for gang 5 follows: SSW010 and hit
              XMIT on page 1 or SSW*1* S and hit XMIT on page 1.
              2.45.2.2.5.4. #051. To aid in data entry, a DPS Overview purpose input screen is
              available. To select this screen, tab to this selection and depress the XMIT key.
              To return to the SBSS System menu enter MENU and depress XMIT.
           2.45.2.2.6. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Session Termination.
           Enter $$CLOSE and then $$SOFF to terminate session.
2.46. Initialization. The SBSS ADS must be initialized prior to processing with either the
online or offline (twilight, reports, utility modes) SBSS routines. To initialize the system,
accomplish the following steps:
   2.46.1. Insert an INT image into the SBSS runstream. See Para 2.155.
   2.46.2. When initialization is completed, a 725 REJECT will be displayed on the AFMC
   SCM-R Information Technology Activity console.
   2.46.3. To change the requisition data at the same time the transaction data is changed, place
   the DAY image immediately behind the INT image and it will be processed.
   2.46.4. Special Instructions. System initialization images (TRIC INT) must be input as
   batch inputs. The END will only be input through the main AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity TIP terminal.
   2.46.5. Any batch input can be input through the demand mode (PAGE 2); however, only
   one execution of NGV801A per database (gang) number can take place at one time. The
   PROJ-ID on the run image will be used to identify the SBSS that originated the input; for
   example, 1GV0 = gang 1, 2GV0 = gang 2, 3GV0 = gang 3 and 4GV0 = gang 4.
2.47. Types of Initialization. Four types of initialization can be accomplished. The type
selected by the program will depend upon the settings of the control flags on the special control
record and the code in the INT image. They are Beginning-of-Day (BOD), Restart Online,
Restart Offline, Restart Beginning-of-Day.
 74                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.47.1. Beginning-of-Day (BOD). This will occur on the first initialization after the
   RPTEON image is processed. Flags A, C, and I were ON in the special control record.
   These flags will be set in the OFF position, the date will be advanced, and the transaction
   serial number will be reset.
   2.47.2. Restart Online. This will occur when online processing was in effect at the time the
   last restart record was written to the DBRA (database record area). Flags A, C, and I were
   OFF in the special control record.
   2.47.3. Restart Offline. This will occur when offline processing was in effect at the time the
   last restart record was written to the DBRA. Flag A was ON and Flag I was OFF. Flag C
   may be either ON or OFF.
   2.47.4. Restart Beginning-of-Day. This will occur when the AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity operator requests a return to online processing. Flag A was ON and
   will be set to OFF. Flags C and I were OFF. Date and transaction serial numbers will not be
   changed.
2.48. NGV214 Failure. If NGV214 fails due to hardware or a system crash, the previously
active document image file will be recovered automatically when the system is restarted. When
NGV214 does not appear to reactivate following a system restart, the following will occur. Wait
for another NTR device output to be queued by NGV211A, whereby NGV214 is activated and
automatic file recovery results.
2.49. NGV280. The following documentation is to be used to print NGV214 or NGV908
documents  in   the    print  queue    for   the   laser   or    bar code   printer.
@COPY,A 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV280,TPF$.                        @XQT NGV280
   2.49.1. Message Output Routine Environment (MORE). This processor allows programs to
   deliver printable messages in an efficient manner. MORE was developed for one specific
   problem; the uncontrolled buildup of outputs (QITEMS) waiting to be delivered to PIDs.
   NGV211A interfaces with MORE. NGV211A will determine if the documents should be
   passed to MORE or NGV214.
2.50. Classified Processing. No classified processing will be executed via the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity. To conform with the requirements of AFI 31-401,
Information Security Program Management, and AFI 14-303, Release of Intelligence to U.S.
Contractors, the Data Communications Processor (DCP) switch will be physically turned OFF at
the DMC main site, thus disconnecting all functional terminals from the DMC when classified
reports are being processed.

Section 2H—-Operators and SBSS Communications Interface

2.51. Overview. This section describes the various inputs available to the remote processing
station ( AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity) operator to control communications
with other supply terminals and change data on the BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) records.
2.52. Communications Inputs. There are four inputs to control/inquiry the communications
functions for SBSS terminals. A brief description of each follows:
   2.52.1. Online and Twilight Mode Terminal Control Input (COM REM). This input is used
   to control the operation of terminal functions. See Para 2.149 for input format.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   75


   2.52.2. Status. Displays various information on status of the database and contents of the
   BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) record. See Para 2.150 for input and output format.
   2.52.3. Terminal Message Input. Allows AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
   operator to send messages to any SBSS terminal. See Para 2.149 and Para 2.152 for
   input/output format.
   2.52.4. End. Changes the SBSS database from online to twilight (END-OF-DAY) mode.
   The END image processes an interactive communication interface (ICI) ready down
   (ICIRDYDN) if any system designator has an active automated data system interface.
2.53. Interactive Communication Interface (ICI). This processor provides the SBSS with the
capability to pass images to or receive images from another automated data system (ADS).
These inputs apply to any ADS interface that has the 001-ADS-ACTIVE-IND turned on. The
following are the two main ICI keyins used by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity to control the ICI processor:
   2.53.1. ICIRDYUP (ICI Ready Up). This input allows other ADSs to communicate directly
   with the SBSS. The ICIRDYUP input also checks the mailbox and passes any images in the
   mailbox to the SBSS for processing. Use this to start receiving inputs from any interfacing
   ADS.
   2.53.2. ICIRDYDN (ICI Ready Down). This input disconnects any ADS from directly
   interfacing with SBSS. When processed, any images passed by other ADSs will go into the
   mailbox. Use this to stop receiving inputs from any interfacing ADS.
       2.53.2.1. EXAMPLE:       If the 001-ADS-ACTIVE-IND for the Core Automated
       Maintenance System (CAMS) is turned on (001-CAMS-M = M) and you wish to stop
       receiving inputs from IMDS (that is, manual processing, supply transaction recovery
       (STR), etc.), then process an ICIRDYDN. Any inputs made by IMDS to the SBSS
       database will go to the mailbox instead of to the SBSS for processing. To resume
       accepting inputs from IMDS, process an ICIRDYUP (manual processing complete).
2.54. Limited ADP System Control Keyins. These keyins are used to inquire the status of,
change the processing sequence of, to delete or change sequence, or routing of print files
designated for the SBSS ADS. See Para. 2.154 for keyin format and description.

Section 2I—-Requisition Date, Releveling, Follow-up, File Status Control

2.55. Overview. Releveling, follow-up, and file status are performed under the control of the
online SBSS system support programs. Operator control over the assignment of requisition
dates, starting/stopping of releveling, follow-up, and file status is maintained by the processing
of a DAY image. See Para 2.155 for the DAY image format.
2.56. Requisition Date Control. The Julian date assigned to requisitions created by the SBSS
is updated by advancing the internally stored date. This is accomplished by specifying the
number of days the existing requisition date is to be advanced in position 4 of the DAY image.
The Julian date assigned to requisitions can be advanced from 1 to 9 days any time during the
online or twilight mode.
2.57. Requisition Serial Number Control. Requisition serial numbers are addressed in AFH
23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Whenever the requisition date is advanced, the requisition serial
 76                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


number will be reset to 0001. The serial number is displayed on a TIP page by the STATUS
command. The 002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-NBR field contains this data. Whenever you have
a mismatch in this field it can be corrected by processing the INT image through a canned
runstream.   This field can also be modified by processing the canned runstream
GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.NGVU72. If, however, NGVU72 is processed, it will set the 002 record
field 002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-NBR to equal 0001. NGVU72 is also processed in the
GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.CREATE/GV-TCB element.
2.58. Suppression of Releveling, Follow-up, File Status. See Para. 2.155 for these
procedures.
2.59. Restarting of Releveling, Follow-up, File Status. See Para. 2.155 for these procedures.
2.60. Day Image Control. All retail supply system-generated and manually initiated
requisitions must contain the current Julian date. Computer Operations section will normally
change the retail supply system date when the beginning-of-day (BOD) input is processed.
When Computer Operations specifies a date change, the requisition serial number is reset to
0001. The mandatory times for date changes are necessary to ensure depot requisitions and
MICAP START/STOP reporting contain accurate dates. Scheduling of releveling, follow-up,
and file status is the responsibility of LGLO and must be monitored by the LRS CC/AO and
major and subordinate commands. Every effort will be made to process releveling daily. Other
operations will be accomplished as frequently as operational circumstances dictate. The
LGRLO, in coordination with all affected flights, is responsible for the processing and
correctness of the DAY image.
2.61. Releveling and File Status Via Through Pseudo. To process releveling and file status
through the pseudo reader, the following is required:
   2.61.1. Creating a file containing the database keys of the records that require releveling or
   file status.
   2.61.2. Starting the required process by the DAY image.
   2.61.3. Loading and starting pseudo.
2.62. File Creation. To create the file containing releveling or file status keys, see Para 2.155
for the day image format or enter DAY for display of options. Program NGV268 will
dynamically start NGV208B, a batch program that will scan the item records and select those
records that qualify for the selected process. The database key (in decimal) for each record
selected is placed in a record which is written to a sequential file. After starting NGV208B,
program NGV268 will issue one of the following management notices:           312 MGT NOTICE -
FILE STATUS COMPLETED                 Note: 1. If FILE STATUS processed.                324 MGT
NOTICE - RELEVELING COMPLETED                                2. If RELEVELING processed.
315 MGT NOTICE - LIMITED RELEVELING COMPLETED                                   3. If restricted
RELEVELING processed.
   2.62.1. After NGV208B has created the required file, the following sample messages are
   produced:      ITEM RECORD SCAN INITIATED AT 090715 AND COMPLETED AT
   090919           TOTAL RECORDS SCANNED FOR PROCESSING WAS 13929 FILE

AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   77


   READY TO PROCESS THRU PSEUDO USE THE                                  FOLLOWING DATA:
   PSU1011LOAD 1GV0*LVL-FILE.
   2.62.2. If no records were selected, a message to this effect will be produced. Both files
   cannot be created at the same time. Create the LVL-FILE first then the XCS-FILE when
   both files are required for processing on the same day. The number of records in either file is
   always two greater than what is shown in the message produced by NGV208B. One is a
   message (MSG) to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator that
   processing has started and the other is an end of file record. To obtain a readout of the
   existing parameters, process a day image with DAY in positions 1 through 3 and 4 through
   80 blank.
2.63. Starting The Required Process. When ready to start releveling or file status, enter the
PSU transaction produced in the message from NGV208B.
2.64. Terminating Requirements Processing. When processing releveling or file status
through the pseudo reader and you wish to stop the process prior to normal completion, use the
console PSU keyin to stop the pseudo from processing. These transactions will remain on the
database in the specified pseudo until the process is restarted. To restart after stopping the
process with a day transaction, the following steps must be followed:
   2.64.1. Start the required pseudo using the PSU transaction that was used originally to start
   pseudo, but first remove the filename.
   2.64.2. The complete filename is composed of the qualifier and the filename. The qualifier
   is four positions long with the gang number as the first character followed by the constant
   GV0; that is, 1GV0. The filename used by releveling is LVL-FILE, while XCS-FILE is the
   filename for file status.
       2.64.2.1. EXAMPLE: 1GV0<ALN>*LVL-FILE. and 1GV0<ALN>*XCS-FILE.

Section 2J—-Pseudo Reader

2.65. Overview. The pseudo reader is a software feature which provides the capability of
simulating an input function during online processing. It was developed to aid the processing of
input images. The pseudo reader consists of the control programs, records, counters and a
dedicated area in the SBSS database record area (DBRA) which serves as repository for the
inputs to be processed.
2.66. Pseudo Functions. Inputs to be processed must first be loaded from images; for example,
bench stock, SNUD, status, or via a direct interface by an active program that creates output for
subsequent online processing. Loads to the pseudo reader area create read and write images on
system audit tape. Once loaded, the inputs will remain until processed or deleted. See Para
2.158 for job stream examples. Upon successful PSU LOAD, PSU DELETE, and PSU STA
processing, an S041 management notice will be typed on the AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity console. When total completion of processing has been accomplished, an
S042 management notice will be typed on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
console. To use the pseudo reader, see Para 2.156 through Para 2.161.

Section 2K—-Concurrent Processing
 78                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


2.67. Overview. This section provides concurrent online and reports (end-of-day) processing
for the Standard Base Supply System. Online processing will be terminated in an orderly
manner at the close of each SBSS business day, assuring completion of all transactions being
processed, while reports processing against transactions for the previous day's SBSS business is
being accomplished.
2.68. Scope. SBSS ADS concurrent processing uses a primary and secondary database concept
to segregate the SBSS database records when concurrent processing occurs and involves two
SBSS business day's transactions. When concurrent processing is initiated, the primary database
records are copied to the secondary database, freezing an image of all database records for
reports (end-of-day) processing. To maintain SBSS database integrity, a recovery point is
established at this phase in the process via an IRU dump of the secondary database records to
tape. If it becomes necessary to reestablish either the primary or secondary database, this
database (IRU) dump may be used as the recovery point. Once the primary database has been
copied successfully, reports that are required to be processed against the primary database are
accomplished to close out the current SBSS business day on the primary database.
   2.68.1. Upon input of the RPTEON select image against the primary database, full online
   transaction processing for the next SBSS business day can be initiated while reports for the
   previous SBSS business day are being processed on the secondary database. To terminate
   concurrent processing, after all required and scheduled reports have been processed
   successfully on the secondary database, input the RPTEON select image against the
   secondary database. All SBSS database records and record data elements which were
   updated on the secondary database are merged with the primary database.
   2.68.2. The resulting action allows all updated SBSS database records to reside on the
   primary database with full recovery capability. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7, S741
   through S748 management/reject notices, which pertain to SBSS concurrent processing.
2.69. Current Processing Sequence and Edits. The major processing sequence of events
required to concurrently process online transactions and reports are contained in the following
paragraphs:
   2.69.1. Initiation of Concurrent Processing. Concurrent processing is initiated by input of
   the RPTRUN runstream against the primary database (see Para. 2.160). Edits are performed
   to ensure that the current SBSS business day's online processing has been terminated in an
   orderly manner (END image has been processed and the special control record 002-FLAG-A
   field (transaction/batch mode flag) is set to a ]) and the secondary database has not been built
   for the current SBSS business day (special control record 002-FLAG-S field (secondary
   database flag) is set to 0). Before the primary database is copied to the secondary database,
   the base-constants-1 record on the primary database is checked to ensure that the database
   being copied is actually a primary database set for concurrent processing mode (001-
   PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG = P). Otherwise, the database copy action will not occur,
   nor will concurrent processing. This situation will only occur if the decision has been made
   to process ALL reports on the primary database prior to the next SBSS business day (online
   mode) being initiated (001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG = blank). If the 001-
   PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is equal to other than blank or P, an S745 reject notice
   (TYPE database IS INCORRECT) will be generated by program NGV801A.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                79


   2.69.2. The SBSS employs the gang-of-eight concept to support up to four separate SBSS
   accounts (S/D 01) on a single computer. Each account is provided two dedicated gangs:
   primary and secondary. The primary is available for online processing, twilight processing,
   and certain report programs. The secondary is used for mandatory and as-required report
   processing. Gang assignments are as follows:

Table 2.2. Gang Assignments.

PRIMARY       SECONDARY
GANG          GANG
    1                5
    2                6
    3                7
    4                8
   2.69.3. During the end-of-day process, once online and twilight processing have been
   completed for that processing date, the primary gang is placed into the reports mode by
   processing RPTRUN. The RPTRUN checks the ITMDTL area on the secondary gang. If it
   is cataloged, the ACOPY process is activated. If it is not cataloged, NGV898 will then
   catalog it and then start ACOPY, copying the primary gang to the secondary, changing the
   database keys to reflect the secondary area codes. RPTRUN puts the primary gang into the
   reports mode, and the primary is then available for processing. A dump is then performed on
   the secondary. Since the secondary is an exact copy of the primary, this dump can be
   reloaded to the primary or secondary if recovery becomes necessary. If this dump is used to
   reload the secondary database, it will be necessary to run NGV299 to set the 001-
   PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG to equal a secondary database (flag = S) since the flag is
   not set to an S by program NGV898C until after the secondary dump is taken. If the 002-
   ATH-IMPLEMENTED field equals a 1, the D37 is executed and a subsequent dump of
   primary areas CT-OWNR, CT-CTRL, and CT-HIST is performed.
   2.69.4. Secondary Database Build. During the secondary database build process, the
   primary database records areas are downed to ensure that no transaction processing occurs
   while the primary database records are being copied to the secondary database. An S741
   management notice (PRIMARY TO SECONDARY database BUILD IS IN PROGRESS) is
   generated by program NGV898C to inform the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity console operator that transaction processing is suspended pending completion of the
   primary to secondary database copy.
   2.69.5. Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) Tape Dump. The record field 002-ATH-
   IMPLEMENTED flag is checked for a 1 (one). If the 1 (one) is present, a tape dump of the
   primary CT-OWNR, CT-HIST and CT-CTRL areas (CTH areas) will be executed when
   position 79 and 80 of the primary RPTRUN input image are blank. All host LRS / materiel
   management activity accounts will process the daily RPTRUN with a B in position 79 to
   bypass the CTH during crossover. The S747 management notice (AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity OPERATOR ELECTED TO OMIT PRIMARY CTH
   AREA TAPE DUMP) is generated by program NGV898C to notify the LGLO that a tape
80                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  dump of the primary CTH area did not occur on the daily run of RPTRUN. Once a week, all
  host LRS / materiel management activity accounts will process RPTRUN with a blank in
  position 79 to create the CTH dump during crossover. The weekly CTH dump should be
  processed after the NDA500 “ALL” option to include the CTH area. A second dump of the
  CTH area should be avoided if the current CTH database is already dumped to tape. When
  an * (asterisk) is present in position 80 of the primary RPTRUN input image, the tape dump
  of the secondary database and the tape dump of the primary CTH areas will be bypassed.
  When this occurs, an S743 management notice (AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
  Activity OPERATOR ELECTED TO OMIT THE STANDARD DATABASE DUMP) and
  an S747 management notice are generated. Note: Costly recoveries can be avoided by
  closely monitoring the size and the number of months maintained in the CTH area. To
  maintain the size of your CTH database, process UTL041 and UTL042 in accordance with
  Ch 3. Always ensure a CTH dump is processed prior to processing UTL041 and UTL042.
  In the event a recovery is required, follow the instructions in Ch 3.
  2.69.6. Special Control Record. The special control record 002-FLAG-S field is set to a 1
  (secondary database is active prior to BOD on the primary database). An S742 management
  notice (PRIMARY database IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR PROCESSING) is generated by
  program NGV898C to inform the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator
  that processing can continue against the primary database. In addition, the second line of
  print on the S742 management notice will read: SECONDARY DATABASE WILL NOW
  BE DUMPED TO TAPE, unless the database (IRU) dump bypass option is selected
  (RPTRUN image, position 80 = ’*’). Only your MAJCOM or AFMC SCM-R Information
  Technology Activity can authorize the bypass option. After all required and scheduled
  reports have been processed successfully on the primary database, to include
  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x, and input of the RPTEON image, the primary
  database may be initialized for the next SBSS business day (online mode).
  2.69.7. SBSS Database Integrity. At the beginning of each concurrent processing day, the
  secondary database is dumped to tape via IRU. Coupled with the DMC system audit tapes,
  the primary or secondary database may be recovered independently, to any desired recovery
  point, without affecting other users of the SBSS ADS. The actual database dump occurs as a
  result of the RPTRUN image/runstream input (unless the database dump bypass option is
  selected). If the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator selects this
  option, an S743 management notice (AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
  OPERATOR TO OMIT THE STANDARD database DUMP) is generated by program
  NGV898C to notify Management and System Officer that the database dump did not occur.
  Extreme caution must be used when this option is selected, since the recovery start point will
  then be the last database dump taken and the tape dump of the primary CTH areas are
  bypassed. Bypass of the database dump and tape dump of the primary CTH areas is not
  authorized without prior approval from the host MAJCOM or Supply Systems Control
  Center.
  2.69.8. Secondary Database Processing. After the secondary database has been built and the
  database (IRU) dump (if taken) is completed, the 001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is
  set to an S. All areas of the secondary database are then ready for reports processing. At this
  point in the concurrent processing, an S744 management notice (SECONDARY
  DATABASE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR PROCESSING) will be generated by program
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   81


   NGV898C. After the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator has
   completed these actions, process database pointer verification on the secondary database by
   keying in the following command statement:                                           @XQT
   DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                    Note: Take applicable option as outlined in Ch 3.
   This must be executed in order to audit the database dump in the event it becomes necessary
   to reload the database records to either the primary or secondary database for recovery
   purposes. Normal reports processing can then resume according to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
   Ch 5.
   2.69.9. Secondary to Primary Database Update. After all required and scheduled reports
   have been processed successfully against the secondary database, and it is desired to close
   out the reports processing day, the RPTEON image is processed against the secondary
   database. This will overlay records and record fields that were updated from the secondary
   reports. Special control record data fields updated at this point are:
       2.69.9.1. 002-FLAG-S is set to an asterisk (*) on the secondary database (RPTEON has
       been processed on the secondary database).
       2.69.9.2. 002-FLAG-S is updated on the primary database. If 002-FLAG-S = 1,
       indicating the primary database is still in reports mode, 002-FLAG-S is set to a 2. If 002-
       FLAG-S = 2, indicating that RPTEON has been processed and BOD has occurred on the
       primary database, 002-FLAG-S is set to 0 (secondary database inactive).
   2.69.10. S746 Reject Notice. An S746 reject notice (REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN
   COMPLETED ON THE SECONDARY database) will be output to the AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity console for the following conditions:
       2.69.10.1. The RPTRUN image has been processed against the primary database. The
       RPTEON image has not been processed against the secondary database. (The AFMC
       SCM-R Information Technology Activity console operator is attempting to initiate the
       next SBSS processing (reports mode) day prior to completion of the current processing
       day.)
       2.69.10.2. The RPTRUN image has been processed against the primary database, but
       BOD has not been initiated; however, the RPTEON image has been processed against the
       secondary database. (The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console
       operator must process the RPTEON select image against the primary database.) The
       generation of the S746 reject notice will prevent any attempt to allow two concurrent
       processing’s to occur at the same time and prevents any damage to the primary database
       reports sequence control record to result after RPTEON has been processed on the
       primary database.
2.70. Restart Procedures. The following events should be analyzed when attempting to restart
specific jobs during concurrent processing:
   2.70.1. RPTRUN. During the initiation of concurrent processing, both the primary and
   secondary databases are down (inaccessible) from processing while the secondary database is
   being built. If an operating system failure occurs during this time frame, it will be necessary
   to process the following runstream to UP the primary database record areas:
       2.70.1.1. @ADD,L 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x (x = applicable gang)
 82                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.70.2. Reinput the RPTRUN Runstream. This will cause the primary to secondary database
   build process to reinitiate.
   2.70.3. Secondary Database Dump in Progress. If an operating system failure occurs,
   initiate the standard database dump against the secondary database. Ensure record field 001-
   PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is equal to S. If not, use NGV299 to correctly set the
   001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG to S. Resume normal processing.
   2.70.4. RPTEON Processing on the Secondary Database. If an operating system failure
   occurs during this time frame, correct the error condition and reinput the RPTEON
   runstream. RPTEON on the secondary database overlays data; it does not update.
2.71. Recovery Procedures. In the event it becomes necessary to recover database areas on
either the primary or secondary database, a thorough research must be accomplished prior to any
attempt to recover the database. Since there are too many conditions to describe, each recovery
situation may be unique to itself. The different types of recoveries may require STR (Supply
Transaction Recovery) or IRU reloads of the database, audit trail tape recovery or any
combination of the three.
2.72. IRU Dumps During Extended Online Processing. When an online processing session is
continued for more than the normal processing day, an IRU dump should be taken during this
session. This dump should be taken at approximately the same time the normal end-of-day
would have occurred. This dump would serve to significantly shorten recovery time in the event
a recovery is later required. This dump should always be followed by a verification of the
database. There must be no READ errors on dump tapes. The difference between a READ and
WRITE error is the WRITE error will cause the tape to back-up and recheck the last write action.
In other words, if the tape’s read and write is okay then you have a good tape. If the tape’s read
is okay and a write error occurs, then the tape may still be okay, however, caution must be used
if these are excessive. If the tape’s read is bad, then the read error is unacceptable. Thus, READ
errors cannot be read by IRU or ACOPY. Consequently, any recovery attempted with these
tapes may not be successful.

Section 2L—-Operating Procedures

2.73. Overview. This section contains a screen format for each TRIC/DIC that is authorized for
input by this manual. Also available is a GENERAL PURPOSE SCREEN, which can be used to
enter data for any TRIC/DIC. Screen displays consist of 24 lines, and each line contains 80
character positions. Lines 1-20 display data fields; information is entered in these fields by
personnel. Lines 21-24 display reject and management notices. These notices are automatically
printed by the computer when they exceed the three display lines.
2.74. Terminal Sign-On/Sign-Off Procedures. Before you can sign on to the computer, you
must take the following actions. Remember, as the microcomputer technology changes so will
these procedures.                   Turn on the terminal.                     Turn on the printer.
Load the computer with the forms that you will need.                      Check the page number
displayed in the lower left corner of your screen.         The screen is referred to as the visual
display unit (terminal) throughout the remainder of this section.      Note: The page number is
displayed, and then continue by taking the following appropriate actions:
   2.74.1. If the page number is one, take the following actions:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               83


     2.74.1.1. Press the CONTROL PAGE function key. The following display will appear
     on your terminal:            (**PRINT*)STA- (**XFER*)PRNT (PRNT) XFER(ALL)
     XMIT(CHAN)MM (PARAM)                        ( /P1/ )ADR- ( / / )SEARCH (            )(/)
     Note: If the display on your terminal is different from the display above, you must enter
     the correct data before proceeding. For additional guidance, see UP (Unisys Publication)
     9142, Terminal Operators Guide.
     2.74.1.2. Press the CONTROL PAGE function key when the control page parameters are
     correct. The control page parameters will disappear.
  2.74.2. If the page number is two, take the following actions:
     2.74.2.1. Press the PAGE function key. Page number one will now be displayed in the
     lower left corner of your terminal.
     2.74.2.2. Press the XMIT function key to begin the sign-on procedure. Your terminal
     will display this message: ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD.
  2.74.3. Enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD. You have only three tries to enter your USER-
  ID/PASSWORD. However, if you have automatic sign-on implemented, then you only have
  two tries to enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD. In either case, if you incorrectly enter your
  USER-ID/PASSWORD in all tries, the system will deactivate your terminal (your PID for
  the terminal will be marked down). If your terminal is deactivated, you must contact the
  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator before you can proceed. The
  purpose of the USER-ID and PASSWORD is as follows:
     2.74.3.1. Your USER-ID is a unique word or code that prevents unauthorized users from
     gaining access to your files. Although entered, your USER-ID will not appear on your
     terminal.
     2.74.3.2. Your PASSWORD is a unique word or code that identifies you as the person
     seeking to use the computer.
     2.74.3.3. Press the XMIT function key. When your USER-ID/PASSWORD have been
     accepted by the computer, the SYSTEM MENU SCREEN will appear on your terminal.
     2.74.3.4. Press the TAB function key until the cursor is positioned at the first input
     position of the SCREEN MENU # field.
     2.74.3.5. Enter the screen number or screen name of your choice.
     2.74.3.6. Press the XMIT function key. The screen requested will be displayed on your
     terminal. Note: If you leave the SCREEN MENU # field blank and then press the XMIT
     function key, the MAIN MENU SCREEN will be displayed on your terminal.
  2.74.4. Terminal Shut-Down Procedures. Take the following actions:
     2.74.4.1. Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key.
     2.74.4.2. Enter $$CLOSE after the SOE prompt >.
     2.74.4.3. Press the XMIT function key.
     2.74.4.4. Press the SOE function key.
     2.74.4.5. Enter $$SOFF after the SOE prompt >.
 84                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       2.74.4.6. Press the XMIT function key. Your terminal is now shut down.
   2.74.5. Single and Multiscreens. The SBSS uses two kinds of screens, single screens and
   multiscreens, which are defined as follows:
       2.74.5.1. Single Screens. These screens use one screen input to complete a transaction.
       For example, a new item record load can be processed with the screen name FIL and the
       screen number 442. All data needed to process this transaction must be entered into the
       screen before they are transmitted from the terminal to the computer.
       2.74.5.2. Multiscreens. These screens use two screen inputs to process a transaction.
       The first screen is an inquiry screen, which collects data from stored detail records. The
       second screen is built from these collected data. Transactions are processed with the
       minimum number of data entry requirements. An example of a multiscreen is as follows:
       first screen--#INQ REC (screen name), or #058 (screen number); second screen--
       #REC/059.
2.75. Menus. When you do not know the specific name or number of a screen, and it is not
listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, you can still call the screen to your terminal by working
through a list of program choices (menus). You must enter a choice from each menu until the
desired screen appears on your terminal. There are four types of menus, defined below.
   2.75.1. System Menu. Use this menu to call any screen used by the computer to your
   terminal. The System Menu is first displayed on your terminal just after you enter your
   USER-ID/PASSWORD when you sign on to the computer. To recall this menu to your
   terminal at any time, take these actions:
       2.75.1.1. Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key.
       2.75.1.2. Enter MENU after the SOE prompt >.
       2.75.1.3. Press the XMIT function key.
   2.75.2. Main Menu. This menu displays major screen topics. You may call this menu to
   your terminal by selecting it from the System Menu or, select the Main Menu by taking the
   following actions:
       2.75.2.1. Press the SOE function key.
       2.75.2.2. Enter #MAINMENU (screen name), or #001 (screen number) after the SOE
       prompt >.
       2.75.2.3. Press the XMIT function key.
   2.75.3. Topic Menu. This menu groups similar functions by topic name. For example, turn-
   in screens are listed in topic menu # TURNIN; issue screens in # ISSUE. Major screen
   topics are listed on the Main Menu. To call a screen topic to your terminal, take the
   following actions:
       2.75.3.1. Move the cursor to the topic of your choice.
       2.75.3.2. Press the XMIT function key.
   2.75.4. Specific Topic Menu. This menu lists topic screens under the topic name, such as
   ISSUES. The Specific Topic Menu also provides for each screen its name and a description
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                      85


   of how it is used. For example, the menu provides the following information: # ISUCE
   Civil Engineering issue, type org code A or B non-MICAP. Specific topics are listed on the
   Topic Menu. To call a specific topic to your terminal, take these actions:
       2.75.4.1. Move the cursor to the specific topic of your choice.
       2.75.4.2. Press the XMIT function key.
2.76. Selecting Specific Screens For Display. You can call a specific screen to your terminal
whether or not you know the screen's name or number. Take the appropriate actions, as follows:
   2.76.1. Screen's Name or Number Is Known. Before you can call a specific screen to your
   terminal, you must first obtain the screen's name or number from AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
   Screen names are directly related to a TRIC/DIC and its intended use. For example, #ISUCE
   is the screen name for an issue request for Civil Engineering. Once you have obtained the
   screen's name or number, take the following actions:
       2.76.1.1. Move the cursor to the first open screen line.
       2.76.1.2. Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key.
       2.76.1.3. Enter the screen's name (#ISUCE) or number (#085) after the SOE prompt >.
       2.76.1.4. Press the XMIT function key.
   2.76.2. Screen's Name or Number Is Not Known. If you do not know the specific name or
   number of a screen, and it is not listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, you can still call the
   screen to your terminal. You must work through a list of program choices (menus).
2.77. Entering and Transmitting Data (Types of Data). A displayed screen contains two
types of data, protected and unprotected, which are defined as follows:
   2.77.1. Protected Data. This data is already entered and you cannot change it. For example,
   the screen name, screen number, and data field name are protected data.
   2.77.2. Unprotected Data. You can enter and change this data. For example, the
   prepositioned initial value data (data entered on the screen by the computer) and the
   information that you enter in each field are unprotected data.
   2.77.3. Entering Data. When you call a detail screen to your terminal, the cursor moves to
   the first character position of the first field in which you will enter data. As you enter data in
   a field, the cursor advances from left to right. When you have entered the maximum number
   of characters in a field, the cursor automatically moves to the first character position of the
   next field on your terminal. If you do not enter enough characters in a field to fill it, you
   must press the TAB function key to advance the cursor to the next field.
   2.77.4. Transmitting Data. When you have entered a certain amount of data and want it
   registered in the computer, you must press the XMIT function key. Data which precede the
   SOE prompt > or follow the cursor are not transmitted. If an SOE prompt is not visible on
   your terminal, all unprotected data from the top left corner of your terminal (home cursor
   position) to the cursor character position are registered in the computer when you press the
   XMIT function key.
   2.77.5. Refreshing the Screen. A screen feature exists to bring back the input data on the
   screen. This occurs whether the transaction processed or not. On top of the screen where the
 86                                                         AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   screen number is shown (i.e., /058), simply replace the slash (/) with an R (i.e., R058) and
   then enter the data that you want to reprocess.
2.78. Special Screen Functions. After you have transmitted data from your terminal to the
computer and that input has been processed, your screen will be refreshed. In other words, the
last screen you used before transmitting the data is redisplayed on your terminal under program
control. When you press the PRINT function key, data on your terminal between the last Start-
of-Entry prompt (>) and the current cursor position is printed. If an SOE prompt is not visible on
your terminal, data from the top left corner of your terminal (home cursor position) to the current
cursor position is printed. Data entered in quantity fields is right-justified. When the data
entered does not fill all the character positions, the field is zero-filled. Under these
circumstances, do not enter leading zeros in the field.
2.79. Error Notices. Correctable Reject/Management Notices.
   2.79.1. Operator Correctable Errors. The errors represented by the following SBSS
   reject/management notices can be corrected by you. These notices are defined in AFH 23-
   123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7. Refer to your reject notice file 0GV00000*REJNOT. for applicable
   rejects.
   2.79.2. Correcting an error.
       2.79.2.1. Move the cursor to the field that contains the error.
       2.79.2.2. Enter the correct data.
       2.79.2.3. Move the cursor past the last data field used in the screen.
       2.79.2.4. Press the XMIT function key.
   2.79.3. Displaying a New Screen. To display a new screen, you must take the following
   actions. If an empty screen line is available, take these actions:
       2.79.3.1. Move the cursor to an empty screen line.
       2.79.3.2. Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key.
       2.79.3.3. Enter the # screen name or # screen number after the SOE prompt >.
       2.79.3.4. Press the XMIT function key.
       2.79.3.5. If an empty screen line IS NOT AVAILABLE, take these actions:
       2.79.3.6. Clear the terminal by pressing the CURSOR TO HOME function key.
       2.79.3.7. Press twice simultaneously the UPPER function key and the ERASE DIS
       function key.
       2.79.3.8. Non-operator correctable reject/management notices. Reject notices other than
       those listed above are printed automatically under program control. The screen you used
       last will then reappear on your terminal.
       2.79.3.9. System Error Notices. In addition to the SBSS reject/management notices
       defined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 the following system error notices may result
       when you attempt to call a screen to your terminal:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   87


           2.79.3.9.1. Invalid Screen Request. This error notice appears on your terminal when
           you have entered an invalid screen name or number.
           2.79.3.9.2. Screen Not Yet Implemented. This error notice appears on your terminal
           when you have entered a screen name that is listed on a menu, but which is not yet
           ready for use.
           2.79.3.9.3. ****System error nn, field xx, name yyyy. This error message gives you
           the following information:
               2.79.3.9.3.1. nn = The error number (see the chart below).
               2.79.3.9.3.2. xx = The field that contains the error.
               2.79.3.9.3.3. yyyy = The first four characters of the screen's name.
       2.79.3.10. Error Numbers. If one of the following error numbers is displayed on your
       terminal, verify and then reenter the data containing the error. If you receive the same
       error message again, you must contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
       Activity operator and describe the error before proceeding.

Section 2M—-Tape Management

2.80. Overview. Tape management is an important aspect of AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity operations. By operating with faulty tapes, valuable computer data may be
lost in the event that recovery of this data is necessary. Numerous amounts of write errors or any
read errors should be researched and corrected as soon as possible. The cataloging of tapes on
the system provides a tracking mechanism for identification of specific tape reel numbers to
specific file-IDS. It also provides for automatically requesting the host DMC operator to mount
the correct tape number(s) when/if a magnetic tape file-ID is used as input on a subsequent
runstream.

2.81. Cataloged Files. As with all other DMC cataloged files, the ability to cycle these tape
files exist. From 1 to 32 cycles may be retained in the master file directory (MFD). These
cycles may be referenced as the following examples depict:
   2.81.1. @PRT,F A*A. This would produce a printout of the MFD information associated
   with the current cycle of file A*A. This would include tape reel numbers if it were a
   cataloged tape file.
   2.81.2. @PRT,F A*A(-1). This would produce a printout of the MFD information
   associated with the minus one generation or cycle (the cycle immediately preceding the
   current generation).
   2.81.3. @PRT,F A*A(7). This would produce a printout of the MFD information associated
   with a specific file cycle, cycle number 7.
   2.81.4. Additional information on file cycling may be found in UP 4144, EXEC SYSTEM
   PROGRAMMER REFERENCE. If a type file catalog entry is deleted or lost by a recovery
   process, the catalog entry for a tape file may be reestablished by using the following
   processes. These processes should be used only when the MFD entry recording the tape's
   current utilization has been lost and the physical tape reel(s) themselves have not been
   destroyed or written over. If the correct tape reel numbers are known, then enter:
       2.81.4.1. @CAT,PV qualifier*filename(+1).,U9,xxx/yyy..../zzz                 Note: Where
       xxx, yyy, and zzz are replaced by the appropriate tape reel numbers.
2.82. Tape Accountability. Accurate tape accountability procedures must         be followed to
ensure positive control over tape input/output within the SBSS ADS on the       DMC. Manual
records must be available for research and recovery. Although AF Form 2006,     Tape Utilization
Log, is not mandatory, recommend using a formal log to keep track of all        AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity tape requirements.
2.83. Tape Records. Historical data on all tapes produced on the DMC are the responsibility of
the DMC chief. All tapes used by LRS / materiel management activity are recorded in the
System for Tape Administration and Reporting (STAR), 1100 tape library system. It is not
mandatory to record tape numbers on AF Form 2006; however, a formal log will make a quick
reference for input/output tape utilization. There are four methods to obtain tape file
information.
   2.83.1. @PRT,F on tape filename (if cataloged tape file).
   2.83.2. @ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.TAPE-NBR/GV-x .x equals gang

2.84. IRU Dumps. The IRU process is the only tool used by the SBSS to dump the database.
This provides backup security for both the primary and secondary gangs. There is a runstream
available in 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. to dump the database: IRUDUMP/GV-x. All dump tape
numbers and audit trail tape numbers are stored in IRU history files (see Para. 2.165 for dumps
and Para 2.167 for audit tapes). Also, you may elect to process IRU dumps with the DUMP
CHANGES options. See UP (Unisys publication) 7830 8194-000 for the DUMP CHANGES
and RELOAD CHANGES options.
2.85. EXEC Files. The recovery of cataloged disk files which are not under the control of the
DMS 1100 (Database Management System) are supported using a variety of procedures. These
procedures are described below:
   2.85.1. The simplest of procedures is the processing of a standard SBSS runstream which re-
   creates the file to be recovered. The files this procedure applies to and the runstreams to
   process are documented in Para 2.163. To re-create a file, prior to processing a runstream,
   verify that the files necessary to process the runstream as documented in Para 2.164 are
   present on the system.
   2.85.2. A second procedure used to backup disk files and provide a recovery capability is
   provided by the host DMC. This is accomplished by the host DMC via a standard utility
   referred to as the File Administrative Processor (FAS). The local DMC is responsible for
   establishing dates and times when files are backed up via the @FAS process. Coordination
   between the Supply Systems Monitor and the host DMC should be accomplished to
   determine what files will be saved and the frequency the @FAS process will be
   accomplished.
   2.85.3. The third method used to provide disk file backup capability is provided via standard
   SBSS runstreams. These runstreams use standard Executive Control Language (ECL),
   specifically @COPY,GM to create backup tapes for files retained on disk. These backup
   tapes are created as a secondary backup measure.
   2.85.4. If it becomes necessary to recover a file listed in Para 2.163 and it cannot be re-
   created by processing a standard runstream, the primary means of recovery should be to
   request the host DMC recover the file from the latest saveall tape. However, it should be
   verified that the date/time of the @FAS backup tape to be used in the recovery operation is
   subsequent to the backup tapes created by processing the applicable SBSS runstreams. If the
   SBSS created backup tape is the most current of the two backup tape sources, the file should
   be recovered from the SBSS created backup tape. Para 2.163 defines processing frequency
   and recovery processes using the backup procedures listed in this paragraph.
2.86. ACOPY Processing Instructions. ACOPY is used to reload a dump to a gang other than
the gang that was originally dumped. It is also used anytime you wish to delete the database
prior to reloading a particular gang. Also, ACOPY is the only way you can cross gangs with a
database dump. ACOPY converts the DBK of each record to the correct area, page, and record.
Prior to starting 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.ACOPY, element 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SGS must
 90                                                   AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


be modified to pass the gang number dumped on the tape and the gang number you wish to
recover.
   2.86.1. The first IRU tape number must also be provided. An example of element SGS
   follows:
      2.86.1.1. >ACOPY GANG Y TO Z
      2.86.1.2. >FIRST IRU TAPE IS XXXXXX
      2.86.1.3. If gang five was dumped on tape number B00024, and you want to reload it to
      gang one, simply change Y to equal gang five, Z to equal gang one, and XXXXXX to
      equal B00024. For multiple reels, separate with a /B00999/B08888/B0777. The
      following is one example of a ACOPY runstream:
         2.86.1.3.1. >@RUN,A ACOPY,,xGV0                 . x = gang number

           2.86.1.3.22. >@FIN
   2.86.2. Processing Logic. ACOPY downs, deletes, catalogs, copies, and then it ups the
   particular database being recovered. It then reads the dump tape, copying the areas from the
   tape to disk. When recovering to a gang other than the gang that was dumped, ACOPY reads
   the database keys of the records on the dump and changes the area codes to equate to the
   gang being reloaded prior to copying the areas.
2.87. Supply Transaction Recovery (STR). The prime method of recovering the SBSS
database is with the Integrated Recovery Utility (IRU) recover command. The major causes of a
STR results either from bad tapes or improper operating procedures. If an excessive amount of
read/write errors persist on output tapes, the tape librarian must be notified. In the case of
improper operating procedures, training will eliminate this problem. However, there are cases
where a STR is necessary.
2.88. STR Coordination. It is imperative that the DECC, AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity, Accounting and Finance, and LRS / materiel management activity
personnel, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, MAJCOM all become very
involved prior to and during this procedure. It is strongly recommended that personnel from
each area assemble together to review these procedures and work together to ensure the database
is rebuilt in a correct and stable manner. If bad or unreadable tapes are encountered, STR will
abort. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must then utilize ATTANL to print
the area on the tape where the error occurred. Close analysis to the ATTANL printout is needed
to extract the last good time a transaction was created both before and after the tape error. This
will require the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel to use extreme
caution in generating each of the recovery input files.
   2.88.1. Special Note. Bases should consider at this point using times slots to build the
   recovery files to limit the number of inputs in each file. If you elect this option, when you
   get an end-of-job for NGVU60, the files should be copied into another file (that is,
   xGV0*TXFILE. copied into xGV0*TX1.) for the first run. Filenames should be unique in
   all cases. STR uses local time for input but converts this to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)
   from the tape.
   2.88.2. STR Recovery Process. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity room
   will determine the start and stop times necessary for the STR recovery and reestablish the
   SBSS database up to the time that the STR will be required. That is, RELOAD back a clean
   and valid database dump and if necessary, audit trail recover up to the start of STR. Once the
   database is ready, IRUDUMP, process NDA500, and STR all audit trail tapes required, hold
   the output files for the Degraded Operations team. The Degraded Operations team will
   assemble and review the output listing for validity and sequencing of inputs. Once the file(s)
   are ready for input, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will pseudo load
   these images, hold all rejects for the Degraded Operations team. Under no circumstance
   should these images be replayed without a person or persons having an in-depth knowledge
   about the SBSS.
   2.88.3. STR Versus IRU Recovery. One important note; once you have started a STR
   recovery, you must finish with a STR recovery. You cannot process STR, IRU, then STR.
   These will leave you with an invalid database.

2.89. File Usage.
   2.89.1. The following files must be present for STR to operate correctly:
       2.89.1.1. 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. contains all the necessary ECL runstreams to start
       and execute NGV291, STR EDITOR.
       2.89.1.2. 0GV00000*DBALIB$. contains all the absolutes necessary to execute the jobs
       involved with the STR process.
       2.89.1.3. TIP$*SCRNF177. contains all the SBSS tip screen formats.
   2.89.2. The work files created during the execution of NGVU60 are as follows:
       2.89.2.1. x equals primary gang.
       2.89.2.2. xGV0*REL-D-FILE
       2.89.2.3. xGV0*REL-K-FILE
       2.89.2.4. xGV0*901-D-FILE
       2.89.2.5. xGV0*901-K-FILE
       2.89.2.6. xGV0*TXFILE
       2.89.2.7. xGV0*1BS-TXFILE
       2.89.2.8. xGV0*NGVU60-PRT
       2.89.2.9. xGV0*NGVU60-SUM
       2.89.2.10. xGV0*NGVU60-901
2.90. Description and Operating Procedures. The following information provides sufficient
operating instructions to allow the user to recover an SBSS database in the event of failure in the
IRU process.
   2.90.1. Description. The first step in the STR recovery is to execute NGVU60 from an
   AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity demand terminal. NGVU60 reads the audit
   trail tape or tapes and creates a work file (xGV0*TXFILE.) containing SBSS transactions
   that are to be replayed using the SBSS pseudo reader. NGVU60 creates three different print
   files. They are as follows:
       2.90.1.1. The Detail Print Report (xGV0*NGVU60-PRT.). This is a listing of inputs.
       This report lists additional information about each transaction such as the input PID, date
       and time, and the audit trail STEP-ID of the original input message. The audit trail
       STEP-ID is a method the audit trail logging process uses to tie a different process
       associated with one step or message together. By using the STEP-ID (a 12-position
       number), 901 transaction histories can be researched in the 901 portion of the printed
       listing. All transactions created by an input will have the same STEP-ID. The 901
       portion is output in STEP-ID sequence.
       2.90.1.2. The Summary Print Report (xGV0*NGVU60-SUM.). This is a summary of all
       audit trail tapes as they are read. Information on previous, current, and next audit trail
       numbers, date and time mounted and demounted, and number of records read are shown.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  93


     2.90.1.3. The Transaction History Report. This report lists each 901-TRANSACTION-
     HISTORY record logged on the audit trail tape during the specified recovery period. The
     user can tie transaction histories listed on the report back to the original input listed on
     the Detail Print Report with the STEP-ID.
  2.90.2. Delete File. NGVU60 creates a delete file. This file is used to delete all work files
  once the recovery is complete. This job should be started by the AFMC SCM-R Information
  Technology Activity console operator once notified the STR recovery has been completed
  and the SBSS ADS is back online and operational.
  2.90.3. TIP File 177. NGVU60 uses the TIP$*SCRNF177. as an index to rebuild the image
  from a screen format into an input image. Since TIP$*SCRNF177. is always the current
  screens you have loaded, NGVU60 will format these images with the correct fields.
  2.90.4. Editing Output. The next step in the STR process is the editing of the transaction file
  (xGV0*TXFILE.). The user will use NGV291 to edit this file. Note: Do not attempt to use
  conversational time sharing (cts) or editor for the review. These processes will truncate data
  of any input that is greater than 80/320 characters. After all appropriate corrected
  transactions have been added to the transaction file, the transactions may be split into small
  files so they can be replayed through the SBSS pseudo. Once all transactions have been
  recovered, the user should perform whatever post-processing is necessary to determine if a
  successful database has been recovered. NGV291 will be explained in detail later in this
  chapter.
  2.90.5. Operating Instructions. The following information is intended to provide the user
  with a detailed discussion of each of the steps of the STR process:
     2.90.5.1. STR requires specific information to perform the above functions. To use STR,
     the ALN (access location number), the ADS-ID (1GV, 2GV, 3GV or 4GV), the
     beginning and ending audit trail tape number(s), the starting and ending times, and the
     output print queue for the recovery period will be required. It is imperative that this
     information be gathered and is accurate PRIOR to start of the recovery process.
     2.90.5.2. ALN. Due to multiple gangs being stacked on the same ALN, you must know
     which ALN you are assigned. The command @WHOAMI will determine this for you.
     You cannot use the ALN 0000, since this is an exempt ALN; you will pull transactions
     not belonging to your particular ALN or gang. You must be signed on to your ALN to
     process STR.
     2.90.5.3. ADS-ID. This is a three-character identification code of the ADS being
     recovered. The first position of the ADS-ID is the gang number (1 through 4 only). The
     last two positions are the constant GV, which denote SBSS transactions only.
     2.90.5.4. Start/End Date/Time. Since the DMC operates on local and GMT (Greenwich
     Meantime) it is imperative you use local versus GMT time. The audit trail tape will
     record the transactions under GMT. Be sure of your start/stop date and times BEFORE
     executing the STR process. NGVU60 will query for local start/stop times.
     2.90.5.5. Beginning/Ending Audit Trail Numbers. The audit trail numbers must consist
     of a six-position input reel number. Audit trail research must be accomplished in a
 94                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       correct manner. IRU can give you the most accurate listing of the audit trail report. Use
       the following to display audit trail tapes:
           2.90.5.5.1. @IRU                               activate IRU processor
           2.90.5.5.2. REPORT ACI ALL; ACT;               or REPORT ACI LAST 15;
           2.90.5.5.3. ACT;                               execute IRU commands
           2.90.5.5.4. @EOF                               exit IRU
           2.90.5.5.5. Use the following to display all audit trail tapes numbers:
               2.90.5.5.5.1. @IRU                              activate IRU processor
               2.90.5.5.5.2. REPORT AUDIT ALL; ACT;            or REPORT AUDIT LAST 15;
               2.90.5.5.5.3. ACT;                               execute IRU commands
               2.90.5.5.5.4. @EOF                               exit IRU
       2.90.5.6. Printer Device. Self-explanatory. This should be your dummy queue of where
       to SYM the output reports.
2.91. Initiation of STR. STR is initiated by the following key-in:
       @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU60
When STR begins, the following message will be displayed:
==================================
====      NGVU60 STR REV: 01           ====
==================================
STR Prompts. STR will now prompt for the processing parameters. The following display will
ask for the ADS-ID:
ENTER 3 POSITION
The operator must enter a valid ADS-ID. If in error, the prompt will be displayed again. Once a
valid ADS-ID has been accepted, the operator is asked to enter the audit trail tape number that
the recovery is to begin with. The following message will be displayed:
ENTER AUDIT TRAIL TAPE REEL NUMBER
If the operator enters an invalid response, STR will again ask for the tape number with the above
message. Next, the operator will be asked to enter the starting date and time of the recovery
period with the following message:
USE LOCAL DATE/TIME. DO NOT USE GMT DATE/TIME. –
ENTER START DATE/TIME IN FOLLOWING FORMAT
MM/DD/YYYY HR:MN After accepting the valid start date and time, STR will ask for the
ending start date and time of the recovery period with the following message:
ENTER STOP DATE/TIME IN FOLLOWING FORMAT
MM/DD/YYYY HR:MN
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                      95


If either starting or ending dates or times are invalid, an error message will be displayed and the
operator must, again, keyin a valid date and/or time. After all above messages have properly
been answered, the following message will be displayed for output queue:
ENTER PRINTER DEVICE-ID
Enter output queue for listings and the following message will be displayed:

4 - ROUND TAPE, 9 TRACK                   "NT" (NTV,NTS)


WHAT IS YOUR OPTION" (1/2/3/4)


Contact your DMC about what type of tape you are using. Once you determine and input the
type of tape you are using, the below message will display:
 96                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


AUDIT TRAIL ASSIGN (ASG) WILL BE:


"@ASG,T SYS$*AUDIT$01.,U9V,XXXXXX,1800 .                  " (XXXXXX = tape number)


IS THE ABOVE ASG CORRECT? (Y/N)
Enter "Y" to start your recovery, and "N" to exit the program.
2.92. Processing NGVU60. STR (NGVU60) will read all applicable audit trail tapes and
extract all messages for input ADS, reel number, start and ending times. These messages are
then read against SCRNF177 for applicable format. By using the current screen file, STR edits
the image, which is written to audit trail in screen format and then built into an 80-position image
for reinput. These images are produced in the same sequence in which they were originally
created.
   2.92.1. Once all messages, both pseudo and TIP messages have been extracted from tape, the
   following will be displayed on the console:
       2.92.1.1. THE DELETE FILE IS xGV0*DEL-FILE.
       2.92.1.2. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE RECOVERY, THE
       2.92.1.3. FOLLOWING START COMMAND SHOULD BE
       2.92.1.4. ENTERED FROM THE CONSOLE
       2.92.1.5. @ADD,L xGV0*DEL-FILE.
       2.92.1.6. THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE WORK FILES
       2.92.1.7. CREATED BY NGVU60
   2.92.2. The deletion file is used to delete all files created by STR. This job should be started
   only after the complete STR processed is finished and the AFMC SCM-R Information
   Technology Activity resumes normal SBSS processing. That is, the database has been
   recovered and verified in a stable state. The following notes will apply when the edit is being
   performed:
       2.92.2.1. STR will not build your input images for twilight processing. The listing of
       transaction histories (901-records) will reflect these, but there will not be images in your
       XGV0*TXFILE. These inputs are all read by batch programs (i.e., FME/NGV580).
       These inputs will require being re-created and reprocessed manually.
       2.92.2.2. Any database alterations (NGV299) processing will have to be accomplished as
       FIX input images are not written to audit trail tape. Database AFTERLOOKS are not
       used by NGV299.
       2.92.2.3. Ensure that the Supply Interface System (SIFS) collector and all related SIFS
       processing is suspended until completion of the applicable STR recovery period. Also be
       sure that an ICIRDYDOWN has been processed to preclude any interruptions by any
       other ADS activity. If STR cannot identify the next tape number to be used, the
       following message will be displayed:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   97


          2.92.2.3.1. STR HAS REACHED THE END OF THE TAPE XXXXXX.
          2.92.2.3.2. THE NEXT REEL NUMBER ON THAT TAPE CONTAINS
          2.92.2.3.3. @@@@@@ THEREFORE, THE NEXT REEL NUMBER CANNOT
          2.92.2.3.4. BE IDENTIFIED. DO YOU WANT ANOTHER TAPE MOUNTED (Y
          OR N)?
       2.92.2.4. This usually indicates the DMC operator manually closed out the audit trail
       tape when it was active. Obtain the next reel number to be used from the DMC operator.
       Answer Y for STR to continue. It will then prompt you to enter the next reel number.
       2.92.2.5. If the next reel number is not readily available, answer N. The STR will
       process data from the tapes already read in this session. Once the next reel is known and
       available, just start another run of STR using this reel number as the beginning tape
       number. Remember, if you do this before processing the inputs created by the first STR
       run, catalog and copy off all of your STR files to keep from corrupting or losing them. If
       multiple reels are used with STR, verify audit trail listing displays open and swaps for a
       continuous run. If an audit trail tape is closed NGVU60 will stop. If you have multiple
       reels with STR, recommend only using two tapes for each STR. (For example, if you had
       six tapes to process, then you would start the STR recovery against the first two tapes.
       After all TX-FILES have been created, recommend processing files individually and
       taking IRU dump and processing NDA500 between runs. You would repeat these steps
       until all six tapes have been recovered.) This gives an updated point to return if problems
       are encountered with the following tapes.
2.93. Editing With NGV291. NGV291 was developed to edit only the xGV0*TXFILE. It is
menu-driven which will list all available options. The following key-in will activate NGV291.
NGV291         interfaces         with         demand        screen        number        637.
@ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.NGV291/Gx . x = gang (1 through 4 only).
   2.93.1. To print the file, option Y will SYM it to the desired printer. Each input image on
   the listing will contain a record number. This record number is the key for reviewing the
   xGV0*TXFILE. Once all modifications have been made to the file, it can be input through
   the pseudo reader. The following are the options used to manipulate the file and what each
   option will do:

Table 2.4. Options used to manipulate xGV0*TXFILE.

OPTIONS               DESCRIPTION
1. REVIEW             (R) - this option will bring the first input up on
                      the screen.
2. MODIFY             (M) - this option will allow any portion of input
                      to be modified.
3. NEXT               (N) - this option will bring the next input up on
                      the screen.
4. PREVIOUS           (P) - this option will bring the previous input back
98                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


                    upon the screen.
5. CHANGE           (C) - this option will allow changes to be made to
                    the current input.
6. DELETE           (D) - this option will delete the current image. In
                    place of the input image will be a MSG to 057
                    showing that the input was deleted.
7. UNDELETE         (U) - this option will restore an image which may
                    have been inadvertently deleted. Your listing
                    from the SYM will show you the exact image
                    number to restore.
8. SAVE             (S) - this option will save all changes and will
                    exit NGV291. To reenter NGV291, the above
                    @ADD statement will have to be reentered.
9. QUIT             (Q) - this option will exit NGV291 without
                    saving any changes.
10. HELP            (H) - this option will display all authorized
                    commands.
11. SYM             (Y) - this option will SYM the listing to the
                    specified device. Once the Y option is
                    transmitted, you will be asked to enter the queue
                    number of where the listing is to be printed.
  2.93.2. The TRIC select option can be used with the majority of the above commands in
  searching for a specific input. Once an output listing has been printed, SBSS personnel will
  do a manual review of the input images BEFORE the transactions are processed through the
  pseudo. This manual review should include the recommended actions in the next six
  paragraphs.
     2.93.2.1. TRIC SHP. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel,
     along with Stock Control personnel, should review the input file (xGV0*TXFILE.) for
     TRIC SHP. This review should be for shipments of unserviceable assets. These inputs
     should be held until all other processing is complete. Then using QLP, select the
     unserviceable details for these stock numbers and system designators. Enter the new
     unserviceable detail document number in the SHP transaction and reprocess. There is no
     external input to ensure the unserviceable is reestablished under the same number as
     previously used.
     2.93.2.2. TRIC AEx. Delete all AEx inputs, x equals any value that contains a
     cancellation status code. Since the AEx has already processed prior to the STR recovery,
     the request for cancellation has already been sent.
     2.93.2.3. TRIC ISU and SPR. Review processing by LRS / materiel management
     activity and Accounting and Finance personnel, should be done to ensure the ISU/SPR
     and other transactions are in the correct sequence within the input TXFILE.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  99


       2.93.2.4. TRIC MSI and SPR for MSI. These inputs should be deleted from the input
       file. If, for instance, it was an automatic ISU (0 balance), the MSI would process twice.
       Since the MSI is in the input file, it would process the ISU; that ISU would produce the
       MSI and the MSI in the file TXFILE would process again. Therefore, deleting these
       images will eliminate double processing. Advise the applicable personnel in LRS /
       materiel management activity that these images were deleted so they can reestablish the
       appropriate records.
       2.93.2.5. TRIC FRC. If you have a SPR in the transaction file for the same stock
       number that is in the FRC image, delete the FRC. When the SPR reprocesses it will
       reestablish the due-in detail under the correct requisition number.
       2.93.2.6. Any other review that needs to be accomplished should be completed prior to
       any reprocessing of the transactions. Once the review is completed, you are ready to
       replay your STR transactions.
2.94. Pseudo Processing. Bases should process NGV299 to alter the 002-REQUISITION-
SERIAL-NBR field on the 002-record to the next even thousand to ensure duplicates are not
assigned (that is, if the last requisition serial number was 1567, then 002-REQUISITION-
SERIAL-NBR should be altered to 2000). By doing this, if an input is missed, you will not have
any duplicate transactions when finished. Close coordination of all output documents must be
accomplished. Inputs should be broken down to manageable batches. The number of inputs
processed in each batch will be determined by the types of inputs and what the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity personnel feel comfortable with. The SBSS should be up, with
releveling, follow-up, and file status suppressed and all terminals off until this STR processing
has been completed.
2.95. Post Processing. When the last inputs are processed, the following steps will be
accomplished:
   2.95.1. Run the END image.
   2.95.2. Take and IRU dump of primary gang.
   2.95.3. Process NDA500, ALL sets excluding CTH.
   2.95.4. Recommend processing any backlog of Base Level ADRSS II System (BLAMES).
   2.95.5. Process all mandatory EOD reports for recovered transactions.
   2.95.6. Suspend all outbound (SIFS) until it has been determined that no requisitions from
   this STR process are transmitted. It is strongly recommended that one person from
   Document Control oversee all 1348-1A documents to be identified with the original output.
   2.95.7. Once all reports have been processed and the STR process completed, delete ALL
   files from this STR session.
   2.95.8. Transaction Counts. You will, in most cases, never recover a one for one transaction
   count. This is due to audit trail tape block errors or noise block errors. The main concern is
   to recover the SBSS database to the most efficient and stable condition as possible. The
   AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisor and/or AFMC SCM-R
   Information Technology Activity personnel should be aware of an excessive amount of read
   errors from audit trail tapes on a day-to-day basis. If excessive amounts of these errors
 100                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   persist, contact your DMC system monitor to try and eliminate these errors. Remember,
   safety dumps and correcting system errors when they occur prevents the use of STR.

Section 2N—-LRS / Materiel Management Activity And Financial System Constants

2.96. Overview. This section provides the procedures for use of constants data elements. The
Accounting and Finance and disbursing serial number (ADSN), MAJCOM code, terminal
function assignments, etc., are specific system configurations and operational system data
elements which vary from base to base. These constant data elements are assigned at base level
and loaded to the SBSS database. In this section, the x is used to indicate the applicable primary
gang number.
2.97. Base Constants. Base constants provide base level functions with the capability to load
unique data which identify processes and computer terminals used at those bases. The SBSS
application programs reference this data during processing to validate inputs, determine
processing rationale, and define output traffic flow. Base system configuration and data
constants are loaded to the 001-BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record, 002 SPECIAL-CONTROL
record, 106-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR record and 310 A&F-VARIABLE-DATA record.
Terminal data is loaded to the 014-BASE-CONSTANTS-2 record, 021 PID-HEADER record.
Care must be taken to ensure these constants are current at all times. Computer Operations is
responsible for developing, maintaining, and processing these inputs. Programs NGV068A,
NGV068B, and NGV068C are provided for this purpose.
2.98. Terminal Translate Tables. A standard method of identifying input and addressing
output to terminals is necessary because the number and application of terminals will vary at
different bases. Use of terminal translate tables allows each system designator to specify the
preferred terminal to receive output designated for a given terminal (see Para 2.177) and adjust
this to suit actual local conditions.
   2.98.1. Program NGV068A. Program NGV068A provides a menu-driven process for
   maintaining terminal translate data. It provides edits to ensure the terminal data are correct
   and verifies that the minimum mandatory terminals are included in the terminal file. The
   mandatory terminals are listed in Para 2.177. Although these are the mandatory terminals,
   they should not be the only terminals included. There should be a terminal image for each
   function number that could receive unsolicited output. This will include function numbers
   for all assigned warehouses, Stock Control, Record Maintenance, etc.
   2.98.2. Program NGV211A. Program NGV211A is the SBSS Executive program which
   delivers the output document to a terminal. It attempts to deliver output to the function
   number and system designator supplied by the application program. When it does not locate
   that function in the translate tables, it defaults to function number 444 for the supplied system
   designator. When NGV211A cannot deliver the output to 444 for the supplied system
   designator, it defaults to 444 for system designator 01. In each instance, when a function is
   not located in the terminal translate tables, NGV211A creates a 703 Management Notice
   which is written to the Cumulative Reject Suspense area. The only means available to clear
   this notice is with program NGV818. To prevent 703 management notices, load the
   appropriate function number as a pseudo device (type equipment = 99) and direct its output
   to a terminal with a printer. When a terminal's output is designated for a print queue,
   program NGV211A will call NGV214 for processing. Program NGV214 creates the print
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   101


   file 0GV0<ALN>00XX*GV214-yyyy. (xx = output system designator, yyyy = TIP number
   of the first document in the file) and stores documents in that file until one of the following
   three conditions occurs:
       2.98.2.1. The system designator of the output document changes.
       2.98.2.2. Program NGV214 times out because of no output.
       2.98.2.3. The file is full (100 documents). Once the file is closed, NGV211A sends the
       file to the queue listed in the site-ID field of terminal 445 for the output system
       designator. When no 445 terminal is located, the default is 445 for system designator 01.
       When there is no 445 system designator 01, the default is function 020 for system
       designator 01.
   2.98.3. Program NGV211B. NGV211B is the SBSS Executive program which delivers
   listings, labels, and produces output images to a queue. When a print file is created, the
   application program passes NGV211B the system designator of the print file. NGV211B
   locates terminal 020 for the application program supplied system designator. When it is
   located, NGV211B sends the file to the queue listed in the queue field. If NGV211B does
   not locate 020 in the translate tables, it defaults to terminal 020 for system designator 01.
   When the print file is for bar coded labels, NGV211B locates terminal 496 for the supplied
   system designator and sends the file to the run-ID listed in the run-ID field. If terminal 496
   is not located, NGV211B defaults to 020 for the supplied system designator. If 020 is not
   located, NGV211B defaults to terminal 020 for system designator 01. When an image file is
   created, the application program passes NGV211B, the system designator of the output
   queue/file. NGV211B locates terminal 442 for the supplied system designator and sends the
   file to the queue listed in the queue field. If terminal 442 is not located, NGV211B defaults
   to 020 for the supplied system designator. If 020 is not located, NGV211B defaults to
   terminal 020 for system designator 01.
2.99. Loading of System Constant. There are three methods available for loading constant and
terminal data. Except for the initial load, constant and terminal information should not require
mass changes or reload. A TIP process is available for updating the SBSS database when minor
changes are needed. This capability is available using options 7 and 8 in program NGV068A.
NGV068A passes images to the tip program NGV269 for updating in online mode only.
Program NGV068B loads terminal data using images located in filename
xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. and constants and support data from images in file
xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701. These are multi-sequential access method (MSAM) files
updated by program NGV068A and cannot be accessed by another processor. To process
NGV068B, execute the following:
   2.99.1. @0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068B,XXXX
   2.99.2. This processor call is followed by an option field, XXXX, which is separated from
   the call processor by a comma. The options in the option field can be specified in any order
   with spaces between them. The available options are:
       2.99.2.1. P - Indicates primary database.
       2.99.2.2. C - Indicates constant data load. Creates a listing of database and input data.
       2.99.2.3. T - Indicates terminal data.
 102                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       2.99.2.4. Z - Indicates the listing created is verification only (no updates). This option
       can only be used in conjunction with option C.          Note: The option field consists of
       a minimum of two and a maximum of four options.
2.100. Special Instructions. Program NGV068B must be run in demand mode. Prior to
processing NGV068B, ensure that your gang number is reflected in the first position of your
sign-on project-ID and current qualifier. You can check these fields by executing a @WHOAMI
in demand mode. Program NGV068C can be processed anytime the Multi-Sequential Access
Method (MSAM) terminal data file (xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700.) is corrupted. Program
NGV068C reads the Base Constants-2 Records (014) which use this data to re-create the
corrupted MSAM terminal data file. This program will not rebuild the Constants/Support Data
file, only the Terminal Data file.          If not cataloged, NGV068C will catalog file
xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. and rebuild the terminal data by processing:
   2.100.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068C
2.101. Other Constants Data. In addition to the most commonly used base system
configuration constants, all AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisors and
operators must be aware of the record constants loaded on the following:

Table 2.5. Other Constants Data.

2.102. Two-Page Concept. The two-page concept is beneficial in high volume input areas
(Receiving) and where large volumes of unsolicited output is printed (Stock Control). This
concept allows the operator to input on one page and receive the output on the second page
without being continuously interrupted with output documents. One disadvantage is that
inquiries input on the input page will automatically be printed on the output page. In a single-
page concept (input and output on the same page), the inquiry will display on the screen without
printing. The procedures for the two-page concept are as follows: configure one page as a
normal SBSS function; for example 062, configure the second page as another valid function; for
example, 077 and place 077 in the output function number field of the terminal image for 062.

2.103. Constant Demand Processor (CDP) (NGV068A). The CDP program does not access
the SBSS database; however, it provides a means to create, change, or delete CON images for
processing by programs NGV068B or NGV269. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity operator enters @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068A to initiate the CDP. The
Master Menu (Screen 600), Para 2.168 displays. It provides nine options as follows:
   2.103.1. Option 1, End Processing. This option (Para 2.169) exits to Demand mode. Prior
   to exiting, a verification process is accomplished except when option 7 has processed and no
   terminal images have been updated since that option.
   2.103.2. Option 2, List Terminal Data. This option (Para 2.170) creates a listing of terminal
   images. Seven sequences are available (see Para 2.170, Screen 598).
   2.103.3. Option 3, Inquire Terminal Data. This option (Para 2.171) allows the user to
   create, change, delete, or inquire terminal images.
   2.103.4. Option 4, List Constant/Support Data. This option (Para 2.172) produces a listing
   of constants and support data images in system designator sequence.
   2.103.5. Option 5, Inquire Host Constant Data. This option (Para 2.173) allows the user to
   create, change, or inquire constant images for system designator 01 only.
   2.103.6. Option 6, Inquire Support Data. This option (Para 2.174) allows the user to create,
   change, delete, or inquire support images for each system designator.
   2.103.7. Option 7, Update SBSS With Terminal Data. This option (Para 2.175) allows the
   user to pass CON images from the xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. terminal file to TIP for
   update of the SBSS primary gang database. The SBSS primary gang must be in the online
   mode or the images will remain on node 11 until the SBSS is online. In addition, the 014
   terminal record for function number 000 must be loaded for the images to be accepted by the
   SBSS.
   2.103.8. Option 8, Update SBSS With Constant Data. This option (Para 2.176) allows the
   user to pass constant and support images from the xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701. constant
   file to TIP for update of the SBSS primary gang database. The SBSS primary gang must be
   in the online mode or the images will not be updated to the database. In addition, the 014
   terminal record for function number 000 must be loaded for the images to be accepted by the
   SBSS.
   2.103.9. Option 9, Verify Terminal Data With Adds and Changes. This option (Para 2.177)
   allows the user to verify the terminal data file only if one or more terminals are flagged with
   an add or change. This option will verify and then terminate NGV068A processor.

Section 2O—-Selective Utility Programs

2.104. Overview. Utility programs can be called from the program bank only during twilight
and reports mode. If operating online, the END image must be processed to ensure an orderly
close-out of all terminals.
   2.104.1. Individual programs may contain parameter information in the utility select image
   and/or have additional parameter images. If additional images are required, place them
   behind the utility select image, followed by a STOP image, if required.
 104                                                         AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      2.104.2. This section describes selective utility programs. Not all SBSS utility programs are
      documented within this section.
      2.104.3. STOP Image. Many of the utility programs use a STOP image to signal the
      program when all parameter or data images have been read. This image must have STOP in
      positions 1-4.
2.105. Inventory Valuation Utility (UTL020).
      2.105.1. Program UTL020 computes the inventory balance and stores the results in 022-
      FILLER-1. If the computed balance is different from what the current record indicates, move
      the computed Inventory Balance to 022-FILLER-1. The program should also output a
      discrepancy list in column format. The program will display ‘NO DISCREPANCIES
      DETECTED’ if there are no discrepancies.

2.106. Item and Repair Cycle Record Linkage Check (NGV024).
      2.106.1. Program NGV024 provides the capability to verify that a repair cycle record exists
      for each ERRCD XD and XF type item record, that no repair cycle record exists for an
      ERRCD other than XD or XF type item record, and that all repair cycle records have an
      owner record that is an ERRCD XD or XF type item record. Program NGV024 produces a
      listing of all errors that is an ERRCD XD or XF type item record. Program NGV024
      produces a listing of all errors detected by type, and reflects the database record elements of
      the records found to be in error. Record count totals are printed by record type. An item
      record count will be printed when positions 9-11 of the parameter image are blank or contain
      ITM. A repair cycle record count will be printed when positions 9-11 of the parameter image
      are blank or contain RCR.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     105


      2.106.2. The type of database record scan to be performed is based upon the option selected
      in positions 9-11 of the parameter image. If positions 9-11 contain ITM, the ITMDTL-
      AREA of the SBSS database is scanned for item records. When an item record is found,
      program NGV024 determines whether or not a repair cycle record should exist based upon
      the ERRCD. If the item record ERRCD equals XD or XF, the program reads the ITEM-R-C
      set for which the item record is the owner to determine the existence of a repair cycle record.
      If the set is empty, an S528 MGT ITEM RECORD WITH REPAIR CYCLE ERRCD, BUT
      NO REPAIR CYCLE RECORD EXISTS - NOTICE ONLY is produced with the item record
      data content. If it is determined that the item record should not have a related repair cycle
      record, the ITEM-R-C set is checked for an existing repair cycle record. If a repair cycle
      record is located for that item record, an S538 MGT ITEM RECORD WITH NON- REPAIR
      CYCLE ERRCD, BUT REPAIR CYCLE RECORD EXISTS - NOTICE ONLY and the
      repair cycle record data will be produced.
      2.106.3. If positions 9-11 contain RCR, the REPCYC-AREA of the SBSS database is
      scanned for repair cycle records. When a repair cycle record is found, program NGV024
      determines the existence of an owner item record by the ITEM-R-C Set. If an owner item
      record does exist, the item record is checked for an ERRCD equal to XD or XF. If the owner
      item record ERRCD is unequal to XD or XF, an S539 MGT REPAIR CYCLE RECORD
      WITH ITEM RECORD CONTAINING NON-REPAIR CYCLE ERRCD - NOTICE ONLY
      message and the applicable repair cycle and item records will be output. If an owner item
      record does not exist, an S529 MGT REPAIR CYCLE RECORD WITH NO ITEM
      RECORD - NOTICE ONLY message and the applicable repair cycle record will be output.
      2.106.4. If positions 9-11 are blank, both the ITMDTL-AREA and REPCYC-AREA of the
      SBSS database will be scanned and the functions will be performed.
      2.106.5. Frequency. As required, but at least once each month.

      2.106.7. Special Instructions for NGV024. This program should be processed anytime an
      item or repair cycle record relationship error is suspected. This condition can normally be
      identified by reviewing the daily Fail Safe (NGV027) Listing. Anytime the number of repair
      cycle records does not match the number of DIFM item records, an error exists and utility
      program NGV024 should be processed to identify the specific records in error. Additionally,
      the program should be processed monthly to identify errors not readily found by reviewing
      Fail Safe Listings; that is, where record counts match and records are not correctly linked.
      Restart is from beginning.
2.107. Failsafe (NGV027). The FailSafe Program, NGV027, provides the counts of basic
records and detail records by system designator. Selective edits are performed on basic and
detail records by system designator. If an error condition is encountered, the record key,
contents, and error type phrase are printed along with the counts. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2,
Ch 5 for specific record formats.
      2.107.1. Program Logic for NGV027 computes totals for item, repair cycle, and detail
      records, by system designator.
         2.107.1.1. Errors.
               2.107.1.1.1. RECORD: Data content of record in error (167 positions).

      2.107.4. Special Instructions. When a discrepancy is noted in record counts, the discrepancy
      must be investigated to determine what action caused the error. All potential areas for error
      are too numerous to list. Some typical checks that should be made are:
         2.107.4.1. Investigate fully any known tape error that occurred during reject and restore
         to determine validity of the restore. Also included would be system crashes, power outs
         or fluxes.
         2.107.4.2. Database key or set error rejects printed out on the AFMC SCM-R
         Information Technology Activity console may indicate record fields erroneously written
         to the DBRA by program error, or generated through tape or hardware failure.
         2.107.4.3. Check AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console printouts in
         Document Control for any record alterations with program NGV299.
         2.107.4.4. If the reloading of an IRU dump and subsequent running of the program
         produces totals which do not agree with the program totals originally dumped, then the
         reloading process should be checked for tape errors.
         2.107.4.5. Management Uses. NGV027 provides the ADPE Unit with a total of basic
         and detail records currently loaded on the DBRA. The list is used to verify record counts
         during recoveries, DBRA uploads, and IRU dumps. Identifies record errors that require
         Computer Operations corrective action before additional processing can continue.
2.108. Satellite Rehoming Download (NGV028). Program NGV028 copies to tape selected
item records, detail records, in-use detail records, repair cycle records, and support records to
tape, for load/reload with program NGV030, Satellite Rehoming Upload.
      2.108.1. Records are selected by system designator(s). This program will create an original
      and safety backup download dump.          CAUTION: This is a general purpose and multi-
      application program. In most cases, use of its many options will require preconversion
      and/or post-conversion actions on the part of the losing and gaining bases. This program
      must be run as directed by the user's MAJCOM, and only run as a part of a plan which
      addresses the specific database conversion or application to be accomplished. Additionally,
      the rehoming process affects non-SBSS systems. Coordinate with the losing/gaining
      accounting and finance offices’ standard materiel accounting system (SMAS) monitor to
      ensure an integrated transition.
      2.108.2. Program Logic. The ITMDTL-AREA of the SBSS database is scanned for item
      records. Item records are checked for system designator(s) equal to the system designator
      constants(s) in the parameter images.
         2.108.2.1. If an equal condition exists, the item record and all of its subordinate detail
         records, repair cycle records, and in-use detail records are written to tape.
         2.108.2.2. After the scan for item records has been completed, the system designator
         record(s) are read for each system designator in the parameter input(s) and the
         subordinate fuels records that reside in the FUELS-AREA, inventory accuracy records,
 108                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


         ARMS records, and routing identifier records, are written to tape if directed by the option
         for each record type if the program select image so designates.
         2.108.2.3. Modifications to the item records and detail records are made based on
         parameter input(s) options prior to writing the records to tape.
         2.108.2.4. Program NGV028 will create an initial download tape, then automatically
         create a safety tape. If more than one tape is required for the download of the account,
         the first tape will be reel #1 of the download, and the second tape will be reel #1 for the
         safety tape. Then the third tape will be reel #2 of the initial download dump, and the
         fourth tape will be reel #2 of the safety tapes. Therefore, reels 1 and 3 would be used for
         the upload rehome, and reels 2 and 4 would be kept for the backup Safety Download
         reels.
      2.108.3. Format for NGV028. One input is required for each system designator to be
      selected (maximum 20 inputs). A STOP image is required after the parameter input.

         2.108.6.1. For satellite relocation’s, the losing base will provide the gaining base with
         the record tape(s). The losing base will also provide the gaining base with a copy of the
         fail safe NGV027 printout not later than 2 weeks prior to the conversion.
         2.108.6.2. Program NGV028 must be run in REPORTS mode on the primary database
         and after RPTEON on the secondary has been processed.
         2.108.6.3. Program NGV028 will create an initial download tape reel, and the program
         will automatically create a safety download tape reel. If more than 1 (one) reel is
         required for the account download, follow these instructions when marking and label the
         reels. The first reel of the download will be marked as reel #1 of the initial dump, and the
         second reel will be marked as reel #1 of the safety dump. The next or third reel mounted
         will be marked as reel #2 of the initial dump, and the fourth and final reel will be marked
         as reel #2 of the safety dump. Ensure reels are properly labeled to prevent shipping of the
         wrong reels, and hold the safety download reel(s) until after the gaining base complete
         their upload of the account.

2.110. Satellite Rehoming Upload (NGV030). NGV030 loads selected records to the SBSS
database from the rehoming tape generated by program NGV028. When the same stock number,
but different system designator, is previously loaded, the common data elements on the item
record are transferred to the record being loaded. A printout will be produced indicating the
number of records loaded and any reject notices that may be generated.
   2.110.1. Utilizing tapes previously generated by program NGV028, Satellite Rehoming
   Download:
       2.110.1.1. The program reads tape blocks sequentially.
       2.110.1.2. Validates the system designator being loaded.
       2.110.1.3. Establishes a restart point (in case of system failure), after every 2,000 records
       processed.
       2.110.1.4. When adding an item record, common item record elements are modified,
       (from an item record already in the DBRA) onto the item record being added to the
       DBRA (same stock number, different system designator); that is, unit of issue, unit price,
       routing identifier code, ERRCD, quantity unit pack code, Interchangeable and Substitute
       Group (ISG) subgroup code, controlled item code, nomenclature, national motor freight
       classification code, freight rate designator, type cargo code, budget code, interchangeable
       subgroup number, and interchangeable code. The unit price is not copied if the routing
       identifier code is JB(x).
       2.110.1.5. Basic records (item records, detail records, repair cycle records) are added to
       the database, followed by support records.
   2.110.2. Common item record elements are copied (from an item record already in the
   DBRA) onto an item record being added to the DBRA (same stock number, different system
   designator); that is, unit of issue, unit price, routing identifier code, ERRCD, quantity unit
   pack code, ISG subgroup code, controlled item code, nomenclature, national motor freight
   classification code, freight rate designator, type cargo code, budget code, interchangeable
   subgroup number, and interchangeable code. The unit price is not copied if the routing
   identifier code is JB(x). A blank field allows upload without copying.
   2.110.3. When the last item record has been processed, the add detail routine is called in to
   load and relate details individually into the DBRA (in appropriate new space allocation).
   2.110.4. Process notices are provided when beginning or ending a new area.
   2.110.5. The support records from the losing CSB are loaded.

      2.110.7. Tape Usage. A message is passed to the DMC operator to mount the required
      tape to be used by program NGV030. For restart, if this is a satellite-to-satellite
      rehome, reload database dump prior to starting NGV030. If this is a satellite to new
      host or bare base load, initialize database and replay new host base procedures starting
      with program NGV068B. If aborted for any reason, the database must be restored to
      the point prior to running NGV030 and program NGV030 must be restarted.
      2.110.8. Special Instructions for NGV030. Program NGV030 must be run on the
      primary database after RPTEON on the secondary and prior to BOD on the primary.
      When processing NGV030 and the 001-XADS-AFEMS-FLAG is set to yes, the program will
      create XSC images to be captured by SIFS to be routed the C001 Computer System. See
      AFMAN 23-122, Sec 1C, Satellite Operations for Gaining Base rehome instructions for
      NGV030.
2.111. Change Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) (NGV031). This program changes
SBSS database records for a SRAN and/or MAJCOM code by system designator (SD 01 only)
when requested in the program select image and directed by MAJCOM or higher authority.
 114                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


When a satellite or tenant system designator is specified, only the MAJCOM code can be
changed.
      2.111.1. Program Logic. The program select image is read and edited. A scan of the
      ITMDTL-AREA, REPCYC-AREA, PRTNBR-AREA, ATHINU-AREA, and ISG-AREA of
      the SBSS database is made on all detail, item, repair cycle, part number item relationship,
      authorized/in-use detail, and interchangeable and substitute records. The last four positions
      of each record account number are requested. Each time an equal condition is encountered,
      the new SRAN (obtained from positions 40-43 of the program select images) is written to the
      applicable record and the SBSS database is updated.           Note:     If the change to the
      MAJCOM code option is requested, then the system designators of the due-in from
      maintenance (DIFM) detail, special level detail, or the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) War
      Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO) spare detail record are equal to the input
      program select image system designator. The detail record MAJCOM code is compared to
      the applicable command code in the report select card. If equal, it is bypassed. If the
      MAJCOM codes are unequal, the detail is updated with the MAJCOM code from the input
      select image. If at least one detail record MAJCOM code is changed or the MAJCOM code
      change was not requested, the program will continue through the remaining database records
      to change SRAN, if requested.

2. This option will only be used when changing MAJCOM code. Ensure that the MAJCOM code
is correct, since the program does not perform an edit for a valid MAJCOM code. When this
option is used, it is mandatory to enter the new MAJCOM code in positions 44-45 and system
designator in positions 48-49. Only the MAJCOM code for that system designator will be
changed. DIFM detail records will be updated with this option only.
3. This option will include special level detail records in the MAJCOM code update when a dash
(-) is entered.
4. This option will include WRM WCDO spares detail records in the MAJCOM code update
when a dash (-) is entered.
5. This is a mandatory entry when requesting a MAJCOM code change. The MAJCOM code that
is changed will only be for the system designator entered in positions 48-49 and the MAJCOM
code entered in positions 44-45 of the program select image. For restart, start from beginning
unless the file has been destroyed. It will not be necessary to reload the file dump. Although
records previously changed will be rechecked, they will be unequal to the old AFSRAN so no
change will be made.
   2.111.3. Special Instructions for NGV031. On the day prior to the date the AFSRAN change
   is to be effective, process all necessary reports. Program NGV031 should be run during end-
   of-month and must be run on the primary database.
       2.111.3.1. When the MAJCOM code option is to be used, ensure that organization cost
       center record changes (FOR) transactions have been successfully processed for affected
       organization codes prior to running program NGV031. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
       8, for organization cost center record change input processing.
       2.111.3.2. Ensure that program NGV836/M10, Consolidated Inventory Adjustment
       Register, is run to clear any adjustment records on the SBSS database for the old SRAN
       prior to running program NGV031. This requires that all inventories (Complete, Special,
       Sample) and warehouse validations are complete. Run a R22 Conversion Audit List.
       2.111.3.3. After all reports have been processed and prior to RPTEON: Ensure that
       RPTEON has processed on the secondary.
          2.111.3.3.1. Take a normal database SAVE and have the DMC console operator label
          the reel(s) PRIOR TO A SRAN CHANGE.
          2.111.3.3.2. Execute program NGV031.
          2.111.3.3.3. Load the base constants with the new SRAN. See section 2C, this
          chapter for base-constants processing procedures.
          2.111.3.3.4. Process an IRUDUMP and have the DMC console operator label the
          reel(s) AFTER AFSRAN CHANGE.
          2.111.3.3.5. Run a R22 Conversion Audit List.
          2.111.3.3.6. Reinitialize offline and process report select image RPTEON.
          2.111.3.3.7. Initialize beginning-of-day and resume normal operation.
 116                                                   AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   2.111.4. If the option to change the SRAN is executed, consideration should be given to
   executing Data Reorganization Utility (DRU) so the file can be reorganized.
2.112. Download Bypass Record Area (NGV032). This program downloads selected SBSS
database records at the end of each secondary database reports processing cycle. Program
NGV032 scans the secondary database records, selects records affected by reports processing,
and stores selected records for NGV033.  Note: FOR NGV032 AND NGV033: Since both
programs are processed within NGV898C, manual intervention of either of these programs are
not authorized.
   2.112.1. Special Instructions for NGV032. Program NGV033 is called by program
   NGV898C as a result of the RPTEON selection image input against the secondary database.
   Program NGV033 will execute upon successful completion of program NGV032. Database
   records are retrieved by program NGV032 on the secondary database and modified on the
   primary database by program NGV033. The following records are downloaded in their
   entirety:

2.115. Consolidated Transaction History Record Download (UTL041/NGV041). This
program downloads and/or deletes CTH records and writes them to magnetic tape. Download
may be for a single date or a range of dates.
   2.115.1. Program Logic. The program:
       2.115.1.1. Edits the input to determine if the date or dates are valid. An error or reject
       occurs if the dates are invalid. Processing ends when this condition occurs. The start
       date must equal the purge date, which is the oldest date on file, except when a specific
       system designator is downloaded or the bypass option is used.
       2.115.1.2. Writes consolidated transaction history records, by date, to magnetic tape as
       they are fetched. If user leaves position 54 blank , selected records will be deleted.
       2.115.1.3. Stores the oldest transaction date remaining on the database in the 711 record.

Note:
Processing NGV070 with position 72 of the select image blank will delete all records attached to
the system designator that was rehomed with the exception of the 106 and 312 records belonging
to the rehomed account. Processing this option allows for M18 processing against the rehomed
account until END OF FISCAL YEAR. Enter a D in position 72 when all records are to be
deleted for the rehomed system designator including 106 and 312 records.
      2.119.5. Special Instructions for NGV070. Program NGV070 must be processed on the
      primary database after the RPTEON has been completed on the secondary and prior to
      completing RPTRUN (crossover to secondary). Ensure that a safety dump is taken prior to
      and after NGV070 is processed in the event a recovery is required. Program NGV028 must
      process (to output the two download tape copies) prior to running NGV070. Program
      NGV403 (ISG Cleanup) must process after NGV070 and prior to inline processing. Program
      NGV068 must be processed to remove (from the 001-BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record) those
      system designators being rehomed prior to the NGV070 run. Replace system designator
      back after NGV070 is complete if position 72 is blank.
2.120. Munitions Cleanup (NGV075). When munitions records are downloaded by NGV028,
the accountability is transferred and validated on the new system. This program deletes the
munitions records in the system designator specified in the select image. The item and detail
areas are scanned for the item record with a system designator that matches the selection and has
a 101-TYPE-SRAN (Type Account Code) of K. Only records with type account code K are
deleted.

must be run as directed by the user's MAJCOM, and only run as a part of a plan which addresses
the specific database conversion or application to be accomplished. Additionally, the rehoming
process affects non-SBSS systems. Coordinate with the losing/gaining accounting and finance
offices’ standard materiel accounting system (SMAS) monitor to ensure an integrated transition.
   2.121.1. Program Logic. The ITMDTL-AREA of the SBSS database is scanned for item
   records with type account code ‘P’. Item records are checked for system designator equal to
   the system designator in the parameter image.
        2.121.1.1. If an equal condition exists, the item record and all of its subordinate detail
        records, repair cycle records, and in-use detail records are written to disk.
        2.121.1.2. After the scan for item records has been completed, the system designator
        record is read for the system designator in the parameter input and the subordinate fuels
        records that reside in the FUELS-AREA, inventory accuracy records, and routing
        identifier records, are written to disk.
        2.121.1.3. Modifications to the item records and detail records are made based on
        parameter input prior to writing the records to disk.

   2.124.1. This program may be processed from any demand terminal attached to the
   SBLC/RPC system, but it is designed to transfer images to a PC. The input command line is
   read and edited for options, data filename for transfer, and output PID number. If all edits
   pass, the images are passed to the TIP terminal PID and transferred to the terminal’s hard
   drive (PCs only) or scroll on the terminal screen. After the file is transferred, a notice is
   output with the image counts and end-of-job message.
   2.124.2. At any SBSS terminal, in demand mode, key-in:              @NGV293,options
   qualifier*filename, send-to-PID        Note: Online help is available by keying in the
   command line without the PID number.

2.125. Air Force Logistics Management Agency CTH Dump Program (Program
NGV292A).
  2.125.1. Purpose. Creates the monthly transaction history record file from all LRS / materiel
  management activity host accounts for transmission to the Air Force Supply Data Bank
  (AFSDB) at the Air Force Logistics Management Agency (AFLMA), 501 Ward Street,
  Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL, 36114-3236. NGV292A is a mandatory monthly report
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 137


  for all LRS / materiel management activity accounts. The transaction history record provides
  factual data for analysis used by AFLMA program managers to provide timely, accurate and
  quality project reports to top level Air Force policy makers.
  2.125.2. Program Logic. Program NGV292A reads the CT-History (704) records and
  produces a Supply Interface System file of all Consolidated Transaction History records for
  transmission via Automated Data Reports Submission System (ADRSS).
     2.125.2.1. After starting program NGV292A, the AFMC SCM-R Information
     Technology Activity operator is prompted to enter (M) or (S). The “M” option represents
     the monthly option whereas the “S” option is used to scan specific beginning and ending
     dates. If the operator enters an (M), the monthly option of NGV292A will be processed.
     The program will fetch the beginning and ending transaction dates from the previous
     month automatically. If the operator enters an (S), the selective date option will be
     processed and the operator will be prompted to enter in the beginning and ending
     transaction dates. For example, to select 1 Oct 2001 through 31 Oct 2001, the operator
     would enter S20012742001304. Program NGV292A will edit the dates provided by the
     AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator, if option “S” is entered,
     against dates contained in the CT-DATE-SYS-DESIG (701) records. If the dates cannot
     be located, the program aborts and outputs an R031 reject. When Wrong Reel or
     Transaction Dates Incorrect appears on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
     Activity operator's console, the program must be restarted from the beginning.
     2.125.2.2. This program produces management notices and rejects notices R031, R038,
     and R036.
     2.125.2.3. If a database error occurs, a message is printed indicating the error area, error
     record, error function, and error number. When the error is corrected, restart the program
     from the beginning.
  2.125.3. References. AFI 23-101, Sec 2B, Stockage Policy.
  2.125.4. As-Of-Date. Program must be processed each month on the first transaction date of
  the month for the preceding month’s transaction dates.
     2.125.4.1. Due-Date. First workday following the date processed.
  2.125.5. Special Instructions. Program NGV292A is executed by the AFMC SCM-R
  Information Technology Activity operator as follows:
     2.125.5.1. @START GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV292AR
  2.125.6. Program NGV292A is processed on the primary system on the first transaction date
  of the month or as required by the MAJCOM. Use of the S option on the @XQT statement
  is ignored.
     2.125.6.1. Output SIFS File. Program creates SIFS file XGV0*GV292AUD801. for
     transfer via ADRSS to the MAJCOM. X=GANG # XXXX=ALN.
2.126. Air Force Logistics Management Agency Quarterly Database Dump (Program
NGV292B). (Retained for historical purposeless only).
  2.126.1. Purpose. Transfers quarterly database records to the Air Force Supply Data Bank
  (AFSDB), at the Air Force Logistics Management Agency (AFLMA), 501 Ward Street,
 138                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   Maxwell AFB - Gunter Annex, AL 36114-3236. The NGV292B is a mandatory quarterly
   report for all LRS / materiel management activity host accounts and must be processed in
   March, June, September, and December. The NGV292B quarterly data records provide
   factual data used for analysis by AFLMA program managers to provide timely, accurate and
   quality project reports to top level Air Force policy makers.
   2.126.2. Program Logic.
       2.126.2.1. The following processing sequence must be followed and the programs listed
       must be processed on the same day: Quarterly D28 - NGV292B - NGV819/Q04 - and
       NGV815/S01 (semiannually, when the S01 is processed). Program NGV292B produces
       four SIFS data files to be sent to AFLMA. Data records are read and reformatted into
       fixed length records.
          2.126.2.1.1. File XGV0XXXX*GV292BUD801.: Contains item records.
          2.126.2.1.2. File XGV0XXXX*GV292BUD802.: Contains all detail records.
          2.126.2.1.3. File XGV0XXXX*GV292BUD803.: Contains the repair cycle records.
          2.126.2.1.4. File XGV0XXXX*GV292BUD804: Contains the following records:
          weapon system control, mobility readiness spares package (MRSP)/in-place readiness
          spares package (IRSP) identification, routing identifier, inventory identifier,
          inventory adjustment, and Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG).
       2.126.2.2. This program produces management and reject notices R036 and R038.
       2.126.2.3. If a database error occurs, a message is printed in the AFMC SCM-R
       Information Technology Activity which provides the error area, error record, error
       function, and error number. When the error is corrected, restart the program from the
       beginning.
   2.126.3. Reporting Data.
       2.126.3.1. As-of- Date. This program must be processed in March, June, September, and
       December, prior to the Q04 and S01 reports. Each quarter the following reports must be
       processed during End-of-Quarter processing, on the same processing day, to ensure a
       valid data bank is maintained: D28 (quarterly option), NGV292B, and Q04.
       Semiannually the processing order is the D28 (quarterly option), NGV292B, Q04, and
       then S01. Data files are transferred file transfer protocol (FTP) via SIFS/ADRSS.
       2.126.3.2. Due Date. First workday following the date processed.
   2.126.4. Special Instructions. Select and parameter inputs do not apply. Program
   NGV292B is executed by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator as
   follows:
       2.126.4.1. @START GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV292BR
   2.126.5. Program NGV292B is processed on the primary system, after mandatory dailies.
   This program must be processed prior to RPTQ04 and RPTS01 and as required by the
   MAJCOM.
2.127. Create Consolidated Transaction History Control Record (NGV225). NGV225 is
used to create CT-HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT records whenever the
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               139


Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) database is established. Each primary gang supporting
the system requires a CT-HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT record. This program will
catalog, register, reserve, and initialize with DMU. Depending on how large your CTH database
areas are sized will depend on how long this process takes.
   2.127.1. The program is executed from a demand terminal using the following statement:
   @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R
       2.127.1.1. The program prompts for a gang number equal to 1-4. A message displays
       when an invalid gang number is entered, and the system will again prompt the user for a
       valid gang number.
       2.127.1.2. The program prompts for the number of database pages reserved in the SBSS
       schema for the CT-HISTORY records, once a valid gang number is entered. Enter six
       numeric characters (other than zeros) equaling the number of pages reserved for the CT-
       HISTORY records. Left justify the numeric entry with zeroes (for example: 20,000
       entered as 020000). After an invalid entry, a message prompts for the number of pages.
       2.127.1.3. The user enters all the correct data and the program establishes the
       CONTROL-HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT records. If the CTH system is
       required on more than one gang you must process NGV225R for each gang.
   2.127.2. Special Instructions for NGV225R.       This program must be processed on the
   primary CTH database.
       2.127.2.1. If the size of the area for the CTH System changes, do the following:
          2.127.2.1.1. Download the consolidated transaction history records for each gang
          using program NGV041, Consolidated Transaction History Download. (See this
          chapter for the CTH Download program.)
          2.127.2.1.2. Resize the CTH database. (See Ch 3 for SBSS Sizing Procedures.)
          Ensure you follow all procedures such as IRU dumps, EXEC dumps, etc., before
          continuing with these steps.
          2.127.2.1.3. Process program NGV225 to reestablish the gang numbers supported
          and to reserve database pages with new sizing figures.
          2.127.2.1.4. Reload the CTH records for each gang using program NGV043,
          Consolidated Transaction History Record Load. The records must be reloaded in
          sequence with the oldest date loaded first. (See this chapter for the CTH Record Load
          program.) Restart from beginning.
2.128. Depot Maintenance and Accounting Production System (DMAPS) Initialization
Utility (NGV302).
   2.128.1. Program NGV302 applies only to AFMC Air Logistics Complex bases (Hill,
   Tinker, and Robins) and satellite system designator A1 from Kadena. These bases contain
   organization records that are considered DMAPS organization codes. They are identified by
   the fund code (6L, 6M, or 6Z). Program NGV302 will scan 205 records for due-outs with a
   fund code as stated above and will create a file to be sent through SIFS to DMAPS. The
   program will also scan 201, 205 and CTH records for records that meet the organization
 140                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      criteria. It will then select item record information for cataloging purposes to be used by
      DMAPS. This file will also be sent through SIFS to DMAPS.

2.129. Consolidated Transaction History Document Control Process (NGV783). This
process provides an interface between the SBLC and the personal computer (PC) for selecting
and transmitting document control and Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) records. To
delete or update document control record (DCR), delete delinquent source records, and update
CTH records.
      2.129.1. Program NGV783 accepts the interface parameter from the PC and does one of the
      following applications:
         2.129.1.1. If the user asks for Request DFC, the program reads the document control
         records, sorts selected records on the transaction date and serial number, the 14 positions
         of the document number or the last 8 positions of the document number, and transmits
         selected records to the PC.
         2.129.1.2. If the user asks for Requests Fun#/OPR, the program reads the document
         control records, sorts selected records on the 14 positions of the document number, and
         transmits selected records to the PC.
      2.129.2. Program NGV783 accepts the interface parameter from the PC and one of the
      following transmittal actions takes place:
         2.129.2.1. When the user transmits the DFC Work File to the standard base-level
         computer (SBLC), the program updates and changes the document control records. If
         clearing a document control record, the program deletes the document control record and
         delinquent source document, and updates the document control card (DCC)-CLEARED
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                          141


     flag on the CTH record. If updating a document control record, the program makes
     updates only to the document control record.
     2.129.2.2. When a user transmits the Function #/OPR Work File to the SBLC, the
     program updates the document control record's OPR and/or function number, as
     applicable.
  2.129.3. When a user transmits the DFC Work File or the Function #/OPR Work File, only
  the changed records update the SBLC. This program writes all document control record
  (DCR) changes to the DCR Change File (xGV0xxxx*GV783DCC., # equal gang number,
  xxxx equals ALN if ALN is turned on; otherwise, this will be the DMC number). The DCR
  Change File, using program NGV288, allows the recovery of CTH and document control
  record updates in the event of a system failure.
  2.129.4. Personal Computer/SBLC Interface (NGVP263). Program NGVP263, Personal
  Computer/1100 Interface, allows the personal computer to communicate with the SBLC.
  Program NGVP263 does the following:
     2.129.4.1. Registers PC with the SBLC.
     2.129.4.2. Edits the return code.
     2.129.4.3. Sends data to the SBLC.
     2.129.4.4. Receives data from the SBLC.
     2.129.4.5. Deregisters PC with the SBLC.
  2.129.5. Screen Position Check (NGVP265). Program NGVP265 determines the type of PC
  being used and checks the position of the cursor on the screen to determine if screen
  transmission is required.
  2.129.6. Wait Routine (NGVP266). Program NGVP266 determines the control transfer rate
  between the PC and the SBLC. The control transfer rate is the number of seconds for each
  pause in the sign-on procedures.
  2.129.7. Log on to the SBLC (NGVP267). Program NGVP267 automatically signs on a PC
  user to the SBLC and does the following:
     2.129.7.1. Reads the CTHECL.DAT file.
     2.129.7.2. Calls program NGVP266.
     2.129.7.3. Calls program NGVP263, which passes CTHECL.DAT file images to the

2.135. Trouble Call Checklist.
   2.135.1. Purpose. To define the minimum steps that must be completed prior to placing a
   call to the SBSS Control Center. These steps are designed to help both the base and the
   controller in the resolution of error conditions.
   2.135.2. Step Remarks.
        1. What is the suspected error? _____________________________
           ____________________________________________________
Note:
It is important that you try to exactly pinpoint the error. This may require some research. If
programs are dependent upon each other, the true error condition can be hidden. For example,
program A may set a particular flag or produce some kind of output for program B. If program
A has an error and does not function properly, then program B may abort. Under these
conditions, program B may appear to be at fault when, in reality, A is in error.
        2. Are there any systems errors?
               What are they?
               ________________________________________________
               ________________________________________________
Note:
 146                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


Sometimes an error condition may result because the overall system may be in error. This error
may be either hardware or software related. Hardware conditions that might produce faults are:
      If there is a bad disk in use, data on that disk may be corrupted or unreachable. For
example, the system cannot read a particular sector or block of data on the disk.
       Tape. If the tape or tape drive has errors, the program may abort because it cannot
read/write to the tape.
      Error Mnemonics/Facility Status Codes (FAC) - Users should examine any error
mnemonics or Facility Status Codes (FAC). These will usually pinpoint the error. Users can
examine the FAC status by performing an @FAC keyin. Error mnemonics and a description of
U1100 error codes can be found in: Executive System Programmer Reference Current Version,
UP 4144 (see appendix C, Diagnostic Messages and Status Codes).
       3. Did the error occur without a recent release load? _____ What is the current release
loaded? _______________
Note:
Sometimes an error condition may have just occurred. You know it worked properly yesterday
or last week. You also know that there have been no release loads. If this happens, chances are
that something has happened at your base. Under these conditions, users should check with their
DMC to see if any local error conditions exist.
      4. Have you checked with your supervisor, DMC, or MAJCOM?
___________________
Note:
Some error condition may exist that is global, or it may have occurred earlier and your
supervisor may know about the problem. During normal duty hours, contact your MAJCOM--
they may have the correction. You should check with the DMC to ensure nothing has been
changed or is in error on their side of the house.
      5. Do you know of any other bases with this same problem? If you do, what bases?
__________
Note:
Usually, if no other bases have this problem and they have the same releases loaded as you do at
your base, chances are this is a local error condition. Again, it is important that users review any
actions taken or problems identified from the past couple of days.
        6. Have you read AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3 (as it applies to this situation) to ensure
proper input format?
              If so, is the format correct? _______________________ What is the format of
the input?____________________
Note:
This may seem like a redundant question. However, it is possible the user may have made an
error or possibly not loaded the latest CD-ROM release. The latest CD-ROM version should be
filed to match the release loads. The program could have been changed during the last release
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   147


load.
        7. Have you checked the worldwide DIREP listing?
                 What DIREPs are currently listed?_________________
Note:
It is possible that you may have a legitimate error condition. If other bases have reported the
problem to Gunter, chances are there is an open DIREP on the error condition. The DIREP
listing can provide you with a workaround for the error condition or a future release date when
the problem will be fixed.
        8. Are there any system advisory notices (SANs) or messages on the problem?
                 What SANs are currently active?_________________
Note:
If there is a legitimate error condition, there may be a SAN or message on the condition. If there
is a SAN or message, it will provide you with a current workaround for the problem. Have you
checked AF Form 636 for special instructions or files containing documentation procedures?
        9. Have you checked the programs against the last PBI listing? _______________
Is the correct version of the program loaded?_______ What is the version date/time of the
program? _________________________________
Note:
Sometimes, the wrong version of software may be in use at a base. Users should check their
software by performing the @PRT,TL command against file 0GV00000*GVABSUD001., and
also check the version that is registered to TIP by doing the following in Demand Mode:
        @BK1
        @XQT,MUZIAX TIP$*TIPRUN$/TIP.TPUR
        LIST 3
        @BK2,E
        L (PGM #) I.E.: LC NGV601
        P 10
Users should check the date/time stamps listed against the PBI listing from the last release load.
Dates of the ECL will not always match the ABS. That is because ECL runstreams are changed
via IPF or EDITOR whereas the ABSOLUTES are generated prior to release with the compile
date/time stamp.
        10. Have you checked the ECL against the last PBI listing? _______________
Note:
Sometimes, the ECL may be the wrong version, or it may have been altered at a base. Users can
validate the ECL in the same manner as above by performing an @PRT,TL command against
GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.
 148                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


        11. Do you have INQ on stock number, document number, and ISG? ____________
Note:
Having all inquiries gives the user and controller a complete picture of the corresponding records
in the database.
        12. Have you researched the reject condition thoroughly?
               What is the reject number?__________________________
               What program is the reject coming from?_____________
               What circumstances led to the reject?_______________
Note:
Each reject must be researched thoroughly at base-level before calling the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity. AFH 23-123, Pt 2, Vol 2, Ch 7, provides detailed instructions
and corrective actions for SBSS reject and management notices. These corrective actions must
be carried out before calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Keep notes
of these actions. Should it become necessary to DIREP the program or to contact the AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity, this information will be needed. It is essential to
understand the circumstances leading to the reject. Was the input initiated at the CSB, PSEUDO,
satellite, etc.? Was the input processed through the Overview Purpose Screen or a specific
screen designed for the transaction? Keep these facts in mind and write them down as you
discover them. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will be asking the same
questions.
        13. Is the reject a 799REJ? If so, complete the following:
               Rollback Code: _______
               Error Function: _______
               Error Code: _______
               Error Number: _______
               Error Area: _______
               Error Record: _______
               Error Set: _______
               Current Area: _______
Note:
799REJs are indeed a challenge. They are not standard SBSS rejects. These rejects occur when
a peculiar situation arises in the program, but there is no corresponding SBSS reject, as yet, to
identify the corrective actions necessary to resolve it. However, this does not excuse you from
researching and analyzing the reject. Indeed, your talents as an analyst will surely be tested.
Even though AFH 23-123, Pt 2, Vol 2, Ch 7 says to contact the AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity as a corrective action, you must analyze the reject first. Calling the AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity to inform them you have a 799REJ does not resolve
the problem. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must know the
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   149


circumstances leading to the reject. Have the reject handy; it will provide a lot of information.
For example, the rollback codes, error codes, functions, and numbers will provide a lot of insight
in to what the program is trying to do. See Para. 2.135. for an explanation of the most common
codes and key fields produced by the reject. It is your responsibility to do everything possible to
resolve the problem before you contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. If
it does prove necessary to contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, make
sure you have all the information ready that you have found in order to assist the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity in resolving your problem.
        14. Have you processed the reject or suspect transaction with a TRACE?_______
Note:
TRACEs provide a great deal of insight into the working interactions of the software. It takes a
great deal of practice and patience to research the TRACE output, but the information learned is
rewarding. You can see the programs that are called, the records that are read and written, and
the output it produces. To process a TRACE against a suspect transaction, you must complete
the following steps:
STEP           ACTION REQUIRED
(a)            SX all files in the queue RJPR01. This step is not
               necessary if your print server is active.
(b)            Stop all TIP processing. For ALN systems with multiple
               ALNs coordinate with all the other ALN users.
(c)           Turn on all sense switches (1, 2, and 3)
(d)            Process TRACE
(e)           Turn off all sense switches (1, 2, and 3)
(f)           After processing the input, the TRACE printout will be in
               RJPR01. Redirect print queue to your line printer.
               Or in designated PS$$0000 file if using print server.
(g)            Now, read the TRACE printout and follow the processes that
               occurred and led to reject. Carefully note the programs
               called, records accessed, and, of course, any errors
               identified.
(h)           Resume normal TIP processing.
        15. Do you suspect the report or transaction is looping? ___________________
               Have you run the Universal Data System (UDS) Monitor? If not, run it.
            Did you find that the program was looping on a database key (DBK)?
___________________
               Have you run appropriate INQs to research the loop? ___________________
 150                                                          AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


                If not, run them.
Note:
The only sure way of detecting and defining a looping condition within the UDS is through the
UDS Monitor. This monitor permits you to see the DBKs that the program is accessing as it is
processing. If you see that a particular DBK is constant, that is a clue the program is looping on
that record. At this point, you may abort the program and run a DBK inquiry to identify the
record causing the looping condition. From this point on, you can run other inquiries that will
help you research the condition thoroughly (such as stock number, document number,
organization cost center record (OCCR), etc.). To start the UDS Monitor, use the following
instructions:
         Initiate the monitor by the following keyin:
                >@ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.MONITOR
         When prompted by UDS Monitor , take the following options:
                M (Menu)
                J (For Job. This will provide the status of Data Management Routine (DMR)
runs.)
                Slot (Enter the slot number of the job you wish to monitor.)
                 Number
         Now you will be able to observe the suspect run as it is progressing through the DMR.
         16. Is the problem you are experiencing the result of a Computer Operating Base
         (COB) error?
                What is the COB error? ____________________________________
                What is the filename giving the error? ____________________
Note:
COB errors identify file errors that occur when the SBSS programs are attempting to access
SSDF or MSAM files. At times, the problem can be traced to an individual who is looking at the
file through CTS or Text Editor and the End-of-File (EOF) marker. Some of the most common
are:
        1101A --- Attempted to open a file which is already open. This error could be a program
error which results when attempting to open a file twice without an intervening close. Another
answer could be that a prior run or program did not complete and left a file open which it should
have closed on an abort. If the program was cataloged by the active program, you should be able
to delete the file and rerun. Another possibility is the file is an input file and the first transaction
within the file is blank. Verify the file and make appropriate corrections.
        1103A --- No equipment assigned to file. The program or run is trying to use a file that
does not exist. The missing file could be due to a wrong option within the ECL (that is, HOST
ILO SITE) or the control image was wrong (that is, wrong disk/tape file specified). Another
possibility is that a wrong qualifier was used for the filename. A file could be missing if there
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                       151


were input transactions and all the inputs rejected. Therefore, no file was assigned for the
program to process against.
         1105A --- Attempted to write to an unopened file. The program is attempting to write to
a file that has not yet been opened. This is a program error which is usually beyond your control.
You can, however, use QLP to check the transaction history records for invalid system
designators. If any are found, make a note of the transaction involved and use NGV299R to
correct the system designator.
        1147A --- Attempted to write beyond maximum mass-storage assignment. This error
occurs when the program is attempting to write beyond the maximum granule assignment for the
output file specified in the ECL. This may be corrected by replacing the assign statement within
the ECL to a larger size and rerunning the program.
         XX18A --- Empty or invalid file structure or file lacks extended parameters. This error
usually occurs when the program is trying to use a file that has nothing in it. You need to re-
create the file by loading it back from a SAVEALL, rerunning the program that initially created
the file, or re-creating the file by inputting the data, if that is how it was created. If the file has
data in it, then it probably was caused by inputting data in the wrong format. This could have
been caused by using @DATA,I which puts field data into an systems data file (SDF) file ILO
using @DATA,IQ for ASCII data or vice versa. This can be caused when someone reads the file
with CTS and replaces it with ASCII OFF when it was supposed to be in ASCII or vice versa.
To correct this condition, initiate CTS, ASSUME ASCII ON (or OFF, whichever is applicable),
do a call on the old file, and then do a REPLACE. You can also re-create the file by reinputting
the data properly or loading it back from a SAVEALL. All of this depends upon what the file
was used for and how it was created.
        XX18A --- File lacks extended parameters. This error usually indicates that a file has
been accessed through CTS, a replace was done, and it destroyed the extended parameters. You
will have to re-create/load the file depending on how it was originally created.

NGV299R, IPF, and TOCED.

2.136. 799 Reject Notices.
   2.136.1. Purpose. To provide system generated rejects when no encoding within the
   application has been established. References used to research 799REJ are UP7992 and
   UP8079 (small pocket version). These references provide detailed explanations for the
   rollback, error codes, numbers, and functions identified by the reject. These publications
   should be within easy reach of the operator on duty. The following paragraphs will help you
   better understand the basic explanation of these codes and how they relate to you.
   2.136.2. Detailed Specifics on 799 Reject Notices.
152                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      2.136.2.1. The error function on a 799 reject notice indicates what action the program
      was trying to take when an error occurred. Some of the most common error functions are
      listed below:
         2.136.2.1.1. 02 -- The program was attempting to DELETE a record from the
         database.
         2.136.2.1.2. 03 -- The program was attempting to READ a record from the database.
         2.136.2.1.3. 08 -- The program was attempting to CHANGE an existing record in the
         database.
         2.136.2.1.4. 09 -- The program was attempting to OPEN an area of the database such
         as ITMDTL-GV-1. The area must be open before the program can access records in
         the area.
         2.136.2.1.5. 12 -- The program was attempting to ADD a record to the database.
      2.136.2.2. The error code/number gives a specific result of the last function requested by
      an application program. It may be easier to understand error numbers if you look at them
      as status codes versus error codes. It should be understood to the application program,
      error codes are frequently received and provide meaningful information to the program.
      For example, an ISU input requires the program to read (FETCH) the item record of the
      stock number on the input. If the item record is not loaded, the system passes back an
      error number of 13. The application program interprets this to mean it could not find the
      item record and a 295 reject notice ITEM RECORD NOT LOADED - SEE CHAP 7 is
      produced. However, under other circumstances, the application may be expecting only a
      successful status. Therefore, if an error number other than 00 is returned, a 799 reject
      notice is produced. An example of this would be: A program reads a controlled item
      phrase to print it on an output document. It reads the item phrase based on the controlled
      item code loaded on the item record, and it relies on an SBSS principle that says you do
      not have controlled item codes loaded on item records when there are no controlled item
      phrases loaded. Using this principle, if any status other than 00 is returned, a 799 reject
      notice is produced. At this point, a new, more specific reject could have been produced
      stating that a controlled item phrase was not loaded but it wasn't and most likely will not
      be until someone identifies and DIREPs the problem. Some of the more common error
      codes are provided here:
         2.136.2.2.1. 00 -- Last database access was successful, no error occurred, erroneous
         799 reject notice if this error code appears.
         2.136.2.2.2. 05 -- Violation of duplicates not allowed clause. Typically, this occurs
         when attempting to add a new record or MODIFY a record whose CALC-key
         duplicates another record's CALC-key already loaded in the database, and the SBSS
         schema definition contains the phrase DUPLICATES NOT ALLOWED for that
         record type.
         2.136.2.2.3. 06 -- No current record of area/record/set name. This error usually
         indicates a true programming error. The application program said read the next
         record in a set or area; however, it failed to read the first record in the set or area. Or,
         it said read an owner record and assumed the error number to be 00, but it wasn't. It
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 153


        then executed a read of the first record in the chain when there is no current owner's
        record established.
        2.136.2.2.4. 07 -- End of set/area/chain. Once again, this status is quite often
        returned to the application program. For example, an inquiry for all details continues
        to read details until a status of 07 is returned. At that time, the inquiry program puts
        out the END OF INQUIRY and terminates normally. However, if a program was
        trying to read a due-in detail using the due-in document number loaded on a due-out
        detail, and it is assumed the due-in detail would be found, any status other than 00
        may result in a 799 reject notice. Once again, at this point, the application program
        could put out a new reject indicating the due-in detail document number of the due-
        out was invalid or the old stand-by 260 reject notice DETAIL NOT LOADED.
        2.136.2.2.5. 08 -- Record not defined in set/area or record does not contain specified
        keys. This is generally a true programming error. For example, the application
        program said read a due-in detail within the authorized in-use set. Looking at the
        SBSS schema you can tell that due-in details are not included in the authorized in-use
        set.
        2.136.2.2.6. 09 -- Improper area usage. When an application opens an area, it must
        specify a mode; for example, retrieval or update. If it is opened for retrieval, any
        attempts to update the area will result in this error.
        2.136.2.2.7. 13 -- No record or set occurrence satisfies criteria. Typically, this error
        is produced when the application program has specified that a specific record with a
        specific key will be read. An example would be that the program said to read a
        specific document number record, but that record was not on file.
        2.136.2.2.8. 34 -- Area cannot be assigned. This error is produced when the database
        area attempting to be accessed is not registered and assigned to TIP. Since the SBSS
        uses an EXEC database, this error would only be received in an application compile
        error.
        2.136.2.2.9. 84 -- Overflow pages associated with data pages have all been allocated.
        This error indicates you have run out of overflow pages to allocate for storing new
        records. You need to do a database resizing. However, this is truly one error that you
        can tell your users to, “Try it at a later time, and it might work,” until you can do the
        resize. The reason for this is that perhaps a record on the page where the new record
        will be loaded will have a record deleted and allow space to load a new record.
        2.136.2.2.10. 92 -- Database key found vacancy entry. Without a doubt, if you
        receive this error, you have database pointer problems.
        2.136.2.2.11. 98 -- Invalid area code/page number. Again, you have structure
        problems within the database. Process a DMU AREA VERIFY to help pinpoint
        errors. Remember, DIRECT access records cannot be verified by DMU VERIFY.
        For example, if the program is looking for the Inventory Adjustment Control record
        (507), it looks on page one, record one. This is the only place the 507 can be stored.
        If it is not there a 98 error will result. The program could also be looking for a
        specific database key and the record is not there. This would also result in a 98 error.
        VERIFY cannot check these conditions. Record fetched is not of expected type.
154                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


         2.136.2.2.12. 100 -- Dynamic page expansion limit. See error number 84 above for
         details. The difference is this error number only occurs on areas defined in the SBSS
         schema with a DYNAMICALLY EXPANDABLE TO clause.
         2.136.2.2.13. 122 -- Generalized name error. If bases do an @START on programs,
         they will get this error if the first digit of the project code on the RUN image does not
         equal 1 through 8. This error will also result if the base does an @XQT,S and the
         first digit of the project code is already a 5 through 8. This is because the first digit is
         used to identify the gang number. If it is a zero, the application program cannot open
         SUPRT-NGV-0. Hence, an error code 122 may result because of a simple project
         code error on the @RUN image. Always check this condition first.
      2.136.2.3. Rollback (RB) Codes. A rollback code indicates that any update the
      application program may have made since starting, or since it executed its last FREE
      DMR command, will be undone. This leaves the database looking like it did before the
      start of the program or just prior to its last FREE command. Some of the more common
      RB codes are listed here:
         2.136.2.3.1. 00 -- A rollback did not take place.
         2.136.2.3.2. 06 -- Not enough quick-look file space allocated. The program has
         accomplished too many updates without doing an internal FREE command. Attempt
         to process the program later with a different mix of programs on the system. If the
         error persists, you must submit a DIREP on the applicable application program.
         2.136.2.3.3. 14 -- Trying to access a downed area. If this occurs, most likely one of
         two things is happening: Your primary to secondary database copy is in progress and
         has marked the gang down. (In this case, take no action until your crossover
         terminates, which normally results in bringing the gang back up.) Or, an attempted
         recovery has not finished successfully, resulting in the areas being left marked down.
         Generally, @ADDing runstreams out of the 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. to up the gang
         should not be accomplished until you have determined the reason the area has been
         marked down.
         2.136.2.3.4. 66 -- Downed area list inconsistency. This error will normally occur
         only during database conversion processes when there has been a procedural error.
         For example, the runstream 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR is processed
         to register a new schema when there are areas in the prior schema definition which
         are marked down.
         2.136.2.3.5. 83 -- Schema aborted. This error condition can only be corrected by
         processing             the            following            ECL              runstream
         0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR. However, running a schema clear
         before finding and fixing the problem which caused the schema abort will most likely
         result in the same error recurring. The most common cause of this error, if it happens
         on a continuous basis, is either numerous pointer and/or CALC-chain errors.
      2.136.2.4. Current Area. This field is used by the programmer to identify the paragraph
      name within the Common Business-oriented Language (COBOL) program. This may or
      may not provide you, at base level, an insight on the function being performed that
      actually caused the reject. By following structure programming standards, paragraphs
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                155


       within programs should have meaningful names. Hopefully, by knowing the paragraph
       name, you will be able to determine a little more clearly the function being attempted by
       the program.

2. Flags 72 through 80 are reserved for AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
use as needed or required.
3. Flags 81 through 144 are reserved for MAJCOM and/or local usage. Bit value can be
processed with or without leading zeros. The flags above are a recommendation only, and
not mandatory to the specific controlled TRICs shown beside them. They are provided in
this format as a counter for the total number of controlled TRICs loaded in the SBSS for
easier end-user needs/requirements.
4. This is positions 81, 161, 241, or 321 used to allow simulation of other terminals. It will
also control the PSU TRIC used to process pseudo inputs.
5. TRIC XSE should only be processed at base level if directed to do so by the MAJCOM
Reporting Organization File Manager. TRIC XSE is transceived from AFEMS (C001) to
the SBSS. Inbound SIFS control record should be configured to send the XSE to the
pseudo for processing.
2.138. New TRIC Loads.
      2.138.1. Purpose. To load or add new TRIC(s) to the controlled TRIC table in the security
      file. Once this input is processed, only authorized user-IDs can use the TRIC(s). This input
      should be processed in online mode. When using online mode, you should use TIP Screen
      436. Process in online mode at a host or satellite account to load new TRICs. Process new
      TRIC(s) in Demand mode at the host base during initial implementation, satellite rehoming,
      or if the TIP security files need to be re-created. This process is accomplished through use of
      IPF or any ASCII text editor.

2.144. Gang Designation.
      2.144.1. Purpose. To process input during the initial conversion to terminal security,
      satellite rehoming, or if you need to re-create your Security File. It can only be processed in
      demand mode at host bases. This input sets up the security control file for all system
      designators sharing a gang.             It must be the first input image of the
      0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEX. It must be followed by SYS, 1SZB, and 1SZI inputs. At those
      locations operating with multiple gangs, be extremely careful and ensure your gang number
      matches the gang you operate on. If you make an error, the other host accounts may have to
      re-create their entire Security File.

2.146. Terminal Security Implementation.
      2.146.1. Purpose. To provide procedures for the host security manager to follow for
      implementing terminal security on the system. These steps should be used if a new host
      account is being created during host/satellite rehoming and perhaps during recovery
      processing or corruptive common bank problems.
         2.146.1.1. STEP 1: Catalog the file called 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx, where <ALN>
         equals ALN number, and x equals the primary gang in use (1, 2, 3, or 4).
                2.146.1.1.1. EXAMPLE: @CAT,PV 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx.,F///1000
         2.146.1.2. STEP 2: Create 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx by using IPF or any ASCII
         editor. Follow format in Para. 2.147.
         2.146.1.3. STEP 3: Process: @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU02
         2.146.1.4. STEP 4: Process: @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03
         2.146.1.5. STEP 5: Optional: If a file and listing is desired of the terminal security
         control file that is read from the common bank:
                2.146.1.5.1. @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU04
2.147. Terminal Security File Creation.
      2.147.1. Purpose. To provide a means of re-creating the USERFILEX. A sample follows
      for creating an 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE1 for a base with primary gang 1 and system
      designator accounts 01 and A3. This file must be created by each host account security
      manager for all satellites on the system. After implementation of terminal security software,
      satellite updates to the security files will be handled by each satellite security manager via
      online transactions (1SZs).
         2.147.1.1. To create this data file with CTS:
                2.147.1.1.1. Enter: >@CTS,IN 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE1.
                2.147.1.1.2. Enter: input images into 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE1

it is set to 2. INIT input moves spaces to the database record field 001-OVERRIDE-FUNCTION-
NUMBER (UP) and normal input/output is resumed. When AL is entered as a system designator,
an interactive communication interface (ICI) ready up (ICIRDYUP) is automatically processed if
any system designator has an active ADS interface.
       STOP INPUT sets the 001-UP-DOWN-FLAG to 1 if the current status is a space; the 001-
TYPE-DEVICE = 21, 28, 37, or 99; the PID is less than 99900; and the function number is not
057. Otherwise, no action is taken. When AL is entered as a system designator, an interactive
communication interface ready down (ICIRDYDN) is automatically processed if any system
designator has an active ADS interface.
        STOP OUTPUT sets 001-OUTPUT-OVERRIDE to 444 if 001-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28,
37, or 99; the PID is less than 99900; and function number is not 057. If the STOP OUTPUT is
for function number 444, then the 001-OUTPUT-OVERRIDE is set to 445.
      DISABLE sets the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG to equal 3 if the following conditions are met:
The 001-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28, 37, or 99. The PID is not 99900 or greater. The 001-
FUNCTION-NBR is not equal to 057.

VALUE         DESCRIPTION
space         - Terminal is signed on and capable of input and
              output. This status can be obtained by the
              following operations:
              -- The current status is 2 and an *OPEN input is
              processed.
              -- A COM REM INIT is processed with the
              following conditions met:
              --- The position identifier (PID) is currently
              signed on through the EXEC.
              --- The 014-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28, 37, or 99.
              --- The PID is not 99900 or greater.
1             - Terminal is marked as an OUTPUT ONLY
              device. Inputs are rejected by the SBSS to the
              user. This status can only be set by a COM REM
              STOP INPUT transaction.
2             - Terminal is marked down--no input or output.
              However, processing an *OPEN from that
              terminal will change the value from 2 to a space,
              thus allowing both input and output. This status
              can be obtained by the following operations:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                            171


                 -- The last user processed an $$CLOSE.
                 -- An END image is processed and the status at
                 the time of the END image is either a space or a
                 1.
3                - Terminal is marked down--no input or output.
                 In addition, the processing of an *OPEN will be
                 rejected by the SBSS. A COM REM INIT must
                 be processed for a terminal in this condition
                 before the user can successfully process and
                 *OPEN and begin SBSS transaction processing.
                 -- Note: This status can be set only by a COM
                 REM DOWN transaction.
      2.150.3. Other Inputs that affect the UP-DOWN-FLAG.

Table 2.52. Other Inputs that Affect the Up-Down-Flag.

VALUE            DESCRIPTION
END              Any function other than 057 which has a 001-UP-
IMAGE            DOWN-FLG less than 2 is set to 2. If the 001-
                 UP-DOWN-FLG is 3, it remains unchanged.
$$CLOSE          Sets the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG to 2.
*OPEN            If the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG equals 2, then it is
                 changed to a space. If the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG
                 equals 3, then the input is rejected to the user. If
                 the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG equals 1, then it
                 remains unchanged.

Notes:
1. The system designator (SD) and function number of originator may be entered. If positions 4-8
are blank, the SD and function number of the input terminal are used.
2. The system designator and function number must be entered if a message is to be sent to an
individual terminal. If a message is to be sent to all up terminals, enter the system designator in
positions 9-10 and enter ALL in positions 11-13.
3. Message text is limited to 67 alphanumeric characters and special characters that do not
perform control functions in terminal transmissions.
2.152. End-Of-Day Image (TRIC END).
      2.152.1. Purpose. To change the SBSS database from online to twilight. If the 001-UP-
      DOWN-FLAG equals a space or 1, the 001-UP-DOWN-FLAG is set to 2 (no input or output
      allowed). Also, if any system designator has an automated data system (ADS) interface
      active, it processes an ICIRDYDN (marks ICI processor down). Any attempt to input data
      results in a notice to the input terminal that the SBSS is in the twilight mode and inputs will
      not be accepted. If the remote processing station ( AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
      Activity) does not want terminals signing on and processing immediately after restarting
      online (that is, manual processing), then the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
      Activity will process a COM REM AL DISABLE before or after the END image processing.
      Terminals will then be unable to input until initialized. A COM REM AL INIT input allows
      the user to sign on and immediately start processing when online.

2.156. Pseudo Load/Activate Input (PSU).
      2.156.1. Purpose. To designate start, stop, or write images to the pseudo area (with security
      checks). Maximum images for each pseudo area are: 15,000 for images that are 80 positions
      in length. For images that are over 80 positions in length, 6,000 is the maximum amount of
      images that the pseudo will accept without aborting. If images are mixed lengths, suggest
      limit images to 6,000. When these limits are exceeded, NGV221B will automatically place
      excess images in an overflow file xGV0*GV221BUD00y. (x equals primary gang number
      and y equals 1 or 2 for pseudo 1, 3 or 4 for pseudo 2, and 5 or 6 for pseudo 3). When the
      particular pseudo area is empty, the overflow file will automatically be loaded to the
      applicable pseudo.

Notes:
1. Must enter a 1, 2 or 3.
2. LOAD = Loads images to the pseudo reader without processing any of the images. Pseudo
status will display OFF. User-ID is mandatory.


     START = Loads and starts processing images immediately. Pseudo status will display
ON. User-ID is mandatory.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    179


         STOP = Stops processing pseudo images and turns pseudo off. Pseudo status will display
OFF.
        STATUS = Displays the status of an individual pseudo by entering a pseudo queue in
position 4. If position 4 is left blank, status of all pseudos will be displayed.
3. Enter the filename of the data file to be processed through the pseudo. May be a 12-position
qualifier and a 12-position filename (qualifier filename) must be separated by an asterisk. May be
blank when images follow a PSU image in a NGV801 runstream.
4. This entry is used for redirecting output documents. If a valid system designator/function
number has been entered, output of the pseudo images are redirected to that specific system
designator/function number.
5. This entry is mandatory when LOAD or START are used and a filename is entered in positions
13-37. USER-ID is checked for validity against the SBSS Security File. If USER-ID is
authorized to process all TRICs entered in the filename, then the pseudo will process as normal. If
the USER-ID is unauthorized to process one or more TRICs within the file, the pseudo will not
load ANY of the images from the specified file and a S045 MGT notice will result displaying the
TRICs that were unauthorized.
2.157. Pseudo Delete.
      2.157.1. Purpose. To delete unprocessed images previously loaded to the pseudo reader
      area. It may be processed only during end-of-day in twilight mode. The pseudo reader area
      is scanned for each input immediately following the PSU image and preceding the STOP
      image. An 80-character compare is performed of the image on the SBSS database versus the
      input image prior to deletion from the pseudo reader area. An S900 notice is produced for
      records not located. This input must be processed in batch mode only (002-FLG-A = space)
      and must be processed through NGV221B procedures. An S040 REJ notice will be sent to
      the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator if this is processed through the
      AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console (TIP screen).

2.159. Rebuild PSEUDO-GV Area.
      2.159.1. Purpose. To rebuild PSEUDO areas. There may be times when the PSU DELETE
      is not effective to clear out the pseudo area. Although there are several ways to rebuild this
      area, the following examples are used for different situations. In any case, you must ensure
      that the SBSS is offline and positively no users may have access to the database until after
      these procedures have been completed. Remember to save your current pseudo images to a
      safety file. After any rebuild/recovery selected, ensure to IRU dump your primary database.
         2.159.1.1. EXAMPLE:
             2.159.1.1.1. @ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.DMU

2.160. RPTRUN Image.
      2.160.1. Purpose. To copy the primary database to the secondary database for reports
      processing. Once all online and essential twilight processing has been completed this report
      image builds the applicable secondary database for mandatory end-of-day reports processing.
      When processed on the secondary database it breaks the reports sequence control record
      (520); thus, allowing reports to be processed out of sequence. Caution must be used anytime
      this image is to processed.

2.162. File Recovery From SBSS Backup Tapes.
   2.162.1. Purpose. To recover standard SBSS filenames from tape. The procedures
   described in this paragraph require access to a demand terminal and only apply to the SBSS
   backup tapes created using the following runstreams. Gang 1 on each ALN is responsible for
   coordination with all users, including other ALNs assigned to your DMC. If an exempt file
   needs to be reloaded, the systems monitor for each ALN must coordinate when and how.
   You may also, if desired, create your own tape backup and restore for your ALN unique files.
       2.162.1.1. @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.CREATE/GVEXECUT001. Exempt SBSS
       files
       2.162.1.2. @START 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC.                       ALN unique
       files
   2.162.2. Precautions. Prior to utilizing the procedures in the following paragraphs, certain
   precautions must be taken.
       2.162.2.1. The appropriate reel numbers containing the files to be recovered must be
       cataloged as the current cycle of the appropriate tape file-ID.
           2.162.2.1.1. EXAMPLE:       0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. for exempt files or
           0GV0<ALN>*GVEXECUT001. for non-exempt.                This may be verified by
           processing an @PRT,F against the applicable filename. Therefore, by entering the
           following command, tape reel numbers can be verified:
               2.162.2.1.1.1. @PRT,F 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001.
           2.162.2.1.2. If the file 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. is cataloged, a printout similar
           to the following sample will be obtained:
               2.162.2.1.2.1. * * PROJ: xxxxxx          ACCNT: xxxxxxx * *
               2.162.2.1.2.2. 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001(1),U9,B00099/B00098/B00097
               2.162.2.1.2.3. MODES: PUBLIC
               2.162.2.1.2.4. TAPEMODES: 6250-BPI,ODD-PARITY,8-BIT
               2.162.2.1.2.5. CAT: 07/21/93 AT 20:00:00, LAST REF: 07/21/93 AT 21:10:00
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  185


             2.162.2.1.2.6. In the above example the tape numbers associated with file
             0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. are B00099, B00098, and B00097. The file cycle
             is 1. The file-ID was cataloged on 21 Jul 93 at 2000:00
      2.162.2.2. If the file is cataloged and the correct tape reel numbers are included in the
      printout, proceed to Entry Commands paragraph below.
      2.162.2.3. If the file was not cataloged or if the tape reel numbers to be used for recovery
      are not correct (such as, tape numbers B00099, B00098, and B00097 listed in the above
      example are not the correct tape reel numbers to be recovered from), a new catalog entry
      must be established to reflect the correct tape reel numbers to be used. For example: If
      the correct tape numbers to be used in the recovery of the above example were B00088
      and B00087, the following catalog entry must be processed:
          2.162.2.3.1. @CAT,PV 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001(+1).,U9,B00088/B00087
          2.162.2.3.2. After the catalog entry has been processed, repeat the actions in
          paragraph above to verify the catalog process was successful.
   2.162.3. Entry Commands.    Once the verification described has been successfully
   accomplished, the following procedures must be executed (using the non-exempt
   CREATE/ALN-EXEC as an example):
      2.162.3.1. Enter:
      2.162.3.2. @ERS TPF$.
      2.162.3.3. @ASG,A 0GV0<ALN>*GVEXECUT001.
      2.162.3.4. At this point the DMC operator will receive the appropriate tape mount
      message:
          2.162.3.4.1. @COPY,G 0GV0<ALN>*GVEXECUT001.,TPF$.
      2.162.3.5. Once the operator has serviced the tape request, the first data file will be read
      from tape and written into TPF. When the cursor returns and the phrase xxxx number of
      blocks copied appears, enter the following command:
          2.162.3.5.1. @ADD SELECT/FILES                        (for Exempt files)
          2.162.3.5.2. @ADD SELECT/ALN-FILES                   (for ALN unique files)
      2.162.3.6. From this point on, the recovery is a prompted process. Respond to the
      questions following the instructions provided on the screen.
2.163. IRU History/Key File.
   2.163.1. Purpose. To provide a list of tapes used in previous IRU dumps or recovery. Any
   time an IRU dump or recovery is performed, data pertaining to each area is recorded in the
   IRU history file. This data is very useful in deciding which tape numbers are used in a
   recovery. This file is printed by executing runstream 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.TAPE-
   NBR/GV-x.
   2.163.2. Example. This runstream is set up to provide data on the ITMDTL-GV-x area only.
   If you want to view any other area, change the runstream to reflect the EXEC filename. An
   @ADD or @Start of this runstream prints the entire contents. To browse through the file in
 186                                                           AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


    chronological sequence, input the commands in demand mode. Data for each tape file
    appears. To look at the next tape file, enter continue. To exit IRU, enter stop.

2.165. Audit Trail History File.
   2.165.1. Purpose. To provide a list of audit trail tapes in the event of an audit trail or STR
   recovery. Each time an audit trail tape is opened, closed, or swapped, the action is recorded
   in a history file. This file should be used by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity personnel prior to and after any recovery. Information provided in this file and the
   IRU history file is sufficient to determine beginning and ending tape numbers and times.
   Prior to a recovery, review this list and coordinate which tapes are required. After the
   recovery, this list can be matched against the recovery printed output to ensure a tape was not
   skipped. Skipping audit tapes during a recovery will undoubtedly require reprocessing the
   IRU recovery or the STR recovery. If audit trail tapes have to be skipped, then a STR
   recovery is required.       To print the file, execute 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.AUDIT-
   TRAIL/REPORT. The runstream is as follows:
       2.165.1.1. @IRU,UIX
       2.165.1.2. REPORT ACI ALL; ACT; . or REPORT ACI LAST 10
       2.165.1.3. (for last 10 tapes)
       2.165.1.4. EXIT
       2.165.1.5. These commands will print a list similar to the following (ACT set is for

    2.167.3. Actions. This option exits to Demand mode. Prior to exiting to Demand mode a
    verification process is accomplished.
    2.167.4. Verification. No verification is accomplished after option 7 (SEND TERMINAL
    IMAGES TO TIP) has been processed and no other updates to terminal images have
    occurred or when exiting the CDP with no updates and the file was previously valid. The
    verification consists of the following actions:
        Checks the output function number linkage for each terminal image and verifies that:
               - each output function number leads to a terminal image;
               - the output chain does not loop.
        Checks the alternate function number linkage for each terminal image and verifies that:
               - each function number leads to a terminal image that is loaded;
               - the alternate chain is not longer than six function numbers;
               - the chain ends with function 445;
               - the chain does not loop.
        Checks the Bar Code alternate function number linkage for each terminal image. Verifies
that:
               - each function number leads to a terminal image loaded;
               - the chain does not loop.
        2.167.4.1. Verifies existence of mandatory terminals for each system designator. The
        following is a list of the mandatory terminals. These are not the only terminals loaded,

  2.172.7. Options.
      2.172.7.1. Option 1 - End Processing. Screen 600 displays, the program accomplishes
      the verification check, and then terminates.
      2.172.7.2. Option 2 - Add Support Image. This option is only available when the record
      is not loaded. The program edits each field and displays appropriate error messages on
      the STATUS line 24. When no errors are found, the image is added to the file with the
      ADD indicator flag set to A. Screen 603 redisplays awaiting another entry.
      2.172.7.3. Option 3 - Change Support Image. This option is only available when the
      record is loaded. The program edits each field and displays appropriate error messages
      on line 24. The cursor positions at the field containing the error correct the error and
      retransmit. When no errors are found, the images are rewritten to the file with the
      CHANGE indicator flag set to C. Screen 603 redisplays awaiting another entry.
      2.172.7.4. Option 4 - Delete Satellite Support Image. This option applies to Screen 599
      and is only available when the record is loaded. The program does not edit the input.

      The image is rewritten to the file with the DELETE indicator flag set to D. Screen 603
      redisplays awaiting another entry. When this option is selected, proceed to the MASTER
      MENU and take option 8 to delete the flagged image from the constants data file. This
      prevents the program from performing edits against the terminal data file and flagging it
      as being in error.
      2.172.7.5. Option 5 - Return to Inquiry Screen. This option returns to Screen 603 with
      no action for the current image.
      2.172.7.6. Option 6 - Return to Master Menu. This option returns to Screen 600 with no
      action for the current image.
2.173. TIP Processing Of Terminal Images.
   2.173.1. Purpose.   To provide a means for passing terminal images (images in
   xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. with the add, change, or delete flag set) to TIP for update of
   SBSS database records.
   2.173.2. Access. Enter option 7 from the Master Menu (Screen 600).
   2.173.3. Transmitting Data. Screen 600 remains displayed and progress messages display
   on STATUS line 24. These messages indicate the stages involved in transmitting to TIP.
   NGV068A verifies that the terminal data are correct (see Para 2.167). If the verification
   edits are not passed, no images are passed to TIP.                If edits are passed, the
   xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. file is read and those terminal images with an add, change,
   or delete flag are selected for processing. Selected images are sorted in sequence according
   to delete, change, add flags, and system designator. NGV068A formats a CON and sends it
   to TIP. NGV209 accepts the input and calls NGV269 for processing. Once the image has
   been sent to TIP, all flags are cleared on the image and it is rewritten to file (for add and
   change images) or deleted from the file (for a delete image). When all images are read, a
   TRANSMISSION COMPLETE message displays giving the total images sent to TIP.
2.174. TIP Processing Of Constant Images.
   2.174.1. Purpose.   To provide a means for passing constant images (images in
   xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701. with the add, change, or delete flag set) to online for update
   of SBSS database records.
   2.174.2. Access. Enter option 8 from the Master Menu (Screen 600).
   2.174.3. Transmitting Data. Screen 600 remains displayed and progress messages display
   on STATUS line 24. These messages indicate the stages involved in transmitting to TIP.
   NGV068A verifies that the constants data are correct (see Para. 2.167). If the verification
   edits are not passed, no images are passed to TIP.                  If edits are passed, the
   xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701. file is read and those constant images with an add, change,
   or delete flag are selected for processing. NGV068A formats a CON and sends through TIP.
   NGV209 accepts the input and calls NGV269 for processing. Once the image has been sent
   to TIP, all flags are cleared on the image and it is rewritten to file (for add and change
   images) or deleted from the file (for delete image of satellite support data). When all images
   are read, a TRANSMISSION COMPLETE message displays giving the total images sent to
   TIP.

                              DATABASE MAINTENANCE

Section 3A—-Database Maintenance Overview

3.1. Overview. Database maintenance is probably one of the easiest, yet most misunderstood
functions of any database management system. The DMS 1100 system used by the SBSS
utilizes a DMS (Data Management System) environment. The DMS database consists of two
types of DMS areas; SARP (Standard Area Record Placement) and DARP (Dynamic Area
Record Placement). SARP areas are standard in size while DARP areas expand as more area is
needed. The type of area used is based upon the type of records stored within the area. UP-
7907.3 will better explain the database design and utilization procedures. There are two
databases discussed in this chapter: the GV database and the CTH (Consolidated Transaction
History) database. For further information on these areas or any DMS questions, refer to your
CAR (customer account representative) for Unisys publications. These will be located in AF
INDEX 2.
   3.1.1. The standard GV database consists of 59 areas. Twenty nine areas for the primary, 29
   areas for the secondary, and one for the systems areas which is the
   DMS$<ALN>*SYSAREAS-GV. This is a stand-alone DMS area which contains two basic
   records; the 015-SUPRT-KEYS and the 100-SYSTEM-AREAS. This area must always be
   up (assigned to the Exec) with these two records installed. Without it, GV or CTH cannot
   operate. The CTH database areas are explained in Sec. 3D.
   3.1.2. Each area contains the sets and records necessary to make the SBSS operational.
   These areas are sized to provide the best performance possible while accessing the database.
   Areas too small causes storage problems while a database too large causes excessive
   input/output.
3.2. Defining a Database. Each database is a collection of interrelated data. Think of a
database in physical as well as logical terms. The following are the basic components of a DMS
database:
   3.2.1. Area/Page/Record. Each database area is subdivided into pages, the unit of storage
   used by input, output, and locking. Each page contains records. A record is a collection of
   related items of data. You store, add, delete, or modify records of data. You find these
   records on a page by using their database keys which is the physical address of each record.
   This key consists of an area code, page number, and record number. Database keys are used
   in the retrieval of these records.
   3.2.2. Data Items. Each record contains data. The basic unit of data is the data item. An
   example of a data item is the stock number on the item record. Data items are logically
   grouped into records; records are logically related by sets and are logically grouped into
   areas. A data item is an entity, such as a name or quantity within a record. You have to use
   some means to define the database to the user and the application programs. This definition
   is called a schema.
3.3. Defining a Schema and Subschema. The schema starts with an input source code of the
database definitions. These definitions contain the description of the database. You must name
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     221


the areas, sets, records, sizes of these areas, sets, records and the relationship of each. AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity uses DDL (Data Definition Language) and SDDL
(Subschema Data Definition Language) to compile the Schemas and Subschemas used by the
SBSS. The schema is the users view of the database. After the schema has been compiled, use
SDDL to describe the database, or subset of the database that is visible to the application
programs. This is called a subschema.
3.4. Storage Techniques. DMS uses two types of areas; SARP and DARP. SARP was the
method first developed to allocate data pages for record storage. DARP was developed to let
you initially allocate the minimum number of data pages only, with the DMR dynamically
allocating additional pages and overflow pages as needed. Since the SBSS changes, it may
become necessary from time to time to resize, either downsize or increase the DMS areas. This
is part of the resizing function of the SBSS.
   3.4.1. DMS 1100 utilities can help determine if resizing is required. Utilities such as
   VERIFY/GV-x, VERIFY/CALCx (x equals gang number) displays record counts as well as
   page usage. DMS uses the 799 reject to inform the user these areas are full. The error
   number 84 is when all overflow pages contain insufficient space to store another record.
   Another error which changed with the DMS-EXEC environment was the reject 799 Error
   number 100. This error is replaced by an I/O error 22 for all DMS-EXEC areas. These
   errors can be caused by a number of system problems. Power fluxes and equipment failures
   attribute to most of these. Bad database recoveries can also create these errors. The DMU
   utilities can explain the majority of errors with your database. DMU will never verify that
   the data contained on the pages are correct; its function is to verify that the physical pages are
   intact. The following is an example of DMU verify for SRD-GV-1:

   3.4.2. Although the above example displays 15 percent unused for prime and total pages and
   the overflow is 20 percent unused, you can still receive 07/12/84 and/or I/O 22 errors. The
   reason being is the way DMS works. In the DMS environment, each overflow page can only
   be associated with one prime page. If the run unit writes to the prime page and requires an
   overflow page, the DMR will assign an overflow page to that prime page unless all overflow
   pages have been exhausted, thus receiving a 799 12/91/084. Although DMU verify displays
   15 percent to 20 percent unused, that is because this is the total space available on all pages
   total. For instance, if the run unit required an overflow page, the DMR will check the next
   available page (from page 0). If none can be found then all pages have been allocated. The
   run unit may have only written one record to the associated overflow page; the only way to
   write to that particular overflow page again is if its owner (prime) page requires an overflow
   page. Thus, with one record only on that page, the percentage of unused is actual space not
   written to. Although this output of DMU shows no errors, it displays the area usage and
   remainder of space available for record storage.
   3.4.3. The next most used DMU utility is the VERIFY-CALC routine. This routine verifies
   the CALC chain integrity for the input area. DMU checks for chain completeness in both
   forward and backward locations. This is done by reading to forward and/or prior links.
   Although the complete option is released in 0GV0*DBRUN$., there are various options for
   this DMU verify. See UP-7909.6 for detailed options of DMU.
   3.4.4. Area Codes. Each DMS-EXEC area within the UDS (Universal Data System) is
   assigned its unique area code. This number is used by the DMR to determine which DMS-
   EXEC file will be used by the application program.

Section 3B—-Database Download And Upload
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    223


3.5. Database Download. The download program must be processed anytime you resize the
database, with exception to the TXHIST area. When you process the download and upload
programs, it keeps your database clean of orphan records. These records are named this by being
delinked or separated from their perspective owners and or members. Records such as the 103
and some other owner records are not downloaded. This is because the upload will create these
records for the proper linkage criteria. It is recommended that download and upload be
processed as required to maintain your database in an efficient manner. After processing your
download with no errors, start your upload. This will initialize all the DMS areas and reload the
database.
   3.5.1. Download Options.        Due to the complexity of the SBSS, only the COM
   (COMPLETE) option will be used for download. Although there are selective options
   available, a working knowledge of the schema and database is required for these options.
   The download will read the owner record and walk the chain. If this chain is broken, the
   download will error and finish prematurely. This is why it is imperative to be as error free as
   possible before the run starts.
   3.5.2. Using QLP or SURGE, locate any ITEM-RECORDS with a blank 101-STOCK-
   NUMBER and either load a 101-STOCK-NUMBER or delete these records. The upload
   program stores the ITEM-RECORD based upon the 101-STOCK-NUMBER and the 101-
   SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR. This will be used as the CALC-KEY. If the stock number is
   blank, the upload program will not store this record or any of its associated member records.
   These queries must be accomplished prior to the download.
3.6. Database Upload. Normally, the upload option is used when a base resizes areas or for a
schema conversion. There are six upload programs (NGV051 through NGV056). The best way
to find out which upload program loads which records is to process the full download and
upload. The printout for each upload program will show each record it fetches or stores. Keep
in mind that the upload programs may only fetch a particular type record (106 record as an
example) but doesn't actually store it.
   3.6.1. EXAMPLE 1: NGV051 stores the 106 records. NGV053 stores some records that
   are owned by the 106 record. NGV053 will fetch the already stored 106 to get currency and
   then store the particular record VIA SET. The printout for NGV051 will show the number of
   reads for the 106 and a total of 0 stored for the 106. Also some records that are not
   downloaded are uploaded.
   3.6.2. EXAMPLE 2: The 902 record is not downloaded but is stored by one of the uploads.
   NGV051 is a special case. NGV051 stores many records but the most common use of
   NGV051 is in the 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/SYSAREAS runstream. The download
   program does not download the 103-DOCUMENT-NBR records. Therefore, if you have too
   many pointer errors or this area is just too corrupt, you must first correct these errors, either
   by NDA500 or a selective recovery, then process the download and upload programs. The
   upload will rebuild the 103 records and relink them to their applicable member records.
   There are two options used by NGV051. They are:
       3.6.2.1. SYA (SYSAREAS) - this option used by NGV051 will load only two types of
       record. The 015 and 100 are the only two records in the SYSAREAS-GV. This option is
       used with run 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/SYSAREAS.
 224                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       3.6.2.2. COM (COMPLETE) - this option is used to load ALL records with NGV051,
       including the 015 and 100 records. This is the only option used when doing a download
       and upload at base level operations.
       3.6.2.3. As each upload program completes, a total record count will be displayed.
       These counts are explained in the following:
       3.6.2.4. TOTAL INPUTS READ: 15000                                 Note 1
       3.6.2.5. TOTAL INPUTS NOT PROCESSED: 11350                        Note 2
       3.6.2.6. TOTAL RECORDS STORED: 4250                               Note 3
       3.6.2.7. TOTAL RECORD ERRORS: 0                                 Note 4        Notes: 1.
       This is the total number of records read from the input tape. DNLOAD will create an
       output tape with two sorted files. These two files are read by the NLOAD programs.
       This total represents the total of this input file.     2. This is the total number of
       records on the input file NOT used by this particular upload program. The upload
       program will read the complete file BUT only select those record numbers which will be
       stored by this particular upload program. 3. This is the number of records that the
       current upload program has stored. The number may be less or more than the records
       selected. The upload program will create certain owner records that were NOT
       downloaded. Also, in most cases, if the upload program encounters a dupe record and the
       schema area has DUPLICATES NOT ALLOWED, it will skip that record. 103-
       DOCUMENT-NBR records are always created by the NGV052 program.                 4. Self-
       explanatory. Displays and skips the record in error.
3.7. Download/Upload Without Resizing. To process the download and upload without
resizing, process the following steps in order. In the following runstreams, the letter x represents
the applicable gang number. These procedures must be followed as closely as possible.
Deviation will only delay valuable processing time.
   3.7.1. Ensure all pseudo processing has been completed.
   3.7.2. Process RPTRUN on the primary and ensure all mandatory reports on the secondary
   database, including RPTEON, have been processed.
   3.7.3. Presizing procedures. x equals primary gang.

       your database. Verify/CALC will display broken or corrupt CALC chains. Break point
       file for Verify/GV is XGV0*VERGVx. Break point file for Verify/CALCx is
       XGV0*GVCALC.           3. The DOWN will release all DMS areas from APPL01. The
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 225


       secondary must be deleted. Since the database key formats will be changed, you must
       delete the secondary. x equals secondary gang number.
   3.7.4. Process all mandatory primary reports including RPTEON. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO
   NOT initialize beginning of day. There must be no transactions until after all of these
   procedures have been completed.
   3.7.5. IRUDUMP your primary database. Then, start the download. The download program
   may run anywhere from 1 to 3 hours, depending upon the size of your database. Since the
   download does not modify or delete records, restart is from beginning in the event of a
   system error.

       Notes: 1. Ensure this dump has NO read errors. This is your safety dump in the event of
       a fallback. Recommend two dumps be taken. 2. Save the output listing. This list will
       display the total number of each record for all DMS areas downloaded. The download
       program writes the selected records to tape, sorts them by record sequence, and then
       writes a second output tape labeled xGV0*GV-xTP. The letter x equals primary gang
       number. This tape will be used by the upload programs.
   3.7.6. Once the download is complete, reload all the records via NGV051 through NGV056.
   The upload may take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending upon your database size.
   NGV052 is the longest upload program due to the storing of item and detail records. In the
   event of a program abort, restart the program from the beginning. This is because with 66
   sets, 237 records and 28 areas, it will ensure that all records are properly linked. After the
   upload, dump your database. Do not load any IRUDUMP tapes prior to this step or your
   database will be corrupted. To keep a clean database, the download and upload, without
   resizing, is recommended semiannually.

       be the totals of all records uploaded. Verify/CALCx is processed to ensure all sets are
       properly linked. 3. For all sets, except CTH, enter: 1-65/80-102. For all sets enter A for
       set options. 4. This is your starting dump after the uploads. DO NOT LOAD ANY
       DUMPS PRIOR TO THIS DUMP or your database will be corrupted. Recommend
       two dumps be taken.

Section 3C—-Resizing The Database

3.8. Overview. Before any resizing option is used, it must be understood which areas are to be
sized. Also, sizing for mission growth, rehome gains or satellite additions should be discussed
 226                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


prior to the resize. Disk pack utilization is also a major factor in the resizing process. Always
coordinate with your DBA (database administrator) prior to any resize for disk utilization.
3.9. Presizing Procedures. Before resizing, you must first download the database. The
following run will download the database records to a cataloged tape file xGV0*DBDWNLD. It
then rewinds the tape, sorts the records by executing NGV058, and then writes the sorted output
to tape file xGV0*GV-xTP. x equals primary gang. Before downloading the database, it must
be as free as possible of errors. The download program (NGV057) will run with limited pointer
errors; however, page errors will abort NGV057. First verify your database with DMU and
NDA500. Remember to ensure all users are advised ahead of time and do not attempt to utilize
the system until after all resizing procedures have been completed.
   3.9.1. Process all pseudo inputs and run any required SIFS utilities to clear out SIFS data.
   3.9.2. Process RPTRUN (crossover) on the primary and process all mandatory reports on the
   secondary including RPTEON on the secondary.
   3.9.3. Process all mandatory reports, including RPTEON, on the primary. DO NOT,
   REPEAT, DO NOT initialize BOD (beginning-of-day). There can be no transactions during
   these resize procedures.
   3.9.4. Process the following jobs. Ensure they are error free before continuing with the next
   step:
       3.9.4.1. @XQT DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                                 Note 1
       3.9.4.2. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                              Note 2
       3.9.4.3. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                              Note 2
       3.9.4.4. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x
       3.9.4.5. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x                                  Note 3
       3.9.4.6. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x                                Note 3
       3.9.4.7. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                       Notes: 1. For all sets,
       except CTH, enter: 1-65/80-102. For all sets, enter A for set options.  2. Verify/GV
       will display record totals as well as detect any page errors on your database.
       Verify/CALC will display broken or corrupt CALC chains. The break point file for
       Verify/GV is xGV0*VERGVx.            The break point file for Verify/CALCx is
       xGV0*GVCALC. (x = primary gang number). 3. The DOWN will release all DMS
       areas from APPL01. Since the database key formats will be changed, the secondary must
       be deleted (x = secondary gang number).
   3.9.5. Once the above steps have been accomplished, error free, download the database.
   This run downloads the database to tape, rewinds the tape for reading by NGV058, then
   writes the sorted records to a new tape file called xGV0*GV-xTP. x equals primary gang.
       3.9.5.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.DNLOADx
   3.9.6. After this job fins, print your output. Visually compare record totals downloaded
   against the output from Verify/GV-x. Totals for most records should match. Not all records
   are downloaded because some are re-created by the upload program. Also members or
   records belonging to empty sets are deleted on the download. As stated, download will walk
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 227


   the owners through the members. One thing to keep in mind or check for is blank stock
   numbers on the ITEM-RECORDS. Although NGV057 will download these records,
   NGV052 will NOT upload these records because the CALC-key is built from the 101-
   STOCK-NUMBER and 101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR. If the DNLOADx aborts or a restart
   is required for any reason, just restart DNLOADx. As stated earlier, the DNLOADx does not
   delete or modify database records.
3.10. Executing NGVU31. NGVU31 reads and resizes the schema absolute SBSS-SCHEMA
based upon input from the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator. NGVU31
is menu-driven and manual intervention of the output files should not be done. NGVU31
interfaces with NDAU31 for schema modification. Manually processing NDAU31 can cause
disastrous results. Therefore, SBSS will use NGVU31 to resize their applicable schema. Prior to
executing NGVU31, save your catalog statements from your DBRUN$ file. NGVU31 will not
put your disk assignments on your new catalog elements. If you don't use disk assignments, then
there is no need to save these elements. The reason we don't use the disk assignments is if your
database administrator (DBA) has all disk assignments set to a particular size, the new sizes may
affect other files on that pack/disk.
   3.10.1. NGVU31 may be executed anytime and the ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA run can
   be processed later. The NCOIC could size the area(s) in the morning and not actually install
   the new sizes or schema until later. The only run that changes sizes or areas is the element
   created in the file 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA. You can run
   NGVU31 as many times, but, until you start this run, nothing changes. You must process
   NGVU31 with a nonexempt user-ID.
       3.10.1.1. KEYIN AND OPTIONS FOR NGVU31
       3.10.1.2. KEYIN: @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31

   3.10.2. After selecting the appropriate option and all prompts have been answered, do the
   following to create 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA. This file contains the new resized SBSS-
   SCHEMA absolute and all updated elements to activate your new sizes.

   3.10.3. To install new UDS and SBSS-SCHEMA, process the @START and the @ADD
   statements below. Also DO NOT start this run if your DMC has a UDS dump or UDS
   reload scheduled. It will not work. This run will update the UDS (Universal Data System).
   It will copy the SBSS-SCHEMA into your DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA. file and copy all
   the new catalog statements into your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file.
        3.10.3.1. @START                  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
        Note: Review the PR for errors. Breakpoint file is 0GV0<ALN>*DELSBS. Errors are
        OK here because the program may be trying to delete a file that does not exist. Also, the
        breakpoint file 0GV0<ALN>*INSTALL., MUST have 0-Fatal, 0-Errors on the
        INSTALL and EXPORT portion only. If you have a warning, go to that line and
        determine if the warning was serious. It will show you if that instruction was successful
        or not. There are too many warnings to list. Therefore, determine which type of warning
        it was. REMARKS are okay. Register the new SBSS-SCHEMA just resized via
        NGVU31 by processing the following:
        3.10.3.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR
   3.10.4. Review the catalog statements in your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file for the particular gang
   you resized. They must have the new sizes in the resized areas. If the disk assignment
   options are used, you must ensure the correct disk assignments are there. DO NOT
   CONTINUE UNTIL THIS STEP IS CORRECT!
3.11. Post Sizing Procedures. Now you are ready to upload the database. This job will read
the tape created by the DNLOADx program. The upload may take anywhere between 2 and 6
hours to complete based upon the size of your database and system saturation. NGV052 will be
the longest running upload program because this is the one that stores all the item details. After
upload, be sure to verify your database. This list should be compared with the one before the
download. As stated earlier, there will be some records not reloaded. Since some application
programs may leave empty sets or orphan records on the system, they will not be uploaded.
Before starting your UPLOAD, ensure you modify your new catalog (@CAT) statements in
0GV0*DBRUN$. Process the following jobs to reload the database:
        @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/GV-x                             Note 1
        @XQT DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                               Note 2
        @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                             Note 3
        @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                            Note 3
        @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                            Note 4
        @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC                         Note 5
        Continue with normal processing                            Note 6
Note:
1. Breakpoint file is xGV0*LOADx. x equals primary gang number. This list will display totals
for all records that were reloaded/stored.
2. Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors.
3. Verify/GV will display record totals from the uploads. Breakpoint file is xGV0*VERGVx.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 229


(Where x = gang number). Verify/CALC will display any CALC errors. This will ensure all
sets were properly linked. Breakpoint file is xGV0*GVCALC. (Where x = gang number.)
4. This is your starting IRU dump. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT LOAD ANY DUMPS
PRIOR TO THIS DUMP or your database will be corrupt.
5. This EXEC dump will save your SBSS environment for your particular ALN.
6. If all prior runs were error free, continue with your scheduled process.
   3.11.1. For the ACCOMMODATE option, after you have processed the runstream
   ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA, you have to use ACOPY to reload the incoming database.
3.12. Resizing TXHIST-GV Area. The transaction history area does not belong to any set and
does not point outside itself. The download and upload procedures are not required to resize this
DMS area. This section will cover the steps required to resize your TXHIST-GV area. The
storage method used for this area is DMS-CALC.
   3.12.1. Presizing Procedures. Process all reports, including RPTEON on your secondary
   gang. Your secondary gang must be closed out:
       3.12.1.1. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x (x = secondary gang number)
       3.12.1.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x (x = secondary gang number)
   3.12.2. Process all reports, including RPTEON on your primary gang. Your primary gang
   must be closed out. DMS-CALC uses the input 901-STOCK-NUMBER to store the 901
   records, then processes the following jobs. x equals primary gang number:
       3.12.2.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x
       3.12.2.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31
   3.12.3. Enter option 1. NGVU31 will prompt for record counts. TAB forward to the TXN-
   HIST field and enter the required number of transactions. Leave all other fields on this
   screen blank. Return to main menu and enter option 5. This will list your track sizes for the
   TXHIST area. If you entered the wrong counts, take option 1 and reinput your correct count.
   When ready, continue.
       3.12.3.1. @FREEALL
       3.12.3.2. @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE.
       3.12.3.3. @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
       3.12.3.4. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR
       3.12.3.5. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC
       3.12.3.6. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x

       3.12.3.8. @CAT,PV DMS$<ALN>*TXHIST-GV-x.,F/1/TRK/5,DA                  Note: The
       information required for the above @CAT statement can be obtained from your new
       CATx statement in file 0GV0*DBRUN$. In the above example F = disk type; 1=
       minimum track size; 5 = maximum track size; and DA = disk assignment. Modify your
 230                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       @CAT statement with the appropriate information. Be sure to add your disk assignment,
       if used. If you use @ASG instead of @CAT just change @CAT,PV to @ASG,UPV:
       3.12.3.9. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x
       3.12.3.10. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DMU
       3.12.3.11. INITIALIZE AREA TXHIST-GV-x.
       3.12.3.12. @EOF
       3.12.3.13. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x
   3.12.4. Your TXHIST area is now ready. Continue with your normal processing or any local
   procedures.

Section 3D—-CTH Database Maintenance

3.13. Overview. These procedures cover the implementation of CTH, the resizing of a new
CTH database or an existing one. In either case, there are a few steps that needs to be
accomplished before resizing or establishing the CTH database.
   3.13.1. Preconversion Procedures.      First, let’s cover the procedures for initial
   implementation of CTH. By now, everyone should be using CTH. Before we actually load
   data to these areas, you must determine the storage area required based upon a 13-month
   period. Any amount above this is by local discretion. Remember, the more data you have,
   the longer run time for the RPTD37 (NGV783), DMU verifies and NDA500. NGVU31 will
   be the processor used to build the DMS areas and modify the existing schema for the new
   sizes. A self-contained formula within NGVU31 helps you determine this. The following
   job will start the resizing process:
       3.13.1.1. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31
   3.13.2. Take option 2 for CTH only. This will not affect any of the NGV areas. CTH will
   be sized based upon projected transaction counts. The formula will size the CT-HIST-GV
   and CT-OWNR-GV based upon your input number of records. The CT-CTRL-GV area
   track sizes are released at a standard size. If you have answered the formula wrong, just exit
   NGVU31 and restart the run.
       3.13.2.1. @FREEALL
       3.13.2.2. @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE.
   3.13.3. When ready to size, do the following. Although you're only sizing the CTH areas, all
   GV users must be down. This is because you will be deleting and restoring the internal UDS
   areas.
       3.13.3.1. @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
       3.13.3.2. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR
       3.13.3.3. INITIALIZE CTH DATABASE AREAS.
       3.13.3.4. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTHx (x = CTH gang number)
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  231


3.14. Upload and Establish CTH Histories. Prepare the Consolidated Transaction History
area for loading by processing NGV225 (Create Consolidated Transaction History Control
Record). The program will prompt for the input GANG and NUMBER OF DATA PAGES
required to establish the area. Enter the Primary gang number at the first prompt (must be 1 - 4).
Next, enter the number of data pages, and be sure to follow the provided sizing formula. To
process NGV225, enter the following command:
   3.14.1. @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R
   3.14.2. #        (Enter primary gang number)
   3.14.3. Y        (Enter Y since you have sizes from NGVU31 or N if you don't)
   3.14.4. #        (Enter primary gang)
   3.14.5. XXXXXX            (Enter # of pages from NGVU31. The # of pages must be entered
   with                            leading zeros. For instance, if the count is 50000, then enter
   050000.)
3.15. Overview UTL043 (NGV043). This is an example of how to use UTL043. Process
UTL043 (NGV043) to establish the Consolidated Transaction History areas by using UTL041
tapes. Research must be accomplished to determine the number of months to be loaded, based
upon the available disk storage from your DBM. Tapes must be loaded in transaction date
sequence with the oldest date loaded first. If you have missing dates in the Consolidated
Transaction History area, (and those dates have actual transactions), then the integrity of the
CTH area is compromised. If dates are missing, the Consolidated Transaction History is invalid.
   3.15.1. You have to take into account the amount of time it takes to upload these histories.
   An average time for an upload is approximately 2 to 16 hours per 100,000 transactions. Your
   time will depend upon your configuration and system workload during the upload process.
   To ensure time is not wasted on trying to upload a bad tape, it's highly recommended that a
   few days prior to the upload process the M19 (NGV777) against the UTL041 tapes.
   3.15.2. There are two load options for UTL043.
       3.15.2.1. Load all histories during one end-of-day processing.
       3.15.2.2. Load all histories on more than one end-of-day processing.
   3.15.3. Here are the steps used for uploading the CT-HISTORIES using the UTL043
   (NGV043).
       3.15.3.1. After processing the RPTRUN crossover, you will need to process NGV299
       and set the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED to a 1 on the secondary database. Process
       NGV225 as explained above. NGV225 will only be processed one time, as it stores the
       711-CT-HISTORY and 710-CT-SUPPORT records. The processing of NGV299 to
       change the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED will have to be processed each day on the
       secondary database if your upload is spread out over more than one end of day
       processing. After processing NGV299/NGV225, start the first UTL043 to upload your
       first month’s histories. You can process your regular EOD schedule, but remember any
       add-on reports will slow down the upload process. Your online processing time should
       not be compromised. If you want to upload using UTL043 and not spread it over more
 232                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       than one EOD, do not process RPTRUN crossover or RPTEON while UTL043 is
       processing.
   3.15.4. Once all UTL043’s have completed you will need to process NGV299 and change
   the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED to a 1 on the primary database. This will let RPTRUN
   crossover automatically dump the CTH areas and process the D37. Here are two final
   Helpful hints. It would be wise, and it's highly recommended that a dump of the CTH areas
   be taken after each successful UTL043 upload. Also, on the RPTRUN select image, do not
   take the bypass option (B in cc-79) in the event that a CTH recovery is required. This can be
   waivered by MAJCOM. After you are through with your complete upload, you will also
   need to process the UTL042 to show what transaction dates have been loaded.
       3.15.4.1. Process NDA500. A option on the Primary.
       3.15.4.2. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CTHx
       3.15.4.3. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALC-CTHx
       3.15.4.4. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx
       3.15.4.5. Ensure your base constants has the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag set to a 1.
       Process either NGV068A or NGV299 to complete this step.
3.16. CTH DMS Areas. The CTH database is comprised of three areas located on the primary
gang only. They are the CT-HIST-GV, CT-OWNR-GV and the CT-CTRL-GV areas.
   3.16.1. The CT-HISTORY area contains the 711 CT-HISTORY-CONTROL and 704 CT-
   HISTORY records. The 704 records are the 901 records that are printable transactions. The
   711 record controls the whole CTH operation. This record is created and stored by program
   NGV225. The 711 is a direct record and is always stored at the following location:
       3.16.1.1. AREA = CT-HIST-GV-x
       3.16.1.2. PAGE = 1
       3.16.1.3. REC = 1
   3.16.2. This record contains the following information to control the CTH environment.
   711-NUMBER-OF-PAGES: This will equal the total number of tracks the CT-HIST area is
   currently sized for. It must equal the number of tracks shown on the Schema for the CT-
   HIST-GV-X area. The next field, 711-RECORDS-PER-PAGE: This will ALWAYS equal
   20. Each page within the CT-HIST-GV-X area will hold 20, 704 records except page 1
   which contains only the 711 CT-CONTROL-RECORD. To compute the number of histories
   (704) you can store, use the following formula as an example:
       711-NUMBER-OF-PAGES * 711-RECORDS-PER-PAGE - 20
                      |                               |           |
                   (25000         *                  20 )       - 20 = 499,980
       3.16.2.1. 711-NEXT-PAGE-NUMBER: tells the D37 (NGV778) at which page number
       to write the next 704 record.
       3.16.2.2. 711-NEXT-RECORD-NUMBER: tells the D37 (NGV778) at which record
       number or page slot to write the next 704 record.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                233


       3.16.2.3. 711-PURGE-DATE: this is the date of the oldest record stored within the CT-
       HIST area. UTL041 checks this field prior to deleting the 704 records.
       3.16.2.4. 711-SUMMARY-INDEX: Unused.
       3.16.2.5. 711-TRANSACTION-SUMMARY:
       3.16.2.6. 711-TRANSACTION-DATE = Ordinal date the D37 was processed on. The
       oldest date is first.
       3.16.2.7. 711-TRANSACTION-COUNT = Number of transactions loaded for that day.
   3.16.3. The CT-CTRL area is the area that Document Control works with and should have
   the responsibility to keep organized. This area contains the following records:
706-CT-DELINQUENT-SOURCE
        * 707-CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL
        708-CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC
        709-CT-DELINQUENT-OPR
        * 710-CT-SUPPORT
Note: * equals the only records you will need to work with. All other records are created by
TIP inputs and by Document Control personnel.
       3.16.3.1. This area is sized at 450 prime and 573 overflow (450/1023). It is released by
       AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity at this size and must not be changed. It
       will hold a maximum of 32,000 to 35,000, 707 CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL records.
       The 710 CT-SUPPORT is used by the DEL DOC list R59 and D37. This is a direct
       record (page 1, record 1) and is used by the D37 to write restart points to. There is no
       restart for the D37, but this record must be stored in order for the D37 to process. When
       storing with NGV299, the record needs no data stored in the fields of the 710. Always
       store a blank record. Do not modify any fields. The 707 CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL
       records are DCC images either loaded automatically by the D37 or manually by
       NGV330. This record is used to create DCC images when download/upload of DCC
       images are required. The 707 date is five positions but the DCC format is four positions.
       You will need to modify these images PRIOR to loading them via program NGV330.
   3.16.4. The CT-OWNR area contains the owner records for the CT-HIST area.
   3.16.5. D37 Run Logic. Ensure RPTRUN (NGV898C) has processed a CTH dump, then
   start the D37 process for the daily updates. The D37 writes the daily 901-TRANSACTION-
   HISTORY records to the 704-HISTORY records and creates the 707 records. In order to
   process the D37, NGV898C will check to see if the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag is set to
   a 1. If it is, the D37 procedures will proceed, then the CTH areas are dumped to tape IAW
   Ch 2, for CTH dumps. This dump is mandatory. Since the area is so large, "QUICK-
   LOOKS" are turned off and prohibits ROLLBACK in the event of an error. If LOOKS were
   left on, all images would be written to AUDIT-TRAIL and a lot of valuable computer time
   would be lost. That is why if you are working errors with either the D37, UTL043 or any
   other CTH program, ALWAYS recover the CTH database first. Remember to turn LOOKS
   back on by processing 0GV0*DBRUN$.LOOKSON/CTH1 before any recovery.
 234                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   3.16.6. DMS$<ALN>*RECOVERYOFF. This file is a DMS file required to be assigned
   anytime LOOKS are turned off. If it is not assigned or cataloged just catalog this file in
   public mode as follows: @CAT,PV DMS$<ALN>*RECOVERYOFF.
   3.16.7. Common errors with D37 and UTL043. Due to system errors and operator interface,
   you may receive from time to time, the following errors. Not all errors are listed due to the
   situation, but the most frequent will be explained.
       3.16.7.1. 799/12/05/00 - DUPES NOT ALLOWED - You have more than one 901-
       TRANSACTION-HISTORY that has the same transaction number. 704 records are
       stored by transaction number. Since the schema states DUPES NOT ALLOWED in this
       DMS-EXEC area, that is why you encounter this error. Function number 12 is a store
       function in COBOL.
          3.16.7.1.1. TO CORRECT: Reload the CTH area, identify the dupe 901, change the
          901-TRANSACTION-NBR to a number that is not in use.
       3.16.7.2. 799/12/91/84 - All associated overflow pages have been utilized or maximum
       storage has been reached. The UDS (Universal Data System) or DMS-EXEC area has
       reached its maximum storage capability.
          3.16.7.2.1. TO CORRECT: Reload the CTH area, run VERIFY/CTHx and identify
          which area is full. Check the CT-CTRL area first. If it is the CT-HIST or the CT-
          OWNR area, UTL041 must be processed to free up disk space. If it is the CT-CTRL
          area, process NGV330 and have Document Control delete invalid images, DMU
          initialize the CTRL area, use NGV299 to store the 710 record, and process NGV330
          to upload the edited file.
       3.16.7.3. 799/07/12/161 - Not enough disk space. This error will be more than likely
       received by those bases that use removable packs. The way to check this is a @PRT,D
       REM01/FMD (example of pack-ID and equipment type). Contact your DMC for more
       disk space. Refer to the DMU example that was discussed earlier.
3.17. Recovery of the CTH Database.
   3.17.1. General. There are many ways to recover the CTH area. Since the CT-HIST area is
   made up of direct records you can recover this area in a number of different ways. Just
   remember, you can NEVER use AUDIT-TRAIL tapes.                    Since LOOKS and
   RECOVERYOFF options are utilized, nothing from CTH is ever written to AUDIT-TRAIL.
   Be sure that any time you use your secondary gang to reload 901 records, ALWAYS,
   REPEAT ALWAYS, dump the secondary gang prior to reloading any dump.
   3.17.2. RPTEON on the secondary will cross over numerous records and if you have an old
   dump loaded, that data gets crossed over to the primary. That is why you always process
   RPTEON on the secondary prior to a recovery and do not process RPTEON again until the
   next processing day (crossover) has been accomplished. There are too many conditions to
   list that might require a recovery but the following are the most frequent:
       3.17.2.1. ERROR: Disk crash, last good dump was 3 days PRIOR. First, process
       RPTEON on the secondary if not already done. Next, reload last good CTH dump.
       Reload the crossover dump for the particular day’s transaction date you need to recover.
       Process the D37. Reload the next day’s crossover dump. Process the D37. Repeat these
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 235


      steps until current. Process the R60. Remember, DO NOT PROCESS RPTEON ON
      THE SECONDARY.
      3.17.2.2. ERROR:      Monday's CTH histories are valid, Tuesday's are invalid,
      Wednesday's are valid, Thursday’s are valid, and today is Friday. Use the same recovery
      procedures as contained in the “ERROR:” paragraph above to recover the CTH data.
3.18. Processing D37 (NGV778) With Multiple Crossovers.
   3.18.1. There may be times when maintenance of the CTH database may not be required to
   process the D37 for several days. This can be done, but it will require close coordination and
   system processing time. The following is recommended to reload each day’s transaction
   histories. These transaction histories will be loaded from the RPTRUN (crossover) dump.
      3.18.1.1. Complete all reports on the secondary database.
      3.18.1.2. Process RPTEON on the secondary database.
      3.18.1.3. Dump the secondary database.
      3.18.1.4. Save and modify an existing IRU runstream with the following ECL
      commands. Process this IRU Reload for the first day of transactions to reload.
          3.18.1.4.1. @RUN,A RELOAD,,xGV0
          3.18.1.4.2. @SYM PRINT$.,,RPS08
          3.18.1.4.3. @ASG,T APPL01*IRU$HF.
          3.18.1.4.4. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x
          3.18.1.4.5. @IRU
          3.18.1.4.6. RELOAD FILE DMS$<ALN>*TXHIST-GV-x
          3.18.1.4.7. FROM REEL ??????;
          3.18.1.4.8. ACT; END;
          3.18.1.4.9. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x
          3.18.1.4.10. @FIN              Note: Replace ?????? with the reel number of
          the RPTRUN dump tape. For multiple reels you only need the first tape number. x
          equals secondary gang number.
      3.18.1.5. Change the following fields to equal the date of the transaction histories loaded
      from the previous paragraph 002-ORDINAL-DATE, 002-JULIAN-DATE, 002-
      CALENDAR-DATE.
      3.18.1.6. Process the D37.
      3.18.1.7. Repeat the IRU Reload instructions above until all days have been recovered.
      See the note above; remember to change the ?????? each time to the applicable reel
      number.
      3.18.1.8. Dump the CTH database:
          3.18.1.8.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx
 236                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       3.18.1.9. Once the last D37 has processed, down and delete the secondary database. x
       equals the secondary gang number. RPTEON has already updated the primary. These
       two steps will prevent an erroneous update of the primary database.
           3.18.1.9.1. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x
           3.18.1.9.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x
       3.18.1.10. Process UTL042, if desired, to list the days and transaction counts of your
       CTH database.
       3.18.1.11. Resume normal processing.
3.19. Processing UTL043 (NGV043) With Multiple Crossovers.
   3.19.1. There may be times when reprocessing of UTL043 cannot be completed in an end-
   of-day due to the number of transactions on your system or recoveries. These procedures
   cover the steps necessary to resize your CTH areas in the event that the download and upload
   will cover more than one end of day reports. As with resizing GV, ensure that these
   procedures are discussed ahead of time with all users.
   3.19.2. Process your normal end of day crossover. Ensure your DMC does not scratch the
   tapes for the days that are to be loaded. You must ensure all steps are clear before and after
   reloading the CTH database. You can either start your upload after end of day reports or
   whenever you want. We suggest the following; leave the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag to
   equal a " " (space), process RPTRUN (crossover) on the primary, and process UTL043 while
   the dailies are processing. Again, this is a suggestion and may be processed as locally
   determined.
   3.19.3. In any case, process an IRUDUMP after each successful UTL043. Each tape may
   take anywhere from 2 to 16 hours to process, depending upon the number of transactions and
   number of days you are loading.
   3.19.4. Process UTL042 to list out the dates and number of transactions loaded for your days
   reloaded. After all reloads have been completed, unless local procedures exist, the users may
   now query the CTH database.
3.20. Resizing Existing CTH Database. These steps will be used to resize an existing CTH
database. You should keep at least 13 months of data on your CTH database. However, this
may change from one system to another based upon the disk area available and workload.
Before any resize, notify all users that all CTH processing must cease until after the resizing has
been completed. The only time the ADS for GV has to be down is for the runstream
ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA. Once this has been completed, all users can continue processing
with the exception of CTH. Before you start to resize your CTH area consider the average time
to download, resize, and upload 13 months’ worth of CT-HISTORY records.
   3.20.1. Before any resize, save your SBSS executive environment and CTH database:
       3.20.1.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC
       3.20.1.2. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx
   3.20.2. Next, you must download existing CTH records using UTL041. Process UTL041
   with a B in position 54. This option bypasses deleting the records as they are being
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    237


   downloaded. Since these areas will be initialized later, this will save a lot of processing time.
   (See Ch 2, for UTL041.) After processing UTL041 to download all CTH records, continue
   with the CTH resizing. Process NGV330 download option to save your 707 records that
   have not been cleared by Document Control. Turn CTH off by setting the 002-ATH-
   IMPLEMENTED to equal a " " (space) on the primary. Do not set it back to a 1 until all
   recoveries are completed and you start processing the D37.
       3.20.2.1. Size your new schema: @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31
   3.20.3. Enter option 2 for CTH. Next, NGVU31 will prompt for the number of 704-
   TRANSACTION-HISTORY records to be stored. Again, using the formula displayed, enter
   this number. When you return to the main menu of NGVU31, use the L option to list the
   new sized CT-HISTORY area. Ensure primary database is offline and no users can access
   the database. Start the resize process:
       3.20.3.1. @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE.
       3.20.3.2. @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
       3.20.3.3. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR
       3.20.3.4. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTH1
       3.20.3.5. @ADD,L GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R                    Note: NGV225 will
       prompt for gang number and number of CT-HISTORY tracks. This run will build the
       711-CT-HISTORY-CONTROL and 710-CT-SUPPORT records.                       The 711-CT-
       HISTORY-CONTROL resides in the CT-HISTORY area at page 1, record 1. This is the
       only record on this page. The 710-CT-SUPPORT resides in the CT-CTRL-GV-1 area at
       page 1, record 1, and will not be the only record stored on this page. This is a CTS
       subroutine that will prompt you for the correct answers. The response for number of
       tracks must be six positions. Once NGV225 completes continue, start the upload process.
   3.20.4. Process UTL043 to upload your CTH records downloaded from UTL041 tapes in
   this section. (See Ch 2 for the UTL043 instructions.) This may take anywhere from 2 to 16
   hours per month. These tapes must be reloaded in transaction date sequence with the oldest
   date loaded first. DO NOT SKIP any dates or your CTH database will become an invalid
   audit trial. If the upload extends past your end of day processing and crossover is required,
   follow the steps in the paragraph on Processing UTL043 (NGV043) With Multiple
   Crossovers, in this section. If the upload does not extend past your end of day, continue on
   with the following step:
   3.20.5. Process UTL042. This report will verify the CTH database, list the transaction dates
   and number of transactions for the days on the select card. UTL042 is used as a verification
   list to ensure the correct number of transactions are loaded for the dates selected.
3.21. Examples of CTH Recoveries. There are many ways to recover the CTH area. Since the
CT-HIST area is made up of direct records you can recover this area in a number of different
ways. Just remember, you can NEVER use AUDIT-TRAIL tapes. Since LOOKS and
RECOVERYOFF options are utilized, nothing from CTH is ever written to AUDIT-TRAIL. Be
sure that anytime you use your Secondary gang to reload 901 records, ALWAYS, REPEAT
ALWAYS, dump it PRIOR to reloading anything. Remember, RPTEON on the secondary will
cross over numerous records and if you have an old dump loaded, that's what gets crossed over.
 238                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


The following are a few examples only. There are too many conditions to list that might require
a recovery.
   3.21.1. ERROR 1: Disk crash, last good dump was 3 days prior. First, dump the secondary
   database and process RPTEON on the secondary after all reports have completed. Next,
   reload the only transaction histories from the first crossover dump. After loading the
   transaction histories, change the 002-ORDINAL-DATE, 002-JULIAN-DATE and the 002-
   CALENDAR-DATE to equal the date of these histories. Process the D37 and repeat these
   steps with each RPTRUN on the primary. When completed, DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT
   PROCESS RPTEON ON THE SECONDARY GANG.
   3.21.2. ERROR 2: Monday's histories are valid, Tuesday's are invalid, Wednesday's are
   valid, Thursday’s are valid and today is Friday. Use the procedures from paragraph above to
   recover the CTH areas.
   3.21.3. ERROR 3. Using the same two examples in section above, you may also recover the
   CTH database using the following steps:
       3.21.3.1. Process all secondary reports.
       3.21.3.2. IRU dump the secondary.
       3.21.3.3. Process secondary RPTEON.
       3.21.3.4. Reload Monday’s CTH dump to the primary.
       3.21.3.5. Reload the transaction histories (901) from the RPTRUN dump taken Monday
       to the secondary database.
       3.21.3.6. Change 002-ORDINAL-DATE, 002-JULIAN-DATE and 002-CALENDAR-
       DATE to reflect the transaction history date (MONDAY). Change 002-FLAG-S to a 1, if
       RPTEON has already been processed.
       3.21.3.7. Process D37.
       3.21.3.8. Repeat reloading the transaction histories, changing the dates and processing
       the D37 for each day until current.
       3.21.3.9. Process the R60 to update the CTRL area.
       3.21.3.10. IRU dump the CTH database when completed.
       3.21.3.11. Down and delete the secondary. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT process
       RPTEON on the secondary.
          3.21.3.11.1. EXAMPLE 1:         Recovering The Consolidated Transaction History
          (CTH) Areas
       3.21.3.12. 798 REJECT. This is usually caused by Batch Production Scheduler (BPS)
       cleanup deleting the BPS file so the program cannot go to a good end of job.
          3.21.3.12.1. Process UTL042 for the date you are processing on.
          3.21.3.12.2. Validate total transactions with the SORT count from the D37. This was
          displayed on your console typeout. If the totals on UTL042 match the number of
          transactions sorted, then no recovery is required.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                239


        3.21.3.12.3. Resume normal EOD processing.
        3.21.3.12.4. If the count does not match, you will have to reload the CTH dump
        taken prior to the D37 and then reprocess the D37.
            3.21.3.12.4.1. EXAMPLE 2: Download and Upload Of CTRL-GV-1 Area
     3.21.3.13. RPTR59 (NGV781) is unmanageable; that is 300 or more pages. When you
     process the R59 and there are no records selected, based upon input or the DCC images
     being sent back to the main frame 2200 not clearing, you may need to download/upload
     the CTRL-GV-1 area.
        3.21.3.13.1. DMU VERIFY of the CT-CTRL-GV-x area shows the number of
        overflow pages as being 400 or more. There are only a maximum of 577. Subtract
        prime pages from overflow pages.
        3.21.3.13.2. Use the following to download and upload your DCC images. While
        doing this, normal processing on the primary and secondary can continue, except for
        processing against the CTH areas.
            3.21.3.13.2.1. Process NGV330 download option.           Have Document Control
            suspend download and upload of DCC images.
            3.21.3.13.2.2. Rebuild the CT-CTRL-GV-x area and clear the overflow pages:
                3.21.3.13.2.2.1. @ERS DMS$<ALN>*CT-CTRL-GV-X
                3.21.3.13.2.2.2. @ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.DMU
                3.21.3.13.2.2.3. INITIALIZE AREA CT-CTRL-GV-x
                3.21.3.13.2.2.4. @EOF
            3.21.3.13.2.3. Use NGV299 to store the 710 record.
            3.21.3.13.2.4. Delete any invalid DCC images. These images will be in file
            xGV0<ALN>*GV330UD700. The x equals primary gang.
            3.21.3.13.2.5. Process NGV330 to upload the DCR images.
            3.21.3.13.2.6. Dump the CTH database:
                3.21.3.13.2.6.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx
            3.21.3.13.2.7. Resume normal processing.
                3.21.3.13.2.7.1. EXAMPLE 3: Check the following if you receive the
                message no records selected when processing the R59:
     3.21.3.14. List the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC records (708). The R59 uses the TRIC and
     date fields on these records for selection criteria. The 708 records can be added, deleted,
     or changed via TIP screen TRIC 1DQ (screen #412) by Document Control personnel.
     3.21.3.15. List the 710-DELINQUENT-DATE using NGV299. The R59 compares this
     date to the CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL records (707) and the CT-DELINQUENT-
     TRIC records (708) to determine delinquency. This date is determined and updated via
     TIP screen 1AQ (screen #503) by Document Control personnel.

Section 3E—-Import And Export Definition

3.22. Overview of the UDS Environment.
   3.22.1. One of the most important functions of maintaining the DMS databases are the
   Unisys Repository Manager (UREP). UREP is part of the overall Universal Data System
   (UDS). SBSS will be our main concern in this UDS review. The SBSS utilizes the
   Repository and the File Description Table (FDT) for storage/definition of all the DMS areas.
   Always coordinate with the SBLC/RPC when you do an IMPORT or INSTALL. If a UDS-
   DUMP or UDS-LOAD is in progress, the IMPORT or INSTALL will not work. Also, if this
   is done after hours, see if the DMC will wait until after the IMPORT/INSTALL to run the
   UDS dump.
   3.22.2. Example of Repository and File Description Tables:
           /         \       __________           __________
       / Repository \                 |ITMDTL-GV |         |DOCNBR-GV |
       |             |       | [FDT] |         | [FDT] |
       | ITMDTL-GV           |         >|__________|       -|__________|
       | DOCNBR-GV                |        |           |
       | REPCYC-GV            |          ____|_____         ____|_____
       | PRTNBR-GV            |         |REPCYC-GV |         |PRTNBR-GV |
       | etc......       |   | [FDT] |         | [FDT] |
       \ 249 areas SBSS /<              |__________|       -|__________|
           \______________/
   3.22.3. In the above example, the Repository contains descriptions of all 249 areas of the
   SBSS database. You MUST have a corresponding FDT for each description in the database.
   You always create the Repository then build each FDT by using the CREATE/INSTALL
   commands in the IMPORT or INSTALL runstreams. Next, each runstream is explained to
   illustrate the relationship of the Repository and FDT.
3.23. Import/Delete/Report Definition.
   3.23.1. IMPORT. This command builds the internal database called the UDS (Universal
   Data System). These are tables which define external DMS-EXEC database areas. They
   define certain attributes about these areas such as locking strategy, assignment configuration,
   area sizes and so on. Without a valid UDS, the external database could never be operational.
   The DD (Data Dictionary) processor is used to update or delete the UDS. Anytime a resize is
   accomplished, the UDS as well as the DMS areas must be updated. The application
   (APPL01) for instance, checks the UDS prior to the DMS-EXEC areas. If it's corrupt, a
   DMS 1100 error will occur. The three most common options we use through the DD
   processor is Delete, Install, and Report.
   3.23.2. DELETE OPTION. First, look at the Delete option. The main purpose of the delete
   option is to remove all FDT (File Description Tables) from the UDS. There must be a FDT
   for every DMS-EXEC area in your database. The example shows the relationships of the
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                            241


  FDT and Repository. You may have to delete and reinstall these areas after a system crash,
  413-boot, and the delete is mandatory after a database resize. You always delete the FDT
  first, then the repository. The following two examples show the difference: (1) PROCESS
  STORAGE-AREA ITMDTL-GV-1 VERSION ALL FOR SCHEMA SBSS9005EMA
  DELETE, and, (2) DELETE STORAGE-AREA ITMDTL-GV-1 VERSION ALL FOR
  SCHEMA SBSS9005EMA. In the first example, the PROCESS is placed in front and the
  DELETE verb is at the end of the command. This tells the DD processor to delete the FDT.
  The second example shows the DELETE in front of the command. This tells the DD
  dictionary to delete the Repository. Remember, you must delete the FDT first, then the
  Repository or a DD error will occur.
  3.23.3. REPORT OPTION. This option reads the UDS database and displays the attributes
  for each DMS-EXEC area. The following example shows the Report option for
  DMS$<ALN>*ITMDTL-GV-1:
     3.23.3.1. @DD,DE
     3.23.3.2. UREP 1R2 (07/17/92 15:25:10) 11/02/93 12:59:59

       3.23.3.22. *REMARK* DSD4036 Your PROCESS STORAGE-AREA ALL command
       was successful.
       3.23.3.23. END UREP (0) FATALS (0) ERRORS (0) WARNINGS (2 REMARKS).
   3.23.4. As you can see, the FDT describes all attributes of DMS-EXEC areas. The two
   fields most frequently changed by DBRUN$ ECL runstreams are the RECOVERY and
   MAXIMUM-PAGES fields. The RECOVERY is changed to AUDITED FALSE whenever
   LOOKSOFF/GV-x is processed from your DBRUN$ file. This is used by the RPTD37
   (NGV778) to turn after-looks off. AFTER-LOOKS are the updated database pages normally
   written to audit trail. Since the D37 has so many updates and IRU dumps are taken after the
   report has been processed, it would be a waste of system resources to write all updated pages
   to the audit trail tape and then process an IRU dump.
   3.23.5. The only difference between the Import and Install runstreams in your DBRUN$ file
   is simply the name. Both elements INSTALL the UDS areas. However, the IMPORT is
   used for any UDS rebuild except NGVU31. The INSTALL runstream uses file
   0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA. which was updated by NGVU31, the SBSS resizing processor.
3.24. Export Definition.
   3.24.1. EXPORT. The Export process saves the descriptions after the UDS areas have been
   installed. The Export reads the UDS areas and writes this data to a file or element. The
   SBSS uses the runstream 0GV0*DBRUN$.EXPORT/ALL-SBSS to build this element.
   Once the updates have been applied to the UDS, an @START of this runstream builds the
   element EXPORT/SBSS-SCHEMA in your DBRUN$ file. The following command exports
   the UDS areas:
       3.24.1.1. EXPORT       STORAGE-AREA          ALL    VERSION       ALL    FOR     SCHEMA
       SBSS9005EMA
   3.24.2. The above command Exports all FDT descriptions for schema SBSS9005EMA. This
   element must always be current and located in file 0GV0*DBRUN$. It's read by NGVU31,
   the SBSS resizing processor, and used to rebuild the UDS by runstream
   0GV0*DBRUN$.IMPORT/SCHEMA. Since it only reads and does not update the UDS,
   you can run this job while the SBSS is in any processing mode.

Section 3F—-Database Key/Set Checks And Errors

3.25. Overview. Various processes exist on the SBLC to verify the validity of the database.
These include checks for valid pages (tracks) and valid linkage between associated sets. No
DMS utility will verify that the data on these pages are correct. Its purpose is to verify that the
database is structurally intact. If any errors appear at any time you must take your database
offline and determine the cause of these errors. At no time should you remain inline if a
database error is discovered.
   3.25.1. SBSS application program NGV024, Item and Repair Cycle Record Link Check
   Program, must be used to verify the integrity of item and repair cycle records.
   3.25.2. Data Management Utility (DMU). DMS 1100 Data Management Utility (DMU)
   processes must be used to verify the integrity of the database.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     243


       3.25.2.1. 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x. This runstream ensures that records located
       within an area are authorized, as identified by the schema, to reside within the area. It
       also provides certain sizing data which will be used by AFMC SCM-R Information
       Technology Activity personnel to determine if resizing of the database is necessary.
       Recommended limits are: optimum is 65 percent and maximum is 75 to 80 percent. If an
       area exceeds 80 percent, notify the MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-R Information
       Technology Activity for resizing verification. This must be processed at least weekly.
       3.25.2.2. NDA500. This program verifies all sets identified by the schema. It ensures
       each member of the set is linked to another member in the set or to its owner record. If a
       set is empty, it verifies the fact that the owner's next pointer is pointing to itself. If a
       record has a pointer, other than pointing to itself, the record at the location being pointed
       to, must be a record authorized to be in the particular set. If a record's next owner, or
       prior pointer does not point to a record authorized within the set, an error file is produced.
       NDA500 is mandatory on the secondary database daily, immediately after RPTRUN on
       the primary and prior to any reports on the secondary gang. It is also NDA500
       mandatory weekly on the primary database using the A (all) option.
       3.25.2.3. 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx. Performs verification of CALC chains.
       Recommend running bimonthly or whenever pointer errors are suspected. NDA500 will
       not show CALC errors. Verify/CALC is the only verification program to identify CALC
       errors.
3.26. Errors. When appropriate, all errors are printed on the AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity console and/or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity printer.
The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisor should review the error
printouts and ensure corrective action is taken. Corrective action is unique for each situation.
Any errors from the Verify/GV-x, Verify/CALCx, or NDA500 produced on the primary database
must be corrected as soon as possible in order to maintain database integrity. This would include
taking the primary database offline, correcting the error or errors, dumping the database and then
resuming normal processing. Under no circumstances must an SBSS account be online if errors
are discovered or suspected.

Section 3G—-Forced Record Alteration (NGV299)

3.27. Overview. Occasionally, there will be conditions created on a database that cannot be
corrected by processing normal transactions. When these conditions exist the records must be
altered or deleted. However, there are conditions where record alterations should never be used;
this includes NGV299, QLP with update, and DBE. Use of QLP with update and DBE
(Database Editor) is authorized by the MAJCOM or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity ONLY. It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by processing a normal
input or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance, reverse-post, or inventory adjustments in
lieu of NGV299.
3.28. Processing of Program NGV299. This program will permit alteration or deletion of
records on the database. The execution of this program is restricted to the AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity (function 057) and should only be executed by personnel who
are familiar with database management system commands and the structure of the database.
Para 3.54 lists the commands authorized for execution by program NGV299. Para 3.55
 244                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


provides examples to execute several of the commands. The program is gang oriented. Once the
execution phase has started and a gang number has been entered, it cannot be changed. To enter
a different gang number, terminate execution of the current run and reexecute the run unit using
the desired gang number. When executing this program, it is essential to ensure that currency of
the record being modified is established prior to the modification. One word of caution; do not
try to alter, modify, or delete records while online because you may cause database pointer
errors. NDA500 must be processed after NGV299 has completed processing.
3.29. Documentation. For accounts not aligned under the AFGLSC construct, a document
reflecting both the BEFORE and AFTER image is printed for each record altered or deleted. All
copies of the document will be annotated with an explanation of why an alteration was made.
The document must also indicate if A&F and satellites or other type stock record account records
were affected. The host LRS Commander/AO or AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations
designated representatives will sign the statement. The original copy of the document will be
filed in Document Control, host/SD 01 site, marked as FORCED RECORD ALTERATIONS
(FIX). A copy of the document will be forwarded to A&F and satellite or other type stock record
account if the alteration affected their records. For accounts aligned under the AFGLSC, a
document reflecting both the BEFORE and AFTER image is posted to the AFMC SCM-R
Computer Operations Forced Record Alteration (FIX) database for each record altered or
deleted. The document will be annotated with an explanation of why an alteration was made and
will indicate if A&F or other type stock record account records were affected. Supported
LRS/satellite Document Control Sections and/or A&F will retrieve the FIX documentation from
the AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations FIX database.
3.30. Control Number. Each document produced by a record being changed or deleted is
assigned a serial number under program control. The serial number consists of a 4-digit Julian
date and a 4-position serial number. The serial number portion of the control number is stored in
the inventory adjustment record and is updated each time a document is produced. The latest
serial number will be printed on the monthly Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document
Register (M10/NGV836) allowing Document Control to account for record alterations. The
serial number will be reset to zero on the record at year's end when the end-of-year option of the
Prep Inventory Accuracy Records Program (A02/NGV838) is exercised. If a previous database
is recovered and a FIX has to be processed, annotate the FIX output with MEMO FOR
RECORD. Explain in the memo the reason for the FIX, indicating the FIX was processed on a
previous database. The M10 will not show these FIX numbers.
3.31. Reconstructing Destroyed Records. If a complete record is lost and must be
reconstructed on the database, use the applicable inputs to reestablish the record. For example, if
an item record is lost, use a FIL input to reload the record; use an inventory adjustment input to
establish the serviceable balance (if applicable) and execute NGV299 to enter applicable data in
other fields that cannot be entered with normal inputs.
3.32. Instructions For FIXPUTFILE and FIXRECFILE.
   3.32.1. Program NGV299 uses two files that are created from the current source schema.
   The files are 0GV00000*FIXRECFILE. and 0GV0<ALN>*FIXPUTFILE. These files
   contain tables used to describe records, data names, and sets from the schema. When a
   change is made to the schema these two files must be re-created at all bases.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   245


   3.32.2. To create the new files, the new schema must be loaded, then execute program
   NGV299 with the following command:
       3.32.2.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/FIXREC
   3.32.3. The above job will delete and recatalog the 0GV00000*FIXRECFILE. and
   0GV0<ALN>*FIXPUTFILE. for the input ALN. On stacked systems, ensure that you
   coordinate with all ALNs prior to processing CREATE/FIXREC.

Section 3H—-Automated Pointer Correction Program (NDA500)

3.33. Overview. Occasionally database set errors will occur. The main causes of database set
errors are improper recoveries, system crashes and disk problems. At no time should this
program be processed to correct set errors without thoroughly researching the possible cause of
the errors. This program should not be utilized to circumvent normal SBSS recovery techniques;
for example, audit trail recovery, supply transaction recovery (STR), or the combination of both.
Even though the program will make a database structurally correct, accountability is not
guaranteed. Records are linked within sets by pointers. There are three types of pointers
utilized: next, prior, and owner. However, not all records contain all three types of pointers.
NDA500 is a pointer correction program whose OPR is system code DA.
3.34. Frequency of Processing NDA500.
   3.34.1. This program must be processed:
       3.34.1.1. Any time database pointer errors are suspected; that is, 799 rejects with an error
       number of 92.
       3.34.1.2. After the completion of all audit trail tape and STR (Supply Transaction
       Recovery) recoveries.
       3.34.1.3. Daily on the secondary database after RPTRUN (crossover) and prior to any
       reports processing.
       3.34.1.4. After any system crash or reboot.
   3.34.2. During the processing of NDA500, other SBSS programs may continue processing
   and apply updates which can cause erroneous pointer errors to be identified. Therefore, if
   NDA500 is processed with other SBSS programs running, sets identified in error should be
   reverified.
3.35. Program Logic.
   3.35.1. Execution of NDA500. NDA500 is started by entering the following execute
   statement from any demand terminal: @XQT DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500. Screen
   NDA500 1R1 will be displayed. After the required data has been entered, the operator
   depresses transmit, and the program will build the summary file (see Para. 3.58). If an
   attempt is made to review the summary file during the build process, the program will
   produce a File FAC Status of 400010000000.
   3.35.2. NDA500 Functions. After the summary file has been built, the program will begin a
   batch run. This operation consists of two phases: database scan and verify. During the
   database scan phase, the program scans the database and selects all records that reside in the
246                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  specified type set; for example, all records that belong in the ISG-Item record set are
  selected. Set integrity is maintained for the verify phase. During the verify phase, the
  program continues through the set from the owner by the set's next pointer and performs the
  following edits:
      3.35.2.1. Does the member belong in the set?
      3.35.2.2. Do the member records have the correct owner pointer, if applicable?
      3.35.2.3. Does the member records prior pointer equal that of the previous record in the
      set, if applicable?
      3.35.2.4. Does the next pointer point to a record in use?
      3.35.2.5. Does the next pointer point into an authorized area when records are authorized
      to cross areas?
  3.35.3. NDA500 Output. After the batch run has been completed, the user should print the
  summary file. This listing will be maintained for 90 days, and it is to be used for comparison
  during any recoveries.
  3.35.4. Errors. If errors are encountered during the run, all processing on the primary
  database must be suspended and NDA500 must be processed utilizing the A option.
  Secondary processing may continue. During the period when NDA500 is processing,
  management personnel should start investigating the possible cause of the errors. Items that
  should be considered since the last error free run of NDA500 are:
      3.35.4.1. Has a recovery of the SBSS database been accomplished?
      3.35.4.2. Were there any abnormal system crashes?
      3.35.4.3. Was there a power flux or outage?
  3.35.5. Once the cause has been identified, if possible, a decision must be made to perform a
  standard SBSS recovery or patch the database. It must be noted at this time that the SBSS
  recovery may consist of an audit trail recovery, a STR recovery, or a combination of both.
  Recovery should always be the first option considered because, even though patching a
  database will make it structurally correct, accountability is not guaranteed.
  3.35.6. If the decision is made to patch the database, at the discretion of the MAJCOM,
  either MAJCOM personnel or base personnel will patch the database. Recommend
  MAJCOM personnel patch the database when possible.
  3.35.7. The first step to be accomplished when the database is to be patched is to print the
  patch file (See Para 3-58. through Para 3-60.). After researching the list to ensure that the
  program generated patches are correct, the user should remove the appropriate asterisk, and
  then the user must reverify the set. The user must ensure that the current set is error free
  prior to proceeding to the next set type. Upon completion of the reverify, and when all errors
  have been corrected, the patches must be applied to the database with NGV224. Program
  NGV224 will apply the patches to the database, assign the next FIX serial number to the
  output listing, and update the 510 record. Each set in error will be assigned a FIX serial
  number. The output from NGV224 must be signed by the LRS CC/AO or their designated
  representative and filed in Document Control as with any other FIX document.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 247


   3.35.8. After the database has been patched, NDA500 should be reprocessed with the A
   option to ensure that the database is error free. In addition, in the majority of cases, all
   patches should be accomplished against the primary database. The only exception to this is if
   RPTEON on the secondary aborts due to a 799 reject with function code 03 and error
   code/number 92.
3.36. Special Instructions.
   3.36.1. When a new schema is implemented, the summary file must be deleted. This is
   required to build a new summary file which will match the new schema. This can be
   accomplished by deleting file SYS$*SG$3142$0000.; G equates to each active SBSS gang.
   3.36.2. In the event NDA500 should error-fin and the active runs exceed one, the status file
   must be rebuilt. This may be accomplished by deleting file SYS$*NDA500STATUS. and
   reexecuting the program.
   3.36.3. If a FAC status of 440000000000 is received when attempting to print a file or patch
   a record, the previous file must be deleted and the print or patch must be reexecuted. To
   delete these files, add the SYS$ qualifier to the file name which appears on the first line of
   the appropriate screen.
   3.36.4. For SBSS, NDA500 is mandatory after an audit trail recovery, STR (Supply
   Transaction Recovery), or IRU recovery. All pointers must be corrected prior to any users
   accessing the SBSS database. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
   supervisor must ensure this is complied with.

Section 3I—-Database Key Format (Addressing)

3.37. Overview. This section describes the format used by database keys and their relationship
in the storage and access of database records.
   3.37.1. A database key is the unique identifier of a record within a database. One database
   key is assigned to each record in a database. This is a physical address of the record. The
   database key consists of two parts: Area Name and Area Key.
   3.37.2. DMS 1100 implements database keys at two levels as follows:
       3.37.2.1. A high level implementation for use by the run unit.
       3.37.2.2. A low level form for the Data Management Routine (DMR) and the run unit.
   3.37.3. The DMR converts from one level to another. A database key which is initiated by
   the DMR; for example, after storing a record whose location mode is via set, is available in
   both forms to the run unit. Conversely, the database key supplied by the run unit before
   storing a record whose location mode is direct, is passed to the DMR and converted before
   the record is stored.
3.38. Run Unit Database Keys.
   3.38.1. A database key consists of an area name and an area key. It is specified in a run unit
   in a pair of datanames defined in the data division of the user program.
   3.38.2. The user (Database Administrator or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity) may specify a database keyin the pair of reserved data names AREA-NAMES and
248                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  AREA-KEY. They are produced by the Data Manipulation Language (DML) preprocessors
  in the working or common storage section of the user program as part of the Data
  Management Communications Area (DMCA).
  3.38.3. The user has the option to specify their own data names to define a database key. In
  this case, the area name must be in a 77-level single item data name, defined with USAGE IS
  AREA-NAME clause and no PICTURE clause. The AREA-NAME usage clause will be
  replaced by the Data Definition Language/Subschema Data Definition Language
  (DDL/SDDL) with PIC IS X(12) USAGE IS DISPLAY clauses. An area key of a database
  key consists of a page number and a record number. These are always in DDL/SDDL
  processor produced subordinate items with PIC IS 9(5) USAGE IS COMP clauses for these
  two items. They have the reserved name PAGE-NUM and RECORD-NUM. The user
  specified database key will be a 01- or 77-level data-base-date-name defined with USAGE IS
  DATABASE-KEY clause and no PICTURE clause. The DATABASE-KEY clause will be
  replaced by the DDL/SDDL with a PIC IS 9(10) USAGE IS COMP-4 clause.
  3.38.4. The Data Definition Language and the Data Manipulation Language pair data-base-
  data-names to specify a database key. For example; LOCATION MODE IS DIRECT data-
  name-1, data-name-2 pairs data-name-1 and data-name-2 to specify a database key whose
  area name is in data-name-2 and whose area key is in data-name-1.
      3.38.4.1. EXAMPLE: Assume the user program contains these DDL statements in the
      data name section.
         3.38.4.1.1. 77 A-NAME USAGE IS AREA-NAME.
         3.38.4.1.2. 01 A-KEY USAGE IS AREA-KEY.
         3.38.4.1.3. 01 LINK USAGE IS AREA-KEY.
      3.38.4.2. The COBOL source language which is produced by the DDL/SDDL processors
      (assuming no subschema renaming) would look like:
         3.38.4.2.1. 77 A-NAME USAGE IS DISPLAY PIC X(12).
         3.38.4.2.2. 01 A-KEY USAGE IS COMP-4.
         3.38.4.2.3. 02 PAGE-NUM PIC 9(5).
         3.38.4.2.4. 02 RECORD-NUM PIC 9(5).
         3.38.4.2.5. 01 LINK USAGE IS COMP-4.
         3.38.4.2.6. 02 PAGE-NUM PIC 9(5).
         3.38.4.2.7. 02 RECORD-NUM PIC 9(5).
      3.38.4.3. Thus, the procedure division statements:
         3.38.4.3.1. MOVE HISTORY-FILE TO A-NAME.
         3.38.4.3.2. MOVE 1 TO PAGE-NUM OF A-KEY.
         3.38.4.3.3. MOVE 17 TO RECORD-NUM OF A-KEY.
         3.38.4.3.4. MOVE HISTORY-FILE TO AREA-NAME.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   249


      3.38.4.4. These statements define a database key to the DMR for commands such as
      FIND ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD where location mode of ADMINISTRATIVE
      record type is DIRECT USING A-KEY, A-NAME FIND A-KEY, A-NAME. The last
      two statements have the same effect. They establish the 17th record of page 1 of area
      HISTORY-FILE as the current record.
3.39. DMR Database Keys.
   3.39.1. The database key internal to the DMR consists of:
      3.39.1.1. Schema area code
      3.39.1.2. Page number
      3.39.1.3. Record number
      3.39.1.4. The above listed items are packed into three subfields of a 36-bit word. The
      format of the three subfields depends on schema and area descriptions.
          3.39.1.4.1. SUBFIELD BIT ALLOCATION
          3.39.1.4.2. AREA-CODE - 7 to 12 bits PAGE NUMBER - 9 to 18 bits RECORD
          NUMBER - 6 to 15 bits
          3.39.1.4.3. The Subfield Bit Allocation shows possible formats of DMR database
          keys in an area.
   3.39.2. The high order subfield contains the area code. The size of the area code field is
   constant throughout a schema once it is fixed between a minimum of 7 bits and a maximum
   of 12. The size of this field is determined by the number of areas specified in the AREA
   CONTROL clause of the DDL. However, if the number of areas is less than 127, 7 bits will
   be allocated. If the ALLOCATE clause is not specified, the subfield is assigned 12 bits.
   3.39.3. The middle field contains the page number. The size of this field may vary
   throughout an area. The size of the page number field is determined by the larger of two
   numbers: the number of pages specified on the DDL ALLOCATE clause, or 21 minus the
   number of bits for the area code. It has an absolute minimum in any area of 9 bits and a
   maximum of 18 bits.
   3.39.4. The low order subfield contains the record number. The field must be at least 6 bits
   and at most, 15 bits. Its size in an area is the number of bits not assigned to the area code or
   page number fields. The DML preprocessor provides the basic structure for database key
   conversion. When a record whose location is direct is stored or found, the DMR must be
   supplied with a database key. The database key (area name and area key) must be specified
   within the run unit before execution of a STORE or FIND command. Refer to Unisys UP-
   7907, Data Management System (DMS 1100), Schema Definition, Data Administrator
   Reference, for additional information on Database Keys.
3.40. Database Key Conversion Procedures.
   3.40.1. Use the following procedures for converting a database key to its area, page, and
   record number:
      3.40.1.1. Convert the database key to its 36-bit binary representation.
250                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      3.40.1.2. Do an @PRT,F on the area name to get its cataloged page size. If the
      minimum and maximum track size differ on the @PRT,F always use the minimum size.
      3.40.1.3. Go to table 3.1. and locate number bits used for page/record number based on
      the size of the area. (Area number is always 12 most significant bits of the database key.)
      3.40.1.4. Convert binary representation of page/record number to its octal equivalent
      (each done individually).
      3.40.1.5. Convert octal representation of area/page/record number of its decimal
      equivalent (each done individually).
      3.40.1.6. You now have the area/page/record number where the record actually resides
      on the database.
  3.40.2. Example of converting a database key located in ITMDTL-GV area.
      3.40.2.1. Given a database key of 000211270005, its binary representation would be:
         3.40.2.1.1. Bit position:    35-33 32-30 29-27 26-24 23-21 20-18
         3.40.2.1.2. 000     000     000     010     001       001
         3.40.2.1.3. 17-15 14-12 11-9        8-6     5-3       2-0
         3.40.2.1.4. 010     111     000    000     000     101
      3.40.2.2. Since it has been determined that the ITMDTL-GV-1 area is cataloged at 6770
      pages (this from an @PRT,F DMS*ITMDTL-GV-1.), go to the conversion table to find
      how many bits are used for the page and record. The table will show that 13 bits are used
      for the page and 11 bits are used for the record number. (The 12 most significant bits are
      always used for area number.)
      3.40.2.3. Bit settings for the area number looks like:
         3.40.2.3.1. Binary: 000000000010 (bits 35-24)
         3.40.2.3.2. Convert binary to octal: 0002
         3.40.2.3.3. Convert octal to decimal: 2
      3.40.2.4. Bit settings for the page number looks like:
         3.40.2.4.1. Binary: 0010010101110 (bits 23-11)
         3.40.2.4.2. Convert binary to octal: 02256
         3.40.2.4.3. Convert octal to decimal: 1198
      3.40.2.5. Bit settings for the record number looks like:
         3.40.2.5.1. Binary: 00000000101 (bits 10-0)
         3.40.2.5.2. Convert binary to octal: 0005
         3.40.2.5.3. Convert octal to decimal: 5
      3.40.2.6. The area/page/record number = Area 2
         3.40.2.6.1. Page 1198, record 5

   3.40.4. An ECL runstream released in your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file can also eliminate the
   awkward use of manually converting these keys. To use this database key converter, do the
   following:
        3.40.4.1. @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/NDA340                               Note
        3.40.4.2. When the above run finishes, go into CTS and CALL
        0GV0*DBRUN$.CONVERT/DBK.               Enter the 12-position database key for
        Area/Page/Record conversion. Note:         This only has to be processed once for each
        ALN’s 0GV0*DBRUN$. file. The only time it is required to run this job is after a
        resizing or if the element SBSS/NDA340 is missing.

Section 3K—-Examples Of Database Recoveries

3.42. Overview. The following section explains some of the most common errors and
procedures for database recoveries. Almost all recoveries can be prevented with little or no
intervention. By utilizing the database utilities, knowledge of the database and training,
recoveries and database maintenance can be simplified. Although some references to the
procedures and utilities may be repeated throughout this part, remember, repetitions can be habit
forming.
3.43. Database Integrity. Database integrity is the number one concern for the SBSS database.
If the LRS CC/AO cannot trust the balances on records then the automation of the supply
account serves no purpose. Some simple tools and techniques will be discussed that aid in
checking the integrity of the SBSS database.
3.44. Database Utilities.
   3.44.1. NGV027. Recommend processing weekly. Correct any errors as soon as possible
   and IRUDUMP the database for recovery purposes after the corrections. It is recommended
   all corrections are made during normal offline processing. That is twilight, reports, etc.
   3.44.2. 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x. Recommend processing weekly. If errors are
   found, cease processing on the primary and secondary gangs and dump both gangs. If the
   primary is clean, process NDA500 on all sets except CTH, (sets 1-65/80-102). If there are no
   errors, take an IRUDUMP and resume normal primary processing. If errors are found,
   correct, IRUDUMP, and continue normal processing. If errors are found on the secondary,
   but not on the primary, a recovery may not have to be processed depending on the set or area
   that the error is in. If you have finished all reports and none of them erred, and the error is in
   an area that NGV032 and NGV033 (RPTEON) does not pass back to the primary, then
   process RPTEON on the secondary, when applicable. Your next end of day crossover will
   rebuild the secondary database.
 256                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   3.44.3. 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALC-GVx. Process up to 7 calendar days prior to
   EOM/EOQ. If errors are found, they may either be patched by NDA500 or a recovery may
   be required. Due to the complexity of DMS-CALC, these chains may be too serious to
   patch.
   3.44.4. DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500. Process daily on the secondary (sets 1-65/80-102),
   or you may process on the primary immediately after crossover and prior to any reports. If
   errors are found, YOU MUST, REPEAT MUST, suspend all processing and correct these
   errors as soon as possible. Your MAJCOM will assist in any NDA500 database patching
   required. If no errors, continue processing on the primary. If there are errors, IRUDUMP the
   database. This will be a restart point in the event the patches from NDA500 were applied
   wrong. Next, try to determine how the errors were created. Find the most current dump.
   This may have to be used as a restart point. Patching the database is a last resort. It may
   make the database structurally correct, but you may lose accountability. That's why a
   recovery will have to be done in most instances. The same holds true for the secondary.
   Most often you reload the crossover dump, process NDA500 (sets 1-65/80-102); if no errors,
   continue. If you have errors, DO NOT USE AUDIT TRAIL RECOVERY because
   database after looks are written to the audit trail by pages, and, you would reload the same
   errors back to the database.
   3.44.5. In the case where your daily reports reflect transaction histories from two different
   dates, this usually means that you did an audit trail recovery wrong on your primary
   database. VERIFY and VERIFY/CALC on the transaction history area will show that the
   total records in this area do not match. VERIFY will show more records than
   VERIFY/CALC.
   3.44.6. Prior to any recovery due to errors from NDA500, determine which sets are
   involved. If it is a set that can be recovered by other means, then an audit trail recovery may
   not be required. This is especially true of the secondary. Daily reports scan the transaction
   history area and fetch corresponding records; that is Project Funds Management Record
   (PFMR), ORG. If the error is in the pseudo area it will not affect processing since the pseudo
   area is not used on the secondary. Other sets will not affect reports; i.e. DOCNBR-GV area
   can sometimes have errors on the secondary and not effect processing.
   3.44.7. NGV061. Process at least weekly or when the area shows on the VERIFY as 80
   percent full. This program will delete any 103 records without members.
3.45. Recovering The Supply Database Except CTH. The following scenarios are just a few
examples of recoveries. Although there are too many to document, hopefully these will be
helpful if needed. Remember, watch the system and use the necessary utilities to check for
errors. Don't take chances with valuable online processing. If in doubt, dump the database and
take time to research. For reference only; we will use gang number 1 and 5 in these examples:
EXAMPLE 1: Started RELOAD/GV-1 in lieu of IRUDUMP/GV-1.
   3.45.1. Reload the most recent dump. Either a safety or crossover dump.
   3.45.2. Audit trail up to the point when the RELOAD/GV-1 was started. The time is on the
   RELOAD/GV-1 PR list. For example, if it shows 18:14:24, you recover up to 18:14:00.
   3.45.3. Process the END input (if you were inline).
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 257


  3.45.4. Process NDA500 on all sets except CTH. Ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.5. Process IRUDUMP/GV-x
  3.45.6. RBOD
  3.45.7. Resume normal processing.
     3.45.7.1. EXAMPLE 2: Started RELOAD/GV-5 in lieu of IRUDUMP/GV-5.
  3.45.8. Reload the most recent dump (crossover or more current) before the secondary was
  erased. If the crossover dump is used, you must change the 002-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-
  FLG to equal a S.
  3.45.9. Audit trail up to the point when the RELOAD/GV-5 was started. The time is on the
  RELOAD/GV-5 PR list. For example, if it shows 18:14:24 you recover up to 18:14:00. It
  may be easier to rerun the reports between the dump and the point the RELOAD was started
  than to do an audit trail recovery. It is your choice.
  3.45.10. Process NDA500 on all sets except CTH. Ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.11. Process IRUDUMP/GV-5
  3.45.12. Resume normal processing.
     3.45.12.1. EXAMPLE 3: Falling back to a previous dump to reprocess a report on the
     secondary database.
  3.45.13. Process 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-5 to dump gang 5 for safety purposes.
  3.45.14. Process RPTEON on the secondary database. This will preclude you having to
  reload a dump after your recovery.
  3.45.15. Reload the desired dump with 0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-5 inserting the
  applicable tape number in the runstream.
  3.45.16. Process the desired reports.
  3.45.17. Process 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-5 and 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-5 to
  delete the secondary database. This way, your good secondary was crossed over by
  RPTEON and the secondary will be rebuilt during the next crossover.
     3.45.17.1. EXAMPLE 4: Perform an audit trail recovery on the primary database that
     includes RPTEON.
  3.45.18. Reload the most current dump to the primary.
  3.45.19. Audit trail up to and just before primary RPTEON was processed.
  3.45.20. Manually reprocess primary RPTEON.
  3.45.21. Restart the audit trail after primary RPTEON has finished the first time up to the
  desired point. If you need to recover through more than 1 day's primary RPTEON, you will
  need to repeat steps 2 through until all days are recovered. Do not audit trail through primary
  RPTEON. This will cause CALC STR recovery. The errors will not appear until the next
  EOD reports are processed. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity has released
  SANs with information on this problem. It is a system flaw within COBOL 74 which is
  being worked for COBOL 85.

      3.45.21.1. EXAMPLE 5: Helpful hints for audit trail recoveries.
  3.45.22. For recovery of the primary:
  3.45.23. Dump the applicable gang using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x.
  3.45.24. While the dump is processing, determine the dump and audit trail tapes and prepare
  and update the applicable runstreams.
  3.45.25. Down your ADS.
  3.45.26. Reload the desired dump using 0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-x.
  3.45.27. Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.28. Start/continue the audit trail recovery. As a rule, recover three tapes at a time.
  Remember DO NOT audit through primary RPTEON.
  3.45.29. Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.30. Dump the database using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x.
  3.45.31. Repeat paragraphs above until completed.
  3.45.32. Dump the database.
  3.45.33. Resume normal processing.        Note: Once you encounter a bad tape, you must
  STR from that point on. Do not recover successive tapes by using audit trail or you will have
  pointer errors. STR procedures are described in this chapter.
  3.45.34. For Recovery of Secondary.
  3.45.35. Dump the applicable gang using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x.
  3.45.36. While the dump is processing, determine the dump and audit trail tapes and prepare
  and update the applicable runstreams.
  3.45.37. Reload the desired dump using 0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-x.
  3.45.38. Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.39. Start/continue the audit trail recovery. As a rule, recover three tapes at a time.
  Remember, it may be easier to just reprocess all reports that do an audit trail recovery.
  3.45.40. Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors.
  3.45.41. Dump the database.
  3.45.42. Repeat paragraphs above until completed.
  3.45.43. Resume normal processing.    Note: Once you encounter a bad tape, you must
  recover by reprocessing any reports that must be reprocessed. You cannot STR the
  secondary. STR is for recovering transaction histories. An audit trail recovery on the
  secondary WILL NOT recover any secondary reports that update the primary.
      3.45.43.1. EXAMPLE 6: Beginning totals on RPTD07 do not match the ending totals
      from the last EOD. This is caused when you process RPTEON on the wrong secondary
      database. You fell back on the secondary to rerun a report, but, you failed to load back
      the most current secondary IRU dump.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              259


   3.45.44. Dump the secondary database.
   3.45.45. While the secondary dump is processing, determine the last good date RPTD07
   processed and each subsequent day you need to recover.
   3.45.46. Reload a secondary dump taken on the last good day PRIOR to RPTEON. If that
   dump cannot be reloaded, or one was not taken, then you must reload the crossover dump
   and reprocess all reports. DO NOT RERUN RPTD13. THIS IS BECAUSE THE D13
   UPDATES THE PRIMARY SRD-GV AREA. ALSO, DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT
   RERUN THE D37. THE CTH DATABASE HAS ALREADY BEEN UPDATED.
   3.45.47. Reload the TXHIST-GV area from the next crossover dump.
   3.45.48. Change 002-JULIAN-DATE, 002-ORDINAL-DATE, 002-REQUISITION-DATE,
   and 002-CALENDAR-DATE to reflect that day's transaction date.
   3.45.49. Process RPTRUN against the secondary database.
   3.45.50. Process all reports including the RPTM36 if it was processed on the original EOD
   from that day. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT PROCESS RPTEON on the secondary. Print
   only the D07 and D32. Have funds or accounting and finance validate the reports.
   3.45.51. Repeat paragraphs above until all dates have been completed.
   3.45.52. Dump the secondary database.
   3.45.53. Process RPTEON on the secondary. This will carry all totals to the primary.
   3.45.54. Resume normal processing.
3.46. Selective ACOPY Areas.
   3.46.1. The following areas can be selectively copied by ACOPY if required for special
   recoveries. In any event, ensure DMU verifies and the NDA500 is processed on gaining
   database. The first record of each set indicates the OWNER record for the set.

Section 3L—-Query Language Processor With Update

3.47. Overview. Occasionally, there will be conditions created on a database that cannot be
corrected by processing normal transactions. When these conditions exist, the records must be
altered or deleted. However, there are conditions where record alterations should never be used.
This includes NGV299, QLP WITH UPDATE, and DBE (database editor). Use of QLP WITH
UPDATE and DBE is authorized by the MAJCOM or AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity ONLY. It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by
processing a normal input or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance, reverse-post, or
inventory adjustments, in lieu of QLP WITH UPDATE.
3.48. Instructions For Use of QLP With Update.
   3.48.1. Provide the DMC with a request letter of individuals authorized to process QLP
   WITH UPDATE on your databases. This letter will be prepared and signed by the Supply
   functional AIS manager (LRS CC/AO) and then coordinated with any other appropriate
   levels as specified in the DISA Unisys Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)
   currently dated 1 October 1998.
   3.48.2. For accounts not aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity constructs, obtain the
   authorization from the LRS Commander or designated representative prior to using QLP
   WITH UPDATE. Note the name and rank of the individual giving authorization, along with
   a MAJCOM control number—if owning MAJCOM requires it. For accounts aligned under
   the AFMC SCM-R Activity, QLP WITH UPDATE will be requested through their
   supporting AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Procedures section with
   concurrence from the owning LRS Commander or designated representative via the AFMC
   SCM-R Information Technology Activity FORCED RECORD ALTERATION (FIX)
   database which will assign a unique control number and allows tracking throughout the entire
   process. For ANG accounts aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity, QLP WITH
   UPDATE will be provided to NGB/A4R.
   3.48.3. Stop all processing on both primary and secondary databases. The primary database
   must not be inline when processing QLP WITH UPDATE. Dump both primary and
   secondary databases.
   3.48.4. Process an @@PRNT command in Demand to print all input and output on a side-by
   printer, or send them to a PC file for printing and/or downloading to disk later.
   3.48.5. Process the appropriate INVOKE command. Before a command that updates the
   database (i.e., CHANGE, DELETE, etc.) is processed, accomplish the following steps:
       3.48.5.1. Step 1. List the records that will be changed, verify the data selected, and
       ensure the correct records have been selected.
       3.48.5.2. Step 2. Process the HOLD command to establish a recovery point.
       3.48.5.3. Step 3. Process the command to modify the database.
       3.48.5.4. Step 4. List the records again to verify the changed data and ensure only the
       desired records are modified.    Note:     If the changed data are not correct, process the
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               267


     ROLLBACK command to discard the changes. Go back to step 1 and try again. If the
     changed data are correct, go to the next step.
     3.48.5.5. Step 5. Process the RELEASE command to accept the changes and make them
     permanent.
     3.48.5.6. Step 6. Process the EXIT command to exit QLP WITH UPDATE.
  3.48.6. Dump the database that was updated, after ALL the correct updates have been made.
  Process @@NOPR to stop printed output on side-by printer, or spooling output to a PC file.
  Coordinate with the DMC to have the expiration date of the database “DUMPS” that are
  taken changed to 2 years from this processing date.
  3.48.7. Resume normal processing only after the database dump printout is verified that it
  contains no errors.
  3.48.8. For accounts not aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity constructs, take all
  printed output from this process, to include dump tape printout for the updated database, and
  follow the rules for documenting and filing output required for program NGV299, FIX. A
  write once/read only electronic media may be used in lieu of printed output. The
  documentation must state why NGV299 or other inputs could not be used to modify the
  records, along with the MAJCOM control number if required, and approval official’s name
  and rank. Document Control will file the output with the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment
  Document Register, M10/NGV836. For accounts aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity,
  the supporting AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will take all output from this
  process and follow the rules of documenting and filing output required for program NGV299,
  FIX. The documentation must state why NGV299 or other inputs could not be used to
  modify the records, must include the database tape dump number taken prior to the update
  and must include the approval official’s name and rank. AFMC SCM-R Information
  Technology Activity will post all output documentation to the AFMC SCM-R Information
  Technology Activity FORCED RECORD ALTERATION (FIX) database and file with the
  Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register, M10/NGV836.
  3.48.9. While this process does not consist of a closed-end audit trail (i.e., there is no
  automated control mechanism to ensure that these processes are followed), it is the AFMC
  SCM-R Information Technology Activity Chief’s responsibility to make sure that these
  instructions are followed. Wing and MAJCOM inspectors, along with Air Force Audit
  personnel, can request from DMC personnel a list of user-IDs, dates, and times that QLP
  WITH UPDATE was invoked (by researching audit trail tapes and spooled master console
  data), to provide a check of compliance with this instruction.
3.49. CHECKLIST FOR DOWNLOAD/UPLOAD WITHOUT RESIZING.
  3.49.1. Purpose. To provide a checklist to utilize for the download and upload of the GV
  database without resizing. Ensure this section is understood prior to executing these
  procedures.

            3.50.3.5.2. AND A RECOVERY WILL BE REQUIRED.
3.51. CTH Resizing Checklist.
   3.51.1. Purpose. To provide a quick review checklist for resizing an existing CTH database.
   Since most CTH databases require mass disk storage, it is recommended that resizing for
   CTH be carefully planned due to the use of system resources and time. All users must be
   notified not to use the CTH database until these procedures are completed.
   3.51.2. CTH Resizing Checklist.
         3.51.2.1. ITEM #           TASK
            3.51.2.1.1. 1                  Process the following jobs to ensure your CTH database
            is intact. Since the
            3.51.2.1.2. CTH is on the primary database only, the x will represent primary gang
            number
            3.51.2.1.3. unless otherwise stated.

Notes:
1. Breakpoint file is xGV0*VERxCTH.
2. Breakpoint file is xGV0*CTHCAL.
3. Sets 70-73 for CTH only.
4. Ensure no READ errors are on these tapes.
         3.51.2.2. 2                     Process UTL041 to download the CTH to tape. Ensure
         position 54 will equal a
            3.51.2.2.1. B. This bypasses the deletion of records as they are downloaded. Later,
            the
            3.51.2.2.2. CTH areas will be initialized. (See Ch 2) for UTL041 run
            3.51.2.2.3. instructions.)
         3.51.2.3. 3                 Process NGV330 to download the 706,707 records. See Ch 6
         for
            3.51.2.3.1. NGV330 run instructions.
         3.51.2.4. 4                Once the download is complete, resize the database.

            Note: Take option 2 for CTH. Enter the number of records (704) required.
            NGVU31 will display the number of tracks required. The following will illustrate the
            basic formula for CTH:
 272                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


          3.51.2.4.2. 75000 = number of tracks
          3.51.2.4.3. 20 = number of records per page
          3.51.2.4.4. 20 = subtract 20 records. Page 1 contains the 711 record only.
          3.51.2.4.5. 1,499,980 = number of 704-CT-HISTORY records that can be stored in
          75000 tracks.
       3.51.2.5. 5              Build the TEMPSCHEMA file.
          3.51.2.5.1. @FREEALL
          3.51.2.5.2. @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE.
       3.51.2.6. 6              Install the schema.
          3.51.2.6.1. @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA
          3.51.2.6.2. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR                         Note: The only
          time that both GV and CTH needs to be down is during the processing of the two
          instructions in item 6 which installs the schema. These jobs will abort the schema
          and install the new UDS sizes for CTH.                       Once the @ADD
          0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR statement has completed and the install is valid,
          GV can continue normal processing.
       3.51.2.7. 7              Rebuild the new CTH areas.
          3.51.2.7.1. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTH1
          3.51.2.7.2. @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R                   Note: The response
          will be for gang number and number of tracks for the CT-HISTORY-GV-x area. The
          number of tracks must be filled with leading zeros 0. For instance, if the new size is
          50000 tracks, enter 050000.
       3.51.2.8. 8              Start the upload program (UTL043). See Ch 2, for
          3.51.2.8.1. run instructions. Recommend a CTH dump be taken after each UTL043.
          This
          3.51.2.8.2. program may take anywhere from 2 to 16 hours for each tape based upon
          the
          3.51.2.8.3. number of transactions for the particular month.
       3.51.2.9. 9              Process NGV330 to download the 706,707 records. See
          3.51.2.9.1. Ch 6 for NGV330 run instructions.
       3.51.2.10. 10             Dump the CTH database.
       3.51.2.11. 11                   Process UTL042 for total days and the total transaction
       counts.
       3.51.2.12. 12             Continue local processing procedures for CTH.
3.52. NGV330 and R60 Overview.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  273


   3.52.1. Purpose. To provide an illustration of programs NGV330 and RPTR60 (NGV288).
   See Ch 6, for the program instructions.
   3.52.2. NGV330. This program reads the 706 and 707 records from the CT-CTRL-GV-x
   area and downloads them into a SSDF file xGV0<ALN>*GV330UD700. This file can be
   edited with any ASCII processor. NGV330 is used during the resize process if these records
   need downloaded or uploaded.
   3.52.3. RPTR60. The R60 reads file xGV0<ALN>*GV783DCC., which contains the DCR
   images that Document Control has already cleared, and deletes/updates the CTH database.
   The only time it is necessary to process the R60 is whenever a recovery of the CTH database
   is accomplished.
3.53. Selective Reload Of The CTRL Area.
   3.53.1. Purpose. To explain the procedures for the selective reload of your CTRL area. The
   following records reside within the CT-CTRL-GV-x area:
       3.53.1.1. 706 CT-DELINQUENT-SOURCE
       3.53.1.2. 707 CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL
       3.53.1.3. 708 CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC
       3.53.1.4. 709 CT-DELINQUENT-OPR
       3.53.1.5. 710 CT-SUPPORT
   3.53.2. Recovery Procedures. Use the following procedures in the event that this area
   becomes corrupt or a selective reload is required. The CTRL area has no records with
   database pointers that point outside itself; therefore, a selective recovery will work, only if
   the CTRL area was valid prior to the recovery.
   3.53.3. Prerecovery Actions. Ensure no users access the CTH database until these recovery
   procedures have been completed. First, modify an existing RELOAD runstream with the
   following entries. The x represents your primary gang.
       3.53.3.1. @RUN CTLOAD,,xGV0
       3.53.3.2. @SYM PRINT$.,,NTR??P
       3.53.3.3. @ASG,T APPL01*IRU$HF.
       3.53.3.4. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/CTHx
@IRU
       3.53.3.5. RELOAD FILE DMS$<ALN>*CT-CTRL-GV-x. FROM REEL ??????;
       3.53.3.6. ACT; END;
       3.53.3.7. @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.UP/CTHx
       3.53.3.8. @FIN      Note: Change the?????? to equal the reel number of the dump being
       reloaded.
   3.53.4. Post-Recovery Actions. After the reload runstream from above has processed
   successfully, process the following jobs to ensure the reload was successful.

      give record totals of all CTH areas. 2. Sets 70-73 for CTH.
3.54. NGV299 Commands.
  3.54.1. Purpose. To delete, store, alter individual records for automatic sets and to remove,
  insert or modify individual records in manual sets.
  3.54.2. Processing NGV299. To execute NGV299, keyin the following.
      3.54.2.1. @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV299R
      3.54.2.2. When the message PLEASE ENTER GV # appears, the operator must type in
      GV and the applicable gang number (space between GV and the gang number).
  3.54.3. NGV299 Commands.
      3.54.3.1. The operator may enter any of the following commands. Several of the
      commands have options. The options are enclosed in brackets. All commands are
      spelled out for identification purposes but only the first three positions of the command
      are required for execution.

Table 3.4. NGV299 Commands.

COMMAND                           FUNCTION
AFTER                             Used to compare and display a record from the execution of
                                  a BEFORE command. This command should only be
                                  executed after the BEFORE command, data was altered, and
                                  the database is to be updated. A FIX document will be
                                  produced. When the AFTER command is executed, data
                                  elements are displayed. The operator should verify data
                                  elements that are to be updated. If the elements are not
                                  correct, the operator should reexecute the BEFORE and
                                  LIST commands, retransmit, and reexecute the AFTER
                                  command. When changes are correct, a document will be
                                  generated, and a FIX serial number assigned.
AREA [Area Name]                  Used to display the current AREA of currency if optional
                                  parameter is blank. If parameter is entered, currency will be
                                  established for AREA NAME entered. EXAMPLE: AREA
                                  ITMDTL-GV-1
BEFORE                            Used to save the current record when an alteration is to be
                                  made. Prior to executing this command, currency must be
                                  established. After this command is executed, the operator
                                  should execute a DISPLAY or LIST command to ensure the
                                  desired record was saved. This command must be executed
                                  prior to the AFTER command when a record is to be altered.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              275


DELETE (RECORD NUMBER)         Used to delete the current record. Currency must be
                               established prior to execution of this command. When this
                               command is executed, a document is produced that displays
                               the BEFORE images of the record and a FIX serial number is
                               assigned.
DIRECT                         Used after the AREA, PAGE, and RECORD commands to
                               directly access records by area, page and record number.
                               Prior to execution of this command, you must establish
                               database currency. EXAMPLE:
                               FIR 002
                               AREA ITMDTL-GV-1
                               PAGE 5
                               REC 1
                               DIR
DISPLAY
[Element Name] [Subscript]     Used to display the current record if optional parameters are
                               blank. If the input parameters are entered, the ELEMENT
                               NAME/SUBSCRIPT entered will be displayed. The
                               DISPLAY command lists only those data elements on a
                               record that contains data if the optional parameters are blank.
FETCH                          Used to FETCH a record using a CALC KEY. The value of
                               the CALC key must be entered prior to execution of this
                               command. EXAMPLE:
                               101-CALC-KEY = 010**12345670
                               FETCH or FET
FIRST [Owner Record Type]      Used to FETCH the first record in the current area, if the
[Set Type] [Requested Record   optional parameters are blank. If the OWNER RECORD
Type]                          TYPE is entered, the first OWNER RECORD is FETCHED.
                               If the SET TYPE is entered, the first record for the OWNER
                               and SET TYPE are entered; the first record for the OWNER,
                               SET and RECORD TYPE entered is FETCHED.
                               EXAMPLES:

3.55. Sample NGV299 Session To Update 002 Record.
   3.55.1. Purpose. To provide the user with a sample interactive session to update the 002-
   Special-Control record.
   3.55.2. Input Processing. The 002 Record may be updated from a demand terminal. If users
   plan to update the 002 record, they MUST run an END image to place the SBSS database in
   twilight mode (if database is not already in twilight mode). Also, make sure that NO batch
   runs are currently accessing the database to be fixed. It is also recommended that a database
   dump be taken prior to performing the FIX.
   3.55.3. Input Restrictions. The demand page used must be specified in the Base Constants
   Record as page 2 of the 057 terminal (that is, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
   Activity Main Console).
   3.55.4. Output. This will vary based upon user inputs.

2. Error Conditions:
       a. Loops--the set ends by looping back to itself.
       b. Points to unassigned record--last record in the sets points to a record not in use.
       c. Converges--the records next pointer points into another set.
       d. Bad Prior--the set has at least one record with a bad prior pointer.
       e. Bad Owner--the set has at least one record with a bad owner pointer.
       f. No Owner--the set has no owner record.
       g. More than one owner--the set contains more than one owner record.
3. If an asterisk appears before the SOE, this indicates that the patch was generated by NDA500.
After verifying that the patch is correct, remove the asterisk after recommended patch, and
transmit. The program will be a patch file for NGV224. If NDA500 does not provide a patch,
the user must structure a patch in the same manner as the program generated patches; for
example, PATCH 2. The numeric portion of the patch represents the record number this record
should be pointed to.
4. NDA500 will display the first set which has errors. The user must display all subsequent sets
which have errors. The user may do this by entering the next set number in the chain field.
5. Enter applicable record number to be reviewed, transmit, and NDA500 will display the next
three records on the screen starting at the record the user specified.
6. Enter the record number to be held. The program will hold this record and display the next
two records in the set.
7. Position the cursor after the SOE, depress transmit. The patch request screen will appear.
See Para 3.61.
8. Position the cursor after the SOE, depress transmit. The program will reverify the set which
was identified as being in error. It is recommended that all sets which had errors are patched
prior to this verify. The program will return the user to the Summary Screen.
9. Position the cursor after the SOE, depress transmit. The program will display the print
screen.
10. Position the cursor after the SOE, depress transmit. The program will return the user to the
Summary Screen.
11. Position the cursor after the SOE, depress transmit. The program will display the next three
records in the set if applicable.

                          SUPPLY INTERFACE SYSTEM (SIFS)

Section 4A—-Supply Interface System (SIFS)

4.1. Chapter Summary. This chapter provides a complete description and explanation of the
SIFS system. SIFS is the vehicle used in the manipulation of all SBSS data images.
   4.1.1. Purpose. This chapter provides users with information to successfully operate and
   manage SIFS processing functions.
   4.1.2. Scope. This chapter provides detailed information on all aspects of the SIFS
   processing functions and its interaction with other Automated Data Systems.
   4.1.3. Audience. The primary audience for this chapter is the SIFS Gang Monitor; however,
   all AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operators and LRS/Materiel
   Management Activity users with an interest in transmission/receipt of supply data through
   SIFS should be aware of information available in this chapter.
   4.1.4. Prerequisites. SIFS covers many diverse areas in materiel management operations
   involving most of the LRS/Materiel Management Activity functional areas. General users
   should have at least a basic understanding of the relationship between SIFS and their own
   functional area. This will permit users to know what SIFS will do for them. It is
   recommended that, at a minimum, the SIFS Gang Monitor be familiar with the following:
       4.1.4.1. The Executive.
       4.1.4.2. TIP processing and database management.
       4.1.4.3. Mass storage file manipulation.
   4.1.5. How to use this chapter. This chapter layout follows the same basic format
   throughout. Each area is introduced to the user. General information and a system overview
   is provided. Input/output data formats and detailed program logic flow is provided in each
   section.
4.2. Section 4A Overview. This section describes Supply Interface Systems (SIFS) operations
and provides a generalized overview of how SIFS interacts with the BLAMES, Automated Data
Reports Submission System (ADRSS) and SBSS applications programs.
4.3. SIFS Operations.
   4.3.1. Purpose of SIFS. The primary goal of SIFS is to dispatch data images generated by
   SBSS application programs. SIFS will dispatch data images generated by batch and TIP
   processing. SIFS also serves as an SBSS interface between other automated systems. This is
   normally accomplished by using the ADRSS system to send and receive data via DDN. SIFS
   will also transfer SBSS data images to and from Standard Procurement System (SPS) and the
   AFEMS.
   4.3.2. Security. There are no classified components in the SIFS system. All inputs and
   outputs to the SIFS system are unclassified. SIFS does not handle or contain any Privacy Act
   data.
 296                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   4.3.3. SIFS Operations. User intervention in SIFS operations is minimal. SIFS is geared to,
   and driven by, the SBSS applications programs that generate output images. SIFS is also
   driven by incoming data processed by ADRSS (system code AA). Normally, the user does
   not have to manually initiate an outbound SIFS processing run. Rather, each time an
   application program generates output images, that application program automatically calls
   the main SIFS dispatcher. SIFS will register outbound files in the ADRSS trigger file
   VAADTEU. When ADRSS is started at the DMC, it will copy the files and verify the data
   for FTP transfer. This concept leaves the user free to concentrate on the management of
   SIFS rather than the mechanics of the process. Users can manually suppress and initiate
   various SIFS processes as required.
   4.3.4. SIFS Control Records. The single most important aspect of the SIFS process is the
   SIFS Control Records. The Control Records control the disposition of each inbound or
   outbound data image by the specific TRIC. SIFS will only dispatch images based on the
   contents of the SIFS Control Records. If data images are not being collected and dispatched
   properly, the probable cause is a Control Record not correctly set up. See Sec. 4B for more
   information on SIFS Control Records.
   4.3.5. SIFS Header Record (722). The SIFS Header Record is primarily used as a decision-
   making tool for SIFS programs. Different options can be turned ON or OFF based on
   different flag settings on the SIFS Header Record. See Sec. 4C for more information on the
   SIFS Header Record.
4.4. Ownership of SIFS Records.
   4.4.1. Gangs. Under the U2200 operating environment, there can be more than one separate
   and distinct supply account supported by the servicing DMC. SIFS will process all
   inbound/output data images for each supply account. Each gang is responsible for its own
   SIFS records and all the associated actions necessary to maintain these records. Within each
   gang, each system designator is responsible for their own records and all the associated
   actions necessary to maintain these records. The disposition of one gang (that is, up, down,
   corrupted, unavailable, etc.) will not affect the SIFS processing capabilities of another gang.
4.5. Responsibilities.
   4.5.1. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will appoint a primary and an
   alternate SIFS Gang Monitor.
   4.5.2. Responsibilities of the SIFS Gang Monitor.            The SIFS Gang Monitor will be
   responsible for the following:
       4.5.2.1. Overall SIFS operations.
       4.5.2.2. Overall administration of the SIFS database records to include:
           4.5.2.2.1. Integrity of the SIFS database records.
           4.5.2.2.2. Database save (IRU).
           4.5.2.2.3. Recovery actions.
           4.5.2.2.4. SIFS release load processing.
       4.5.2.3. Successful execution of the SIFS end-of-day utilities.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               297


      4.5.2.4. Advise the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity on all matters
      affecting the SIFS operation.
      4.5.2.5. Provide technical support to SBSS/SIFS users.
      4.5.2.6. Function as a focal point for all questions and/or actions relating to SIFS and
      other interfacing ADS interfaces.
      4.5.2.7. The SIFS Gang Monitor will provide training on the SIFS system to section
      supervisors and designated individuals. Section supervisors and designated individuals
      will be responsible for providing training to individuals within their own section.
   4.5.3. LGLOS.
      4.5.3.1. Ensure SIFS USERS file is being worked and cleared in a timely manner by
      appropriate section(s).
      4.5.3.2. Resolve conflicts on TRIC routing and to MAJCOM as needed .
      4.5.3.3. Ensure SIFS residue is reviewed and cleared daily. (Sec. 4D contains detailed
      information on residue.)
      4.5.3.4. Review the SIFS Status Report daily to ensure any potential problems are
      identified and corrected in a timely manner.
      4.5.3.5. Ensure the DLA Transaction Services (DLATS) rejects in the Narrative file are
      worked daily. Sec. 4D contains detailed information on the Narrative file. SBSS no
      longer has the capability to monitor DLATS rejects via a demand session and the task
      must now be performed in Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S).
4.6. SBSS Processing Modes.
   4.6.1. Beginning-of-Day (BOD). When the SBSS starts BOD (program NGV210), SIFS
   program NGV243 (Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) Handler) is automatically
   executed. Program NGV243 will load to pseudo any SNUD images with an effective date
   equal to or less than the current SBSS Julian date on the primary gang 002-SPECIAL-
   CONTROL-RECORD. Users can suppress this option, if desired. See Sec. 4E for more
   information on SNUD processing.
   4.6.2. End-of-Day (EOD). Whenever the END image is processed, SIFS will be
   automatically called. SIFS will scan all database records to check for data images which
   require dispatch processing. See Ch 2 for more information on END image processing.
4.7. Error Reporting.
   4.7.1. DIREP Submission. If users determine they have a legitimate error condition, the user
   must submit a DIREP.      Users must read the procedures for DIREP reporting before
   submitting a DIREP.
      4.7.1.1. Difficulty Report (DIREP).
          4.7.1.1.1. AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity is responsible for monitoring,
          controlling, and submitting DIREPs. .
298                                                 AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      4.7.1.1.2. Purpose of a DIREP. A DIREP, is an accountable, documented report of a
      system difficulty submitted by user activities through the AFMC SCM-R Information
      Technology Activity DIREP Monitor.
         4.7.1.1.2.1. A DIREP provides information needed to research and analyze the
         difficulty the user is having with the system. DIREP analysis should isolate the
         source of the difficulty and provide a permanent solution. Errors which require an
         immediate resolution should be called in to the AFMC SCM-R Information
         Technology Activity.
         4.7.1.1.2.2. A DIREP is NOT a way of submitting suggestions. This reporting
         system should not be used instead of the Air Force Suggestion Program.
         Likewise, the Air Force Suggestion Program will not be used as a means of
         reporting program problems.
         4.7.1.1.2.3. A DIREP will not be used to report documentation errors to this
         manual. Editorial errors, procedural or technical inconsistencies, or requests will
         be submitted to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity in writing.
      4.7.1.1.3. Problem Research and Documentation. Before a user submits a DIREP,
      the user and the personnel in AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance s will review the
      suspected problem to make sure it is a valid problem. To submit a thoroughly
      researched and documented DIREP, the following personnel are recommended.
         4.7.1.1.3.1. User. The user is the individual experiencing the problem. The user
         is usually a Stock Control clerk, A&F technician, etc.
         4.7.1.1.3.2. ADPE Supply Systems Monitor. The monitor obtains applicable
         data, such as TRACE files, ECL runstreams, and tape dumps.
         4.7.1.1.3.3. DIREP Monitor. The DIREP Monitor makes sure the problem is not
         caused by following incorrect procedures.
      4.7.1.1.4. DIREP Preparation. When preparing a DIREP, provide as much
      information as possible.   It is better to provide too much information than not
      enough.
      4.7.1.1.5. DIREP Monitor Duties. The AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity
      should appoint both a primary and an alternate DIREP Monitor. The DIREP Monitor
      will act as the point of contact for the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity.
      The monitor's duties will include the following:
         4.7.1.1.5.1. Review the submission of all SBSS DIREPs created by all functional
         users in the LRS/Materiel Management Activity arena. Review the reports for
         accuracy, clarity, completeness, and correct mailing address.            Note:
         Mailing address is AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, Attention:
         DIREP Control, 401 East Moore Dr, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-
         3001 or e-mail team4@gunter.af.mil.
         4.7.1.1.5.2. Make sure all supporting documentation is carefully labeled with the
         correct DIREP number and attached to the DIREP. If the DIREP is inadequate or
         no supporting documentation is provided, the DIREP may be canceled. Support
         documentation should include the following:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 299


             4.7.1.1.5.2.1. Input image.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.2. Before and after inquiries (type 16 ALL DETAIL).
             4.7.1.1.5.2.3. Copy of the reject notice.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.4. Transaction trace when the DIREP involves an online/TIP
             program. The computer operator will obtain the transaction trace using the
             general purpose screen (Screen 051). The operator places the input image on
             the top line, moves the cursor to the first position of the second line, and
             enters the word TRACE. When he or she presses the transmit key, a file is
             built in RJPR01. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
             operator will print the output so it can be attached to the DIREP.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.5. Report select parameter image.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.6. Aborted ECL runstream and applicable dumps.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.7. A copy of the report for which the DIREP has been prepared.
             4.7.1.1.5.2.8. All other documentation which would aid in solving the
             problem.
          4.7.1.1.5.3. Maintain a log of all DIREPs submitted to the DMC. The entries for
          the log will have at least the following:
             4.7.1.1.5.3.1. A meaningful short title. Use the same short title as stated on
             the AF Form 1815, Difficulty Report (DIREP) Worksheet.
             4.7.1.1.5.3.2. DIREP number. Enter the number after the report is received
             from the DMC.
             4.7.1.1.5.3.3. Flight or section submitting the DIREP.
             4.7.1.1.5.3.4. Date the DIREP was submitted to the DMC.
             4.7.1.1.5.3.5. An entry which indicates whether the DIREP is about a
             program number or an SBSS screen.
               4.7.1.1.5.3.5.1. If it is against a program, enter the program number.
               4.7.1.1.5.3.5.2. If it is against the SBSS screen, enter the screen number.
             4.7.1.1.5.3.6. An entry which tells whether the DIREP is open or is closed. If
             the DIREP has been closed, enter the closing date.
          4.7.1.1.5.4. Monitor the status of DIREP solutions provided on the Worldwide
          DIREP Status Report (WWDSR). Make sure all DIREPs submitted to the DMC
          facility are on the WWDSR. Resolve problems encountered when a DIREP does
          not appear on a WWDSR by closely working with the DMC. It is also advisable
          to use the WWDSR to track DIREPs submitted by other bases on problems you
          are experiencing.
          4.7.1.1.5.5. Formally advise DIREP initiators of DIREP results and make the
          WWDSR available to all users. All DIREPs submitted by bases will receive a
          formal response that includes a correction of the problem if applicable.
300                                                  AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


      4.7.1.1.6. Category Codes. Category codes are tools used by AFMC SCM-R
      Information Technology Activity to make sure reported problems receive proper
      attention. The category code assigned to the DIREP by the DIREP Monitor is used
      mainly as a guide and may be assigned a different code by AFMC SCM-R
      Information Technology Activity. All DIREPs are processed through the AFMC
      SCM-R Information Technology Activity, where a category code of I, II, III, or IV is
      assigned. The criteria for assigning a category code are as follows:
         4.7.1.1.6.1. Category I--MAJOR IMPACT. These problems include system
         loops causing pointer problems, lost audit trails, and incorrect accountable record
         updating. Normally, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity corrects
         these problems immediately and releases data on a special release. Problems
         involving fatal software errors resulting in serious degradation are usually
         category I. They require the following actions:
             4.7.1.1.6.1.1. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity should act
             immediately to identify and correct the problem.
             4.7.1.1.6.1.2. Computer Operations must discuss the problem with the AFMC
             SCM-R Information Technology Activity before submitting the DIREP. A
             category I DIREP can and should be processed over the phone with the
             AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. This phone call provides a
             starting point for resolving the problem. Note:      If Computer Operations
             designates a problem category I without first talking to the AFMC SCM-R
             Information Technology Activity, then the problem is usually downgraded to
             category II or III.
             4.7.1.1.6.1.3. The user processes the DIREP in the normal manner and
             forwards the support material to the DMC.
             4.7.1.1.6.1.4. The DMC forwards the material to AFMC SCM-R Information
             Technology Activity as quickly as possible.
         4.7.1.1.6.2. Category II--SEVERE PROBLEM. The problem stops the computer
         from processing input, but it does not cause looping or destroy accountable
         records. Category II problems could be causing errors in recovery or upchannel
         reporting. These problems are normally corrected in or with the next release to be
         shipped.
         4.7.1.1.6.3. Category III--CHRONIC PROBLEM. This problem does not stop
         processing. Category III problems may be spacing or incorrect rejects that are
         rarely encountered. These problems are corrected in the next scheduled release.
         4.7.1.1.6.4. Category IV--COSMETIC ERROR. These are misspelled words and
         all other minor program deficiencies. Correct these problems as workload
         permits.
      4.7.1.1.7. Completing AF Form 1815. The information on AF Form 1815 provides
      definitions and descriptions of data needed for DIREP initiation and completion. The
      format of the requested information is similar to that identified in the frames of the
      mission support system (MSS).
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                             301

              coordination. Shaded areas are for field support use only.
          4.7.1.1.8. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. The AFMC SCM-R
          Information Technology Activity processes all DIREPs for SBSS system codes GV
          and CH. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is the point of contact
          for all DIREP information.
   4.7.2. Calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Sometimes questions or
   errors arise that just cannot be resolved at field level or MAJCOM level. These questions
   and errors should be directed to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity at
   Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114.
       4.7.2.1. Make sure the answer isn't already documented in this chapter, DIREP’d, or
       identified in the MAPPER System before calling.
       4.7.2.2. See Ch 2 Reporting Program Problems, before calling the FAS.
       4.7.2.3. Do Your Homework First. Run through the problem checklist provided in
       Chapter 2. If you still can't solve the problem, then call the AFMC SCM-R Information
       Technology Activity. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is staffed by
       extremely knowledgeable individuals who are willing to assist you. However, it is
       extremely hard to give assistance to a base that has not defined the basic problem and has
       no knowledge of the events that led up to the problem.
4.8. Disaster, Emergency and Contingency Planning. A complete discussion of disaster,
emergency and contingency planning can be found in Sec. 4K.

Section 4B—-SIFS Control Records
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  303


4.9. Overview. This section provides the procedures and identifies the processes required to
load and maintain the SIFS control records. This section also describes the SIFS control records
and how they interact with the overall operations of SIFS. The SIFS control records are
extremely important. All dispatch actions to be performed on each TRIC are described in the
SIFS control records. It should be noted that these records have now been standardized across
the Air Force. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is now responsible for releasing
a consolidated SIFS routing table. This table will contain the disposition for all TRICs routed by
the SIFS control records (see Para 4.54).
   4.9.1. SIFS Control Record Processing. The objective of the SIFS control records is to store
   dispatch information for each TRIC. This information permits SIFS programs to dispatch
   these TRICs in a timely manner based on the mission requirements of that base.
4.10. SIFS Control Records.
   4.10.1. General. Users can load, change, or delete SIFS control records but must have an
   Authorization Number provided by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity to do
   so. The inquiry option does not require an Authorization Number. See the following
   paragraphs for processing restrictions accomplished individually by using TRIC 1JC
   (Inbound) (Para 4.55), 1JB (Inbound) (Para 4.59), or TRIC 1JD (Output) (Para 4.57).
   4.10.2. Responsibilities.
       4.10.2.1. SIFS Control Record Contents. The OPR cited on the SIFS control record has
       the primary responsibility for ensuring that all images dispatched to their file are worked
       in a timely manner. It is recommended that each flight appoint a primary and an alternate
       SIFS Control Record Monitor. These individuals will be the focal point for any questions
       relating to these TRICs and should have some understanding of IPF and CTS. If the
       flight has a representative, it is recommended that the representative be appointed the
       primary SIFS Control Record Monitor.
       4.10.2.2. System Designator. The SIFS control records are unique to each system
       designator. By default, data images will be dispatched based upon the control records of
       the host account.
       4.10.2.3. Review of SIFS Control Records. P&A is responsible for ensuring that each
       flight receives a copy of the SIFS control file. They should also monitor each flight file
       to ensure all images are being reviewed in a timely manner. P&A is also responsible for
       the following:
           4.10.2.3.1. Coordinating with MAJCOM to resolving routing conflicts.
           4.10.2.3.2. Management of the SIFS residue and clearing SIFS residue in a timely
           manner.
           4.10.2.3.3. Management of the SIFS Narrative File and clearing the SIFS Narrative
           File in a timely manner.
4.11. Loading the SIFS Control Records.
   4.11.1. Prior to load of SIFS Control table,
       4.11.1.1. Ensure all pseudo readers are empty
 304                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       4.11.1.2. Run End Card and process a file Dump
       4.11.1.3. Come back inline and down all terminals
   4.11.2. Process SIFS utility option 8 (Control Record Loader).
       4.11.2.1. When the new SIFS option 8 is processed, program NGV231 performs the
       following actions:
          4.11.2.1.1. Reads the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity released
          control table.
          4.11.2.1.2. Validates each TRIC’s authorization number. (This is done to ensure that
          routing records were not modified prior to being uploaded. If any position of a record
          has been modified, then the program will end. A notice is sent to the AFMC SCM-R
          Information Technology Activity console stating that the file has bad records. This
          notice is also printed on the SIFS history report. You then have to load the file back
          from the release tape.)
          4.11.2.1.3. Reads the Base Constant record 001 to determine all active SRANs.
          4.11.2.1.4. Creates inbound and outbound records for each active SRAN.
          4.11.2.1.5. Recalculate authorization number for each record.
          4.11.2.1.6. Deletes all inbound, equate, and outbound records from the database.
          4.11.2.1.7. Loads the new records to the pseudo processor. Note:       This program
          must be run for each active gang. If your system has a gang 1 and 2, then both gangs
          must process option 8 to load the control table.
4.12. Miscellaneous.
   4.12.1. Changes Made to SIFS Control Records. Users can inquire the SIFS control records
   at any time. However you must receive prior approval from your MAJCOM and AFMC
   SCM-R Information Technology Activity to change any SIFS control record. If approval is
   granted AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will provide you with the
   Authorization Number needed to update request record. Users should be aware that their
   user-ID (BATCH) or their user initials TIP will be recorded on the applicable SIFS control
   record at the time the change is made. All changes made to SIFS control records are reported
   on the SIFS End-of-Day (EOD) Listing. If the change was made in BATCH mode, then the
   user-ID of the individual making the change will show on the SIFS EOD Listing. If the
   change was made in TIP mode, then the initials of the individual performing the change will
   show on the SIFS EOD Listing.
   4.12.2. Rejects. The most common rejects occur when users try to load a SIFS control
   record that is already loaded or try to delete/change a SIFS control record that is not loaded.
   A complete list of rejects and corrective action is outlined in Ch 7. A satellite account has
   the capability to query SIFS control record settings for the host account; however, any
   attempt by a satellite to change a host account’s SIFS control record will result in a 179
   Reject Notice.
   4.12.3. Residue. Any time SIFS tries to dispatch an image, it looks for a corresponding
   entry in the SIFS control record. If SIFS cannot find an entry or if the entry does not provide
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    305


   the necessary information (entry may be corrupt), then the data image is written to residue.
   Note: The default dispatch for satellite accounts is the 01 account (that is, if NO separate
   entry exists for that particular Satellite account, then by default, the entry for the 01 account
   is used). Items will only be sent to residue if there is NO entry for the 01 account. Users
   have 24 hours in which to clear the residue. If the image is not cleared in 24 hours, it is cited
   as being delinquent. Each day the image is delinquent and the number of days delinquent are
   reported on the SIFS EOD.
4.13. SIFS Inbound Data Handling. ADRSS Inbound Processing. The ADRSS system
(system code AA) dispatches images arriving on base for systems (ADS) which are resident on
the SBLC. ADRSS extracts Supply data and passes this data to the SBSS for SIFS processing.
When Inbound SIFS processes, the raw inbound data images are dispatched based on the
contents of the SIFS Inbound Control Records. See Sec. 4G for SIFS inbound processing
procedures.
4.14. SIFS SBSS Output Data Image Handling.
   4.14.1. SBSS Application Program. SIFS directly interfaces with the SBSS application
   program which generates the output data image(s). In effect, this means that the output data
   images are dispatched at the time they are generated.
   4.14.2. Data Image Output. SIFS dispatches output data images based on the contents of the
   output SIFS control records. If users have any questions about specific settings for any of the
   output SIFS control records, they should see Para 4.50
   4.14.3. SIFS Control Record Settings. The following steps should be taken when a conflict
   occurs over settings on the SIFS control records.
       4.14.3.1. If you disagree with the standard settings outlined in Para. 4.54, then contact
       the Procedures Section and discuss this with them. The AFMC SCM-R QUALITY
       ASSURANCE ACTIVITY must determine if the requested change is to correct a routing
       error or to improve local flexibility. The request is then forwarded to the supporting
       MAJCOM. The MAJCOM will determine if the routing should be changed. If so,
       forward the request to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity for
       consideration. Note: SIFS Control is now standard across the Air Force. So, in some
       cases, local flexibility will have to give way to the greater need of the group.

Section 4C—-SIFS Header Records

4.15. Overview. The SIFS header record provides SIFS with a decision-making complex.
Different switches and flags are set on the SIFS header record based on local events and local
conditions. SIFS uses these flag settings to determine appropriate courses of action during
dispatch processes. The SIFS header record also provides SIFS with constants data that is
unique to that base and system designator.
4.16. SIFS Header Record Processing. Users can inquire the SIFS header record(s) at any
given time. Certain items may be changed by the user at any given time. The SIFS Header
Record is basically divided into three segments.
 306                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   4.16.1. The first segment contains constants information unique to that base/system
   designator that will be used by SIFS (that is, SPS site-ID, host DMC, etc.). This segment is
   rarely updated.
   4.16.2. The second segment contains those flags that can be toggled ON or OFF by the user
   depending on local conditions (that is, SIFS inbound and/or SIFS output runs can be
   suppressed, SPS, AFEMS transfers can be suppressed, etc.). This segment is updated at any
   time depending on local circumstances. Note: Users should exercise care when
   manipulating these flags. Failure to properly set and use these flags may result in delayed
   processing of inbound and output data items.
   4.16.3. The third segment is reserved for internal SIFS processing and cannot be updated
   unless the user performs a FIX action for whatever reason (see note below). This segment
   contains different flags which tell SIFS that a specific database area is full and that overflow
   processing is in effect. Once the database area is cleared and the overflow file processed,
   SIFS will clear this flag under program control. Note: Be reminded that FIX action or QLP
   Update should be performed ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. Fixing data records is reserved
   for those times when SBSS application programs cannot perform the required changes. If in
   doubt, check with your MAJCOM or the FAB prior to performing this action.
4.17. Constants Information.
   4.17.1. General. The constants information is global to all SIFS processing runs. The SIFS
   Header Record provides a convenient way to store this data. This constants data is unique to
   each site and, may even be unique across system designators. Users can change this data at
   any time by processing TRIC 1JA (see Para 4.61). Care should be taken when changing this
   data as it could have an effect on ALL SIFS jobs for a given system designator. The
   capability now exists to store data images to the Queue 2 area for later processing by SIFS
   (see Para 4.63). SIFS will make distribution of the TRIC based on its disposition code
   loaded to the SIFS TRIC table.
   4.17.2. SIFS Constants Data. The SIFS constants data is located on the SIFS header record
   and is broken out as follows:
       4.17.2.1. Site Identification Data.    Site Identification is data that is unique to this
       processing site. This data includes:
          4.17.2.1.1. HOST-ALN and HOST-PLN. These are used to identify the host DMC.
          SIFS primarily uses this data to interface with the ADRSS system.
          4.17.2.1.2. SPS -Site-ID. This tells SIFS where to send all data images that are
          destined for SPS. Blank when TYPE-BCAS-XFER is File (f).
          4.17.2.1.3. ZULU-DIFF and HOURS-ZULU-DIFF. These are used by SIFS in
          date/time calculations. Users should understand that all date-time stamps used in
          DDN and ADRSS are converted to ZULU time. ZULU time or Greenwich Meridian
          Time (GMT) is a standard time that provides a method to measure events that are
          time sensitive (that is, local time for different time zones are relative to ZULU time
          which is the standard). By using this standard there is no confusion or need to
          convert times, so that times can be viewed in perspective.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   307


          4.17.2.1.4. DLATS-Site-ID identifies which DLATS site to route data to. See Para.
          4.61., note 27, for a list of locations and indicators.
       4.17.2.2. Threshold Records. The threshold records permit users to control SIFS runs
       based on the volume of data. When the number of images cumulated in a specific area is
       equal to the user supplied threshold count, SIFS will automatically start and dispatch
       these records. The user can adjust these threshold values for optimum SIFS processing.
       Each of these threshold counts has a minimum value of 50. These threshold counts do
       NOT apply to ADRSS bound data images.
       4.17.2.3. SIFS Hold Record. SBSS output data images can be divided into two groups:
          4.17.2.3.1. ADRSS bound data images. For ADRSS bound data images a routine or
          a priority distinction still exists, but at the ADRSS level ONLY (that is, outbound
          packets of data images can be sent through DDN as a priority packet or as a routine
          packet). At the SBSS level (that is, SIFS), a distinction between Priority or Routine is
          meaningless, since ALL SBSS output data images are made available to ADRSS as
          soon as they are generated.
          4.17.2.3.2. Non-ADRSS bound data images. All SBSS output data images that are
          not routed to either ADRSS, SPS, AFEMS or DLATS will be placed in the SIFS
          HOLD DATA RECORD. The frequency with which these images are dispatched
          will be based on the user specified value of the SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES. Each
          time SIFS writes an SBSS data image to the SIFS HOLD DATA RECORD, the
          SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES is checked against the SIFS-HOLD-COUNT. If the
          SIFS-HOLD-COUNT is at 75 percent of the SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES, SIFS will
          automatically start a dispatch run. Users may have to adjust the threshold values to
          assure optimum processing. Users must decide if the SIFS dispatch processor is
          running too often. If it is, then the threshold values should be adjusted upward to
          allow more images to collect before a dispatch run. If SIFS is not executing often
          enough, then users should lower the threshold count. See Para. 4.62. for guidelines
          on assigning the threshold counts.
       4.17.2.4. Transfer Media. Tells SIFS how to transfer images that are non-DDN bound
       but go outside of the SBSS (for example, SPS. Users can select the media used to
       transfer these images. The transfer media code is stored on the SIFS-HEADER-
       RECORD in the TYPE-BCAS-XFER field. User can elect to transfer these images by:
       (E)lectronic transmission, (F)ile, or floppy (D)isk.
       4.17.2.5. SIFS Save. Each time SIFS dispatches a file, a copy of that file is written to
       elements     as    follows:        (GANG)GV0*SIFS-SAVE.NGV250/DATETIME,
       (GANG)GV0*SIFS-SAVE.TRIC/DATETIME etc.
4.18. SIFS Inhibit Flags.
   4.18.1. General. The SIFS Inhibit Flags provide users with control over a variety of SIFS
   events. Users can toggle these flags ON or OFF. Users should exercise care when using
   these options, since delayed processing of images could result. Flags are toggled on by
   entering a Y in the appropriate field and toggled off by entering an * in the appropriate field.
   See 1JA format for specific options.
 308                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   4.18.2. User Options. Users can toggle these flags ON or OFF at any time by processing
   TRIC 1JA (see Para 4.61). Once the appropriate flag has been set, the applicable images
   will NOT be automatically processed by SIFS. Instead, these images will be queued until the
   user elects to process these images. Users are discouraged from setting these flags unless a
   legitimate condition exists that warrants use of the inhibit flags. Inhibit flags can cause one
   or all of the following conditions:
       4.18.2.1. Data images could be routed to volatile flat-files.
       4.18.2.2. User intervention and manual dispatching increases.
       4.18.2.3. Increased chance of lost or delayed data images.

Section 4D—- SIFS Utilities

4.19. Overview. SIFS utilities are a miscellaneous collection of programs and routines that
assist the user by providing a set of tools to tailor SIFS to meet local processing requirements.
These tools provide the user with the means to ‘force’ certain events or, to override current SIFS
settings temporarily for the duration of a specific processing run. The DLATS reject
management capability is only available through the ES-S system. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 4,
Ch 6 for the ES-S User’s Manual reference.
4.20. Concept. Each SIFS program or routine can be invoked by the user at any time. The user
does this by using the demand run of SIFS utility and taking the option for the particular run they
wish to process. This is done by keying in: @ADD 0GV00000*GVSSGUD001.UTIL or by
processing an @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV260.

Section 4E—-Processing Of Stock Number Users Directory (SNUD) Data

4.21. Overview.
   4.21.1. General. The Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) is an Air Force Materiel
   Command (AFMC) operated data system located at HQ AFMC Wright Patterson AFB OH
   45433-5001. The SNUD system provides automatic distribution of catalog management for
   stock numbers loaded at each base. This data arrives on base through DDN and is passed to
   the SBSS for processing. A full description of SNUD processing can be found in AFH 23-
   123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.
   4.21.2. SNUD OPR. At base level, SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is the point of
   contact on all matters relating to SNUD processing.
   4.21.3. SIFS Inbound SNUD Processing. The SIFS SNUD handler (program NGV243) in
   conjunction with program NGV230 (Master SIFS Inbound Dispatch Utility) provides an
   automated means for processing inbound SNUD images. Inbound SNUD data can basically
   be grouped into one of three areas with SIFS processing each group differently. The groups
   are:
       4.21.3.1. SNUD data without an effective date is passed by SIFS to the pseudo for
       immediate processing.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              309


      4.21.3.2. SNUD data which has an effective date is held until the effective date is
      reached. The data images are stored on the 729 record (SIFS SNUD DATA IMAGE
      RECORD).
      4.21.3.3. Interchangeable and Substitute (ISG) data used by program NGV404.

Section 4F—-Outbound Processing

4.22. Overview. This section describes how SIFS interfaces with the Automated Data Reports
Submission System (ADRSS). A brief overview of the ADRSS system is also provided for
purposes of clarity.
4.23. Automated Data Reports Submission System (ADRSS).
   4.23.1. General. ADRSS is an offline batch utility system. The primary purpose of ADRSS
   is to prepare data reports generated by all Automated Data Systems (ADS) for offbase
   distribution. ADRSS will generate messages in the correct format for DDN transmissions.
   4.23.2. Key files. See Para 4.74 for a complete list of files that are essential to ADRSS
   processing.
   4.23.3. SIFS Outbound. SIFS is the Supply interface that submits DDN bound Supply data
   to the ADRSS system (system code AA). ADRSS is responsible for translating data to a
   DDN acceptable format. SIFS will submit data to the ADRSS system based on the contents
   of the SIFS OUTPUT CONTROL RECORD (see Para 4.57). Normally, Supply data is
   submitted to the ADRSS system with minimal manual intervention. Under some instances,
   users may wish to introduce external Supply data to the ADRSS system. Introduction of
   external supply data is referred to as OFFLINE data submission.
      4.23.3.1. Manual Submission using 2HQ. Authorized users can use TRIC 2HQ to
      submit images for later submission through SIFS. The 2HQ provides the capability to
      store 160-position images on the 2-HR-CARD record to transceive later to SIFS. SIFS
      makes disposition based upon the disposition code for the TRIC in positions 1-3 of the
      image stored. See Para 4.63 for the 2HQ format.
      4.23.3.2. Manual Submission through ES-S to DLATS. Authorized users can use ES-S
      to submit transactions directly to DLATS for subsequent routing (bypassing the normal
      SIFS/ADRSS process). Users must be authorized privileges against the “FBDLATS”
      DoDAAC in ES-S (FBDLATS is internal to ES-S, it is not a real DoDAAC for use in any
      other system). ES-S will not derive any field values or edits for transactions submitted
      through this method so all values must be entered IAW the applicable transaction format.
          4.23.3.2.1. Single transactions. Single transactions can be input through the ES-S
          general purpose screen. The General Purpose processing capability must also be
          assigned. FBDLATS must be selected first and then ES-S will allow any transaction
          image to be entered. Upon submission the image will be placed in the DLATS queue
          for forwarding to DLATS.
          4.23.3.2.2. Multiple Transactions. Transactions can also be submitted directly to
          DLATS in batch. Users are authorized to submit batches through ES-S to DLATS
          when they have the “FBDLATS” DoDAAC and the Batch capability assigned.
          “DLATS” should be entered in the first 4 positions of any transaction being sent
 310                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


          directly to DLATS (that is, use DLATS in lieu of a specific base SRAN in each
          image in the .txt file being used to batch process transactions). See the ES-S User’s
          Manual for more information.
   4.23.4. Routing Outbound Transactions through ES-S. Outbound Transactions can be routed
   through ES-S instead of the normal SIFS/ADRSS process. ES-S will then pass the
   transactions directly to Stock Control System (SCS) or to the DLATS for processing. Most
   transactions will simply pass through ES-S to DLATS, but selected transactions will actually
   be subject to additional processing. For example, A0A/A01 transactions will pass through
   the ES-S Automatic Lateral Support (Sourcing) logic. Other transactions may be
   transformed into the new Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) formats prior to
   being passed to DLATS.
       4.23.4.1. The ES/S TRIC UPDATE (Screen 1TT/183) is used to List (L), Add (A), or
       Change (C) the transaction identifiers that should be routed through ES-S. Outbound
       transactions should only be routed through ES-S as directed by AFMC SCM-R
       Information Technology Activity (that is, the use of Screen 1TT to add or change
       transaction routing must be coordinated through AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
       Activity). The entire transaction identifier does not need to be entered, i.e., “A0” can be
       used to route all transactions that begin with “A0” through ES-S (i.e.,
       A01/A02/A04/A05/A0A/A0B/A0D/A0E). Partial transaction identifiers should be used
       with caution and they should NOT be used when the individual complete transaction
       identifiers are more appropriate. Do NOT use partial and complete transaction identifiers
       for the same type of transactions together. For example, do NOT enter “AFX” and “AF”
       together. Either use “AF” to route all transactions that begin with “AF” through ES-S or
       list each transaction separately (AF1, AFC, AFX, etc). The 1TT transaction can only be
       processed through the main RPS console (Function 057).
       4.23.4.2. All transactions that are routed through ES-S will be recorded in the ES-S
       ATC. Transactions submitted through ES-S to DLATS are still subject to DLATS edits.
       Transactions that do not pass DLATS edits and result in Narrative rejects will be returned
       to ES-S where they will be displayed in the DLATS Narrative Rejects area of ES-S.

4.24. System Responsibilities. The ADRSS Monitor at the host DMC is the main OPR on the
ADRSS system. The ADRSS Monitor at the DMC has ultimate control over all input/output
to/from ADRSS. At a minimum, the ADRSS Monitor must coordinate report certification, data
retransmissions, error/contingency processing, any routing changes, and any changes to any item
connected with Supply data processing. If the above items are closely coordinated, this will
assure a smooth operation of the ADRSS system. The results of ADRSS processing must be
viewed as soon as possible. This will allow any necessary corrections and resubmission of
reports in a timely manner. If any error conditions exist that prevent the submission of Supply
data to ADRSS, it is imperative that the ADRSS monitor notify Supply as soon as possible. It is
recommended that a written agreement between Supply and the ADRSS monitor be established
which outlines all responsibilities. Good communication between the ADRSS monitor and the
SIFS Gang Monitor is integral to smooth operations.
4.25. Routing Information Changes.
   4.25.1. Overview. The routing information comes from offbase distribution instructions in
   documentation from the functional user system producing a data report. It is the
   responsibility of the receiving activity to notify users of the correct routing information
   required to successfully transceive the report.          THE ADRSS MONITOR AT THE
   DMC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTATION FOR ALL NEW
   SYSTEMS AND TO REVIEW ALL RELEASE PACKAGES TO DETERMINE
   CHANGES TO BE MADE TO THE ROUTING INFORMATION.
   4.25.2. SIFS Operations. The SIFS Gang Monitor is the main OPR for the SBSS SIFS
   system. The SIFS Gang Monitor has control over supply data items going to the ADRSS
   system. The Supply SIFS Gang Monitor must coordinate with the ADRSS monitor on:
       4.25.2.1. Any problems related to submission of data to the ADRSS system.
       4.25.2.2. Any changes required on routing information.
 314                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       4.25.2.3. Any changes to SBSS filename(s) that interface with ADRSS.
       4.25.2.4. DDN tracer action(s).
       4.25.2.5. Error/contingency processing.
4.26. Communications Procedures. Source Documents. Communications procedures are
accomplished in accordance with AFI 33-112, Information Technology Hardware Asset
Management and AFI 33-113, Managing Air Force Messaging Centers.
4.27. Description of the DLA Transaction Services (DLATS).
   4.27.1. Overview. DLATS is a real-time computer system with communication lines
   directly linked to DDN. DLATS has been designed to effectively utilize DDN services,
   thereby allowing it to route and pass logistics traffic. In effect, DLATS serves as a relay
   station, passing data along to its final destination.
   4.27.2. Function of DLATS. DLATS receives, processes, and forwards designated
   transactions (DICs) to the appropriate destination(s). Transactions that are narrative
   exception/supplemental data cannot be processed by DLATS but can be processed by DDN.
   SIFS will submit DLATS -bound Supply data to the ADRSS system. The ADRSS system
   then passes this data directly to DLATS via DDN. Currently DLATS will not accept any
   data images greater than 80 characters in length.
   4.27.3. Destination Communications Routing Indicators. DLATS Logistics traffic should be
   addressed to the correct DLATS terminal for the base’s geographic location. If the user
   decides that there is a need to change the DLATS terminal, then DLATS require at least 5
   days notification. Within the CONUS, this may be determined by the first four positions of
   the base’s routing indicator and adding ZZA. For activities outside of CONUS, contact the
   local communications center. SIFS will use the information stored on the SIFS header record
   and on the output SIFS control records.
   4.27.4. Content Indicator Code. Content Indicator Codes (CICs) that can be used by bases
   are outlined in Annex B of JANAP 128. At the option of the base, CIC of IAZZ may be used
   without regard to the type of document. In this case, a mix of MILSTRIP, MILSTRAP and
   Finance FT(x) or FA(x) transactions may be included in the same message within the same
   precedence. Separate messages are NOT required for the submission of different CICs.
   DLATS will accept messages with either the record count or in the record field of the
   message header. The count, however, MUST appear in the EOT image. ADRSS will
   automatically generate this information for all SBSS data that is DLATS bound. The
   following CICs are used by SIFS: The CIC is required to be assigned prior to effecting
   transmission of data when the data content is defined with a standard CIC. To find a CIC,
   see JANAP 128, Annex I.

4.28. ADRSS Message Preparation.
   4.28.1. DLATS. See DLATS Manual DoD 4000.25-10-M. Text headers and text trailers
   will not be included. DLATS permits the combination of different data types within the
   same message. The identity of the data is at record level. The content indicator code (CIC)
   and the COMM Routing Indicator (RI) in the ADRSS message header are the data elements
   which indicate that the message will be interrogated at record level. The data at record level
   indicates the destination ADS. The TO RI and the CIC are NOT defined with DLATS.
   4.28.2. NON- DLATS. The ADRSS header will have all the information required by
   JANAP 128. (See Para 4.70 for the format of an ADRSS header.) The ADRSS message
   headers do not uniquely identify the text contained within the message to the extent that it
   can be directed to a specific ADS for processing. Each data report (non- DLATS) prepared
   by ADRSS for transmission must have a text header.
       4.28.2.1. Text Header. The text header is generated by ADRSS. Every data report
       prepared must have a text header for each message to be transmitted. The text header
       will be the first image of each message group. (See Para. 4.70. for a description of the
       text header.)
       4.28.2.2. Text Trailer. Every data report that requires a text header must have a text
       trailer as the last record of the last message group prepared for the data report. The text
       trailer will immediately precede the DDN trailer (EOT) record.
   4.28.3. Minimize Considered. When MINIMIZE is imposed, all logistics data routed by
   DLATS will CONTINUE to be transceived via DDN unless the message imposing
   MINIMIZE specifically includes logistics traffic. In that event, output data images will be
   sent via priority mail.
   4.28.4. Invalid Data. Invalid data will cause DLATS rejects. These rejects will be returned
   to     the      originator     of      the     message     and      placed      in      file
   (GANG)GV0<ALN><PLN>00*NARRATIVE. Only those documents that rejected need to
 316                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   be reprocessed.   The remainder of the returned messages, if any, have already been
   processed.
   4.28.5. The contents of the NARRATIVE file are message packets of DLATS rejects that
   are returned to the SBSS account for correction and resubmission. Each packet is identified
   by the following identification entry:          “ATTN: DOCUMENTS RETURNED AS
   RECEIVED. CORRECT AND RESUBMIT.” Following the packet identification entry are
   the DLATS POC telephone information, images of the actual documents being returned, and
   a clear test explanation of the reason for the return of the documents.
       4.28.5.1. The NARRATIVE file cannot be edited. Attempts to edit it will corrupt it and
       cause the ADRSS system to lock and abort. To use the NARRATIVE file, the SBSS
       SIFS monitor must catalog a SBSS work file and then copy the NARRATIVE file into it.
       The NARRATIVE file contains all images returned from DLATS, both Supply and
       Accounting & Finance. After the NARRATIVE file is copied into the SBSS work file it
       can be deleted. This file must be worked daily to minimize delays in retransmitting
       priority requisitions and other valid supply transactions through DLATS. The rejected
       images must be made available to the responsible section within LRS/Materiel
       Management Activity or Accounting & Finance for correction. The SBSS work file
       should be used for that purpose. The corrected data images should be extracted and
       copied into (GANG)GV0<ALN><PLV>00*VGV237. And retransmitted to DLATS via
       GV237MDR or option 17 or the SIFS utility menu.
   4.28.6. Data Retransmittals. If users require data packets to be retransmitted, then users
   should contact the ADRSS Monitor. The ADRSS Monitor can use the retransmittal
   subsystem to selectively extract data from the Cumulative History File (VAAHSTU).
4.29. ADRSS/SIFS Interface (File Specifications). All Supply files submitted to ADRSS for
processing must comply with the following limitations:
   4.29.1. Must have an ADRSS control record (see Para 4.70) as the first record in the file, or
   it must be accompanied by an override ADRSS control record.
   4.29.2. Logical record length must be fixed between 80 and 1200 characters.

Section 4G—-Inbound Processing

4.30. ADRSS II.
   4.30.1. ADRSS II processes all inbound messages. ADRSS places the inbound data images
   for each ADS in the appropriate files. These files are specified in the DISN Collect
   Incoming FTP/DISN file (CID).                 ADRSS will place Supply messages into
   0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230. SIFS reads the SIFS gang file to determine which gangs
   are active at that site and performs the following:
   4.30.2. SIFS Inbound. Once ADRSS has passed all the Supply messages to SIFS, the
   following actions occur:
       4.30.2.1. Program NGV230A. The gang parameter images identify which gangs are
       active at the base.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 317


      4.30.2.2. Once program NGV230A has determined which Gangs are active at that base,
      NGV230A          takes    the   ‘raw’     inbound     images    from   the     file
      0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230. (ADRSS II places all Supply inbound images in the
      file 0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230.). Copies of the ‘raw’ data are placed in gang
      unique files (that is, ?GV0*GV230UD001. Where ? = primary gang number). A file will
      be created for each Gang Parameter Input Image provided to NGV230.
      4.30.2.3. Program NGV230A builds ECL and starts concurrent runs for each Gang
      configured.
      4.30.2.4. If the database is available, NGV230A will read and load the following records
      to tables internal to NGV230A, which reduces I/O’s and possible database conflicts:

      4.30.2.5. Once SIFS has successfully read these records, SIFS is ready to dispatch the
      images.
      4.30.2.6. To facilitate the dispatch process, NGV230 prepares the images to be
      dispatched. NGV230 will check to see if the ‘raw’ input data contains images for other
      gangs (done by examining the SRAN). If another gang is configured at that base, SIFS
      will discard the data for the other GANG (Remember each Gang received its own copy of
      this raw inbound data file.). If SIFS does not know what to do with any inbound data
      (that is, unidentified SRAN) the data will be placed in the residue file and a message will
      be sent to console 057. This file will also be reported on the SIFS EOD listing. Users
      will have to annotate the EOD list with any actions performed against that data (for
      example, sent back to data automation, 001 Record updated in case of a rehome, etc.).
      4.30.2.7. During the dispatch process, program NGV230 builds a 720-CALC-KEY to
      fetch the Inbound Control Record. The 720-CALC-KEY consists of the destination
      SRAN and TRIC of the image to be dispatched. If no Inbound Control Record are loaded
      for the SRAN and TRIC, the image will be placed in Residue. If an Inbound Control
      Record is loaded, SIFS will use the routing information for the record to dispatch the
      inbound data image. See Para 4.48.

Section 4H—-Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) Processing

4.31. Overview. SIFS will collect inline AFEMS images for transfer via DDN to Wright
Patterson AFB OH. AFEMS images are created and sent to the AFEMS area programmatically.
Program NGV240O collects the images and dispatches them to ADRSS. NGV240O will be
started when the AFEMS images collected are equal to or greater than 75% of the AFEMS
threshold.
 318                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


4.32. AFEMS Stacking. When the AFEMS thresholds have been met, images from the 748
record (AFEMS) will be read and written to file (GANG)GV0<ALN>*1GV240. For ADRSS
registration. In the event that the AFEMS threshold is met and status has not been returned from
ADRSS on a previous run, a message will be sent to the console typeout, and the SIFS HUD file
will reflect an error, as follows:
   4.32.1. FROM THE CONSOLE TYPE OUT
   4.32.2. (GANG) GV0<ALN>*(D24801 or 1GV240) (CYCLE NUMBER)
   4.32.3. DOES NOT HAVE GOOD TRANSMISSION STATUS
   4.32.4. WHEN FILE IS SUCCESSFULLY SENT TO AFEMS
   4.32.5. CLEAR AFEMS INHIBIT FLAG TO RESTART JOB
   4.32.6. FROM THE SIFS HISTORY FILE
   4.32.7. PROGRAM STARTED WITH RUNID OF [(GANG)GV240],
   4.32.8. (GANG) GV0*1GV240. (PREVIOUS CYCLE NUMBER) HAS BAD STATUS -
   JOB ABORTED.
   4.32.9. The images for the second run will remain on the AFEMS record along with any
   subsequent images for AFEMS. Once status has been received by ADRSS the user must
   execute GV240ODR from the UTILITY menu to flush the AFEMS record. This process is
   known as AFEMS STACKING. Program NGV787 (D24) works on the same principal. If a
   previous cycle of (GANG)GV0*1GV240. Or (GANG)GV0<ALN>*D24801. (D24) did not
   receive a good transmit status (TF), the program will error and display that cycle number on
   the console and the SIFS HUD file.
4.33. AFEMS Password Process. Occasionally the user will have to retrigger files with
ADRSS using the DTE screen (DTE). This entry requires users to specify the qualifier, file
name, sequence number, cycle number, and file length. If any of the entries are in error, ADRSS
will pass an error notice to the SIFS SUD file. If this happens, the next AFEMS outbound run
will error due to a previous cycle. Users can request a control number and password that will
correct that entry from the Supply Systems Control Center. See trouble reporting, Ch 2.
4.34. Updating AFEMS Status. Once you receive a control number and password go into the
SIFS utility option 16. Locate the entry number of the file that has the error status. Next, on the
input line enter ‘C?’ (? = line number of the file being updated). You will then be asked to enter
your 10 digit control number, next enter your password. The SUD file status screen should now
reflect (TF) status for the AFEMS entry indicated in the change command.

Section 4I—-SPS Interface Processing

4.35. Overview. This section describes the SBSS-SPS interface. Each component in the SBSS-
SPS link will be discussed and any actions or responsibilities required by the SBSS will be
discussed. The objective of the SBSS/SPS interface is to successfully transfer data images
to/from the SBSS/SPS with minimal user intervention.
4.36. General.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   319


   4.36.1. SPS System Application. The Standard Procurement System SPS is a functionally
   dedicated computer system which supports the Base Contracting Office (BCO). The SPS
   system provides the BCO with automation capabilities required to fully support the local
   purchase activity at base level. A part of this support is an interaction with the SBSS (via
   SIFS) through the U2200 to pass demands to contracting and to receive status from these
   demands. This interaction may occur by tape, electronic transfer, ADRSS Search and Move
   (SAM), or by floppy disk.
   4.36.2. SPS System Organization. SPS is a functionally dedicated base-level system located
   in the BCO. A Wang computer is used to support SPS processing in the BCO. The system
   operates in an office environment, and it is used to support local purchase requirements for
   the acquisition of supplies and services.
4.37. Data Transfer Methods.
   4.37.1. SPS Electronic Data Transfer. The SPS/SBSS interaction that requires the least
   amount of user intervention and is far more reliable, is the electronic transfer. The electronic
   transfer requires the SPS to be connected to a port on the U2200. A specific SPS-SITE-ID
   allows data to be transferred between SPS using nine thousand remote (NTR) protocol. By
   using NTR protocol, data is sent to SPS. Data is received from SPS as though it were read
   from a remote input device. All communications between the SPS and the U2200 will be
   initiated on the SPS system by the BCO. When a communications session becomes active,
   all data files queued to the BCAS SITE-ID will be transferred to the SPS for batch processing
   by SPS. Data transferred from the Wang to the U2200 is accomplished by a batch run
   initiated by SPS (run-ID 0LQR0A).
   4.37.2. SAM Data Transfer. When using SAM to interface with SPS, make the following
   changes to the SIFS’s Header record by using the 1JA screen 547.
      4.37.2.1. Blank the BCAS-SITE-ID.
      4.37.2.2. Change the BCAS TYPE XFER to ‘F’. Have the ADRSS monitor load your
      SPS output file name: (G)GV0*GV232OUD(SRAN). To the SAM control table.
   4.37.3. Non-Electronic Data Transfer. Under some circumstances, the electronic transfer
   may not be possible. For example, the hardware configuration may not support electronic
   transfer, the hardware may be broken, or there may be other limiting factors. In any of these
   events, data can be passed to and from SPS either by magnetic tape or floppy disk.
      4.37.3.1. Tape Transfer. If tape is used, the BCO will generate an ‘ALQBSS’ tape. This
      tape will be given to the supporting DMC for processing. To transfer the data from tape
      to disk, the LQ system monitor at the DMC will run program NLQ220 against the
      ALQBSS tape.
      4.37.3.2. Floppy Diskette Transfer. The SPS Wang computer is capable of reading and
      writing to a standard MS-DOS formatted diskette. This allows both the SPS and SBSS to
      transfer data using a microcomputer. If this method is used, local processing procedures
      must be developed to ensure proper control of diskettes is maintained to prevent data
      loss. Any questions on this should be directed to your local BCO.
4.38. System Responsibilities. Good communications are essential to have effective SBSS-to-
SPS and SPS-to-SBSS data image transfers. The LRS CC/AO appoints a SBSS/SPS Monitor
 320                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


which possesses knowledge of SBSS/SPS processes. Responsibilities of the SBSS/SPS monitor
are as follows:
   4.38.1. Establish good communications with the BCO, SPS (LQ) System Monitor and the
   SIFS Monitor.
   4.38.2. Provide the SIFS monitor with the proper SPS site-ID, SPS type transfer and the
   desired SPS image threshold count. Notify the SIFS monitor immediately when changes are
   required.

Section 4J—- SIFS User Files

4.39. Overview. This section explains SIFS User files, their importance and significance to
overall SIFS operations. This section also describes methods that allow users to manage and
manipulate the data in these files.
4.40. User Files.
   4.40.1. SIFS User files give users the capability to direct specified TRICs or program output
   to a file of their choice. User files should be used when:
       4.40.1.1. Users want to “hold” images to be input at a later date.
       4.40.1.2. Users want to use the images as input data into another program, such as R32
       or a locally developed SURGE.
   4.40.2. SIFS User files should NOT be used to create a local safety backup of ALL images.
   SIFS will handle recovery/contingency procedures. Storing a copy of all images handled by
   SIFS into a local user file is a duplication of effort and an abuse of system resources.
   4.40.3. Filenaming Conventions for SIFS User Files. SIFS will NOT perform extensive
   edits on filenames entered by users. This provides users with the flexibility to tailor SIFS to
   local requirements. Users should try to use meaningful SIFS User filenames. The U2200
   Executive has certain criteria that must be satisfied before a file can be cataloged to the
   Master File Directory (MFD). For a discussion of the Master File Directory, see Para 4.77.
   4.40.4. Managing SIFS User Files. Users should understand that flat files can be volatile.
   This basically means that data stored in these files can easily be lost, destroyed or corrupted.
   There are many reasons why your data may be destroyed (e.g., operator error, power
   fluctuations, disk crash, and so forth). However, care and attention to detail can eliminate or
   significantly reduce the chance of problems.
   4.40.5. Potential Error Conditions.
       4.40.5.1. Recoverable Errors. If SIFS finds that User file specified on the Control
       Record is not cataloged to the Master File Directory (MFD), SIFS will catalog the file
       and then write the images to the file. If SIFS finds that the User file does not have
       sufficient track size, then SIFS will first free the file and then reassign the file with
       additional tracks.
       4.40.5.2. Nonrecoverable Errors. If another run has exclusive control of the file, or if the
       file is hardware disabled, SIFS will queue those images destined for the file. SIFS will
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                  321


       then generate a message informing the user that the user file was unavailable. Users will
       then have to manually release the file.
   4.40.6. Disk Management. It is very important that users carefully monitor disk usage.
   Users must periodically clean up their files and remove those elements that are no longer
   needed. Users can remove unneeded elements by deleting files identified by an asterisk
   using the @PACK command. The best way to compute file sizes is to do the following:
       4.40.6.1. @PRT,TL Qualifier*Filename.
       4.40.6.2. Number of Words = Text Size * 28
       4.40.6.3. 1792 Words = 1 Track
       4.40.6.4. Number of Tracks = Number of Words / 1792

Section 4K—- SIFS/SBSS Degraded Mode Processing

4.41. Overview. This section provides an overview of disaster types that users may encounter.
A brief evaluation of cause and effect is provided for each disaster type identified. Users should
understand that this section is not an exhaustive description of potential error or disaster
situations. Local variations preclude an exhaustive coverage. The second part of this section
describes various degraded processing modes and what the user can do to minimize and work-
around degraded processing modes.
4.42. SIFS Degraded Mode Processing.
   4.42.1. General. The SIFS gang monitor will be the main point of contact for SIFS degraded
   mode processing. LGLOS will provide assistance and technical expertise as required. The
   main objective is to maintain the health of the materiel management Account and to ensure
   minimal impact on the processing of materiel management status and requisitions.
   4.42.2. Degraded Modes of Processing. The SIFS Gang monitor must determine the level of
   degraded mode processing.
   4.42.3. Status Code A. When the system is down due to power failure, weather conditions,
   or major ADPE/software failure, SIFS processing will resume once the system becomes
   operational. If excessive downtime is expected, then users must coordinate with their host
   DMC for alternate processing procedures.
   4.42.4. Status Code B. When TIP processing is not available, use the SIFS stand-alone
   utilities for any SIFS processing that must be accomplished.
   4.42.5. Status Code C. If the SBSS database is not available, use the SIFS stand-alone
   utilities for any SIFS processing that must be accomplished.
   4.42.6. Degraded Operations Procedures. If each of the above conditions continue for an
   extended period of time, Degraded Operations procedures are most likely in effect. Any
   images that have to be sent out should be given to the SIFS gang monitor. Users should
   generate these images using either a standard text editor or and ASCII word processor. If a
   word processor, such as WORD for WINDOWS, WordPerfect, or WORDSTAR is used to
   generate data images, ensure that the file containing the data images are in plain ASCII
   format. Users may have to export the data images to an ASCII file to ensure there are no
 322                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   embedded control characters (i.e., tabs, carriage control characters, etc.).     Consult the
   appropriate word processing manual for steps to accomplish this

Section 4L—-SIFS Residue Processing

4.43. Overview. SIFS Residue files are designed to ensure that any Inbound/Outbound images
that could not be identified or dispatched are cleared in a timely manner. The SIFS Residue files
are extremely important and should be cleared as soon as possible. This section provides
detailed instructions on how to review and clear SIFS residue images from the files. Guidance is
also provided on how to prevent inbound and output images from being placed in residue hold.
4.44. SIFS Residue Records.
   4.44.1. General. The SIFS Residue files are created for each Inbound or Output file when a
   corresponding SIFS Control Record cannot be found. SIFS dispatch jobs form a CALC KEY
   which consists of both the SRAN and the TRIC or the SRAN and the Program Number
   (Batch). Using this CALC Key, Inbound and Output runs will make an attempt to fetch the
   corresponding SIFS Control Record. If the SIFS Control Record cannot be found, the image
   to be dispatched will be written to the appropriate Inbound or Output SIFS Residue file.
   4.44.2. Responsibilities. LGLOS is responsible for ensuring that all SIFS residue images are
   cleared as soon as possible. For management reasons, SIFS residue images are considered
   DELINQUENT after 24 hours and require immediate action. All SIFS Residue images will
   be reported on the SIFS EOD Report and will automatically be deleted if they are over 10
   days old.
4.45. Concept.
   4.45.1. Any records placed in residue will be reported on the SIFS EOD Report. LGLOS
   will review the Residue portion of the SIFS EOD Report to ensure users clear residue records
   in a timely manner. Any actions performed against the SIFS Residue Records will be
   reported by user-ID on the next SIFS EOD Report.
   4.45.2. Residue Records fall into the following general categories:
       4.45.2.1. Those images that belong to the SBSS, but SIFS did not know what to do with
       them because no corresponding SIFS Control Record was loaded.
       4.45.2.2. Those Materiel management images that do not belong to any account(s) at that
       base (misrouted data).
       4.45.2.3. Those images that do not belong to Materiel management (e.g., Medical
       Systems, Finance, etc.).
4.46. Miscellaneous.
   4.46.1. Users can view the SIFS Residue files at any time. See Para. 4.65 through Para.
   4.66 for more detailed information on IRD and ORD processing.
   4.46.2. The primary keys for transactions relating to the SIFS Residue are as follows:
       4.46.2.1. TRIC - for TIP images
       4.46.2.2. Program number - for Batch images
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                   323


      4.46.2.3. - see Inbound Residue Record Format -
      4.46.2.4. // inbound packet can be deleted or treated as a whole //
4.47. Clearing Residue Images.
   4.47.1. Inbound Residue Records (Applicable). Users must review the Inbound Residue
   data images very carefully (Utility option 12 ). If users determine that the residue records are
   good data images and that they apply to that base, then users should:
      4.47.1.1. Inquire the following records:
          4.47.1.1.1. SIFS Inbound Control Record. See Para 4.55.
          4.47.1.1.2. SIFS Inbound Equate Record. See Para 4.59.
      4.47.1.2. If these records are missing users need to load these records for the appropriate
      SRAN/TRIC. Once these actions have been completed and the new records have been
      validated, users can now clear that Inbound residue.
   4.47.2. Inbound Residue Records (nonapplicable). Once users have reviewed the Inbound
   Residue data images and decide that the data does NOT apply to that base, then users must
   further decide if the data is Supply or Non-Supply.
      4.47.2.1. Supply Data. If the data is Supply data, but does not apply to that base, then
      the user must contact the base that the data applies to.
      4.47.2.2. Non-Supply Data. If the data is not Supply data the user should return this data
      to the DMC ADRSS monitor as soon as possible. In both cases, users should try to
      determine why they received the wrong data. Users should have the DMC check their
      files. If all SIFS and ADRSS file are set-up correctly and you cannot determine who the
      data belongs to, call the DLATS help desk at DSN: 986-3564/3247.
      4.47.2.3. Output Residue Records. All Output Residue Records are applicable to that
      base. The vast majority of Output Residue Records are most likely missing an Output
      SIFS Control Record.
      4.47.2.4. Special Instruction for AN(x). If you receive TRIC AN(x) in the Inbound
      Residue file, follow the steps below:
      4.47.2.5. Separate all AN(x) images from residue and put them in another file.
      4.47.2.6. Sort AN(x) images by SRAN, positions 32-35.
      4.47.2.7. Save file(s) by SRAN.
      4.47.2.8. Create an AN9 header record for each packet.
      4.47.2.9. Send file back to DLATS for proper distribution.
      4.47.2.10. Special Instruction for ASH. If you receive TRIC ASH in the Inbound
      Residue file, delete these images from the residue file. The SBSS is not programmed to
      process TRIC ASH.
4.48. SIFS Programs.
   4.48.1. Purpose. To provide SBSS users with a quick reference of the programs used in the
   SIFS process.

4.55. Inbound SIFS Control Record Update.
     4.55.1. Purpose. To create and maintain the SIFS INBOUND-CONTROL record in a
     DMS/UDS TIP environment. SIFS programs will dispatch images arriving on base through
     DDN (that is, the ADRSS II (AA) system), based on the contents of this record.
     4.55.2. Input Processing. This data image may be input through TIP Screen 544, 051, or
     through pseudo processing (NGV221B).     Note: TIP screen 051 is normally used if there is
     an open DIREP against screen 544.
     4.55.3. Input Restrictions. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity /main system
     or any SBSS terminal and a valid user-ID/password. Users should also note that this TRIC
     (1JC) may be controlled locally through SBSS terminal security.
     4.55.4. Output. If the input is successful, there is no output; otherwise, one of the following
     reject/management notices is output: 001, 179, 712, 713, 714, or 799.
     4.55.5. Input Format and Entry Requirements.

1. Action Code (position 4). The action code identifies the type transaction to be performed:
        a. A - (A)dd new Inbound SIFS Control Record
        b. C - ©hange existing Inbound SIFS Control Record
        c. D - (D)elete existing Inbound SIFS Control Record
        d. I - (I)nquire Inbound SIFS Control Record

This field CANNOT be blank.
2. Inbound TRIC (positions 5-7). This field forms the first part of the 720-CALC-KEY. It is
used by any SIFS programs which need to fetch the Inbound SIFS Control Record. Users can
enter any inbound TRIC (that is, enter the TRIC/DIC for those data images that you normally
receive through BLAMES). See Ch 3 for a list of valid SBSS TRICs. This field CANNOT be
blank.
3. Inbound SRAN (positions 8-11). This field forms the second part of the 720-CALC-KEY. It is
used by any SIFS programs which need to fetch the Inbound SIFS Control Record. Users must
enter the numeric four-position SRAN as it appears on the 001 record (Base-Constants-1 Record,
see Ch 5). By default, the system designator/SRAN that your terminal is signed on to will be used
if this field is left blank.
4. Pseudo Load Flag (position 12). Enter a P in this position if you want inbound images with
this TRIC to be loaded to pseudo. Otherwise, leave this field blank.
5. OPR Code (positions 13-22). The OPR code identifies the owner of inbound images with this
TRIC. This code is printed on all significant transactions that affect this TRIC. Valid entries for
this field may include an office symbol (that is, LGRM, LGSD, etc.). This field CANNOT be
blank.
6. Data/Element Flag (position 23). This field identifies how the inbound images are stored in the
file specified in positions 30-54. The following are valid entries:
        a. E - (E)lement
         b. F - (F)ile overwrite (if this option is used, each time inbound images are written to the
file, they overwrite existing images.)
        c. A - (A)ppend (if this option is used, each time inbound images are written to the file,
they are added to the end of the file.)

Users should be consistent on the Data/Element Flag settings if the same file is specified for more
than one TRIC. This field CANNOT be blank if an entry was made in positions 24-48.
7. User File (Positions 24-48). Enter a valid qualifier*filename. If you want a copy of inbound

place an asterisk (*) in the field you want to blank.
2. Output TRIC (positions 5-7). This field forms the first part of the 721-CALC-KEY. It is used
by any SIFS program that needs to fetch the Output SIFS Control Record. Users can enter any
valid output SBSS TRIC. See Ch 3 for a list of valid SBSS TRICs. This field CANNOT be
blank.
3. Output SRAN (positions 8-11). This field forms the second part of the 721-CALC-KEY. It is
used by any SIFS programs that need to fetch the Inbound SIFS Control Record. Users must enter
the numeric four-position SRAN as it appears on the 001 record (for example, Base Constants-1
Record, see Ch 5). If this field is left blank, the system designator/SRAN that your terminal is
signed on to will be used by default.
4. Sequence Number (positions 12-13). The sequence number will stay constant 01.
5. Routing Type (position 14). Type routing identifies where the image will be directed:
(A)FEMS, (B)CAS, (D)AAS, OR (U)SER FILE. See Ch 2 for a list of valid SBSS TRICs. This
field CANNOT be blank.
6. Output Record Length (positions 15-17). Enter a three-position record length; otherwise, leave
blank. By default, a length of 080 is used. This field is extremely important when these data
images are going to be input to a batch report. For example, the record length for WLC output
data images is 047. If you do not specify 047 for WLC data images, a record length of 080 is
used. If a record length of 080 is used, the D38 report (Bin Label Output) will abort.
7. OPR Code (positions 18-27). The OPR code identifies the owner of the output images with
this TRIC. This code is printed on all significant transactions that affect this TRIC. Valid entry
for this field is the office symbol (for example, LGRM, LGSD, etc.). This field CANNOT be
blank.
8. User File Type (position 28). This field identifies how the output images are stored in the file
specified in positions 29-53. The following are valid entries:
       a. E - (E)lement
       b. F - (F)ile overwrite (if this option is used, each time output images are written to the file
they will overwrite existing images).
       c. A - (A)ppend (if this option is used, each time output images are written to the file they
are added to the end of the file.)

Users should be consistent on the Data/Element Flag settings if the same file is specified for more
than one TRIC. This field CANNOT be blank if an entry was made in positions 29-53.
9. User File (positions 29-53). Enter a valid Qualifier*filename. If you want a copy of the output
images with the TRIC specified in positions 5-7 to be placed in a file. READ/WRITE keys on the
file are NOT permitted. Also users must ensure that a PUBLIC file is specified. All SIFS
filenames should follow the format below. Note: SIFS creates this file if it does not already exist
on the system. This field CANNOT be blank if an entry is made in position 28.

10. Output File Size (positions 54-59). Enter the number of tracks desired on your output file.
The default size is 001000 tracks.
11. ADRSS Type Routing (position 60). Enter a D for DDN.
12. Reports Control Symbol (positions 61-74). The reports control symbol (RCS) identifies the
report to the receiving base. The receiving base will key on the RCS to identify the packet
arriving at that base. Note: The RCS cannot contain any special characters, embedded spaces, etc.
This field CANNOT be blank if you made an entry in position 68 (that is, ADRSS Bound) AND
position 69 is blank (that is, Non-DLATS routable data images). See AFP 700-16 for a complete
list of valid RCS codes (your Admin Office should have a copy of this manual). Leave this field
blank if you placed a Y in position 69 (DLATS Flag).
13. CIC (positions 75-79). The CIC is designed primarily for use by the receiving
communications terminal as an aid in determining the distribution of data messages. (That is, the
receiving Communications Center/DMC uses the CIC to identify the receiving activity of the
incoming data images. The Communications Center/DMC processes inbound data images for

information (that is, SRAN, RIC, etc.), this routing information is actually
contained within the TEXT HEADER for that inbound packet. In the case of
SNUD, this data is in the form of a SRAN and can be found in positions 68-
71 of the TEXT HEADER. USERS MUST load a 1JB using TRIC TEX with
start position 68, length 4, and type routing S.
        b. A Type Routing Identifier of N should be used for SNUD TRIC
codes which have an effective date. See section 4F for the list of SNUD
TRIC codes which have an effective date. If you enter an N in this field, the
Start Position of Field to Route On (positions 12-14) must contain the starting
position of the five-digit effective date. The Field Length flag (positions 17-
19) should contain 005, since this is the length of the ordinal date. If the
SNUD data image does NOT have an ordinal date, then enter 000 in this field.
6. Authorization Number (positions 81-95). This field is used to prevent user
from modifying SIFS control prior to receiving approval from AFMC SCM-R
Information Technology Activity. An authorization number is mandatory
when the Action Code on input is A, C, or D. This field can be blank when
using the inquire option.
4.60. Tip Output SIFS Data Image Dispatching.
   4.60.1. Purpose. To describe the logical flow of events during the dispatch of data images
   generated by TIP processing. Any images generated by an online TIP application program
   will be dispatched as follows:
       4.60.1.1. The application program calls the SIFS Master Dispatch Utility (program
       NGV250) and passes the output data image and additional information which SIFS will
       use to build a CALC key the applicable SIFS-OUTPUT-CONTROL record.
       4.60.1.2. Program NGV250 builds a 721-CALC-KEY to fetch the SIFS OUTPUT-
       CONTROL Record using the following information passed by the calling program:
           4.60.1.2.1. The TRIC of the image to be dispatched
           4.60.1.2.2. The SRAN (four numeric digits)
           4.60.1.2.3. Routing Flag. This flag is blank unless the data image is SPS-bound or
           AFEMS-bound. If the image is for SPS the flag will be B. If the image is for
           AFEMS, the flag will be A.
       4.60.1.3. If a 721-OUTPUT-CONTROL record cannot be found for the TRIC and SRAN
       in the CALC Key, SIFS will write the outbound image to the SIFS Outbound residue file.
       However, if the Routing Flag (position 8 of 721-CALC-Key) is an A, B, or D the image
       is automatically written to the SBSS database. Routing Flag A is written to an SIFS-
       AFEMS-OUTBOUND-IMAGE record, B is written to an SIFS-OUTBOUND-BCAS-
       IMAGE record, and D is written to an SIFS-DLATS-ADRSS record. If the data image to
       be dispatched belongs to a satellite account, SIFS will first attempt to fetch the output
       SIFS control record for that satellite. If there is a NO-FIND condition for the satellite
       account, then SIFS will next attempt to fetch the SIFS control record for the host (SD 01)
       account. If there is a NO-FIND condition for the 01 account, then SIFS will then write
       the output data image to the SIFS outbound residue file.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 351


         4.60.1.4. If the 721 record can be fetched using the 721-CALC-KEY, the control record
         is read and the output image is dispatched based on the contents of the control record.
         4.60.1.5. Control is then returned to the application program which is called NGV250.
4.61. SIFS Header Record Update
      4.61.1. Purpose. To create and maintain the SIFS header record in a DMS/UDS TIP
      environment. SIFS programs will use this record during data dispatch processes.
      4.61.2. Input Processing. This data image may be input via TIP screens 547, 051 or through
      pseudo processing (NGV221B).
      4.61.3. Input Restrictions. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity /Main system
      or any SBSS terminal and a valid user-ID/password.
      4.61.4. Output. If input is successful - NONE; otherwise, the following reject/management
      notices may be output: 001, 179, 712, 713, 799.

               4.69.2.1.9. BASE/DLSC INTE Note: DLSC, Defense Logistics Service Center is
               now DLIS, Defense Logistics Information Center.
         4.69.2.2. For each of the above SNUD packets, NGV230A will reformat the inbound
         SNUD data images to match those in Para. 4.68. Once the raw inbound SNUD data
         images have been reformatted, NGV230 will break the SNUD data images out by SRAN,
         then generate a SNUD dispatch run for each SRAN. This run will be placed in the
         inbound SIFS queue for processing.
         4.69.2.3. SNUD Dispatch Run. The purpose of the SNUD dispatch run is to allow for
         modular processing. The SNUD dispatch run will invoke NGV243 (Master SNUD
         Handler). NGV243 will examine the inbound SNUD data images and will perform the
         following function:
               4.69.2.3.1. Pass those SNUD images outlined in Para. 4.68. to pseudo for processing.
               4.69.2.3.2. Examine those SNUD data images with an effective date (see Para. 4.68.).
               If the effective date is equal to or less than 002-ORDINAL-DATE, then these images
               will be passed to pseudo for processing. If the effective date is greater than the
               current 002-ORDINAL-DATE, then these images will be retained on the SNUD-
               DATA-RECORD. This process will be repeated until all SNUD data have been
               processed.
4.70. Text Header (TEXHD) Record Format.
      4.70.1. Purpose. To describe the format of a text header (TEXHD) record. ADRSS will
      automatically generate the text header record when it processes reports for submission to the
      DDN network.
      4.70.2. Input Restrictions (ADRSS System). This image will be the first data image of each
      message group consisting of 496 data images or less. This data image is generated by
      ADRSS.

Notes:
1. The Security Classification is used to denote the classification of the report. Values allowed
for this field are U (unclassified) and E (unclassified, encrypt for transmission only). Supply data
will have a U in this field.
2. Special Handling Requirements. Supply data does not use this field.
3. The Privacy Act Data flag is used to identify data that applies to the Privacy Act of 1974.
Currently Supply does not transmit privacy act data. ADRSS will place a 1 (that is, NO) in this
field for Supply Data.
4. The Reports Control Symbol is a unique identifier used to identify the report. SIFS will use the
reports control symbol specified in the output SIFS control record. The reports control symbol is
specified by the sending activity. The receiving activity will keyin the reports control symbol to
identify the report. ADRSS will place the reports control symbol in positions 11 through 24 of the
TEXHD and TEXTR records. The RCS must NOT contain any embedded special characters (that
is, A through Z, 0 through 9, or punctuation characters). Reports control symbols can be found in
AFP 700-16.
5. Submission Type. Allowed values are: N (normal) and C (re-submission).
6. As-Of-Date.
7. Sequence Number. The sequence number (right justified with leading zeros) of the message
group of data if transmitted via DDN.

8. Record Item Length. This is the length of each record in the user file. The record length can
vary from 18 to 1200 ASCII characters.
9. The Blocking Factor will match the blocking factor of the user file. This is the number of
logical records in each physical record (block). This value will be at least 01. The product of the
blocking factor and the record length must not exceed 448 words.
10. The originator's MAJCOM code.
11. Supplemental From Information. SIFS will place the following information in this field as
follows:
         a. positions 1-4    = Originating SRAN
         b. position 5       = Blank
         c. positions 6-10 = NGVxxx (where xxx = program nbr that generated the report)

ADRSS will place this information in positions 51 through 63 of the TEXHD record.
12. MAJCOM TO. This will be the MAJCOM code of the command that has requested the data.
This field may be blank if the same data is multiple routed to more than one command, a text
header is designated for use with data forwarded to activity side of the Air Force, or if the
requesting MAJCOM has directed that it be blank.
13. Supplemental To Information.
4.71. Text Trailer (TEXTR) Record Format.
      4.71.1. Purpose. To describe the format of a text trailer (TEXTR) record. ADRSS will
      automatically generate the text trailer record when it processes reports for submission to the
      DDN network. Every data report requiring a text header must have a corresponding text
      trailer as the last message group prepared for the data report.
      4.71.2. Input Restrictions (ADRSS System). This image will be the last data image of each
      message group consisting of 496 data images or less. This data image is generated by
      ADRSS.

Notes:
1. Reserved. Information here will be the same information contained in the text header.
2. Total Record Count. This is the total number of logical records contained in the data report.
Text header/trailers that have been inserted by ADRSS for message building are NOT included.
3. Supplemental Remarks. This field can contain any remarks/additional data required, not
included in the text header to clarify the report.
4.72. Files Used By ADRSS.
   4.72.1. Purpose. To provide users with a consolidated list and brief description of files that
   are essential to ADRSS processing.               Each ADRSS file has a qualifier of
   0AA0<ALN><PLN>00. When talking to the Supply Systems Control Center, this format is
   often referred to as '0AA long qual' for brevity purposes.
   4.72.2. Files Essential to ADRSS Processing.

Table 4.28. Files Essential to ADRSS Processing.

FILE NAME                       FILE-ID        REMARKS/NOTES

DISN Trigger File               VAADTEU        Notes 1, 7
This is NOT a complete list. Only those files that concern Supply have
been listed.
Note:
1. The ADRSS Monitor at the DMC has responsibility for these files.
Any questions or problems regarding these files should be directed to the
ADRSS Monitor at the servicing DMC.
2. Master Control File. This file is the ADRSS master control record.
This file contains the start times for automatic ADRSS and some other
pertinent information.
3. Cumulative History File. This file may be maintained on disk or tape
depending upon local procedures. This file contains reports previously
processed by ADRSS. Reports are kept in this file according to the as-of-
date, retention period and current system date. Reports whose retention
has expired are deleted from this file. Maintenance on this file is
performed during each ADRSS run. New reports are added and expired
reports are deleted. ADRSS allows values from 0 to 45 (days) for a
 380                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


retention period. Supply Reports are normally held for 45 days. The
ADRSS monitor at the servicing DMC can retransmit any Supply reports
that have NOT been deleted from this file.
4. Trigger File. The trigger file contains trigger records. The trigger
records identify user data files to process and/or messages to retransmit.
For Supply traffic, the trigger records will normally be generated under
program control by the ADRSS monitor at the servicing DMC if it has the
capability to create, modify, or delete trigger records. The ADRSS
monitor should NOT modify a Supply trigger file without prior
coordination.
5. Report Information File. This file contains a table of all reports that are
normally processed at that site. ADRSS matches the six-position file-ID
of the report, the reports control symbol, content indicator code, and the
MAJCOM from Code of the ADRCTL submitted. Once a match is found,
then ADRSS uses the destination DMC code as a key to find the
appropriate DDN routing indicators. These DDN routing indicators are
used in message preparation.
6. Routing Control File. This file contains a table of ALN codes and their
associated ICI host-ID, DISN address, DDN routing indicators. As
outlined above, ADRSS uses this file to identify the appropriate DDN
routing indicators to use in preparing DDN messages. This file’s contents
are maintained through use of the screen utility subsystem (using the
“RTE” or “RTU” screens).
7. DISN Trigger File. This file contains records that identify the files
required to be transmitted via the DISN module of ADRSS. This file can
be created by either of two methods. One method is automatically created
by ADS program. The ADS program creates a new VAADTEU file
internally and in it builds a DISN Trigger record. The other method of
creating this file is through the ADRSS screen utilities (using the "DTE"
screen). The "DTE" screen will catalog a new VAADTEU file and build
records within that file from the entries on the screen. This file is read by
the DISN Module Driver (NAADRV) and deleted after its contents are
read. The contents of this file are passed to the DISN Transmission
Module (NAAXMT) by NAADRV.
4.73. Sending Data By Alternate Means.
   4.73.1. Purpose. To provide users with a brief description of the minimum requirements
   when sending data by means other than ADRSS.
   4.73.2. General. This describes the minimum requirements for output data forwarded from
   the sending location using commercial mail and package carriers, First Class mail, or pouch.
   Magnetic tape, floppy disks, and listings are the media used to forward data via mail or
   courier.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                381


   4.73.3. Magnetic Tapes. When magnetic tapes are used, they must have an adhesive-back
   label affixed that can be removed easily when the tape is released. At a minimum the label
   will contain:
      4.73.3.1. RCS (or some other unique report identifier).
      4.73.3.2. As-of-date.
      4.73.3.3. Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually
      unclassified data).
      4.73.3.4. Number of Reels (that is, reel 1 of 3, reel 2 of 3, etc.)
      4.73.3.5. Track and density.
      4.73.3.6. Point of contact and DSN number of the sending base. The tape monitor at the
      servicing DMC should be able to assist you in preparing a tape for transmission.
   4.73.4. Floppy Disk. When floppy disks are used, data reports will be placed on the floppy
   disk in a manner to preclude individual reports from getting combined due to possible
   mishandling of the floppy. Each floppy must have an adhesive-back label. At a minimum
   the label will contain:
      4.73.4.1. RCS (or some other unique report identifier).
      4.73.4.2. As-of-date.
      4.73.4.3. Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually
      unclassified data).
      4.73.4.4. Number of disks (that is, disk 1 of 3, disk 2 of 3, etc.)
      4.73.4.5. Point of Contact and DSN number of the sending base. Note: If the label is
      already affixed to the floppy disk, don't forget to use a fiber-tipped pen when preparing
      the label. A ball-point pen may damage the floppy disk.
   4.73.5. Listings. When a listing is used, it must be clearly annotated with at least the
   following data:
      4.73.5.1. RCS (or some other unique report identifier - may already be on listing).
      4.73.5.2. As-of-date.
      4.73.5.3. Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually
      unclassified data).
      4.73.5.4. Number of listings (that is, listing 1 of 3, listing 2 of 3, etc.)
      4.73.5.5. Point of contact and DSN number of the sending base.
   4.73.6. Miscellaneous. Your servicing DMC should be able to assist you concerning
   policies or requirements when sending data by other than ADRSS.
4.74. Defense Data Network.
   4.74.1. Purpose. To describe the Defense Data Network.
 382                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   4.74.2. General. The Defense Data Network (DDN) is a packet-switching network designed
   to meet the data communications requirement of the DOD. The elements of the network are
   grouped into two functional areas:
       4.74.2.1. The backbone network, which comprises the trunk circuits and packet switches.
       4.74.2.2. The access network, which comprises circuits and equipment that enable
       subscriber systems to connect to the backbone network. Packet-switching is a method for
       handling data as it is transmitted through a communications network. The switching to
       which subscriber computers are attached subdivide information streams into small
       packets, then route and otherwise, handle each packet as if it were a separate message,
       correctly reassembling the packet data at its destination. Each switching to receiving a
       packet from a neighbor node checks for errors and, should an error be found, requests
       retransmission from the neighbor until the data is received correctly. The node then
       either forwards the packet to another node or delivers the packets to the addressee.
       Unlike DDN, DDN uses adaptive packet-switching. This means that data packets are
       routed adaptively instead of using predetermined paths. With predetermined routing,
       data cannot be easily forwarded if any network component fails in the path over which
       the data must pass. With adaptive routing, switching nodes avoid portions of the network
       that are congested or damaged. Packet-switching allows a real-time access to any node in
       the world (that is, can use a terminal input just like it was on the same base. However, do
       not abuse the system; you will be held accountable).
4.75. TRICs used by SPS.
   4.75.1. Purpose. To provide users with a list of those TRICs that can be transferred to, and
   received from, the SPS.

                   OVERVIEW OF THE SBSS DATABASE RECORDS

Section 5A—-SBSS Database Records

5.1. Chapter Summary. This chapter provides the formats for all SBSS database records. Sec.
5A describes the organization of these files and explains the record description entries. Ch 6 -
14 provide the purpose, access, record length, and specific record description entry for each
database record. Each chapter covers one group of related records. The formats of the basic
records are contained in Ch 6. Ch 7 provides the formats for entry/basic records. The formats
for the detail records ( Ch 8), the accounting and finance records ( Ch 9), the fuels records ( Ch
10), the general support records ( Ch 11), the management support records ( Ch 12), the tape
records ( Ch 13), and the transaction history records (Ch 14), make up the rest of this chapter.
5.2. Overview. This chapter contains the formats of the internal records stored in the SBSS
database and on tape under the Standard Base Supply System. It also defines the types of record
description entries used. Note: The database records are required. They may not be altered
except as permitted under program control with an authorized input. The techniques used to
locate all SBSS database records are contained in Ch 3.
5.3. U2200/400 SBSS Database.
   5.3.1. Definition of the Database. The SBSS database is a network of hierarchically
   structured records appropriately associated. The association allows for base-level update or
   retrieval of data as required by HQ USAF. The SBSS database is a SPERRY DMS-1100
   database following Conference for Data Systems Language (CODASYL) Worldwide
   Standards Committee specifications. It is defined by a schema and one or more subschemas.
   The schema and subschema make up a set of tables that contain the computer code necessary
   for programs to gain access to the database. The Data Definition Language (DDL) processor
   (SPERRY UP-7907 Data Management System (DMS 1100) Level 8R1, Schema Definition,
   Data Administrator) describes the characteristics of the entire database. Through the use of
   the data contained in the parentheses, the DDL creates the schema.
   5.3.2. Organization of the Database. The construction of the database provides the ability to
   partition related records and sets. The database allows maximum flexibility in the acquisition
   and placement of data with a minimum amount of time and storage requirements. The
   database is currently divided into 257 areas, 236 records (of which 160 are base level and 96
   are for AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity , and 50 sets for each LRS host
   account. Each area contains one or more types of records as shown in the schema. The
   SBSS record types are grouped into nine categories. (These are described in Ch 6 - 14.)
   5.3.3. Storage Requirements. Due to variance in record occurrence and hardware
   configurations from base to base, the size of the areas is tailored to meet each base's needs.
   The minimum and maximum disk storage are changed to meet individual base needs at the
   time of the system generation or upload. The SBSS database requires a minimum disk
   storage of 1,420,720 words and a maximum disk storage of 20,950,160 words.
   5.3.4. Labeling/Tagging Conventions. Each record identified in the schema is assigned a
   unique record code. The SBSS uses three characters for record code assignments. All data
 386                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   elements within each record use the record code as the first three characters for identification
   purposes.
   5.3.5. Creation of Subschemas. The creation of subschemas limits a user's view of the
   database to subsets of the areas, records, sets, and data names described by the schema. The
   subschemas provide a description of the views of the database. The use of a subschema
   provides important protection for sensitive information and permits access to only as much of
   the database as the user is permitted to see. The subschema is created by the subschema Data
   Definition Language (SDDL) processor (SPERRY UP-8505 Data Management System
   (DMS 1100) Level 8R1, Subschema Definition).
   5.3.6. Schema/Subschema Identification. The SBSS absolute schema is identified as SBSS-
   SCHEMA and resides in a file called DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA. The SBSS absolute
   subschemas also reside in file DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.
       5.3.6.1. EXAMPLES: The absolute schema DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.SBSS-
       SCHEMA allows the users to access the entire SBSS database. The subschema
       DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.SBSS-QLP1 allows access only to records residing on
       Gang 1.

                                          Chapter 6

                                  CONSTANT RECORDS

6.1. Overview. This chapter describes and contains the formats for the basic records used in the
computer. Note: The database records are required. They may not be altered except as
permitted under program control with an authorized input.
6.2. Record Description Entry.
   6.2.1. Level Numbers. The first items of a record description entry are the level numbers.
   The 01 level number indicates that the item is a record. Levels 02, 03, 04, 05, etc., are used
   for subdivisions of group related record items.
   6.2.2. Data Name or FILLER. Each item in the record description entry must contain either
   a data name or the reserved word FILLER (formerly = blank). The data name refers to the
   name of the storage area that contains the data. It does not refer to a particular value. The
   item referred to may assume numerous values during the execution of the program. The
   reserved word FILLER may be used in place of a data name.
   6.2.3. Independent Clauses. Each record description entry may consist of one or more
   clauses that provide information about the data item. The most commonly used clauses are
   picture (PIC), usage computational (USAGE IS COMP), and occurs (OCCURS) clauses.
       6.2.3.1. Picture (PIC) clauses specify the general characteristics and the detail
       description of a basic item. The clause tells how many characters describes the types of
       characters through the use of various symbols.
           6.2.3.1.1. PIC X(05). In this example, the X stands for one character of any kind
           (alpha, numeric, special characters, or space). The (05) means that a five-character
           combination may be present in this field. It represents the length of the field.
           6.2.3.1.2. PIC 9(05). In this example, the 9 stands for one decimal position. Each
           nine in these clauses represents one decimal position. (For the (05) meaning, see
           paragraph above.)
           6.2.3.1.3. PIC S9(05). In this example, the S indicates that the number has an
           operational sign. An operational sign tells the computer that the number is negative
           or positive. (For the 9(05) meaning, see above.)
       6.2.3.2. Usage computational (USAGE IS COMP) clauses specify computational
       clauses. All values in a computational clause represent values to be used in arithmetic
       operations. The values must be numeric. Computational clauses may be written at any
       level.
       6.2.3.3. OCCURS clauses specify the number of times an item is repeated with no
       change in its usage or picture clauses. In addition, occurs clauses are used to define
       tables, matrixes, and other sets of data whose elements can be referred to by subscription
       or indexing.
6.3. Base Constants-1 Record (001).
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                395


   6.3.1. Purpose. To establish and maintain the BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record. These records
   are created by the computer support base LGLO. Satellite accounts must coordinate their
   changes to this record with their CSB. The BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record provides the
   constant data unique to each CSB operation. Most application and utility programs in the
   SBSS use these constants. Data elements in this record must be current at all times. The
   necessary file maintenance is accomplished by input of TRIC CON. See Ch 2.
      6.3.1.1. Access. Only one of these records appears in the SBSS database and is accessed
      in a direct mode. The two parameters that must be initialized before accessing this record
      are as follows:
          6.3.1.1.1. CON-1-KEY.
          6.3.1.1.2. SUPRT-AREA-NAME. Note:       The BASE-CONSTANTS-KEY is
          contained in the SUPPORT-AREA-KEYS record (015-RT-001). It consists of the
          following:
             6.3.1.1.2.1. PAGE-NUM (4)
             6.3.1.1.2.2. RECORD-NUM (1)
      6.3.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 179 words and resides in the
      SUPPORT-GV area of the SBSS database.
   6.3.2. Record Description. The description of the BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record as it
   appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

05 006-PRINT-FLAG                                     PIC X(01)
Note:
1. The action flag is a method of programming to ensure that specific actions are taken at the time of
reject. When a reject occurs, the input and the phrase appear on the input terminal. Additional printing
and action occurs as follows:
        a. X (32) bit = Print the reject on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console.
        b. 2 bit = An internal suspense record is to be established for the input.
       c. 4 bit = All records thus far updated as a result of this input are to be restored to their original
condition.
2. The data location flag specifies the location of additional data to be printed. The number of characters
that can be assembled for printing on the printer or terminal in each area is restricted to 80. For the
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console, the number of characters may not exceed 60
for offline processing or 72 characters inline. The data location flags are as follows:
        a. 1 bit = Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-1.(reject) or MGT (management).
        b. 2 bit = Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-2.
        c. 4 bit = Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-3.
        d. 8 bit = Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-4.
3. The transaction identification code must always be REJ (reject) or (management).

4. The REJ/MGT phrase message is restricted to 49 characters during end-of-day processing.
5. The format of the management notices are identical to notes 3 and 4 except the characters MGT are
the first three positions of the message. This signifies the difference between the reject and management
notice when they are printed.
6.9. Routing Identifier Record (007).
   6.9.1. Purpose. To serve as a data documentation record. The ROUTING-IDENTIFIER
   record documents processing that has occurred between the base and the support agency to
   which requisitions are forwarded. The ROUTING-IDENTIFIER record is established and
   maintained at base level.
       6.9.1.1. Access. The DMR uses the DMS-1100 supplied randomization routine,
       DMSCALC, as the prime path to access a ROUTING-IDENTIFIER record. The keys
       required by the DMSCALC routine are as follows:
           6.9.1.1.1. 007-CALC-KEY. This key contains the following:
               6.9.1.1.1.1. Positions 1-3 = ROUTNG-IDNTFYR
               6.9.1.1.1.2. Positions 4-5 = SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR
           6.9.1.1.2. RID-AREA-NAME.
       6.9.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 72 words and resides in the
       MISC-GV area of the SBSS database.
   6.9.2. Record Description. The description of the ROUTING-IDENTIFIER record as it
   appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

Notes:
1. The eight (8) occurrences of the 007-PRIORITY-GROUP-ONE field are used to accumulate the
number of receipts. Each field represents a range of days. When a receipt is processed for priority-
group-one the appropriate field is incremented by one based on the actual time between date of
requisition and date of receipt 13-15).
2. The nine (9) occurrences for the 007-PRIORITY-GROUP-TWO field are used to accumulate the
number of receipts. Each field represents a range of days. When a receipt is processed for priority-
group-two the appropriate field is incremented by one based on the actual time between date of
requisition and date of receipt.
3. The eleven (11) occurrences for the 007-PRIORITY-GROUP-THREE field are used to accumulate
the number of receipts. Each field represents a range of days. When a receipt is processed for priority-
group-three, the appropriate field is incremented by one based on the actual time between date of
requisition and date of receipt.
4. The four occurrences for the 007-OST-STANDARD, 007-BYPASS-UPDATE-FLAG, 007-NBR-OF-

         a. (1) Priority-Group-One
         b. (2) Priority-Group-Two
             (1) The 007-OST-STANDARD occurrence two (2) is used to store the median value for
DLA depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply, and that value is stored as follows:

         Positions 1-2 = Median for priority groups 1 and 2 combined.
         Position 3    = zero (0)
         Positions 4-5 = Median for priority group 3
         c. (3) Priority-Group-Three
         d. (4) Airlift Investment

7.3. Item-Record Record (101).
   7.3.1. Purpose. To permit, when coupled with all the detail records, a truly random length,
   flexible record with sufficient data to manage most items under nearly all circumstances.
   Separate records are maintained for all equipment and supply items on which accountability
   must be maintained. This record is addressable by stock number or document number and,
   by using the stock number randomization technique, the record is deleted, located, and/or
   relocated at the time of load or stock number change. AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8,
   addresses the item records as they are located, changed, and deleted.
      7.3.1.1. Access. The DMR utilizes the DMS-1100 supplied randomization routine,
      DMSCALC, to access an ITEM-RECORD record. The keys required by the DMSCALC
      routine are as follows:
 442                                                   AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


          7.3.1.1.1. 101-CALC-KEY.
             7.3.1.1.1.1. National stock number CALC key is as follows:
                 7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Positions 1-2 = 101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR
                 7.3.1.1.1.1.2. Position 3 = 5th Position of stock number
                 7.3.1.1.1.1.3. Positions 4-5 = '**'
                 7.3.1.1.1.1.4. Positions 6-13 = Positions 6-13 of stock number
             7.3.1.1.1.2. L & P stock number CALC key is as follows:
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.1. Positions 1-2 = 101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.2. Position 3 = 5th Position of stock number
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.3. Positions 4-5 = Positions 14-15 of stock number
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.4. Position 6 = 6th Position of stock number
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.5. Positions 7-8 = Positions 12-13 of stock number
                 7.3.1.1.1.2.6. Positions 9-13 = Positions 7-11 of stock number
          7.3.1.1.2. ITMDTL-AREA-NAME.
       7.3.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 55 words and resides in the
       ITMDTL-GV area of the SBSS database.
   7.3.2. Record Description. The description of the ITEM-RECORD record as it appears in
   the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

Notes:
1. The unit price for items with type account code P (AVFUELS) is reflected as five-position dollars,
two-position cents, and three-position mills (that is, $$$$$CCMMM) for basic item record only. The -9
(dash 9) fuels record and all other account item records unit prices are reflected as eight-position dollars
and two-position cents (that is, $$$$$$$$CC).
2. For item records in the B account (type stock record account B), the field is as follows:
       a. For repair cycle items (ERRCD XD/XF), this field contains the maintenance priority code
(code 3, 4, 7, C, L, or T).
        b. For economic order quantity (EOQ) items (ERRCD XB), this field contains the stockage
priority code (code 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, B, C, D, or E).
         c. For EOQ items (ERRCD XB) which are authorized to bypass MACR controls, this field is
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     447


identified by code J, K, L, M, /, S, T, or U. This code is assigned by external control.
       d. For item records in the P account (type stock record account P), this field contains the materiel
category code (code A, G, or L).
        e. For item records in account E (type stock record account E), this field is updated but has no
effect on requirements except for code E in the equipment account. Code E suppresses automatic due-
out release.
        f. Stockage Priority Code (SPC) will change to 0 under program control when processing a
backorder or upgrading to a MICAP with a UND 1, / or J and the demand level equals 0, budget code 8
or 9, ‘XB’ assets. The (SPC) will also change to 0 under program control when processing a backorder
with a UJC of ‘AR’ for budget code 8, ‘XB’ assets when the demand level is equal to 0.
3. If the type stock record account code is K, the first position of the application code is either an N or an
R. The N or R denotes whether or not the item is subject to daily Ammunition Reporting Management
System (ARMS) reporting.
4. In the equipment account, the last position is the equipment management code.
5. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for a detailed explanation of these fields.
6. This field is used to store the computer code on the item record. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for
the specific codes.
7. An * (asterisk) appearing in the first position of the nomenclature field indicates that the ERRCD has
been changed as a result of special authority being granted prior to cataloging action. The Department of
Defense Item Code (DODIC) will appear in the first four positions of the nomenclature if, 1) the item has
a type account code K, 2) the first position of the application code is an R (subject to daily ARMS
reporting). EXCEPTION: If the first position of the nomenclature contains an * (asterisk), then the
DODIC will appear in the next four positions.
8. This field will determine the appropriate routing identifier record to be updated when processing
requisitions, status, or cancellations, as follows:

11. This field is used for multiple purposes. (See
AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for specific program
control flag.)
12. For the specific acquisition advice codes (see
AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2).
13. An R in this field indicates that the item requires
releveling. Otherwise, this field contains the first
character of the date of the last releveling.
14. For marginal analysis items, this date is the
marginal analysis level computation date. For all
other items, the date of releveling will be the
requisition date.
15. Mission Impact Code (MIC) will change to 0
under program control when processing a backorder
or upgrading to a MICAP with a UND 1, / or J and
the demand level equals 0, budget code 8 or 9, ‘XF’
assets. The (MIC) will also change to 0 under
program control when processing a backorder with a
UJC of ‘AR’ for budget code 8, ‘XF’ assets when the
demand level is equal to 0.
16. The 101-DATE-SPC-5-ASG contains the ordinal
date when the 101-STOCKAGE-PRIORITY-CODE
was assigned. This field is updated for all ERRCD
XB items when the 101-STOCKAGE-PRIORITY-
CODE is changed. This date is referred to as the
serviceable asset retention start date (SARD)--start
date for measuring activity for retention/disposal
actions. It is assigned to ERRCD XF items when
there is no demand activity for two consecutive
quarters.
17. XCE date for all XD stock numbers with at least
one demand and no RBL loaded in the SBSS. This
field is updated if the date stored in the field is older
than 90 days from current Julian date. A new DIC
XCE is generated if the condition still exists. This
field is blanked when a DIC XCA is received for this
item.
18. Local Purchase Flag is set under program control
to 0 (zero) when loading item record with Routing
Identifier (RID) equal to JBB, JBF, JBG, JBH, JBK,
JBL, or JBI. This will identify those items that
require a DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item

Form), for the first time requisitioning action. This
flag is set to 1 (one) by the status programs when
status is received indicating the requisition was
received by SPS.
19. The 101-SRD-COLLECTION-FLAG equals ‘1’
if a transaction processed with SRD NOT equal to
Z**; AND TRIC = DOC, DUO, ISU, MSI, TIN, OR
TRN; AND TYPE-ORG-CODE = 7, 8, 9, D, G, I, Q,
OR V. Otherwise, the field will be ‘0’.
20. The 101-FORECAST-ACQUISITION-COST
stores the JCS/contingency project flag and
JCS/contingency project code assigned to a given
stock number.
21. The Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel
(NWRM) Indicator identifies an NSN as NWRM and
the value is “Q”. The code shall be pushed from
D043 through D071.
7.4. Repair Cycle Record (102).
   7.4.1. Purpose. To record automatically any time an item with ERRCD XD or XF is added
   to the computer, or when the ERRCD on a nonrepair cycle item is changed to XD or XF.
   The record is automatically deleted any time a repair cycle type item record is deleted, or the
   ERRCD is changed to other than XD or XF. When the stock number on a repair cycle item
   is changed, the stock number on this record is also changed. The data stored on this record
   are used for computing stock control levels. The quarterly data are shifted or blanked by
   report Q04. Data on the repair cycle record are updated by the issue, turn-in, releveling, and
   adjustment routines.
       7.4.1.1. Access. The REPAIR-CYCLE record participates as a member of the ITEM-R-
       C set, whose owner is the ITEM-RECORD record. Access is through the ITEM-R-C set.
       The keys required by the DMSCALC routine area are as follows:
           7.4.1.1.1. 102-STOCK-NUMBER.
           7.4.1.1.2. REPCYC-AREA-NAME.
       7.4.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 52 words and resides in the
       REPCYC-GV area of the SBSS database.
   7.4.2. Record Description. The description of the REPAIR-CYCLE record as it appears in
   the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

111, the SBSS programs will display this field as blank. CAUTION: If the Query Language Processor
(QLP-1100) and/or direct retrieval of SBSS database record data is used, extreme caution must be used.
On a new item load (FIL), ‘100’ is stored in this field. This will be updated during releveling to ‘111’.
7.5. Document Number Record (103).
   7.5.1. Purpose. To provide an alternate access path to the AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-
   DETAIL record and the detail records.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                453


         7.5.1.1. Access. The DMR uses the DMS-1100 supplied randomization routine,

7.6. Interchangeable And Substitute Group Record (105).
   7.6.1. Purpose. To provide for the relating of different items that may be used to satisfy a
   requirement. The issue routine uses the record in an attempt to satisfy a requested quantity
   when the balance on the requested item is insufficient. Items coded master (M) or
   interchangeable (I) are issued automatically while other codings provide only an asset
   printout for an external decision. The record is established for an external decision. At base
   level it is established, changed, and deleted by using file maintenance procedures. See AFH
   23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for an explanation of ISG records.
       7.6.1.1. Access. The INTERCHANGE-SUBSTITUTE-GROUP record is accessed
       through a DMS-1100, DMSCALC, randomization routine. The two parameters that must
       be initialized before accessing the record are as follows:
          7.6.1.1.1. 105-ISG-NBR.
          7.6.1.1.2. ISG-AREA-NAME.         Note: The INTERCHANGE-SUBSTITUTE-
          GROUP record is also the owner record of the ISG-ITEM set. The member record in
          this set is the ITEM-RECORD record.
       7.6.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 145 words and resides in the ISG-
       GV area of the SBSS database.
   7.6.2. Record Description. The description of the INTERCHANGE-SUBSTITUTE-
   GROUP record as it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as

                                    DETAIL RECORDS

8.1. Overview. This chapter describes and contains the formats for the detail records. Notes:
1. The database records are required. They may not be altered except as permitted under
program control with an authorized input.    2. The term Defense Business Operations Fund
(DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever
DBOF is used in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output. The term
will be updated upon system programmatic updates.
8.2. Authorized In-Use Detail Record (201).
   8.2.1. Purpose. To provide a record for Equipment Management when it is determined that
   an equipment item is authorized to a particular activity. The record provides for complete
   reporting and of all in-use assets and authorizations. These records are located within the
   AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAIL-RECORD area.
       8.2.1.1. Access. The AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAIL record participates as a member
       of the ITEM-ATHINU set, whose owner is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-
       ATHINU set, whose owner is the DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary access path is
       through the ITEM-ATHINU set. An alternate path is available through the DOCN-
       ATHINU set. The keys required by the DMSCALC routine are as follows:
          8.2.1.1.1. 201-STOCK-NUMBER.
          8.2.1.1.2. ATHINU-AREA-NAME.
       8.2.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 28 words and resides in the
       ATHINU-GV area of the SBSS database.
   8.2.2. Record Description. The description of the AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAIL record
   as it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

8.3. Due-In Detail Record (202).
   8.3.1. Purpose. To record (other than for fuels) information from the original requisition that
   is required for follow-up and/or base management. A due-in detail is established for each
   requisition submitted. When the total due-in balance is required, program control adds
   quantities on due-in detail records to provide a net asset position. In addition to the quantity
   of an item due-in and the requisition number, the due-in detail also is used to compute price
   variances and pipeline time during processing of the receipt. A due-in detail is established
   under program control when an automatic requisition is made. Action must be taken to load
   a due-in detail when a requisition is initiated offline while the SBLC is down or in a
   Degraded Operations situation.
       8.3.1.1. The record is automatically eliminated when a receipt for the quantity due-in is
       processed. In addition, a due-in detail may be cancelled by an input. The request for
       cancellation is submitted to the appropriate supply source. When this is accomplished, a
       record of the request for cancellation is also established as a detail in the computer.
       When it is necessary to analyze the due-in details, it is also necessary to determine if a
       cancellation request has been submitted. When the source of supply acknowledges
       cancellation, an input automatically causes cancellation. Due-ins are not cancelled
       automatically when in an excess position.
       8.3.1.2. The fuels DUE-IN DETAIL record contains information from the original
       requisition (1PR). A due-in detail is established for each 1PR input. The due-in detail is
       automatically deleted when a 1RP (fuels receipt) is input for the actual quantity due-in or
       if the input 1RP contains a final receipt flag (position 53 = F). The due-in detail may be
       cancelled by processing a 1PC (fuels cancellation). (Notes 10-14 below, apply to fuels
       account P only.)
   8.3.2. Access. The DUE-IN-DETAIL/fuels due-in detail record is a member of the ITEM-
   DTLS set, whose owner record is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-DTLS set,
   whose owner is the DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is through the ITEM-
   DTLS set and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.
   8.3.3. Size And Location. This fixed record length is 24 words and resides in the ITMDTL-
   GV area of the SBSS database.
   8.3.4. Record Description. The description of the DUE-IN-DETAIL record as it appears in
   the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

cancellation request.
       b. 9--The due-in was linked to a due-out which has been
cancelled.
       c. R--This is a special requirement.
       d. S--The due-in is for a UJC AR/BR due-out.
       e. T--This is a CFOSS requirement.
       f. OTHER ALPHA--These indicate ISSL/mission change
requirements (flag 2-8 or A-Q).
12. A 1 in this position indicates SPS.
13. For reportable MICAP conditions, this field contains an N or
F followed by the appropriate UJC.
8.4. DIFM Detail Record (203).
   8.4.1. Purpose. To identify items for control and reporting purposes which are physically
   located in maintenance, or for which a due-out exists. The DIFM detail records with DIFM
   status flag zero, with the exception of UR exhibits, are considered as on-hand assets for stock
   leveling computation. The DIFM detail record is established automatically under program
   control when a repair cycle item is either issued or backordered on a recurring or
   nonrecurring basis. The DIFM detail record is deleted or updated at the time the item is
   turned in either condemned, reparable (NRTS) or as a serviceable item. The only other
   means by which the DIFM detail record is eliminated is by canceling the due-out detail
   record and/or using the inventory adjustment procedures.
       8.4.1.1. Access. The DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE-DETAIL record is a member
       of the ITEM-DTLS set, whose owner record is ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-
       DTLS set, whose owner is the DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is through
       the ITEM-DTLS set and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.
       8.4.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 28 words and resides in the
       ITMDTL-GV area of the SBSS database.
   8.4.2. Record Description. The description of the DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE-
   DETAIL record as it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as
   follows:

Notes:
1. The DIFM status flags are as follows:
         a. 0--The quantity due-in is firm.
         b. 1--A due-out with the possibility of delayed turn-in action.
         c. 2--A due-out for which the exchange item has already been turned in.
2. If the 203-REPAIR-RETURN-FLAG field contains an R, the last 12 positions of the document
number from positions 69-80 of the original issue request are shown in the 203-PREVIOUS-DIFM-
STATUS through 203-WORK-UNIT-CODE and 203-SRD fields. This is where the document number is
reflected on the 203 detail at the repair location.
3. A P in this position indicates that item record number of demands has been updated for this detail as a
result of turn-in or due-out cancellation action.
4. This field contains the last two characters of the routing identifier code of the activity that generated
the reparable when the asset was generated at an off-base activity.
5. For contract maintenance details, this position is blank or contains the equipment authorized inventory
data (EAID) flag. If the reparable was generated by a lateral base, this position contains a Q. When the
detail is created as a result of an issue from a WRM or MRSP detail (including activity code C,
functional check), this position contains an H for high priority mission support kit (HPMSK) assets or a
W for all other WRM/MRSP assets.
6. When the first position of the MAJCOM-CODE is blank, internal logic equates it to 0; an octal 1
equates to 4. (The first five bits of the first position of the MAJCOM-CODE are reserved for future use.)
7. For type organization code G, V, I, 7, 8, and 9 or when the last position of the UJC is R, the field
contains the actual command code from the input or the organization record.
8. This field reflects the total delayed maintenance/AWP days accumulated against this item. A flag is
stored in the low order position of this field indicating that these days are to be subtracted from the total
repair cycle days.

9. For Maintenance (J Activity Code) this field contains the Job Control Number.
10. This field contains the JOCAS number for JOCAS organizations.
11. This field contains the 201 document number of the shipping activity and will have an activity code
of E for equipment or P for supplies.
8.5. Unserviceable Detail Record (204).
   8.5.1. Purpose. To identify items that are physically located in supply stock in unserviceable
   condition or Deficiency Report exhibit items located in Maintenance. The unserviceable
   detail record is established automatically under program control when an unserviceable asset
   is picked up on the CSB accountable records. The unserviceable detail record is updated or
   deleted at the time the asset is shipped/transferred or issued to Maintenance for repair. The
   only other means by which the unserviceable detail record will be reduced in quantity or
   eliminated is by inventory adjustment procedures.
       8.5.1.1. Access. The UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL record is a member of the ITEM-
       DTLS set, whose owner record is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-DTLS set,
       whose owner is DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is through the ITEM-
       DTLS set and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.
       8.5.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 20 words and resides in the
       ITMDTL-GV area of the SBSS database.
   8.5.2. Record Description. The description of the DIFM-UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL
   record as it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

Notes:
1. The first six positions of the 204-DOCUMENT-NBR field contains activity code R, organization code
920, and shop code RW.
2. The DEMAND-CODE field always contains an N.
3. The 204-STATUS-FLAG field is always 0.
4. This field contains the last two characters of the routing identifier of the activity that generated the
reparable when the asset was generated at an off-base activity.
5. The 204-TYPE-ORG-CODE field contains a Q when the asset was generated at an off-base activity.
6. This field contains the seven-position ammunition disposition request number (AFK account only).
7. Deficiency Report follow-up date or blank.
Flight Service Center personnel will process deficiency report to include latent defects turn-ins for items
with ERRCDs XD, XF, and XB. Equipment Management personnel will prepare turn-in documentation
for Deficiency Report to include latent defects on equipment managed items.
8. If a warehouse location is assigned, the letter W appears in the first position followed by the location.
If no warehouse location has been assigned, these positions are blank.
9. The UNSERVICEABLE-STATUS-CODE field reflects the status of the unserviceable asset as
follows:

Table 8.6. Unserviceable Status Code.

STATUS        DESCRIPTION
A             This code does not appear on the unserviceable detail record but is recorded
              on the transaction history record when the asset is automatically
              shipped/transferred under program control.
 474                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


C            Condemned/waived. This status is assigned when the turn-in reflects
             maintenance action taken code 9 (condemned) and the item record reflects
             ERRCD codes XD1/XD2 and a unit price of $300 or more. Code C
             indicates that the condemned item has been reported for disposition
             instructions. The report date is entered in the DISPOS-REQUEST-ADR-
             DATE field of the unserviceable detail record. Status code C is also
             assigned to the unserviceable detail to reflect receipt of condemned XB3
             assets (supply condition code H) for TRM action.
D            Reported for disposition instructions. This status is assigned when the
             supply condition code is F or G and the item has been reported for
             disposition instructions. The report data are entered in the DISPOS-
             REQUEST-ADR-DATE field of the unserviceable detail record.
H            Held for maintenance action. This status is assigned when the input TEX
             code is 1 (do not ship or report). It is also assigned when the turn-in or
             condition change reflects condition code G (incomplete), or condition code
             H (held in stock).
U            This status is assigned when the item is a Deficiency Report exhibit or when
             a condition code change (FCC) is processed from serviceable to supply
             condition J (suspended in stock).
10. Deficiency Report control number or blank. This field is updated by the input of
TRIC DFM. See Note 7.
8.6. Due-Out Detail Record (205).
    8.6.1. Purpose. To maintain a record when the on-hand asset position is less than the
    quantity requested. The record is eliminated when the asset has been released or by
    cancellation action.
       8.6.1.1. Access. The DUE-OUT-DETAIL record is a member of the ITEM-DTLS set,
       whose owner record is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-DTLS set, whose
       owner is DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is through the ITEM-DTLS set
       and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.

8.7. Excess Report Detail Record (206).
    8.7.1. Purpose. To maintain a record when the on-hand stock position is determined to be in
    excess. The EXCESS-REPORT-DETAIL record is established by program control during
    file status processing. All excesses are reported for disposition instructions. The excess
    report detail is eliminated only under program control when the quantity reported is no longer
    excess and/or when disposition instructions have been received from the appropriate agency
    and shipping action taken. This record is also established by program control upon input of a
    forced excess (FEX).
        8.7.1.1. Access. The EXCESS-REPORT-DETAIL record is a member of the ITEM-
        DTLS set, whose owner record is ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-DTLS set,

8.8. EOQ Consumption Detail Record (207).
   8.8.1. Purpose. To record consumption data for potential bench stock additions. For all
   XB3 items that do not have IEX codes of 3, 6, E, or K assigned, an economic order quantity
   (EOQ) consumption record will be established when issued or due-out released, provided a
   master Bench Stock or consumption record is not already on file. This provides Bench Stock
   Support and individual organization a way to identify and control the consumption of bench
   stock items.
       8.8.1.1. Access. The EOQ-CONSUMPTION-DETAIL RECORD is a member of the
       ITEM-DTLS set whose owner record is ITEM-RECORD and the DOCN-DTLS set,
       whose owner is DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is through the ITEM-
       DTLS set, and an alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.

8.9. Status FLP MILSTRIP Detail Record (208).
   8.9.1. Purpose. To reflect the various logistical conditions of new or additional
   requirements. The STATUS-FLP-MILSTRIP-DETAIL record is created under both program
   control and offline input.
        8.9.1.1. Conditions. The conditions for establishing these details are as follows:
           8.9.1.1.1. When a MILSTRIP requisition or shipment status is received from the
           source of supply, see AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and Requisitioning, for
           requisition status processing procedures.
           8.9.1.1.2. When inline follow-up, program NGV588, detects a requisition without
           current status or upon input of an offline follow-up (FLP), a follow-up detail is
           created. 8.9.1.1.3. When excess requirements are detected by the releveling program
           or by input of a request for cancellation (TRIC REC with TEX E), a cancellation
           request detail ZC/ZD is established. (See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 5B, Order and
           Requisitioning for cancellation procedures.)
        8.9.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 16 words and resides in the
        ITMDTL-GV area of the SBSS database.
   8.9.2. Record Description. The description of the STATUS-FLP-MILSTRIP-DETAIL
   record as it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

Note:
1. When source initiated partial actions are applicable, this position contains a suffix code. Valid
suffix codes should reflect partial supply action by source. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for a
detailed explanation of these codes.
2. The 208-SUPPLY-STATUS field indicates one of the following situations:
      a. Base initiated actions (that is, cancellation requested (ZC/ZD) or follow-up (two
numerics)).
       b. Source of supply initiated actions (that is, the item back ordered or suspended, the item
being shipped or procured, the item being supplied as a substitute, etc.).
3. Previous supply status is used as provided in note 3 above. However, to prevent duplicates,
ZC/ZD cancellation codes are never shifted off the record.
4. If the detail is an exception or positive supply status, this field represents the estimated delivery
date (EDD) or the standard delivery date (SDD). If it is the SDD, it was computed by program
NGV592 in accordance with standard.
5. The SOURCE-TRANSACTION-DATE field reflects the date when the transaction was processed
by the initiating activity.
6. An R indicates depot reconciliation has occurred during the current reconciliation cycle (delete
remainder).
7. An N in the 208-E3A-COMPONENT-FLAG field identifies a status detail that was built as a result
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                    483


of an AB(x) input.
8. When the due-in routing identifier code is JBD, JBE, or JBT, this field contains the local
manufacture work order number.
9. A C indicates AFC action if the detail is not a ZC/ZD or a follow-up (ARC) action if the detail
status is ZC/ZD.
8.10. Status Billed Not Received Detail Record (BNR) (209).
   8.10.1. Purpose. To record payments for property prior to receipt. Program NGV965
   creates these BNR details. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for program NGV965 processing.
   BNR details are deleted as a result of processing the receipt. BNR-CODE contains the letter
   B for identity purposes. The quantity and extended cost fields on this detail are updated by
   receipt program NGV625 to reflect the current balances. When the quantity drops to zero,
   NGV625 will delete the detail.
       8.10.1.1. Access. The STATUS-BILLED-NOT-RECVD-DETAIL record is a member
       of the ITEM-DTLS set, whose owner record is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the
       DOCN-DTLS set, whose owner is DOCUMENT-NBR record. The primary path is
       through the ITEM-DTLS set and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set.

Note:
1. When the first position contains an * (asterisk), the TMAs are received with blanks or XXX in
positions 14-16.
2. This field reflects either the date shipped or the estimated ship date. For type stock record account
code P, the last three positions reflect the date shipped and the first position is blank.
3. If the shipment is for overseas, this field reflects either the port of embarkation or the source
transaction date. If the shipment is for CONUS, this field is blank or contains the source transaction date.
For type account code P, this field reflects the date available for shipment/estimated delivery date.
4. The TTF is assigned to retail supply system shipment status details when shipment status is provided
by the LRS/transportation activity. Transportation tracer flags are automatically assigned and used to
identify overdue or lost shipments. Overdue or lost shipments are based on MILSTAMP standards using
the priority designator and RDD. Additionally, TTF assignment is based upon the mode of shipment or
transportation method used. Requisitions (shipments) are traced when government transportation or mail
channels are used. If requisition (shipment) tracing is required, the transportation tracer flag determines
which portion of the MILSTAMP Tracer Reconciliation Listing the overdue or lost shipment appears on.
5. This field is computed and used by program NGV597 in producing the TAR listing.
6. For type stock record account code P, the shipment identification is reflected in positions 2-16.

Notes are applicable to mission change special level details (type level codes G and H) with the
exception of note 14.
Note:
1. For type level codes G and H, the authorized quantity is the mission change daily demand rate
(MCDDR) (xx.xxx).
2. The detail load date is in positions 7-10 of the 216-DOCUMENT-NBR field.
3. The SRAN where the data has been collected is stored in positions 1-4, and the tasking document is
stored in positions 5-14. For new activations spares support list (NSSL) processing, the constant N is
contained in position 5. The NSSL serial number is contained in positions 6-13. For RBL/COLT
items (XB and XF), positions 1-6 will contain optional application data, e and positions 7-11 will
contain the reorder point.
4. The mission change daily demand frequency rate (MCDDFR) (x.xxxx) is in the 216-DDFR field. The
percent of base repair override is in 216-PBR-OVERRIDE field.
5. The type level code is G or H.
6. This field is taken from the 1XT434 input. It must be A, C, or D (AFMC, CMD, or USAF).
7. The computed mission change percent of base repair is stored in the first 216-DUPLICATE-DETAIL-
FLAG field (from positions 26-27 of the 1SD input).
8. The program has assigned C--program phasedown/phaseup.
9. The program has assigned C--MAJCOM approval.
10. The first position of command code may have a flag ON when an I141 management notice has been
output.
11. This field includes the mission support date (from 1XT434 input). The mission support date is the
date when the mission change gaining base receives its full complement of the gained weapons system.
At that point in time, the effect of the MCDDR and MCDDFR on the requirements computation begins
to diminish. 12. This field includes information from the SRD demand data input.
13. This field contains the mission change detail effective date (from 1XT434 input). The mission
change detail effective date is the date when the MCDDR and MCDDFR are first used in the
 498                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


requirements computation to affect the base demand level quantity.
14. This note applies to all special level details. This field will contain 0 for levels initially loaded
memo until firmed. Adjusted stock levels that equal type level F or contain level justification code S or 0
will remain 0. Type level E loaded for wholesale storage and distribution points items will remain 0.

Note:
1. This is the actual quantity that is currently suspended, and produced a reject or management notice
(Ixxx or Rxxx).
2. From the original A2x/A4x.
3. From positions 30-35 of the original A2x/A4x.
4. Suffix code needed for reinput to deny or ship future quantities.
5. This will reflect the quantity that has been shipped or denied up to this point for the same 220 detail
document number. EXAMPLE: RDO qty is 5 and 3 assets are shipped. The 220-PARTIAL-QTY
equals 3 and the 220-RDO-QTY equals 2 (number currently suspended). If one additional asset becomes
available for shipment, then the 220-PARTIAL-QTY is increased to 4 and the 220-RDO-QTY is reduced
to one. These two quantities (RDO-QTY and PARTIAL-QTY) will equal the quantity of the original
A2x/A4x. The 220 detail will be deleted when the last quantity for 1 is either shipped or denied.
6. The filler-1 field is defined as follows:
        a. Position 1: I(management notice) or R(reject).
        b. Positions 2-4: Three position management or reject number.
       c. Position 5: Is the follow-up counter. This field will be updated when a BF7 is received for the
220 detail document number; it is also incremented with each subsequent follow-up.
        d. Position 6: Cancellation flag. This field will be set to a “C” if an ACx (cancellation request)
is received for the same 220 detail document number.
        e. Position 7: This is the original suffix code from the A2x.
8.22. Claims Receivable Detail Record (221).
   8.22.1. Purpose. To record, under the conditions explained below, a claims receivable detail
   record instead of a BNR. The CLAIMS-RECEIVABLE-DETAIL record is established under
   program control during supply follow-up on due-in details when the due-in detail is subject
   to valid cancellation and a corresponding BNR detail is in the computer with extended cost
   greater than $100.00 for General Services Administration (GSA) and greater than or equal to
   $250.00 for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and other services SMAG sources of supply.
   Under this condition, the BNR detail is deleted and the claims receivable detail is created
   instead. This detail is used as a source for request for billing credit. It is deleted when the
   credit billing is received and processed or when the credit billing is denied by the supplier.
   This record is also created for the amount of shortage in funded receipt when the monetary
   value of such shortage is as specified above.

                       ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE RECORDS

9.1. Overview. This chapter describes and contains the formats for the Accounting and Finance
records used in the computer.          Note:    1. The database records are required. They may
not be altered except as permitted under program control with an authorized input. The
techniques used to locate all SBSS database records are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
2. The term Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital
Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever DBOF is used in a systems output, the older
term is used to reflect the actual output. The term will be updated upon system programmatic
updates.

   9.6.1. Purpose. To accumulate obligated and unobligated monetary values from the
   organization code center records by sales code for each Trial Balance within each of three
   SMAG divisions (such as, clothing, general support, and materiel support).
        9.6.1.1. Records. Two records exist for each Trial Balance. One record (GLA 910)
        contains obligated due-outs, and the other record (GLA 911) contains unobligated due-
        outs. A total of 20 records exists for each SMAG division. The first record of each area
        is a master control record containing up to 50 different sales codes. Each sales code
        contained in this record has a corresponding binary accumulator in the basic GLA record.
        9.6.1.2. Program Functions. Program NGV994/M29 performs three functions: (1) it
        stores each master sales code on the control record; (2) it accumulates the total due-out
        dollar values for that sales code by Trial Balance and SMAG division; and (3) it stores
        this aggregate sum on the appropriate basic accumulator record field.
        9.6.1.3. Access. The A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZOO record participates as a member in the
        GLA-OO set, whose owner is the GLA-CODES record. This record must be accessed

7. The nine occurrences of the 310-SAT-DATA field are the system designators A1 through A9.
8. If the CSB does not support this satellite system designator, leave the field blank.
9. Load each four-position SRAN supported or maintained on the SBSS database U2200/400
(SBSS/GV). The host SRAN is used for Trial Balance reporting and other output products for each
nonautonomous satellite. The applicable satellite SRAN is used for autonomous satellites.
10. This field indicates whether the satellite is autonomous; that is, whether it is operated as a separate
system with its own operating program and trial balance. If the satellite is autonomous, output
containing the satellite SRAN is produced. If the satellite is nonautonomous, output containing the host
SRAN is produced. A flag is provided for each type of account code (B, E, or P). Load the flags as
follows:
       a. For the 310-B-E-ACCT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG field, load Y if the satellite operating the B
or E account is autonomous. Load N if the satellite is nonautonomous.
       b. For the 310-FUELS-ACT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG field, load Y if the satellite operating the P
account is autonomous. Load N if the satellite is nonautonomous. CAUTION: The 310-B-E-ACCT-
AUTONOMOUS-FLAG and 310-FUELS-ACCT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG fields must contain either a
Y or N. Therefore, load N if a B, E, or P account is not supported by the satellite.
11. The following information applies:
      a. This field has two purposes. It indicates to programs NGV981/D10 and NGV985/D32
whether output from the U2200/400 is required at the satellite location.
       b. Load the field as follows:
               (1) Is D10 output for this satellite required over the output from S1100/2200-60? Y N N
Y
               (2) Is D22 output for this satellite required over the output from S1100/2200-60? Y N Y

9.11. Project Funds Management Record (311).
   9.11.1. Purpose. To control and/or monitor Air Force Operations and Maintenance and other
   customer funds identified for purchasing materiel from the various divisions of the Air Force
   SMAG. The monetary fields in this record are cumulative for the fiscal year, except for
   issues and turn-ins from the current period. These records are updated by Accounting and
   Finance inline and end-of-day programs. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for the systems
   concept.)
       9.11.1.1. Access. The PROJECT-FUNDS-MGMT record is not an owner or member
       record in any set. It is accessed by a DMS-1100 randomization routine, DMSCALC.
       The two parameters that must be initialized before accessing this record are as follows:

9.12. Stock Fund Inventory Management Record (SFIMR) (312).
   9.12.1. Purpose. To provide the storage media for the accumulation of financial inventory
   transaction data affecting all divisions of the Air Force SMAG. A separate STOCK-FUND-
   INV-MGMT record is established for each materiel category and/or source of supply code
   within each budget code (1, 4, 6, 8, or 9) for each system designator (01, A1 through A9).
   The data accumulated in this record are used for preparation of the operating program.
       9.12.1.1. End-of-Day Processing. As a part of the Accounting and Finance end-of-day
       processing, the monetary fields are updated according to information stored in the
       transaction history records. The U2200/400 program, which prints the Stock Fund
       Inventory Management Report (M18), performs an Inventory Management Record (IMR)
       total and update function to assure that the IMR inventory-end-of-period monetary field
       agrees with the computed price-out of related item records, WAR-RESERVE-MATL-
       SPARES-DETAIL and SUPPLY-POINT-DETAIL records, and DIFM detail records
       with activity code C.       Note: Should an out-of-balance condition exist, the M18
       program adjusts the INVENTORY-END-OF-PERIOD field to agree with the price-out of
       related support records.
       9.12.1.2. End-of-Year Processing. As part of the end-of-fiscal-year processing, all
       monetary fields are zeroed out, except for the INVENTORY-END-OF-PERIOD field.
       Each record is self-balancing; that is, the mathematical accuracy is calculated each time
       the M18 program is run. Note: Should an out-of-balance condition occur, the M18
       program adjusts the IMR price and accounting correction monetary field to bring the
       IMR into balance. Any increase or decrease adjustments are printed on the stock fund
       IMR list.
       9.12.1.3. Access. The primary access path for the STOCK-FUND-INV-MGMT record
       is through the DMS-1100 randomization routine, DMSCALC. The two parameters that
       must be initialized before accessing the record are as follows:

          9.12.1.3.1. 312-CALC-KEY.
          9.12.1.3.2. STKFD-AREA-NAME.
             9.12.1.3.2.1. The secondary path for accessing this record is through the SD-
             SFIMR set, whose owner is the SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR record.
      9.12.1.4. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 35 words and resides in the
      STKFD-AREA area of the SBSS database.
   9.12.2. Record Description. The description of the STOCK-FUND-INV-MGMT record as it

9.18. Billing Variable Record (318).
   9.18.1. Purpose.     To store the accounting classification (such as, the fund code,
   appropriation, and sales code) of SMAG customers at each particular base. Input TRIC 1BR
   is required to load or delete this record. The record contains a use code which determines
   how and who uses the record.
         9.18.1.1. Use Code C. Records with use code C are used for aviation fuel interfund
         billings and are categorized by customer identification code (CIC). They are used by the
         M28 to assign the appropriation charged for CICs ASD, USA, USM, and USN. Note:
         The M28 report is no longer processed in the SBSS and is deleted from the SBSS
         program library.
         9.18.1.2. Use Code P. Records with use code P relate to project fund management
         record (PFMR) SF 1080 billings. They are used by the M05 to generate the billed office
         appropriation from the PFMR fund code.
         9.18.1.3. Use Code S. Records with use code S relate to non-PFMR billings. They are
         used by the D07/D12 to assign sales codes and debtor codes to SZS/SZR cards. In
         addition, they are used by the M33 to generate the billed office appropriation on the non-
         PFMR SF 1080 billings.
         9.18.1.4. Access.      The BILLING-VARIABLE record is accessed by SBLC

9.24. MACR-GSD-Part2 Record (332).
   9.24.1. Purpose.      To provide a means of financial control and visibility of
   obligations/commitments issued against Fund Authorizations received for the Air Force
   SMAG General Support Division (BC 9), War Readiness Materiel (WRM), and inventory
   Augmentation (IA). The available balance is computed concurrently for requisitions
   processed against the General Support Division (GSD). If computed amount exceeds fund
   authorizations or a predetermined notice output advising that available fund authorization has
   been exceeded, the requisition is manually processed or MICAP. In addition, actual demand
   data fields in the record are updated at end-of-day or as required by the D08 Report. The
   D08 report prints out accumulated data on the status Fund Authorization.
   Obligations/Commitments and Demand Data.
      9.24.1.1. Access. This record is accessed via the SD-MACR set, whose owner is the
      system designator record.

                             GENERAL SUPPORT RECORDS

11.1. Overview. This chapter describes and contains the formats for the general support records
used in the computer.        Note:      1. The database records are required. They may not be
altered except as permitted under program control with an authorized input.       2. The term
Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF).
However, in this chapter wherever DBOF is used in a systems output, the older term is used to
reflect the actual output. The term will be updated upon system programmatic updates.
11.2. Inventory Accuracy Record Account B/E Complete Record (501).
   11.2.1. Purpose. To provide the data necessary for managing inventory accounts. These
   records are updated inline and during end-of-day processing. The totals maintained are
   accumulated annually and are blanked during end-of-fiscal-year processing.
       11.2.1.1. Separate Records. Separate records are maintained for system designators 01,
       A1 through A9, and type account code B/E. System designator Bx/Cx data are
       accumulated with system designator 01. Inventory accuracy records are maintained for
       the following types of inventories and property categories: repair cycle (XD/XF3),
       economic order quantity (EOQ) (XB3), equipment in-warehouse (ND/NF), General
       Support Division (GSD) (BC9), Systems Support Division (SSD) (BC 1), and investment
       (BC Alpha).
       11.2.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 69 words and resides in the
       INVACC-GV area of the SBSS database.
   11.2.2. Record Description. The description of the INV-ACCR-ACCT-BE-COM record as
   it appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

11.14. Organization Cost Center 100-999 Record (518).
   11.14.1. Purpose. To show the net dollar value of materiel transactions for base-supported
   organizations. A separate record must be maintained for each organization (that is, each cost
   center) for accumulating the expense data at the cost center level. This record is subsidiary
   to the project fund management record (PFMR), which is usually at the responsibility center
   level.
       11.14.1.1. Financial Data. Each record contains specific financial data. The fields
       indicate budget targets and unfunded due-outs according to supplies and equipment, and
       they indicate net issues and due-outs according to the fiscal year and the element of
       expense (EEIC). Organization cost center records (OCCRs) 100-999, except 920, are the
       basic records for reporting obligations (that is, expenses and obligated due-outs) in the
       accounting system for operations (system code BQ).
       11.14.1.2. Organization Information. Besides containing financial data, this record
       contains certain constant organization descriptive information such as parcel post address
       and force activity designator.
       11.14.1.3. Loading Responsibilities. Since this record contains both financial data and
       organization descriptive information, loading the correct data is a joint responsibility of
       the Supply and A&F functions. Specifically, the responsibilities are as follows:

11.16. Reports Sequence Control Record (520).
   11.16.1. Purpose. To control the sequence of report preparation during end-of-day and end-
   of-month processing. This record is used by the reports analysis program. Program
   NGV898A sets all report run flags to a value of three as each job is completed. Program
   NGV898A uses a value which is prepositioned by the application/utility program (NGV801A
   for mandatory daily reports), to determine which run flag to set. Program NGV898C blanks
   daily report run flags when the RPTEON input is processed. Program NGV898C blanks
   monthly report run flags when the specific monthly management data report is processed.
   Note: Report run flags are not necessarily in report processing sequence.
       11.16.1.1. Access. The REPORTS-SEQUENCE-CONTROL record does not participate
       as an owner or member of any set. The two parameters that must be initialized before

11.17. Daily Reject Suspense Record (521).
   11.17.1. Purpose. To identify rejected and suspended transactions for daily listing and
   management action. The Reject and Restore Program, program NGV215A, builds and stores
   a DAILY-REJECT-SUSPENSE record for each rejected transaction. The Cumulative Reject
   Processor, D818 (as outlined in AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7), establishes a record for each
   rejected image deleted from the database. These records are printed by the Base Supply
   Surveillance Report (D20/NGV821) during end-of-day processing. Part eight of the D20
   report lists records reflecting 301 rejects; whereas, part nine lists those rejects deleted by
   D818.
       11.17.1.1. Access. The DAILY-REJECT-SUSPENSE record is a member of the DLY-
       REJ set, whose owner is the DLY-REJECT-HEADER record. This record is accessed
       through the DLY-REJ-Set.
       11.17.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 25 words and resides in the

Note:
1. The 607-CALC-KEY contains the constant literal 607 followed by the applicable 2-position system
designator (SD), followed by a 2-position organization identifier. Each master reporting organization
(MRO) code, as identified in the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE, will be assigned an organization identifier
with the value of '01' through '15', respective to the MRO code occurrence position within the 625-CT-
REPCYC-TABLE of the MGMT-RPT-CONTROL-TABLE (625) record. The '01' through '15'
organization identifiers will represent those MRO codes specified for collection of repair cycle
management data at base level. The 'ALL OTHER' category of repair cycle management data will be
collected and reported with the organization identifier of '00'. In addition to the 'ALL OTHER' category
(organization identifier '00'), the maximum number of designated MRO codes identifying collection
categories is 15 (organization identifiers '01' through '15'). Organization identifiers from '01' through '15'
utilized in the 607-CALC-KEY must have an associated MRO code loaded in the respective occurrence
of the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE of the MGMT-RPT-CONTROL-TABLE (625) RECORD.

Notes:
1. The 625-CALC-KEY contains the constant literal 625 followed by the applicable 2-position system
designator.
2. The 625-CT-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR contains the same system designator as contained in the last
two positions of the 625-CALC-KEY.
3. The 20 occurrences of 625-CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE provide a directory of the 20 standard reporting
designators (SRDs), controlling the collection and storage of the WEAPON-SUPRT-EFFECTIVENESS
(603) records. The first 10 SRDs in the 625-CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE field will indicate those weapon
support effectiveness data records to be downloaded and reported to ILS-S Program Office and/or
MAJCOM during end-of-month processing. No other load sequence requirements apply within the 625-
CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE field. The presence of a given SRD in this table field will signal the collection
of the respective weapon support effectiveness data. Any number of SRDs, from none (0) to a maximum
of 20, can be loaded in this table field(If no SRD is loaded, no weapon support effectiveness data will be
collected and all associated data will be collected and reported under the Customer Support Effectiveness
Category of data.)
4. The 15 occurrences of 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE provide a directory of the master reporting
organization (MRO) codes for which the appropriate repair cycle management data (REPAIR-CYCLE-
ASSET-CONTROL (607) record) will be collected as designated by the 15 occurrences of the 625-CT-
COLLECTIVE-ORGS table within each occurrence of the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE. Those MRO
codes specified will signal and direct the data collection of the respective repair cycle management data
and all other repair cycle management data not identified within these tables will be collected under the
'ALL OTHER' category. All 15 MRO codes in the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE field, in addition to the
'ALL OTHER' category, will indicate the associated data records to be downloaded and reported to ILS-S
Program Office, Gunter Annex, and/or MAJCOM during end-of-month processing. (Note: The repair
cycle data for all specified organizations and the 'ALL OTHER' category will be accumulated and loaded
by reporting SRAN under the 'ALL OTHER' category and cumulative MAJCOM/USAF totals will be
maintained for the 'ALL OTHER' category on the Management Data Bank at ILS-S Program Office,
Gunter Annex.) Any number of MRO codes, from none (0) to a maximum of 15, can be loaded in this
table field. If no MRO code is loaded, no specified repair cycle management data will be collected and
all associated data will be collected and reported under the 'ALL OTHER' category.
5. The 15 occurrences of the 625-CT-COLLECTIVE-ORGS provide a collection of organization codes
to identify those organizations to have repair cycle management data collected under the associated MRO

code.
6. The 20 occurrences of 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE provide a directory of the 20 Standard Reporting
Designators (SRDs), controlling the collection and storage of the MICAP-ANALYSIS (609) record. The
MICAP analysis data will be collected as directed by the 20 specified SRDs. Also, in addition to the 20
specific SRDs, data will be collected under the SRD of 'ZZZ' and all other associated data will be
collected under 'other', identified with the '999' identifier. All SRDs in the 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE
field, in addition to the SRD 'ZZZ' and the '999' identifier, will indicate the associated data records to be
downloaded and reported to ILS-S Program Office, Gunter Annex, and/or MAJCOM during end-of-
month processing. No load sequence requirements apply within the 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE field. The
presence of a given SRD in this table field will signal the collection of the respective associated data.
Any number of SRDs, from none (0) to a maximum of 20, can be loaded in this table field (If no SRD is
loaded, all associated data will be collected and reported under the 'ZZZ' and '999' identifiers.)

12.33. SIFS Header Record (722).
   12.33.1. Purpose. The SIFS header record is used by SIFS to store constant data that is
   global to a variety of SIFS applications and to store various database flags. These flags are
   used in decision-making processes by the SIFS applications, and store the date of last review
   of the SIFS control records.
       12.33.1.1. Access. The SIFS-HEADER record is accessed in a direct mode. The two
       parameters that must be initialized before accessing this record are as follows:
           12.33.1.1.1. (1) SIFS-KEY
           12.33.1.1.2. (2) SUPRT-AREA-NAME Note: The SIFS-KEY is contained in the
           SUPRT-AREA-KEYS record (015-RT-722). It consists of the following: PAGE-
           NUM (63) and RECORD-NUM (2).
       12.33.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 65 words and resides in the
       SIFADR-AREA-NAME area of the SBSS database.

                           TRANSACTION HISTORY RECORDS

Section 14A—-Transaction History Records

14.1. Overview. This chapter provides the following data: The format of the transaction
history record (Para 14.3); the standard print positions of the transaction/document register
(Para 14.4); the transaction history exception records cross-reference index; and the transaction
history exception records arranged as paragraphs to this section.       Notes:    1. The database
records are required. They may not be altered except as permitted under program control with an
authorized input. The techniques used to locate all SBSS database records are contained in
Chapter 3.            2. The term Materiel Support Division (MSD) is now the Consolidated
Sustainment Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S). However, in this chapter wherever MSD is used
in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output. The term will be updated
upon system programmatic updates.               3. The term Defense Business Operations Fund
(DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever
DBOF is used in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output. The term
will be updated upon system programmatic updates.
14.2. Consolidated Transaction History Records.
   14.2.1. Included in this chapter are the record formats for the consolidated transaction
   history (CTH) process. (CTH records are Para 14.102 through Para 14.112) These records
   differ from the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY record as stated below:
       14.2.1.1. All transactions are maintained in the CTH area of the SBLC and are backed up
       on tape. Users can query CTH transactions through a Master Inquiry Menu. (See AFH
       23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 4, for details on how to use the CTH inquiry process.) All
       document control records (DCRs) are stored on the SBLC. The DCRs are cleared
       through personal computer interface.
   14.2.2. All delinquent source documents are stored on the SBLC and cleared through
   personal computer interface.
14.3. Transaction History Record (901).
   14.3.1. Purpose. To indicate that updating of records has been completed. Transaction
   history records are evidence of completed updating, and are used to prepare Transaction and
   Document Control Registers and the Accounting and Finance Listings. In addition, they
   provide a method of statistical gathering that is essential to management at all levels of
   command. Transaction history records are created only during the inline or twilight
   processing modes.

       14.3.1.1. Access. This record is accessed via DMSCALC using the 901-CALC-KEY,
       which consists of the following:
          14.3.1.1.1. For National stock numbers.
              14.3.1.1.1.1. Positions 1-2 = 901-System designator
              14.3.1.1.1.2. Position 3 = 5th position of stock number
              14.3.1.1.1.3. Positions 4-5 = **
              14.3.1.1.1.4. Positions 6-13 = Positions 6-13 of stock number
          14.3.1.1.2. For L&P stock numbers.
              14.3.1.1.2.1. Positions 1-2 = 901-System designator
              14.3.1.1.2.2. Position 3 = 5th position of stock number
              14.3.1.1.2.3. Positions 4-5 = Positions 14-15 of stock number
              14.3.1.1.2.4. Position 6 = 6th position of stock number
              14.3.1.1.2.5. Positions 7-8 = Positions 12-13 of stock number
              14.3.1.1.2.6. Positions 9-13 = Positions 7-11 of stock number
       14.3.1.2. Size and Location. This fixed record length is 54 words and resides in the
       TXHIST-GV area of the SBSS database.
   14.3.2. Record Description. The description of the TRANSACTION-HISTORY record as it
   appears in the schema, subschema, and DML/COBOL programs is as follows:

Note:
1. Change the from/to supply condition code as follows: The first position will contain the FROM code,
and the second position will contain the TO code.
2. When the type account code is K and the item is reportable, this field contains the ammunition
transaction code.
3. Document numbers (inspection and unserviceable detail) are cross-referenced on each transaction
history. For example, on a change from serviceable to unserviceable, the TTPC 1A transaction history
has the inspection document number in the document number and the unserviceable detail (R920RW)
number in the stock number requested. The TTPC 1B has these numbers reversed.
4. Document control RECORD (DCR) are produced for the inspection (Z004) transaction history. If the
TTPC is 7N or 7O, this field will contain a 3.
5. If the TTPC is 7N or 7O, this field will contain the serialized reporting serial number.
6. Cost field values, if applicable.

Notes:
1. If the TRIC is DZE, LVL or XCD this field is blank.
2. If the TRIC is FFC, 1FC or 1GP, then position 1 contains the freeze code, and position 2 contains the
action code. For all other TRIC this field will be BLANK.
3. If the LVL or XCD this field will contain the DDFR.
4. If the TRIC is DZE, then positions 1-6 contain the group reorder point and positions 7-12 contain the
group retention level.
5. If the TRIC is 1GP, then positions 1-14 contain data from input positions 41-54.
6. If the TRIC is LVL, then positions 1-6 contain the computed reorder level and positions 7-12 contain
the economic retention quantity, 13-14 equal Zero’s
7. If the TRIC is LVL or XCD, and a D28 report is required, then positions 1-6 contain the item daily
demand rate (DDR), positions 7-8 contain the item percent base repair (PDR), positions 9-10 contain the
item record standard deviation (for example, 10, 20 or 30), positions 11-13 contain the percent base
condemned, and positions 14-15 contain NRTS/condemned time.
8. Y is constant in the first position of this field.
9. If the TRIC is LVL OR XCD, then positions 1-3 contain the repair cycle time and positions 4-6
contain the order and ship time and positions 7-9 contain number of units repaired.
EXAMPLE 1:
Reading from right to left $602205.90 discard the last zero as that is the tenth position of
the field, 059 is the number of units repaired, 022 is the order and ship time and 6 is the repair cycle time
with leading zeros suppressed.
EXAMPLE 2:
Reading from right to left $2205.90 discard the last zero as it is the tenth position of the
field, 059 is the number of units repaired and 22 is the order and ship time with leading zeros suppressed
and repair cycle time is zero with zeros suppressed.
10. If the TRIC is LVL or XCD, then the 901-Filler-1 field will reflect the sum of the Number of
Demands on the item record (101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-CURRENT + 101-NBR-OFDEMANDS-
PAST-6-MONTHS + 101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-PAST-7-12 MONTHS). The total is capped at 9. If the
sum is greater than 9, then 9 will be recorded in this field.
11. A '1' in this field indicates NSN has MAX Level equal to 0 (zero) is assigned for CRF bases only.
12. If the TRIC is 1FC or 1LI, then:
         (a) The 901-FILLER-4 will contain the 250-DEPLOYED RID (for 1LI only)
         (b) The 901-STOCK-NUMBER REQUESTED will contain the input Serial Number (for 1LI
only)
         (c) The 901-NOMECLATURE will contain the first 19 positions of the 101-NOMENCLATURE
         (d) The 901-SRC-TRN-Code will contain the 101-SERIALIZED-REPORT-CODE
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              833


       (e) The 901-FILLER-1 will contain the 101-EQUIP-MGT-CODE (NWRM-Indicator)
        (f) The 901-JOCAS-NBR will consist of positions 1-3 the record number, position 4 blank, and
positions 5-11 will contain the DATE of LAST INVENTORY
       (g) The INPUT MISC-REFERENCE DATA will contain the 901-MARK-FOR
14.25. DLA/GSA Billing Image Charge (TTPC 2S, 1Z, 9Y, 9Z; TRIC FJ1/FK1).

Notes:
1. If the due-out is under DIFM control, the routing identifier code field contains the average repair
cycle days, and positions 6-8 of the 901-FILLER-2 field contain the total DIFM time.
2. For AWP assets, the following breakdown applies from the end-item DIFM detail:
         a. Position 4 = AWP advice code
         b. Positions 5-6 = MAJCOM code
         c. Positions 7-8 = work unit code
         d. Positions 9-11 = delayed maintenance days
         e. Positions 12-14 = AWP days
3. The first 14 positions of this field will contain positions 67-80 of the DOC input image which is
reserved for local use. The last position of this field will contain the maintenance priority code.
4. If the item being cancelled is an AR or BR UJC due-out, and not TEX code E, the SRD will be
reflected in positions 14-16 of the 901-NOMENCLATURE field.
5. Cost field values, if applicable.

Notes:
1. If the transaction identification code is FCI, then this entry is the authorized quantity. If the
transaction identification code is FER, then this entry is the action quantity.
2. If a change is made from or to use code A, C, or D, then the 901-BLANK field will contain the
change from use code. Otherwise, it will be blank.
3. If the TTPC is 7P or 7Q, this field will contain a 3.
4. This entry applies only to FCI number 3 inputs. It is blank for other inputs.
5. This field is to be used as follows:
         a. If the TRIC is FER, then the change-to or change-from is contained in the stock number.
       b. If the TRIC is FCI and the allowance identification is changed, then positions 1-7 contain the
change from allowance identification, position 8 is blank, and positions 9-15 contain the change-to
allowance identification.
        c. If the TRIC is FCI and the allowance identification is not changed, then positions 1-8 are
blank, and positions 9-5 contain the record allowance identification.
6. If the TTPC is 7P or 7Q, this field will contain the Serialized Reporting Serial Number.
7. This field will be used as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                     895


         a. If the use code is C or D, or the ASC is 158, then the base of planned use will be stored in the
first three positions of the 901-FILLER-2 and the composition code in the four last positions of this field.
        b. If the use code is unequal to C or D, or the ASC is unequal to 158, then the allowance
identification will be stored in the 901-FILLER-2 field.
       c. As an exception to the 901-FILLER-2, position 1 contains a D when the asset is deployed.
Position 7 of the 901-FILLER-2 field will contain (*) asterisk denoting the report to the AFEMS (C001)
bypass flag.

Notes:
1. If the in-use detail use code is equal to C or D, or the allowance standard is 158 or 159, then the base
of planned use/composition code is stored in the 901-FILLER-2 field. If the use code is unequal to C or
D or allowance standard 158, then the 901-FILLER-2 field will contain the allowance identification.
2. The following information applies:
      a. This entry is the routing identifier code (RIC) except when the transaction phrase code is 1K or
1M and the losing and gaining organization codes are unequal.
        b. If the transaction phrase code is 1K or 1M and the losing and gaining organization codes are
unequal, then this entry is the project FMR code applicable to the organization code in the transaction
history. If no project FMR is affected, then the field is blank.
3. For SPRAM transfer, the 901-MAT-CAT-SOS-CODE field will contain the type SPRAM flag.
4. The TTPC 3H results when the input stock number is established as a substitute quantity and the
authorized quantity on the prime detail is increased.
5. If the TTPC is 7P or 7Q, this field will contain a 3.

6. The following information applies:
        a. When the transaction history is for an in-use detail record, the 901-MARK-FOR field is used
as follows:
                  (1) If the transaction history is for a substitute in-use detail, then the 901-MARK-FOR
field is blank.
                (2) If the history is for an authorized/prime in-use detail, and the document number of the
transaction history is for the losing detail, then positions 1-5 are the input decrease authorization.
               (3) If the history is the gaining document number, then positions 1-5 are the input
increase authorization. Positions 6-9 are blank, and positions 10-14 reflect the authorized quantity
recorded on the in-use detail record.
        b. If the transaction history is for a registered equipment management (REM) detail record, then
positions 1-7 reflect the vehicle registration number, and positions 8-14 are blank.
7. Upon SPRAM transfer, the 901-MARK-FOR field will contain the authorized document code.
8. If the TTPC is 7P or 7Q, this field will contain the Serialized Reporting Serial Number.

Notes:
1. This transaction history record is created only for application code changes when the type stock
record account code is K, and only when the first position of the application code is being changed to or
from R.
       a. If the first position has been changed from R to N, ammunition transaction code 91 is stored in
the application code field of this transaction history.
         b. If the first position is changed from N to R, 92 will be in this field.
        c. All transaction histories with 91 or 92 in the application code field have an A in the demand
code field, zeros in the ending balance and action quantity field, and blanks in the extended cost field.
2. If the unit price multiplied by the affected balance results in the extended cost overflowing eight
positions, the action quantity is reduced and multiple transaction histories are created in sufficient
number to prevent an overflow reject. When this occurs, the quantity in the DCR (if output) will not
agree with the quantity on the corresponding warehouse change document (if printed). See AFH 23-123,
Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for management notice F306.
3. If the type detail code is V, then the vehicle registration number is in this field.
4. This field is used for item record transaction histories (type A) to accumulate the extended cost of
due-in details for automatic materiel acquisition control record (MACR) interface. This occurs when
budget code changes require the migration of funds between MACR.
5. During the migration of funds to budget codes 1 and 9, the TTPC 3U type demand code A transaction
history contains the dollar value of the net increase computed as follows for the affected stock number:
         a. Current Processing Date - DOFD = Divisor. (If less than 180, make it 180.)
         b. Current Recurring Demands = Dividend.
        c. Divisor into Dividend = QTN (DDR). (Decimal alignment is maintained and the first three
positions from decimal placement are used as the DDR.)
         d. QTN daily demand rate (DDR) X 365 = Annual Result.
         e. Annual Result X $ Value = Net Increase (Annual).
6. Cost field values, if applicable.

Notes:
1. If the type stock record account code is K and the condition code is A, the ammunition transaction
code 90 is stored in the code field of the change-from transaction history. Otherwise, the item record
application code is stored in the code field.
2. For condition codes A and F, this field contains stock number changes only.
3. If the unit price multiplied by the affected balance results in the extended cost overflowing eight
positions, the action quantity is reduced and multiple transaction histories are created in sufficient
number to prevent an overflow reject. When this occurs, the quantity in the DCR (if output) does not
agree with the quantity on the corresponding warehouse change document (if printed). See AFH 23-123,
Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for the management notice F306.
4. This entry applies only to items migrating to, from, or within divisions of the SMAG and to due-in
detail transaction histories. If the migration decreases the orders-placed field of the appropriate MACR,
the 901-MAT-CAT-SOS-CODE field must contain K. If the net change is an increase, the 901-MAT-
CAT-SOS-CODE field must contain J.
5. If the type detail code is V, then the vehicle registration number is in positions 1-8 of the redefined
901-MARK-FOR field.
6. If the TTPC is 3Y, then this field contains the change-to stock number. If the TTPC is 3V, then this
field contains the change-from stock number. If TTPC 3V or 3Y, and TRIC is FIC that was created as a
result of processing program NGV441, then this field will contain the 250 serial number.
7. The 901-FILLER-5 contains the 901-ACTION-QTY multiplied by the 022-FILLER-2 (Extended
MAC).
8. Cost field values, if applicable.

Notes:
1. The input reorder point is stored in the first 5 positions of the supplementary address.
2. Unit price. For TRIC XCH, an input of (0) in position 50 coverts to whole dollars and no cents, unit
price must be $100,000 but less than $10,000,000.00; two (2) is actual value and unit price of $99,999.99
or less; six (6) is zero (0) added in position 57 and used only for unit price of $10,000,000 or more.

3. Data in this field pertain to data in corresponding positions 35-48 of the FCD input card.
        a. Whenever any of these positions are blank on input, a dash (-) will appear.
        b. A question mark (?) in any of these positions indicates the input data in these positions were
not valid. Analyze the output management/reject notice to determine the cause. All other data will be as
entered in the input FCD card.
        c. An asterisk (*) in any of the positions indicate the data on the corresponding record position
are to be blanked.
4. When a change is made to numerical parts preference code (NPPC), the first four positions contain the
phrase NPPC and the last position contains the change-to code.

Notes:
1. The document identifier code on output DD Forms 1348-1A will contain A5J for national stock
number (NSN) items or A5K for non-NSN items instead of TRM.
2. Transactions for ammunition are assigned the following ammunition transaction codes:
         a. 00 if the item is nonreportable.
         b. 45 if the item is reportable and in serviceable condition.
         c. 47 if the item is reportable and in unserviceable condition.
3. For TTPC 7O, this field will contain a 3.
4. The following information applies:
        a. If the transaction history record is created for unserviceable supply condition codes, then the
first position is blank and the next 14 positions contain the unserviceable detail document number.
       b. If the disposal authority code is 7 or P, then the first position is blank and the next 14 positions
contain the contents from positions 65-78 of the serviceable detail document number.
5. For TTPC 7O, this field will contain the serialized reporting serial number.
6. When the routing identifier code is not on the unserviceable detail, a D will be stored in the first
position of this field and the rest of the field will be blank.
7. The 901-FILLER-5 contains the 901-ACTION-QTY multiplied by the 022-FILLER-2 (Extended
MAC).
8. Cost field values, if applicable.

Notes:
1. The last four positions of this field will contain the date of last obligation from the due-out detail.
2. Transaction histories which have a type DEMAND-CODE of M or E and an activity code of Z will
contain the Julian date from the applicable detail record (positions 7-10 of the document number field).
3. If the Non Stock Fund (NSF) materiel acquisition record adjustment (MACR) (BC Z) is updated or a
MACR is processed, then this field will contain the MACR update. Otherwise, this field will be blank.
4. The vehicle registration number occurs in these positions when the type detail code is V.
5. The eight-character conversion factor should have a decimal placed after the fourth digit. Quantities
are adjusted by using the conversion factor as a multiplier. The result is half adjusted adding .5000 to it
and dropping the digits to the right of the decimal in the final sum. For example, if the unit of issue is
changed from EA (each) to DZ (dozen), use the following computation:

         144 (quantity to be converted)
         Multiply by 0000.0833 (conversion factor)
         .0432
         .432
         11.52
         11.99522 (result)
         Add to half adjust .5000
         12.4952 (final sum)
         Drop characters after decimal (12 converted quantity)
6. If the materiel acquisition control record (MACR) has been adjusted, this field will contain the net
change. This net change applies only to the net value changes affecting due-in details.
        a. If the input is for a price change, this net change will be contained in the item record
transaction history (DEMAND code A).
       b. If the input is for both unit of issue and price changes, the net change will be contained in a
due-in detail transaction history. Due-in detail transaction histories are written only when the input is for
both unit of issue and price changes.
7. Reason why code J is assigned to indicate data changes on the SNUD stocklist. If there are no SNUD
changes, this field will be blank.
8. If the input is for unit price changes (budget code 9), only a net price increase will be computed for
the affected stock value. The following formula is used:

         Current Processing Date - DOFD = Divisor (round smaller values to 180)
         Current Recurring DEMAND= Dividend

        Divisor into Dividend = QTN (DDR) (Decimal alignment is maintained and the first
        three positions from decimal placement are used at the DDR.)
        QTN (DDR) X 365 = Annual Result.
        Annual Result X Dollar Value Only - Old Price = Result A
        Annual Result X Dollar Value Only - New Price = Result B
        Result B - Result A = Net Price Increase - Annual. (If net price increase is negative, the
        positions of the type A DEMAND-CODE code transaction history will contain zeros. If
        the net price increase is positive, these positions will contain the computed dollar value.

Notes:
1. Inputs 1BC and 1BD with FC 61 and the petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) flag G contain the stock
number from the input. For all other inputs, the first two positions contain constant 00, and the rest of the
field is blank.
2. If input TRIC is 1BT, then the unit of issue is constant EA. Otherwise, this field is blank.
3. If the input TRIC is 1BT, then the action quantity is constant 000001.
4. Inputs 1BC and 1BD with FC 61 and POL flag G contain the date of last transaction from applicable
item record. All other inputs are blank.
5. For NSF transactions use the materiel acquisition control record (MACR) update code (MUC) budget
code Z.
6. These two fields are formatted as follows:

         First six positions = Blank
         Next 12 positions = Management Notice Phrase Codes (four positions each), when
         applicable
         Next three positions = Fuel Grade Code (from item record)
         Next three positions = Conversion Factor (from item record)
         The last six positions above apply to 1BC and 1BD inputs with FC 61 POL flag G.
7. For SMAG transactions, use the alpha ZBL code.

Notes:
1. Only the transaction history affecting the item record is printed on the Daily
Transaction/Consolidated Transaction Register.
2. Whenever a transaction occurs which adds or deletes the date of approval/validation or change detail
quantity on firm details, the resulting transaction appears on the Transaction Register.
3. The only time that a TTPC 1A transaction history is printed on the Document Register is as a result
of a due-out release for a lateral requisition.
4. Para. 14.4. is used with TTPC 1Z only if the last two positions of the status or advice code field
contain BJ or FS.
5. When input is AOX, a TTPC 4W transaction is not printed on the Document Register (D04).
6. Document control outputs (DCRs) are produced only when a deployment issue is output.
7. DCRs are output only for LOAN or RENT receipts.
8. DCRs are provided only for those transactions which correspond to a turn-in/issue document.
9. DCRs are produced only when a corresponding warehouse change document is printed. . NGV441
processing writes a TTPC 3V under the ‘change-to’ NSN and 3Y for the ‘change-from’ NSN.
10. This transaction history is written to provide balancing of Fail Safe totals with the Daily
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1465


Management Data Report (D14). The transaction history will not be printed.
11. A transaction history is created and printed on the Daily Transaction/Consolidated Transaction
Registers for billed-not-received and (octal 20) status only.
12. A receipt (TTPC 1B) transaction history is printed only on the Document Register for receipts of
stock-funded (budget code 9) local manufacture items.
13. The type transaction phrase codes (TTPC) are those authorized record reversal & correction. The
transaction history flags are the same as the original transaction. (See Para 14.73, Para 14.73A through
Para 14.73N, and Para 14.74 for transaction history exceptions.)

            SUPPLY USERS REPORT GENERATOR (SURGE) PROGRAM

Section 15A—-Supply Users Report Generator (SURGE)

15.1. General.
   15.1.1. SURGE (Program UTL003) is a tool for the local user of the SBSS. It allows the
   user to access the database in a read-only mode and perform any function normally provided
   by a program language except writing to the database. SURGE will primarily be used to
   create reports of the information from the database.
   15.1.2. SURGE is a subsystem of the SBSS that provides the users with access to the SBSS
   database and non-database disk and tape files created by the SBSS for the purpose of creating
   local management reports.
   15.1.3. Capability limitations within existing utilities, command unique, and other report
   generator programs, dictated the development of a single program that will:
      15.1.3.1. Handle input and output images.
      15.1.3.2. Handle tape input and output.
      15.1.3.3. Retrieve and format mass storage data (disk).
      15.1.3.4. Handle a complete run with a single program pass.
      15.1.3.5. Reduce manual intervention.
      15.1.3.6. Match, merge and/or multiple sort at predetermined intervals.
      15.1.3.7. Provide a flexible and rapid sort.
      15.1.3.8. Be programmed with ease.
      15.1.3.9. Provide meaningful debugging aids.
      15.1.3.10. Reuse established and tested routines.
      15.1.3.11. Handle large input and output volumes while permitting instruction linkage to
      perform the complete task.
      15.1.3.12. Be assembled without maintaining a compiler or an assembler.
      15.1.3.13. Perform extensive edits before performing live operations.
      15.1.3.14. Transmit output data to Rolling Line Printer (RLP) or Satellite.
   15.1.4. Materiel Management personnel at all levels should become familiar with the
   capabilities of this program. All personnel directly involved with the operations of the SBSS
   must possess a detailed working knowledge and the skills necessary to prepare, interpret, and
   process UTL003 program language style.
   15.1.5. Supervisors must ensure personnel are fully trained and skilled in accomplishing
   these tasks. Base-level classroom training environment is highly recommended and should
   be utilized where possible.

   15.1.6. SURGE programs designed to make input images for subsequent online input should
   be processed to take advantage of the pseudo reader.
15.2. Documentation. There are three categories of SURGE programs each requiring its own
type of documentation.
   15.2.1. Mandatory Utilities. These are utility programs directed by this manual. Maintain
   program run instructions in the format of section 15B in a program jacket file within
   Computer Operations. At the discretion of the MAJCOM, program jacket files could be
   assigned local program numbers and listed to show the dates the requirement is to be
   processed. Recommend using the assigned control number as the program identification.
   This will facilitate scheduling and product review requirements. The as-required utility
   programs may be published in a supplement by the functional activity, or an AF Form 2011
   will be filed in the program jacket file if the product is recurring.
   15.2.2. Local Recurring Utilities. The functional activity requiring the product may publish
   a supplement. Program jacket files will be maintained as described above.
   15.2.3. Local Nonrecurring Utilities. Record run instructions in block 16 (and reverse side
   when necessary) of the initiating AF Form 2011. These programs do not require formal run
   instructions or documentation.

Section 15B—-SURGE Program Preparation and Run Instructions

15.3. Overview. SURGE provides a general purpose programming capability for the SBSS
without the need for a separate compiler.
15.4. Program Logic. SURGE reads the program instruction images prepared by the user,
translates them into a tokenized program, and then acts as an executive system to process the
generated program. The instruction repertoire provided allows the user to write a program with
the following input and output options within a single program:
   15.4.1. Input.
        15.4.1.1. RPS.
        15.4.1.2. Tape Unit.
        15.4.1.3. Mass Storage File (Disk).
   15.4.2. Sort. Multiple sorting is allowed.
   15.4.3. Output.
        15.4.3.1. Printer.
        15.4.3.2. RPS.
        15.4.3.3. Mass Storage File (Disk).
15.5. Computer Operations.
   15.5.1. Report select image. x represents applicable primary gang number.

       15.5.1.4. SBLC Main Site Tape Drive Unit. As required.
       15.5.1.5. RPS Console.     Operational messages will be generated via the RPS main
       console.
       15.5.1.6. Restart Procedures. From beginning.
15.6. Special Instructions. The user should prepare documentation and run instructions for
each program written using this Section as a guide. Include all peripheral file identification and
distribution instructions. All database areas have to be up or SURGE will abort.
15.7. Management Uses. This program can be used to satisfy all nonstandard SBSS program
requirements.

Section 15C—-Error Message Definitions

15.8. General.
   15.8.1. When SURGE runs and an abnormal condition is detected, an error message is
   generated and printed on the "PR" listing. These messages explain the nature of the problem,
   who (user or AFMC SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY) can remedy it,
   and in many cases what the remedy is.
   15.8.2. There are three classes of errors, "Warnings", "Serious", and "Fatal." Generally,
   "Serious" and "Fatal" errors will cause program termination, while "Warnings" are basically
   information about troublesome, but not deadly errors.
       15.8.2.1. Warning. Program will run with this error.
       15.8.2.2. Serious. Program could run but with no assurance of correctness so program is
       terminated.
       15.8.2.3. Fatal. Program cannot run as control is totally lost. Program is terminated.
15.9. Specifics.
 1480                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   15.9.1. SURGE runs in two stages: (1) the compile (Tokenize) stage and, (2) the execution
   stage. The messages and their formats are different for each stage.
   15.9.2. The compile stage converts the SURGE source code into executable tokens which
   are then written to the "Work Token File" (WTF). The errors in this stage are variable form,
   plain text messages, and are not explained here. The general form may include underlining
   (with x's) a word (in the source code) in question and then proceeding with an explanation of
   what was "expected" and what was "found". The solution is often inferred by the "expected"
   phrase.
   15.9.3. The execution stage reads the "Work Token File" (WTF) and executes the tokens
   interpretively. Para 15.25 illustrates the form and contents of the messages that come from
   the execute stage. All of these messages are in "plain" text, but not all are in "clear" text.
   Those messages that are not clear are further explained, along with corrective action/s to
   take.

Section 15D—-Debugging Aids

15.10. $SCREEN. $SCREEN is an active receiving field. When data is moved here, as in,
"MOVE expression TO $SCREEN;", $SCREEN will be moved to the PRINT$ file. In Demand,
the PRINT$ file is the terminal screen and optionally the side-by printer. Moving data to
$SCREEN in Demand allows the user to monitor events as they happen. In Batch, the PRINT$
file is moved to "PR" file by default, or is redirected by the @SYM image (2nd image in the
@START runstream) to a file of choice where it can be monitored (@ED,R) during execution.
Moving data in Batch allows debugging messages to be printed without corrupting the actual
print file being created. Move to $SCREEN should be used in lieu of DISPLAY for debugging.
   15.10.1. $SCREEN messages are 80 characters long, but the first three positions are reserved
   for the literal "TL:". "TL:" is an acronym for TEST LINE and identifies the source of the
   output line. These three characters subtract from the available space, leaving 77 characters
   for the output message (data). Move no more than 77 characters to $SCREEN.
   15.10.2. $SCREEN is a SDDN and as such can be accessed as a source of data as in:
   "MOVE $SCREEN TO HLD-AREA;".
   15.10.3. $SCREEN is a self-clearing area when not partialed. There is no need to clear it
   before using it. When data is moved to $SCREEN, it is printed and then cleared, unless
   $SCREEN is partialed. If $SCREEN is partialed, as in "MOVE expression TO
   $SCREEN[5,10];", the data is placed into $SCREEN in positions 5 through 10, and is printed
   but not cleared. The following coding:
        15.10.3.1. MOVE 1 TO #RN;
        15.10.3.2. MOVE ‘ RECORD NUMBER = ‘ & #RN TO $SCREEN[1,19];
        15.10.3.3. LOOP: REPEAT . . . . . . .
        15.10.3.4. MOVE #RN + 1 TO #RN;
        15.10.3.5. MOVE #RN TO $SCREEN[19,19];
        15.10.3.6. LOOP: END
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                1481


       15.10.3.7. would create formatted print as follows:
       15.10.3.8. TL: RECORD NUMBER = 1
       15.10.3.9. TL: RECORD NUMBER = 2
   15.10.3.10. TL: RECORD NUMBER = 3
   15.10.4. $SCREEN can be used in Demand in conjunction with READ$-FILE to create an
   interactive program. $SCREEN is also used to instruct SURGE to do special debugging
   operation. They are:
       15.10.4.1. TRACE - Which allows a token-by-token view of the internal processing with
       corresponding values of each data item being moved to PRINT$.
       15.10.4.2. DUMP - Which gives an unformatted dump of the AN-area and/or its INDEX.
       It allows a view of what data is in the AN-area and where it is in that area (not
       operational).
15.11. Trace. Trace allows a token-by-token view of the internal processing with the
corresponding value of each data item being moved to PRINT. Trace can produce a vast amount
of print and should be turned on just before the code in question and turned off just after. Trace
can be turned on/off an unlimited number of times without effecting the results of normal
processing. Trace can be used to see the data being processed, decided upon, and created during
execution.
       A trace can be activated by:               "MOVE TRACE ON TO $SCREEN;".
                    deactivated by:               "MOVE TRACE OFF TO $SCREEN;".
       When a trace is started,
          PRINT$ will begin with:                 "TL:TRACE ON"
                and is followed by:               One or more formatted lines.

       15.11.9.1. TRACE: SEQUENCE
       15.11.9.2. MOVE ‘TRACE ON’ TO $SCREEN;
       15.11.9.3. MOVE 24 + 15 TO #SUM;
       15.11.9.4. MOVE ‘THE SUM OF 24 AND 15 IS ‘ & #SUM TO $SCREEN;
       15.11.9.5. MOVE ‘TRACE OFF’ TO $SCREEN;
       15.11.9.6. TRACE: END
15.12. Dump.
   15.12.1. Two types of unformatted dumps are possible; the Alphanumeric Area and/or its
   Index. An unformatted dump does not list data names along with the data, and is not
   selective in what is printed. An unformatted dump does list the entire area in question with
   address locations down the left side. The address location is the address of the first character
   on a given dump line and is always zero relative.
       15.12.1.1. The following instruction will dump the Alphanumeric Area:
           15.12.1.1.1. “MOVE DUMP AN AREA TO $SCREEN;”
       15.12.1.2. The following instruction will dump the Alphanumeric Index:
           15.12.1.2.1. "MOVE DUMP AN-INDX TO $SCREEN;"
       15.12.1.3. A sample dump line follows:
1484                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


Figure 15.7. Sample DUMP AN-AREA Line.




  15.12.2. All "null characters" (no data) are printed as "*". All asterisks are printed as
  asterisks.
  15.12.3. All alphanumeric literals start at the end of the area (address 16383) and work
  backwards toward the front of memory (address 8192).
  15.12.4. This dump is useful when a large number of data items, or large tables begin to fill
  up most of the available alphanumeric space. It can be used for memory management
  planning.
  15.12.5. Another use for this dump occurs when a large number of unexpected
  "AUTOMATIC ALPHA-NUM AREA PACKS" are indicated. Here are the conditions:
       15.12.5.1. A SURGE program is written without partials, but instead with catenations.
       This results in very little code if done right, and is a good technique. However, on
       processing sufficient data, the A/N area will fragment and fill up. SURGE will then go
       into an AUTOMATIC A/N AREA PACK. This does not take long, and is acceptable on
       a medium amount of data. For this style of program, AUTOMATIC A/N AREA PACK
       is expected and is not a problem.
       15.12.5.2. A SURGE program is written with partials specifically to eliminate memory
       fragmentation. If memory does fragment and fill up, it is an error and detection of the
       offending data item is desired. This can be detected by taking a dump of the A/N area
       before it packs. On the dump, look for the data that is moving away from all other data,
       towards a high address.
       15.12.5.3. A SURGE program is written with partials specifically to eliminate memory
       fragmentation. In this case, memory does not fragment but simply fills up because of too
       much data. An A/N Area dump may reveal which data to DROP to free more space.
  15.12.6. "MOVE ‘DUMP AN-INDX’ TO $SCREEN;" will cause a dump of the
  Alphanumeric Index. This index is the link between a Data token and the A/N Area. To
  identify Alphanumeric Data Tokens, consider the following token format examples:

   15.12.7. In each alphanumeric data token, the last number points to the Alphanumeric Index.
   This dumped index consists of four columns of numbers. The breakdown of each column is
   as follows:

15.13. Source Program Input.
   15.13.1. Purpose. To define the source program inputs.
      15.13.1.1. Source Versus Tokenized Programs. Source programs are the actual
      instructions written by the programmer, usually stored in elements within programs
      generated by the SURGE processor from source programs, and contain the program in a
      form executable by SURGE. They are usually stored in elements within program files
      but may also be stored in data files. Tokenized programs previously created by SURGE
      may be executed directly, bypassing the tokenization process. Therefore, all programs
      must be retokenized on the next run following the release of a new data dictionary.
      15.13.1.2. Source Input Format. Program constructs and verb phrases are delimited by
      colons, semicolons, and key reserved words. Therefore, there are no restrictions as to
      how the source program is formatted into individual input images. A single program
      construct or verb phrase may span as many or as few input images as desired, or a single
      input image (1 line) may contain as many program constructs and verb phrases that will
      fit. Anywhere a single space is allowed (or required), any number of spaces may be
      coded. This allows the programmer to format for readability.
      15.13.1.3. Input Images. Each input image may be up to 80 characters. An input image
      is ended by the physical end of the input image or by a percent sign (%) preceded and
      followed by a space. Anything following the percent sign is treated as a comment.
      EXCEPTION: Percent signs within alphanumeric literals or within REM verb phrases do
      not end the input image. Input images may not have a question mark (?) or an at sign
      (@) in column 1.
      15.13.1.4. Continuation of Words Between Input Images. Words may not be continued
      from one input image to the next except for alphanumeric literals. An alphanumeric
      literal may be continued on more than one input image according to these rules:
          15.13.1.4.1. The alphanumeric literal is opened on the first input image with a single
          quote (') and continues to the physical end of the input image.
          15.13.1.4.2. The literal is continued on the next input image with the first character
          following the first single quote on that image. Anything before the first single quote
          is ignored. The literal will continue if necessary until the end of that image literal.
          15.13.1.4.3. The literal will be terminated by the second stand-alone (not back-to-
          back) single quote on the same image.

           15.13.1.4.4. Care should be used to ensure back-to-back single quotes (indicates one
           single quote within the literal) appear on the same input image to avoid
           misinterpretation.
        15.13.1.5. Using the Surge Processor in a Runstream.
           15.13.1.5.1. The SURGE processor is executed in a runstream the same as any other
           SBSS batch program. The XQT of NGV801A will be followed by the SURGE select
           image, the local SURGE program instructions, and optional data. The format is:

Figure 15.16. Runstream.




        15.13.1.6. The source program specifies the name of the file or element containing the
        source-program instructions. The tokenized program contains the name of the file or
        element to contain the tokenized program instructions. The options are one or more of
        the following letters without spaces between them and have the following meanings:
           15.13.1.6.1. I - The program instructions immediately follow the SURGE select
           image and are ended with an image containing STOP in the first four positions and
           nothing else in the remaining positions. The source-program field may or may not be
           used. If it is used, these instructions (without the STOP) will be placed in that
           element or file. If an I is not specified, the source program instructions are assumed
           to be in the file or element which must be given in the source-program field. Do not
           use with the X option.
           15.13.1.6.2. L - Produces a long listing which includes the program source code,
           executable tokens and error messages. Overrides S and N options. Do not use with
           X.
           15.13.1.6.3. N - Produces no listing of the program. Identifies errors by listing only
           those lines that are in error and all associated error messages. Do not use with X.
           15.13.1.6.4. S - Produces a short listing of program source code and errors messaged
           only. Overrides N, and do not use with X.
           15.13.1.6.5. T - Tokenize the program only. Do not execute. Do not use with X.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1489


         15.13.1.6.6. X - Executes a previously tokenized program. Does not tokenize. The
         source-program field is ignored, the tokenized-program field must be given, and the
         file or element must contain a tokenized program. This is a stand-alone option and is
         not to be used with any other option.
         15.13.1.6.7. Y - Suppresses the printing of warnings.
         15.13.1.6.8. Z - Reserved for internal use only. DO NOT USE.
      15.13.1.7. Syntax Rules for Surge Select Image.
         15.13.1.7.1. UTL003SURGE must be the first 11 positions of the select image.
         Positions 20-50 are for program identification.
         15.13.1.7.2. If options are given, UTL003SURGE must be immediately followed by
         a comma, zero, or more spaces. The options must be back-to-back, and at least one
         space must follow the last option. The comma is not to be used if no options are
         given.
         15.13.1.7.3. The source program and tokenized program (if given) must be a fully
         qualified file or fully qualified element names. If these names lack a qualifier or file
         name, then standard defaults will be used. Be completely familiar with defaults
         before using them.
         15.13.1.7.4. When using both the source program and tokenized program fields, they
         must be separated from the options (or from UTL003 SURGE) by at least one space.
         They are separated with a comma followed by "zero or more" (0 or more) spaces.
         There will be no space before the comma.
         15.13.1.7.5. When using just the source-program field, it must be separated from the
         previous field by at least one space. The comma and tokenized-program field must
         be omitted.
         15.13.1.7.6. When using just the tokenized-program field, it must be separated from
         the previous field by one or more spaces, a comma, and zero or more spaces.
      15.13.1.8. Runstream Considerations.
         15.13.1.8.1. If the I option is used, the program instructions must follow the SURGE
         select image. The instructions must be followed with an image containing only STOP
         in the first four positions.
         15.13.1.8.2. If the program reads READ$ file, this file of data images is placed either
         behind the SURGE select image, or behind the first STOP image if the I option is
         used. These images are also followed with a STOP image.
         15.13.1.8.3. The sequence of images is terminated with the image ??STOP in the first
         six positions. The image is required whether or not instructions or data follow the
         SURGE select image.
         15.13.1.8.4. Care should be taken to ensure that STOP or ??ST do not appear in the
         first four positions of the instructions or data image to prevent them from being
         interpreted as runstream control images.
15.14. Language Concepts.
1490                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  15.14.1. Purpose. To define the SURGE language concepts.
       15.14.1.1. Data Representation in Surge. There are four types of data names which may
       be represented in a SURGE program.           Alphanumeric-User-Defined-Data-Names,
       Numeric-User-Defined-Data-Names, Database Data Names, and SURGE-defined Data
       Names.
       15.14.1.2. User-Defined-Data-Names (UDDN). These items are ALPHANUMERIC-
       USER-DEFINED-DATA-NAMES or NUMERIC-USER-DEFINED-DATA-NAMES.
       When "UDDN" appears in the programming skeletons, the programmer may use either.
          15.14.1.2.1. Alphanumeric User-Defined-Data-Name (ANUDDN).
              15.14.1.2.1.1. Description. These items are used to store data needed by the
              program. Some calculations and totaling can be accomplished on any string that
              can be converted to numbers. The lengths of these items are variable and are set
              each time data is moved to them according to the length of the data moved. The
              maximum length is 132 characters. The programmer may define up to 512
              alphanumeric data items which may use up to a total of 8,192 characters in
              memory. Indexed items (items defined with a DIMENSION verb) use more than
              one of the available 512 data items. To compute the number used, add 1 to the
              integer specified in the DIMENSION verb phrase. Memory space used by
              alphanumeric user-defined data items is assigned as it is required. If the memory
              space used exceeds 8,192 characters, the program will error-terminate (the
              acronym ANUDDN is used throughout this chapter).
              15.14.1.2.1.2. Composition. These data names can be up to 16 characters long
              from this set of characters: 0-9, A-Z, -, #, $. ANUDDN must begin with an
              alphabetic character (A-Z) and cannot end with a hyphen (-).
          15.14.1.2.2. Numeric-User-Defined-Data-Name (NUDDN).
              15.14.1.2.2.1. Description. These names are used to store numeric values and to
              do calculations and totaling with the least amount of internal processing. They
              have the fixed format of a sign, nine digits for the whole number, an assumed
              decimal point, and seven digits for the fractional portion. The user may define up
              to 256 numeric items. Subscripted items use as many of these 256 items as
              specified by the integer in the DIMENSION verb phrase.
              15.14.1.2.2.2. Composition. These names can be up to 16 characters long from
              this set of characters: 0-9, A-Z, -, #, $. NUDDN must begin with a pound sign
              (#) and cannot end with a hyphen(-).
          15.14.1.2.3. Data-Base-Data-Name (DBDN).
              15.14.1.2.3.1. Description. These names are already defined in the system's
              database schema. Once a record has been read, the programmer can reference the
              data within the record using the names as defined in the schema. Care should be
              taken to reference computational (binary) items as elementary items rather than as
              group items. The SURGE processor deals with data in display (printable) mode
              and automatically translates from computational to display when a computational
              data item is reference "d". Moving a group item containing a computational
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1491


             elementary item will cause the entire item to be treated as alphanumeric and,
             therefore, no translation will be done (the acronym DBDN is used throughout this
             chapter).
             15.14.1.2.3.2. Composition. Any data name defined within the SURGE
             program's view of the database may be used by the programmer. These names are
             written exactly as they are defined in the database and begin with the 3-digit
             record number and a dash (nnn-). EXCEPTION: Record names are defined in
             the database without the record number in the first three positions of the name.
             To use these names in a SURGE program, the programmer must use the name as
             defined in the database preceded with the 3-position record number and a slash
             (nnn/). For example, the record defined as ITEM-RECORD in the database must
             be written as 101/ITEM-RECORD in the SURGE program.
          15.14.1.2.4. Surge-Defined-Data-Name (SDDN).
             15.14.1.2.4.1. Description. These items are alphanumeric and have fixed lengths.
             They can hold both numeric and/or alphanumeric type data, but the numeric data
             will be in string (alphanumeric) format. In general, they are used to pass constant
             information (such as base name, etc.) to the local SURGE program. They can
             also be used to pass information from the local SURGE program to the SURGE
             processor to direct execution of the local SURGE program. SURGE-defined data
             items can be used to specify database record keys to tell the SURGE processor
             which record to read, to specify data to be converted, to specify headers, trailers,
             and other report formatting information, etc. The acronym SDDN is used
             throughout this chapter.

Section 15G—-Skeletons And Rules

15.16. Skeletons and Rules.
   15.16.1. Purpose. To define skeletons and their rules.
   15.16.2. Skeleton. A skeleton is a picture of the arrangement of the elemental items that
   make up a program construct or verb phrase. As a general rule, these elements or groups of
   elements, must be coded in the sequence in which they appear in the skeleton. Exceptions to
   this rule will be stated following the skeleton.
   15.16.3. Syntax Rules. Further define the order in which elements or groups of elements
   may appear. It also places restrictions on values of elements which may be supplied by the
   programmer.
   15.16.4. General Rules. Clarifies the effect an element or group of elements have on the
   tokenization and execution processes.
   15.16.5. Brackets. Brackets [], in the skeleton indicate the portion included within the
   brackets is optional.
   15.16.6. Braces. Braces {}, in the skeleton indicate one and only one of the options within
   the braces must be included within the program construct or verb phrase.
 1496                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


   15.16.7. Double Bars. Double bars || || , indicate one or more of the options within the
   double bars must be included within the program construct or verb phrase. Unless otherwise
   specified, the options must appear in the order they appear in the skeleton.
   15.16.8. Ellipsis. Ellipsis (. . .) indicates the last bracketed [], or braced {}, portion of the
   skeleton may be repeated at the programmer's option. The syntax rules will specify any
   limitations on the number of repetitions.
   15.16.9. Semicolons. Semicolons (;) appear at the end of each verb phrase skeleton.
   15.16.10. Words Used In Skeletons. There are three types of words used in skeletons:
   programmer supplied words, key reserved words, and reserved words.
        15.16.10.1. Programmer Supplied Words. These words are in lower case and are to be
        replaced by the programmer with a syntactically correct entry as described in this manual.
        15.16.10.2. Key Reserved Words. These are reserved words that are underlined within
        the skeleton. They must be coded by the programmer exactly where shown and may
        appear nowhere else. Special characters that are used for operators (+, -, *, /, =, <, >, <=,
        =>, <>,) are considered to be key reserved words even though they are not underlined
        when used in a skeleton. Reserved words are capitalized within the skeleton. Optional
        Reserved words add readability to the program. When used, they must be coded exactly
        where shown in the skeleton and may not appear anywhere else.

     15.16.12. Construct Names.
        15.16.12.1. Description. These names identify the beginnings, endings, and divisions of
        program constructs. There are two special types of construct names: the program name,
        which appears on the first line of the program and subroutine names which appear on the
        first line of a subroutine.
        15.16.12.2. Composition. Construct names are up to 16 characters. They contain any of
        the characters A-Z, 0-9, and hyphen. They cannot begin or end with a hyphen and must
        conform to the same standards as ANUDDN. They must end with a colon (:), except
        when used in a DO statement or a QUIT statement. In these two statements, they are part
        of verb phrase which ends with a semicolon.
 1498                                                        AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


        15.16.12.3. Literals. Literals allow the user to define constant data. An alphanumeric
        literal uses up one of the allowable 512 alphanumeric user-defined data items and a
        numeric literal uses up one of the 256 numeric user-defined data items.
        15.16.12.4. Numeric Literals. Numeric literals are used to define fixed numeric values
        in a program. They are made up of the characters 0-9, +, -, and decimal point. The sign
        (+ or -) can be used only once in the literal and, if used, must be the first character. There
        can be one decimal point with up to seven decimal digits on its right and up to nine digits
        on its left. There must be at least one digit in a numeric literal. A fraction, a number
        smaller than one, (1) must have a zero (0) preceding the decimal (0.25 -vs- .25).
   15.16.13. Alphanumeric Literals. Alphanumeric literals are used to represent fixed
   alphanumeric values in a program. They begin and end with a single quote ('). Any
   character in the computer's set may appear in the literal which may be up to 132 characters
   long. To represent one single quote within an alphanumeric literal, two quotes must be
   coded back-to-back.
        15.16.13.1. Condition Names. Condition names represent a test that can be either true or
        false(see expressions).
           15.16.13.1.1. DEFAULT                  Same as "1 = 1" or "1"

15.17. Expressions.
   15.17.1. Purpose. To define what an EXPRESSION is and what it does.
   15.17.2. Background. Data processing is concerned with three basic operations:
      15.17.2.1. Input of Data.
      15.17.2.2. Processing Data.
      15.17.2.3. Output of Data.
      15.17.2.4. The processing stage is concerned with two things: (1) combining values of
      variables and constants to get new values and, (2) combining them in the right order. Part
      of the ordering or sequencing is controlled by the program constructs detailed elsewhere.
      The rest of the sequencing control and the actual combining is accomplished in
      expressions.
          15.17.2.4.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.17.2.4.1.1. "MOVE A + B TO C;"
          15.17.2.4.2. In this example, A and B are added and the answer is placed into C. "A
          + B" is an expression. Expressions can range from simple, "A", to complex, "A +
          ROOT(B - C / 2) - 3.5 * (B - C.)." Expressions can be used to determine a value,
          compare one or more values for making decisions (true or false situations),
          determining order of data (greater than, equal, less than), pulling strings of data apart
          into smaller strings, concatenating (combining) smaller strings into larger strings
          (build print lines, phrases) and converting from one class of data to another
          (alphanumeric-string to numeric-value and vice versa). A working knowledge of
          FUNCTIONS, INDEXING, PARTIALING, CONDITION NAMES, SEPARATORS,
          AND OPERATORS PRECEDENCE is needed to understand expressions.

Section 15I—-Functions

15.18. Functions.
   15.18.1. Purpose. To define SURGE Computational Functions.
   15.18.2. Functions. Just as operators direct actions to be performed upon their operands,
   functions direct actions to be performed upon their operands. Functions can have one or
   more operands depending upon the function. SURGE functions have a maximum of two
   operands. A function can be one of two types; alphanumeric or numeric which is determined
   by the type of data it puts out. An alphanumeric function puts out an alphanumeric string
   even if the string can be read as a number. A numeric function puts out a numeric-value data
   item. The result of all functions is placed on an internal stack and does not modify any input
   operands.
   15.18.3. Days-Difference Function.
 1500                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


        15.18.3.1. Function. Computes the difference in days between two Julian dates.

        15.18.3.3. Syntax Rules. None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton.
        15.18.3.4. General Rules.
           15.18.3.4.1. Expression-1 should evaluate to the earlier Julian date; if not, a negative
           result will be returned.
           15.18.3.4.2. Expression-2 should evaluate to the later Julian date; if not, a negative
           result will be returned.
           15.18.3.4.3. The format of the Julian dates is seven digits: four for year and three for
           day. The year portion may have spaces as the first three characters (i.e., A 4-position
           Julian date). In this case, the SURGE processor will assume the decade to be the one
           that makes the year closest to the current year. In the event two possible selections
           will be 5 years away, the earlier date will be used. The day portion must be between
           001 and 365 (or 366 for leap years). If DAYS-DIFFERENCE fails these edits, an
           error will result, and the program will be terminated.
           15.18.3.4.4. The form of the Julian dates must be an alphanumeric string without
           decimal points. Numeric values will contain decimal points (even if assumed) and
           will cause error termination.
               15.18.3.4.4.1. EXAMPLE:
                   15.18.3.4.4.1.1. MOVE ‘bbb’ & 202-DATE-SERIAL-NBR[1,4] TO JD;
                   15.18.3.4.4.1.2. MOVE DAYS-DIFFERENCE (JD, $SBSS-JULIAN) TO PL
                   WITH EDITING ‘99999’;
           15.18.3.4.5. PRINT PL;
   15.18.4. Length Function.
        15.18.4.1. Function. Returns the length of an alphanumeric string.

        15.18.4.4. General Rules. The expression must evaluate to an alphanumeric string.
           15.18.4.4.1. EXAMPLE:

        15.18.8.4. General Rules.
           15.18.8.4.1. Expression-1 must evaluate to a string containing the packed binary
           data. Data in this form is from 1 to 7 characters, and is not in ASCII format.
           Therefore, it may not be printable. A one (1) character packed binary number will
           unpack to a 1-or 2-digit number, and will appear on a SCHEMA or COBOL file
           description as PIC 9(2) COMP. A two (2) character packed binary number will
           unpack to a 1 through 5 digit number, and will appear on a SCHEMA or COBOL file
           description as PIC 9(5) COMP. The following table defines all seven possibilities:

           15.18.8.4.2. Expression-2 must evaluate to a number from 0 through 7, and
           represents the positioning of the decimal point in the final number. Packed binary
           numbers do not have a decimal point. The SURGE user must adjust accordingly. If a
           packed field unpacks to 583 with 0 in expression-2, it will unpack to 5.83 with a 2 in
           expression-2.
               15.18.8.4.2.1. EXAMPLES:
                  15.18.8.4.2.1.1. a. MOVE 205-MARK-FOR [10,14] TO PACKED-DATA;

Section 15J--Indexing
    15.18.9. Purpose. To explain Indexing and its uses.
    15.18.10. Indexing. Indexing is a technique that allows data items containing similar data to
    have the same name. A look-up table is a good example. The individual items would be
    distinguished by including an index in parentheses immediately after the data name. In an
    example of the month table, a data item MONTH-TAB(1) might contain the data "JAN"
    while MONTH-TAB(12) might contain the data "DEC".
       15.18.10.1. EXAMPLE:
           15.18.10.1.1. TABLE(4)
           15.18.10.1.2. A(2)
           15.18.10.1.3. #B(25)
           15.18.10.1.4. In order to tell SURGE the maximum size of a user-defined table, a
           DIMENSION statement is provided. The DIMENSION statement also identifies to
           SURGE which UDDN are tables.
       15.18.10.2. EXAMPLE:
           15.18.10.2.1. DIMENSION TABLE(15)
           15.18.10.2.2. DIMENSION #A(3)
    15.18.11. Syntax Rules.
       15.18.11.1. An indexed UDDN must have been dimensioned or an error will occur.
       15.18.11.2. A UDDN may not be dimensioned greater than 256.
 1504                                                      AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


        15.18.11.3. A DBDN that contains an occurs clause in the schema does not need a
        dimension statement as they are automatically dimensioned by SURGE. These items
        must be referenced with indexing or an error will occur.
        15.18.11.4. SDDN may not be indexed.
        15.18.11.5. Literals may not be indexed.
        15.18.11.6. A data name may not be partialed and indexed at the same time. An indexed
        item may be moved to a nonindexed item and then partialed, or a partial may be moved to
        an indexed item.
Section 15K--Partialing
   15.18.12. Purpose. To define partials and their uses.
   15.18.13. Partials. Partials define part of a data item. If an alphanumeric data item is 25
   characters and characters 8 through 15 are desired, they may be specified and pulled out.
        15.18.13.1. EXAMPLE:
           15.18.13.1.1. If DATA-NAME contained "NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL.."
           DATA-NAME[8,15] evaluates to "THE TIME".
   15.18.14. Syntax Rules.
        15.18.14.1. Literals cannot be partialed.
        15.18.14.2. UDDN.
           15.18.14.2.1. Numeric-UDDN items (beginning with "#") cannot be partialed.
           15.18.14.2.2. Alphanumeric-UDDN items can be partialed even if they contain
           numbers.
        15.18.14.3. SDDN can be partialed.
        15.18.14.4. DBDN can be partialed. PIC 9 COMP fields are numbers in binary form and
        can, for instance, represent a 10-digit decimal number in only four character positions.
        Therefore, PIC 9 COMP fields are converted to DISPLAY (expanded) form before being
        partialed. Unpredictable results may occur if an attempt is made to partial a schema
        defined group item containing PIC 9 COMP fields.
        15.18.14.5. Indexed data names may not be partialed. An indexed item may be moved to
        a nonindexed item and then partialed, or a partial may be moved to an indexed item.
15.19. Condition Names.
   15.19.1. Purpose. To define Condition Names.
   15.19.2. Condition Names. When a decision has to be made, a test could be performed such
   as does A = B. The answer would be TRUE or FALSE. When a condition name is
   referenced, SURGE makes the test and then makes available the TRUE or FALSE. FALSE
   is always represented by 0, TRUE is represented by every other value, positive or negative.
   Therefore, the value one (1) also represents TRUE.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1505


      15.19.2.1. DEFAULT is always TRUE, value one (1). This condition name may be used
      as the test of the last "OR" in a choice construct. If all other tests fail, DEFAULT will
      force this selection to process.
          15.19.2.1.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.19.2.1.1.1. DECIDE: CHOOSE SD = ‘A1’
              15.19.2.1.1.2. DO PROCESS1;
              15.19.2.1.1.3. DECIDE: OR SD = ‘A2’
              15.19.2.1.1.4. DO PROCESS2;
              15.19.2.1.1.5. DECIDE: OR DEFAULT
              15.19.2.1.1.6. DO PROCESS-OTHERS;
              15.19.2.1.1.7. DECIDE: END
      15.19.2.2. END-OF-FILE. The test "$STATUS = ‘9’" is performed, and if true, END-
      OF-FILE is given a value of one (1) (TRUE) or else it is given a value of zero (0)
      (FALSE).
      15.19.2.3. NO-FIND. The test "$STATUS = '8'" is performed and if true, NO-FIND is
      given a value of one (1) (TRUE) or else it is given a value of zero (0) (FALSE).
   15.19.3. Syntax Rules.
      15.19.3.1. Can be used in any expression.
      15.19.3.2. Cannot be partialed or indexed.

Section 15L—-Separators

15.20. Separators.
   15.20.1. Purpose. To define separators.
   15.20.2. Separators. In most cases, words are separated by spaces in the SURGE language.
   Words are recognized as words by both the programmers and the SURGE compiler because
   of the spaces. In expressions, several more separators are required. The complete list is:
      15.20.2.1. ^          space
      15.20.2.2. ,        comma
      15.20.2.3. (          left parenthesis
      15.20.2.4. )          right parenthesis
      15.20.2.5. [          left bracket
      15.20.2.6. ]          right bracket
      15.20.2.7. ;        semicolon
   15.20.3. General Rules. The space (^) separator carries no special meaning except to
   separate words or symbols; therefore, it may be repeated as desired. All the other separators
   carry a special meaning and may not be used or repeated out of context.
 1506                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


Section 15M--Space
   15.20.4. Purpose. To define SPACES.
   15.20.5. Space. "^". Separates words.
        15.20.5.1. EXAMPLE:

Figure 15.23. Space Example No 1.




           15.20.5.1.1. Also separates other separators or separates separators from words.
        15.20.5.2. EXAMPLE:

Figure 15.24. Space Example No 2.




Section 15N--Comma
   15.20.6. Purpose. To explain the use of the COMMA in SURGE.
   15.20.7. Comma (“,”). The comma separates operands in functions, partials, or indexed
   database items.
        15.20.7.1. EXAMPLES:
           15.20.7.1.1. DAYS-DIFFERENCE (A,84056)
           15.20.7.1.2. A[2,16]
           15.20.7.1.3. 001-COMP-ENTR(2,3)
   15.20.8. Syntax Rules.
        15.20.8.1. May be preceded or followed by spaces.
        15.20.8.2. May be used freely within an alphanumeric literal where it does not act as a
        separator.
Section 15O--Left and Right Parentheses
   15.20.9. Purpose. To define the purpose of the parentheses.
   15.20.10. Left and Right Parentheses "( )". Parentheses do three things:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1507


      15.20.10.1. They enclose, and thereby, define the operands in a function:
          15.20.10.1.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.20.10.1.1.1. ROOT(A)
                 15.20.10.1.1.1.1. DAYS-DIFFERENCE(A, B)
      15.20.10.2. They enclose, and thereby, define the index in an indexed data name.
          15.20.10.2.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.20.10.2.1.1. SRAN(C)
             15.20.10.2.1.2. TABLE-ENTRY(25)
      15.20.10.3. They control the order of processing in an expression. All items in
      parentheses are resolved first, followed by any items outside the parentheses. All items
      within multiple parentheses are resolved from the innermost parentheses first to the
      outermost parentheses and then to any items outside the parentheses.
          15.20.10.3.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.20.10.3.1.1. (A + B) * (C + D) will not resolve the same as A + B * C + D.
   15.20.11. Syntax Rules.
      15.20.11.1. Parentheses may be preceded or followed by spaces.
      15.20.11.2. Parentheses may be freely used within an alphanumeric literal but do not
      affect the order of evaluation of an expression containing such a literal.
      15.20.11.3. For every opening parenthesis, "(", there must be a closing parentheses, ")".
Section 15P--Left and Right Brackets
   15.20.12. Purpose. To define brackets.
   15.20.13. Left and Right Brackets "[ ]". Brackets enclose and thereby, define the operands
   in partials.
      15.20.13.1. EXAMPLE:
          15.20.13.1.1. A[1,3]
          15.20.13.1.2. B[FROM,TO]
   15.20.14. Syntax Rules.
      15.20.14.1. May be preceded or followed by spaces.
      15.20.14.2. May be used freely within an alphanumeric literal where they do not act as
      separators.

Section 15Q—-Operators

15.21. Operators.
   15.21.1. Purpose. To define Operators as used in SURGE.
1508                                                     AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


  15.21.2. Operators. All expressions are comprised of operands and operators. Operands are
  those data items operated upon. In the expression "A + B", "A" and "B" are operands.
  Operators tell what is to be done to the operands. In the expression "A + B", "+" is the
  operator. Operators range from the familiar arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide)
  to the less familiar logical and concatenation operators.
  15.21.3. Arithmetic Operators. Arithmetic operators work on numeric value items and on
  numbers in alphanumeric string form. Internal conversion occurs automatically. If
  conversion is not possible, an error will occur.
       15.21.3.1. Addition (+). Adds two operands together, and places the result on an internal
       stack.
          15.21.3.1.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.3.1.1.1. A + 5
       15.21.3.2. Subtraction (-). Subtracts second operand from first operand, and places the
       result on an internal stack.
          15.21.3.2.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.3.2.1.1. B - C
       15.21.3.3. Multiplication (*). Multiplies two operands together, and places the result on
       an internal stack.
          15.21.3.3.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.3.3.1.1. B * 2
       15.21.3.4. Division (/). Divides first operand by second operand, and places the result on
       an internal stack.
          15.21.3.4.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.3.4.1.1. B / 2
  15.21.4. Relational Operators. Compares two operands and returns one (1) (TRUE) if the
  specified condition exists or zero (0) (FALSE) if the specified condition is not found. The
  result (0 or 1) is placed on an internal stack and the internal true/false flag is set. Both
  operands must be the same class; that is, numeric or alphanumeric string.
       15.21.4.1. EQUAL, =
          15.21.4.1.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.4.1.1.1. A = B
       15.21.4.2. NOT EQUAL, <>
          15.21.4.2.1. EXAMPLE:
              15.21.4.2.1.1. A <> B
       15.21.4.3. LESS THAN, <
          15.21.4.3.1. EXAMPLE:
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1509


             15.21.4.3.1.1. A < B
     15.21.4.4. GREATER THAN, >
         15.21.4.4.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.4.4.1.1. A > B
     15.21.4.5. LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO, <=
         15.21.4.5.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.4.5.1.1. A <= B
     15.21.4.6. EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN, =>
         15.21.4.6.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.4.6.1.1. A => B
  15.21.5. Logical Operators. Logical operators work on numeric value items and numbers in
  alphanumeric string form. Internal conversion occurs automatically. If conversion is not
  possible, an error will occur.
     15.21.5.1. NOT. The NOT operator inverts the value of the following operand from
     TRUE to FALSE or vice versa. If an operand has a value of zero (FALSE) the result will
     become one (TRUE). If an operand has a value other than zero, such as 1, -2, +8, 15,
     etc., (TRUE), the result will become zero (FALSE). The result (1 or 0) is placed on an
     internal stack and the internal TRUE/FALSE FLAG is set.
         15.21.5.1.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.5.1.1.1. NOT A
             15.21.5.1.1.2. NOT A = B
     15.21.5.2. AND. Compares two operands to determine if both are TRUE (not zero).
         15.21.5.2.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.5.2.1.1. A AND B
             15.21.5.2.1.2. A > B AND A > C
     15.21.5.3. OR. Compares two operands to determine if one of them is TRUE (not zero).
         15.21.5.3.1. EXAMPLE:
             15.21.5.3.1.1. A OR B
             15.21.5.3.1.2. D < E OR F = 2
  15.21.6. Concatenation (&). It is sometimes desirable to build a longer string out of two or
  more shorter strings. One use is to construct print lines. The concatenation symbol (&)
  operates on two operands. The operands must contain alphanumeric strings, representing
  either alphabetic or numeric data. An attempt to concatenate a numeric value item into a
  string will result in the numeric value item being automatically converted into a string before
  concatenation. The resultant string is placed on an internal stack.
     15.21.6.1. EXAMPLE:

           15.21.6.1.1. A & B
           15.21.6.1.2. PAGE NO., & PG-CNT
   15.21.7. Unary Minus (-). The unary minus inverts the sign of numeric-value items or
   numbers in alphanumeric string form, from plus (+) to minus (-) and vice versa. It works on
   the operand following it. Remember, the minus is not a separator and therefore must be
   preceded and followed by a space or other separator. The result is placed on an internal
   stack.
        15.21.7.1. EXAMPLE:
           15.21.7.1.1. - B
           15.21.7.1.2. - (2 + B)
           15.21.7.1.3. B * ( - A)
           15.21.7.1.4. B * ( - (A) )
   15.21.8. Function Operators.         Functions are both operators and function operators (see
   functions).
   15.21.9. General Note For Operand of Operators. In the examples above, each expression
   was represented in its most simple form. In the expression “A + B = C * D” there are 3
   operators (+, =, *). Each of these 3 operators can work on two and only two operands each.
   The plus (+) works on “A” and “B” giving an intermediate result. The multiplication (*)
   works on “C” and “D” giving a second intermediate result. No operator in this example
   works on more than two operands. This principle must be kept in mind when studying the
   above examples. The intermediate results are stored on an internal stack until needed.
Section 15R--Operators Precedence
   15.21.10. Purpose. To define Operator Precedence.
   15.21.11. Operator Precedence. Expressions are comprised of operands and operators which
   work upon the operands.
        15.21.11.1. EXAMPLE:
           15.21.11.1.1. A + B * C - 2
           15.21.11.1.2. This example has three operators. The order in which the operations
           occur is determined by two things: (1) parentheses, and (2) operator precedence.
   15.21.12. Overriding Operator Precedence. The order in which SURGE evaluates
   expressions can be changed by using parentheses. Operations within parentheses are
   performed first. If more than one set of parentheses is present, SURGE evaluates them from
   left to right. Parentheses can be nested within parentheses. SURGE will evaluate the
   innermost set first, then the next innermost, proceeding to the outermost set. Parentheses
   may be nested to any level and used freely to clarify the order of operations within an
   expression. The SURGE compiler can detect and will indicate when an expression becomes
   too large or complex. This would be caused by the physical limitations of the computer, not
   the evaluation technique and should be a rare occurrence.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                1511


   15.21.13. Precedence. All operators have a precedence which determines the order in which
   they are processed. For example; multiplication (*) has a higher precedence than plus. In the
   expression "2 + 3 * 4", the "3 * 4" will evaluate to 12 and then the 2 will be added to 12
   giving 14. This illustrates the rule that operators with the higher precedence will evaluate
   first. Plus (+) and minus (-) have the same precedence and process in sequence. In the
   example "2 + 3 - 4", the "2 + 3" is evaluated first giving 5, and then 4 is subtracted from 5
   giving 1. This illustrates the rule that operators of the same precedence are evaluated from
   left to right. The details of each operator are best expressed in table form. Please refer to
   Table of Precedence.
Section 15S--Legend for Table of Precedence
   15.21.14. Purpose. To define items in Table of Precedence (Table 15.7).

      equal to, and greater than. See operators for complete description.
      15.21.15.7. Logical. These are also referred to as Boolean operators. See operators for
      complete details.
   15.21.16. Column 2 - Precedence. This column contains the actual precedence number
   which is used to determine the order of processing not otherwise modified by parentheses.
   Precedence 9 is reserved for expansion. Operators with a higher precedence are processed
   first.
   15.21.17. Column 3 - Operator/Function. This column contains the actual symbol or name
   that SURGE will recognize as the operator. Some items are both operators and functions;
   these are referred to as functions.
   15.21.18. Columns 4 and 5 - Class, Input/Output. These two columns specify the class of
   data that each operator can operate upon, and the class of data that the operation will output.
      15.21.18.1. ANS. Alphanumeric string. This class is a string of characters, including a
      string which looks like a number.
      15.21.18.2. NV. Numeric value. This class is a number that can be used efficiently in a
      mathematical process.

    15.21.19. Column 6 - # of Operands. This column specifies the number of operands which
    each operator acts upon. If the number of operands is one (1), the operator is said to be either
    a unary operator or a unary function. If the number of operands is two (2), the operator is
    said to be either a binary operator or a binary function.

Notes:
1. ANS. NV will be automatically converted to ANS before the operation is performed.
2. ANS or NV. Both input operands must be the same class or an error will occur.
3. NV. ANS will be automatically converted to NV, if possible, before operation is performed. If
conversion is impossible, an error will occur.
4. ANS. This is really numeric data in pure binary form. Some values appear to be alphanumeric data
while others appear to be special characters or even unprintable garbage. This data can be moved around
as if it were an alphanumeric string.
15.22. The Expression Construction.
   15.22.1. Purpose. To define the EXPRESSION.
         15.22.1.1. Function. Expressions cause data items to work upon data items under the
         control of operators. Therefore, expressions are just that. They are expressions of what
         is to happen with the data items specified in the expression.
            15.22.1.1.1. EXAMPLE:
                15.22.1.1.1.1. A * (B + C)
                15.22.1.1.1.2. This says, add B and C and then multiply the result by A. This
                expression does not say what to do with the result, just to calculate it. What is
                done with the result is determined by the SURGE construct or SURGE verb
                phrase in which it appears. The expression construction is best described in three
                forms, simple, intermediate, and compound. Each of these three forms has its
                own skeleton.

       15.22.1.3. Syntax Rules. None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton.
       15.22.1.4. General Rules.
          15.22.1.4.1. The class of the data output from an expression is determined by the last
          operation performed. The two classes are alphanumeric string (ANS) or numeric
          value (NV).
              15.22.1.4.1.1. EXAMPLE:
                  15.22.1.4.1.1.1. (NAME IS & NAMEFIELD) = B
                  15.22.1.4.1.1.2. The literal NAME IS would be concatenated with the name
                  in NAMEFIELD producing an ANS. That ANS would be compared with the
                  contents of B producing a numeric value one (TRUE) or zero (FALSE). The
                  class of data output from this expression would be numeric value.
          15.22.1.4.2. Some expressions can get too complicated because of the limited
          number of internal registers. If SURGE does not give the warning "expression too
          complex", it will evaluate correctly.
          15.22.1.4.3. All operators may be combined in one expression.              There are no
          combinations of operators in an expression that are invalid.
              15.22.1.4.3.1. EXAMPLE:
                  15.22.1.4.3.1.1. #A = #B = #C is valid but tricky
                  15.22.1.4.3.1.2. (A OR B) + 2 is valid
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                             1515


                 15.22.1.4.3.1.3. ROOT(C * D(2)/(1 + B)) is valid
          15.22.1.4.4. Since automatic conversion between ANS and NV, or NV and ANS
          occurs for intermediate values in some expressions, care must be exercised when
          writing them because although any NV can be converted to an ANS, not every ANS
          can be converted to an NV.
          15.22.1.4.5. Notice that simple expressions can be part of intermediate-level
          expressions and that simple, intermediate level, and complex expressions can be
          included in complex expressions. This allows for expressions as complex or as
          simple as the programmer wishes to use.

Section 15U—-Program Constructs

15.23. Program Constructs.
   15.23.1. Purpose. To define program constructs in general.
   15.23.2. Program Constructs. The program construct is a syntactically correct and complete
   string of words beginning with a program construct name, a word identifying the type of
   program construct (SEQUENCE, CHOOSE, OR, REPEAT, ASSUME) and ending with the
   same program construct name and the key word END. A program construct tells the SURGE
   program when to do something. Program constructs and verb phrases can be nested within
   program constructs. There are four types of program constructs: sequential, choice,
   repetition, and assumption/admission.
Section 15V--Sequential Construct
   15.23.3. Purpose. To define the Sequential Construct.

          15.23.3.3.1. Both construct-names must be the same.
          15.23.3.3.2. There are no spaces between the construct-names and the colons. There
          is at least one space following the colons.
          15.23.3.3.3. The construct-body is made up of one or more syntactically correct and
          complete verb phrases and program constructs.

           is at least one space following the colons.
           15.23.4.3.3. The construct-bodies are made up of zero or more syntactically correct
           and complete verb phrases and program constructs.

          15.23.4.3.4. The syntax rules for expressions are defined in the paragraph on
          expressions.
      15.23.4.4. General Rules.
          15.23.4.4.1. The expressions can be thought of as conditions which can be true or
          false. For example, the expression A = B is considered true if A equals B, false if A
          does not equal B. During execution, the expressions will be scanned until one is
          found that is true. The construct-body that immediately follows that expression will
          be executed. All other construct-bodies are skipped.
          15.23.4.4.2. If none of the expressions are found to be true, nothing will be executed.
          15.23.4.4.3. If DEFAULT is coded in place of the second or subsequent expressions,
          that condition is always assumed to be true. For this reason, if DEFAULT is used in
          place of an expression other than the last condition, all subsequent conditions become
          meaningless, and their associated construct bodies will never be executed.
             15.23.4.4.3.1. EXAMPLE 1: (see general rules in paragraphs below)

   15.23.5. Purpose. To define the Repetition Construct.
        15.23.5.1. Function. To execute a series of verb phrases and program constructs zero or
        more times.

        15.23.5.3. Syntax Rules.
           15.23.5.3.1. Both construct-names are the same.
           15.23.5.3.2. There are no spaces between the construct-names and the colons (:).
           There is at least one space following the colons.
           15.23.5.3.3. The construct-body is one or more syntactically correct and complete
           verb phrases and program constructs.
        15.23.5.4. General Rules.
           15.23.5.4.1. The construct-body will be executed repetitively until one of the
           following conditions is met:
           15.23.5.4.2. The condition specified in the UNTIL clause is true, or
           15.23.5.4.3. The condition specified in the WHILE clause is false, or
           15.23.5.4.4. The construct body has been executed the number of times specified in
           the TIMES clause.
        15.23.5.5. The above conditions are checked before the first execution of the construct-
        body. It is, therefore, possible not to execute the construct-body at all.
        15.23.5.6. The integer-expression must be an expression that resolves to a non-negative
        integer value; otherwise an error will result.
        15.23.5.7. The integer-expression is evaluated once before the first (if any) execution of
        the construct-body. This integer value will determine the number of executions of the
        construct-body regardless of changes to the values of any data names used in the integer-
        expression.
        15.23.5.8. If no UNTIL, WHILE, or TIMES clause is specified, the construct-body
        execution will be repeated indefinitely until a STOP verb terminates the program or a
        QUIT verb (for an assumption construct in which the repetition is nested) is executed.

Section 15Y--Assumption/Admission Construct
   15.23.7. Purpose. To define the Assumption/Admission Construct.
        15.23.7.1. Function. This construct is used to execute one of two possible series of verb
        phrases and program constructs. This construct differs from the choice construct in three
        ways:
           15.23.7.1.1. There are only two choices.
           15.23.7.1.2. There is no condition to be checked as part of the construct to determine
           which of the two series of verb phrases and program constructs is to be executed.
           15.23.7.1.3. The first series of verb phrases and program constructs (the "ASSUME"
           leg) is always executed until the program determines it should have executed the
           second series of verb phrases and program constructs (the "ADMIT" leg). The Admit
           leg is then executed. This construct is particularly useful when editing for valid data.
           That is, the data is “assumed” to be valid until the program is forced to “admit” that
           the data is invalid.

           15.23.7.3.2. There are no spaces between the construct-names and the colons (:).
           There is at least one space following the colons.
           15.23.7.3.3. The construct-bodies are made up of one or more syntactically correct
           and complete verb phrases and/or program constructs.
        15.23.7.4. General Rules.
           15.23.7.4.1. Construct-body-1 will be executed until a QUIT verb is executed at
           which time execution of construct-body-1 will stop and construct-body-2 will be
           executed. If a QUIT verb is not executed as part of construct-body-1, then construct-
           body-1 will be executed completely and construct-body-2 will be skipped.
           15.23.7.4.2. A QUIT verb should be included within construct-body-1 (usually
           within a nested choice construct) or within a subroutine called by it in order for the
           assumption/admission construct to be meaningful.

Figure 15.30. DB-READ Skeleton.




        15.24.4.3. Syntax Rules.
           15.24.4.3.1. Database record-name and set-name must be the names of a record and a
           set within the SURGE processor's view of the database.
           15.24.4.3.2. The word SEQUENTIALLY is not required. If neither VIA, USING,
           DIRECT, nor SEQUENTIALLY is specified, SEQUENTIALLY is assumed.
           15.24.4.3.3. The USING clause can only be used if the specified record type can be
           accessed using a CALC key.
           15.24.4.3.4. Key-expression is either an alphanumeric literal or an ANUDDN.
           15.24.4.3.5. UDDN must be alphanumeric.
        15.24.4.4. General Rules.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                             1523


        15.24.4.4.1. After a database read, the record read is said to be the current record
        being processed of its record type and of all sets in which it participates. Sometimes
        it can be referred to simply as the current record. When reading a record type
        sequentially or when reading a set, it is extremely important for the programmer to
        keep track of which record is current. Reading a record sequentially can affect
        currency in a set and reading a record via set can affect the current record for future
        sequential reads. If currency needs to remain the same in a set or for a record type
        after the read, the SAVE and RESTORE verbs can be used to reestablish the currency
        that existed before the read. For example, if an Item-Detail set is being scanned and
        after one of the Detail Records is read, the program needs to read another related Item
        Record, the pointer to the current record within the Item-Detail set will be destroyed
        unless it is SAVED before the Item Record read and RESTORED afterwards. (See
        SAVE and RESTORE verbs.)
        15.24.4.4.2. After a read, the database record code will be available in SURGE-
        defined data item $RECORD-CODE. If the record was a Detail Record the type
        detail code will be in $TYPE-DETAIL; otherwise it will be blank. These features
        allow the program to determine which type of record was read when using the NEXT
        RECORD or NEXT DETAIL clauses.
        15.24.4.4.3. Detail Records are read into the same memory space regardless of the
        type detail. Therefore, reading a Detail Record will overlay the previous record read.
        All other record types have their own memory space and reading any other record
        will only overlay records of the same type.
        15.24.4.4.4. Using the NEXT RECORD VIA set-name option will cause the next
        record in the set (regardless of record type) to be read. The next record is the record
        to which the record currently being processed in the set points. If there is no next
        record in the set or if the current record points to the owner (e.g., a Detail Record
        points to an Item Record as the next record in the set) then an END-OF-FILE
        condition results and the current record remains the same.
        15.24.4.4.5. Using the OWNER VIA set-name option will cause the owner record of
        the specified set to be read. For example, if the owner record is read via an Item-
        Detail set, then the Item Record which points to that current Detail Record is the one
        read.
        15.24.4.4.6. Using the record-name VIA set-name option will cause the set to be
        canned from the current record towards the end of the set looking for the first record
        encountered of the name specified. If one is found it is read. If one is not found
        before reaching the end of the set, or the owner record, an END-OF-FILE condition
        results and the current record remains the same.
        15.24.4.4.7. When trying to find more than one detail record type in the same scan,
        use DB-READ NEXT RECORD VIA set-name and check $RECORD-CODE to
        determine which record you have just read. This type of read will find all record
        types in a given area.

          15.24.4.4.8. The USING clause reads the record of the type specified which contains,
          in its key field, a value equal to the key-expression. If no such record exists, a NO-
          FIND condition results.
          15.24.4.4.9. Using the DIRECT clause requires that $PAGE-NUM and $RECORD-
          NUM be set to the 5-digit page number and record number of the record to be read.
          If these fields are not numeric an error results and the program is terminated. If they
          do not represent a valid page and record number of the specified record type, a NO-
          FIND condition occurs. If neither of the above conditions occur, then the DIRECT
          option will read the record of the specified record type that is at the location given in
          $PAGE-NUM and $RECORD-NUM.
          15.24.4.4.10. The SEQUENTIALLY clause causes the next record within the
          database of the specified type to be read. If the NEXT DETAIL clause is also
          specified, then any Detail Record is considered to be of the specified type.
          15.24.4.4.11. The result of the latest DB-READ executed is left in SURGE-defined
          data item $STATUS. If the STATUS clause is used the result will also be left in the
          UDDN. Possible values for this status and the meanings are:
              15.24.4.4.11.1. 0 - Successful completion
              15.24.4.4.11.2. 8 - Record not found (NO-FIND)
              15.24.4.4.11.3. 9 - End of file/set (END-OF-FILE)
              15.24.4.4.11.4. For examples, refer to ACCESS/SURGE(0) handout.
              15.24.4.4.11.5. When reading records where overflow of CALC chain occurs
              (that is, transaction history) use the following example:
              15.24.4.4.11.6. A: SEQUENCE
              15.24.4.4.11.7. DB-READ            901/TRANSACTION-HISTORY                   USING

  15.24.5. RESTORE Verb.
       15.24.5.1. Function. The Restore verb reestablishes a record as the current record being
       processed within the specified set (for reading VIA SET) or of the specified record type
       (for reading sequentially). The record is reread using the database location (database
       key) previously saved.

      15.24.5.3. Syntax Rules.
         15.24.5.3.1. Set-name and record-name are both DBDN and must specify either a set
         in which the record to be reread participates, or the correct record-name of that
         record.
         15.24.5.3.2. UDDN must be an ANUDDN.
      15.24.5.4. General Rules.
         15.24.5.4.1. After execution of the RESTORE verb the record specified by the
         database location (database key) in UDDN will be reread.
         15.24.5.4.2. If the SET clause is specified, the record will be established as the
         current record being processed within that record set (set currency).
         15.24.5.4.3. If the RECORD clause is specified, the record will be established as the
         current record being processed of that record type only (record currency).
         15.24.5.4.4. If neither the SET nor RECORD clause are specified, the record will be
         established as the current record of its own record type and the current record being
         processed within all sets in which it participates (both record and set currency).
         15.24.5.4.5. If either the SET or RECORD clause is specified and the record read
         does not participate in the specified set or is not of the specified record type then an
         error will occur and the program will terminate. UDDN must contain the location
         (database key) of a record in the database obtained from a previous SAVE command.
             15.24.5.4.5.1. EXAMPLE:
                 15.24.5.4.5.1.1. See example in SAVE VERB, below.
   15.24.6. SAVE Verb.
      15.24.6.1. Function. The SAVE verb saves the location within the database (the
      database key) of the record currently being processed within the specified set (when
      reading via set) or of the specified record type (when reading sequentially). This location
      may later be used to restore the record as the one currently being processed.

        15.24.6.4. General Rules.
           15.24.6.4.1. After execution of the SAVE verb the UDDN will contain the 4-
           character database key (location within the database) of the most currently processed
           record within the set or of the record type specified.
           15.24.6.4.2. This key will most likely contain unprintable characters and therefore,
           should not be printed or displayed. The key can be moved to another data name,
           written to disk to be read later, and used to restore a record as the current record being
           processed.

          15.24.7.4.1. The START verb when used with the data-base-record-name option
          causes the next DB-READ SEQUENTIALLY (of the specified record type) to read
          the first record of that type in the database.
          15.24.7.4.2. The START verb, when used with the DETAIL option, causes the next
          DB-READ NEXT DETAIL SEQUENTIALLY to read the first detail record in the
          database.
          15.24.7.4.3. If the last record is read (end of file) that record name is automatically
          STARTed again.
          15.24.7.4.4. The DETAIL record and all other record types will automatically be

          for reads and writes unless it is RE-OPENED.
             15.24.9.4.1.1. If the DELETE option is specified, the file is dropped from the
             system and is no longer available to any user. Files that are already opened must
             be closed before closing and/or deleting any other files.

               15.24.9.4.1.2. The delete option may only be used with files opened for input.
           15.24.9.4.2. If the file is a tape file: after the file is closed it is no longer available to
           the program and may not be opened again; the tape is rewound and the tape drive is
           made available to other runs; a tape file may not be deleted.
               15.24.9.4.2.1. All open files are closed automatically when the program ends.
               15.24.9.4.2.2. All files opened for work (that is, the OPEN verb phrase contained
               a WORK clause) and not closed are closed and deleted automatically when the
               program ends (if they have not already been deleted).

         15.24.10.3.1. Format 1.
             15.24.10.3.1.1. Filename-1 is one of the internal filenames for disk (DISK-1,
             DISK-2, DISK-3, DISK-4, DISK-5).
             15.24.10.3.1.2. Filename-2 is the external filename under which the file is (or
             will be) cataloged in the system. It must have a qualifier if the SAME clause is
             not specified, and it must not have a qualifier if the SAME clause is specified.
             15.24.10.3.1.3. The WORK clause can be used only with OPEN OUTPUT. (The
             file may later be closed and reopened for input.)
             15.24.10.3.1.4. Integer-1 must be equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal
             to the maximum record size listed in Para. 15.15. for filename-1.
             15.24.10.3.1.5. Integer-2 if used, must be equal to 1.
         15.24.10.3.2. Format 2.
             15.24.10.3.2.1. Filename-3 must be an internal disk filename (see Para 15.16.).
             15.24.10.3.2.2. There must be an OPEN and CLOSE for filename-3 elsewhere in
             the program.

             15.24.10.3.3.1. Filename-4 must be one of the internal filenames for SURGE tape
             files which is listed in Para 15.16.

              15.24.10.3.3.2. The data names must be ANUDDN.
              15.24.10.3.3.3. The literal must in quotes and six characters long.
              15.24.10.3.3.4. Up to twelve (12) reels may be specified.
          15.24.10.3.4. Format 4.
              15.24.10.3.4.1. Filename-5 must be one of the internal filenames for SBSS tape
              files listed in Para 15.16.
              15.24.10.3.4.2. Filename-6 must be a qualified external filename of an already
              cataloged file.
              15.24.10.3.4.3. The rules for the data names and literals from format 3 apply.
              15.24.10.3.4.4. Up to twelve (12) reels may be specified.
          15.24.10.3.5. Filename-2 and filename-6 are alphanumeric literals enclosed in single
          quotes.
       15.24.10.4. General Rules.
          15.24.10.4.1. The USING clause in formats 1 and 4 and the SAME clause in format
          1 are used to determine the external filename (the name under which the file is
          cataloged in the Master File Directory) of the file being opened. The rules used to
          determine the filename are as follows:
              15.24.10.4.1.1. If the USING clause is specified (in formats 1 and 4) and the
              SAME clause is not, then the external filename will be taken entirely from the
              USING clause. The filename or the contents of the data name in the USING
              clause must be a fully qualified filename.
              15.24.10.4.1.2. If both the USING clause and the SAME clause are specified
              (format 1 only) then the qualifier will be gBPSxxx (where g is the gang number
              and xxx is the restart number assigned by NGV801). The rest of the filename will
              be taken from the USING clause. The filename or the contents of the data name
              in the USING clause must be an unqualified filename.
              15.24.10.4.1.3. If the SAME clause is specified and the USING clause is not
              (format 1 only), then the qualifier will be gBPS xxx (see rule above) and the
              filename will be the one associated with the internal filename in Para 15.16.
              15.24.10.4.1.4. If neither the SAME nor the USING clause is specified (that is,
              the WORK clause is specified in format 1), then the external filename is built
              entirely by the SURGE processor. Since work files only exist during the
              execution of the local SURGE program (it is deleted when the programs ends),the
              programmer does not need to be concerned with what the external filename is.
          15.24.10.4.2. Files that are opened for input must be already cataloged in the system
          Master File Directory under the external filename derived as shown in the above
          paragraph. SURGE will attempt to assign the file. If the attempt is successful, the
          file is opened and processing continues. If the file cannot be assigned, an error results
          and the program is terminated.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              1531


         15.24.10.4.3. Files that are opened for output (but not for work) need not, but may be
         already cataloged. If the file is not catalogued, SURGE will catalog and assign it. If
         the cataloging and assigning are successful, the file is opened and processing
         continues. Otherwise, an error results and the program is terminated.
         15.24.10.4.4. Files OPENED for WORK must not be cataloged. If they are, an error
         results and the program is terminated. Otherwise, the procedures for opening are the
         same as in the paragraph above.
         15.24.10.4.5. Reel numbers must be specified in the order they are to be used. Blank
         reel numbers are interpreted as no reel and are ignored.
         15.24.10.4.6. Record and block lengths given on a file opened for input must match
         the existing record and block lengths of that file. If not, an error results and the
         program is terminated.
         15.24.10.4.7. A file may not be reopened unless it has been previously opened and is
         currently closed at the time of the execution of the reopen.
      15.24.10.5. Skeleton. Specific formats.
         15.24.10.5.1. Output to be reinput by the same program. Project-ID becomes the

       15.24.14.4. General Rules.
          15.24.14.4.1. The values of the data names and literals will be displayed at the RPS
          console. It is the programmer's responsibility to add spaces as necessary for
          readability.
          15.24.14.4.2. The QUERY verb differs from DISPLAY by temporarily halting the
          program until the RPS operator keys in a response. This response (up to 80
          characters long) will be available to the program in $RESPONSE. The QUERY verb
          phrase must be immediately proceeded by a DISPLAY verb phrase.
          15.24.14.4.3. The length of the values of the data names and literals, when thought of
          as a single string, must be less than 320 characters.

          15.24.15.4.1. If the last FORMAT verb executed had the OFF option the EJECT verb
          will do nothing.
          15.24.15.4.2. If the last FORMAT verb executed did not have the OFF option and the
          form being printed is not at the top of a page, then the form will be positioned at the
          top of the next page after printing a trailer (if required). If the form is already at the

         top of the page, the EJECT verb will simply position the form at the top of the next
         page and print nothing.
             15.24.15.4.2.1. EXAMPLE:
                15.24.15.4.2.1.1. SD-COMPARE:        CHOOSE NEW-SYS-DES <> OLD-

          15.24.16.3.2. None of the clauses within the double bars are required. The default
          values for these clauses are:
              15.24.16.3.2.1. 1. LINES - 66.
              15.24.16.3.2.2. 2. TOP - 6.

          shorter.
       15.24.16.4. General Rules.
          15.24.16.4.1. The following actions are taken when the FORMAT verb is executed:
              15.24.16.4.1.1. Any open report is closed and directed to the printer specified in
              $REPORT-PRINTER.
              15.24.16.4.1.2. $REPORT-SD is examined. If it contains a valid system
              designator and the base constants contains a printer device name for that system
              designator, then $REPORT-PRINTER is set to that device name. If $REPORT-
              SD is blank or contains an invalid system designator, then $REPORT-PRINTER
              is examined. If $REPORT-PRINTER is blank or if it does not contain a valid
              printer device name, then $REPORT-PRINTER will be set to the device name of
              the 01 account printer (host RPS printer; i.e.; 014-SITE-ID of the (014) BASE-
              CONSTANTS-2 record).
              15.24.16.4.1.3. The following SDDN will be set as follows:
                 15.24.16.4.1.3.1. $LINES-PER-PAGE will be set to the value of integer-1.
                 15.24.16.4.1.3.2. $LINES-PRINTED will be set to zero.
                 15.24.16.4.1.3.3. $TOP-LINES and $BOTTOM-LINES will be set to the
                 values of integer-2 and integer-3, respectively.
                 15.24.16.4.1.3.4. $LINE-SPACING will be set to 1 for SINGLE spacing, 2
                 for DOUBLE spacing or 3 for TRIPLE. (Note: Can be set to a value from 1-
                 9 by the programmer.)

               15.24.16.4.1.3.5. $NBR-HEADERS will be set to 1, 2, or 3 based on the
               HEADER/HEADERS clause or 0 if the HEADER/HEADERS clause was not
               specified.
               15.24.16.4.1.3.6. $TRAILER-FLAG will be set to 1 if the TRAILER clause
               was specified; if not, $TRAILER-FLAG will be set to 0.
        15.24.16.4.2. If the HEADER/HEADERS clause was specified and $REPORT-SD
        contained a valid system designator, information will be placed in the first header
        ($HEADER-1)as follows:
           15.24.16.4.2.1. Columns 1-9 will be set to the SBSS calendar date ($SBSS-
           DATE).
           15.24.16.4.2.2. Columns 11-26 will be set to the base name (from the base
           constants) associated with the system designator in $REPORT-SD.
           15.24.16.4.2.3. Columns 102-107 will be set to the SRAN (from the base
           constants) associated with the system designator in $REPORT-SD.
           15.24.16.4.2.4. Columns 109-112 will be set to the constant “DATE”.
           15.24.16.4.2.5. Columns 114-117 will be set to the SBSS Julian date ($SBSS-
           JULIAN).
           15.24.16.4.2.6. If STANDARD (in the PAGE clause) was specified, columns
           120-123 will be set to the content “PAGE”.
           15.24.16.4.2.7. The LINES clause specifies the length of the form in lines per
           page.
        15.24.16.4.3. The TOP and BOTTOM clauses specify the number of blank lines at
        the top and bottom of the form, respectively.
        15.24.16.4.4. The HEADER clause (in the PAGE clause) specifies the number of
        header lines printed at the top of each page. A blank line is always printed after the
        first line of the header and (if more than one header line is called for) after the last
        line. The contents of the headers must be placed in $HEADER-1 through
        $HEADER-3 by the programmer except as stated above.
        15.24.16.4.5. The TRAILER clause (in the PAGE clause) specifies that a trailer is to
        be printed at the bottom of each page.
        15.24.16.4.6. The PAGE clause specifies that the page number is to be placed in the
        HEADER or TRAILER in the column specified (integer-4) and the next three
        columns. The STANDARD option places the page number in the header, (columns
        125 through 128).
        15.24.16.4.7. The OFF clause initiates unformatted printing (that is, bin labels, or
        other header-less reports).   Formatting, in this case, is the programmer's
        responsibility.
        15.24.16.4.8. If the 001-PRINT-QUEUE equals “1” and the 014-SITE-ID does not
        equal spaces, the report also goes to the SAFETY PRINT QUEUE (Function 498,
        System Designator 01).

   15.24.17. PRINT Verb.
        15.24.17.1. Function. The PRINT verb causes one line of data to be printed.                  If
        formatting is not off, headers, trailers, and page numbering are automatic.

        15.24.17.3. Syntax Rules.
           15.24.17.3.1. Literals may be alphanumeric or numeric.
           15.24.17.3.2. The total length of printed information must be less than or equal to
           132 characters long.
        15.24.17.4. General Rules.
           15.24.17.4.1. If the form is at the top of a page and formatting is on, then the page
           number will be incremented by 1, placed in the header or trailer, and the required
           blank lines and the headers will be printed. Note: The headers will be printed only
           after a request to print a body (detail) line on the page. If nobody lines are printed,
           there will be no headers.
           15.24.17.4.2. The data will be printed.
           15.24.17.4.3. It is the programmer's responsibility to insert spaces as necessary to
           separate printed items. It is suggested that items to be printed are moved to a single
           data item which is 132 characters long and that the one item is printed.
           15.24.17.4.4. If formatting is on, sufficient blank lines will be printed to accomplish
           double or triple spacing if called for.
           15.24.17.4.5. If no more room to print detail lines is left on the page the trailer is
           printed (if required) and the form is positioned at the very top of the next page.
           15.24.17.4.6. When a report is closed and if formatting is on and the form is not at
           the top of the page, blank lines are printed down to the trailer, the trailer is printed (if
           required) and the form is positioned at top of the next page.
           15.24.17.4.7. A report is closed when a new format command is issued or when the
           program is finished.
               15.24.17.4.7.1. EXAMPLE:
                  15.24.17.4.7.1.1. MOVE 21 TO #AGE;
                  15.24.17.4.7.1.2. MOVE ‘GARY’ TO NAME;

      15.24.19.4. General Rules.
          15.24.19.4.1. CONVERT JULIAN requires that SUDDN $JULIAN-CONV be preset
          to the Julian date being converted. The format of this Julian date is seven digits, four
          for year and three for day. The year's portion may have spaces as the first three
          characters. In this case the SURGE processor will assume the decade to be the one
          that makes the year the closest to the current year. In the case where two possible
          selections will be 5 years away, the earlier date will be used. The day portion of the
          Julian date must be between 001 and 365 (or 366 for leap years). If $JULIAN-CONV
          fails these edits, an error will result and the program will terminate. Upon successful
          completion of the conversion $CALENDAR-CONV will contain the equivalent
          calendar date in this format: four digits for year, one space, three-character
          alphabetic month (first three positions of the month name), one space, and two digits
          for day of month. $NUMERIC-MONTH will contain a number between 01 and 12
          (the numeric code for the month). $FISCAL-CONV will contain the four-digit fiscal
          year of the date converted.

  15.24.20. DIMENSION Verb.
     15.24.20.1. Function. The DIMENSION verb tells the tokenization process that a
     UDDN is to be indexed so that it can be used to create tables of like data.
     15.24.20.2. Skeleton.
        15.24.20.2.1. DIMENSION UDDN (integer)
        15.24.20.2.2. [VALUES ARE literal [ literal ] . . . ];
     15.24.20.3. Syntax Rules.
        15.24.20.3.1. The integer must be a numeric literal with an integer value between 2
        and 255 (for alphanumeric items) or 2 and 128 (for numeric items).
        15.24.20.3.2. The literals must conform to the value for alphanumeric literals or
        numeric literals depending on the type of the UDDN.
        15.24.20.3.3. The number of literals may not be greater than the integer. Although
        the dimension of a UDDN can be up to 128 and 255 items, there is a physical limiting
        factor on the number of values which can be placed in the VALUES ARE clause.
        This limiting factor is an internal Phrase Table (PT), which limits the values to
        around 30 in number. This does not limit the size of the table, just the number of
        initial values.
     15.24.20.4. General Rules.
        15.24.20.4.1. The DIMENSION verb must be included in the user's program before
        any reference to the UDDN.
        15.24.20.4.2. The DIMENSION verb is meaningful to the tokenization process only.
        It produces no executable coding. For this reason it may appear anywhere within the
        user's program within the limits stated in rule a, above. It is recommended, however,
        to code it at the beginning of the program for ease of program maintenance.
        15.24.20.4.3. Other references to the UDDN should be indexed to access the data
        within the table. This index must have a positive integer value less than or equal to
        the integer from the DIMENSION verb.
1542                                                    AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


        15.24.20.4.4. The value of UDDN (1) will be preset to literal no.1. The value of
        UDDN, (2) will be preset to literal no. 2, etc. These values may be changed during
        the execution of the program using the MOVE statement.
        15.24.20.4.5. If the number of literals is less than the integer, then the values of the
        highest occurrences of UDDN will not be preset and will need to be set by the
        program.
           15.24.20.4.5.1. EXAMPLE 1:
               15.24.20.4.5.1.1. DIMENSION TAB-OF-MON(3) VALUES ‘JAN’ ‘FEB’

      15.24.21.1. Function. The DROP verb makes the memory space used by a UDDN
      available for other UDDN’s when one of the data names is no longer needed.

         15.24.21.2.1. DROP UDDN;
      15.24.21.3. Syntax Rules. None; the syntax is described fully in the skeleton.
      15.24.21.4. General Rules.
         15.24.21.4.1. Any data that had been previously moved to the UDDN will no longer
         be available.
         15.24.21.4.2. The memory space assigned to the UDDN will be made available for
         reuse.
         15.24.21.4.3. Moving data to the UDDN at a later point in the program will cause
         memory space to be reallocated.
             15.24.21.4.3.1. EXAMPLE:
                 15.24.21.4.3.1.1. % VAR HAS NO DATA AND TAKES UP NO SPACE.
                 15.24.21.4.3.1.2. MOVE ‘THIS IS SOME DATA‘ TO VAR;

                 15.24.21.4.3.1.5. % VAR HAS NO DATA AND TAKES UP NO SPACE.
   15.24.22. MOVE Verb.
      15.24.22.1. Function. The MOVE verb establishes a value for a SDDN or a UDDN. It
      also concatenates alphanumeric data, manipulates strings, performs mathematical
      calculations, and edits dollar sign, decimal point and comma insertion as well as zero
      suppression.

      15.24.22.3. Syntax Rules.
         15.24.22.3.1. The UDDN or the SDDN may be subscripted or may be partialed.
         15.24.22.3.2. The EDITING clause may only be used when moving to an ANUDDN
         (see Edit Strings).
         15.24.22.3.3. The edit-string is an alphanumeric literal (in quotes)
1544                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


       15.24.22.4. General Rules. Numeric expressions, when evaluated, must yield a number
       between 999,999,999 and -999,999,999. Decimal digits beyond seven digits to the right
       of the decimal point will be dropped; therefore calculations will only be accurate to six
       decimal places. The seventh place can be used to determine which way to round the
       sixth.
          15.24.22.4.1. Alphanumeric Move.
              15.24.22.4.1.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in an
              alphanumeric string is moved to an ANUDDN that has not been partialed.
              15.24.22.4.1.2. The alphanumeric string resulting from evaluation of the
              expression is moved to the UDDN.
              15.24.22.4.1.3. The length of the UDDN is adjusted to the length of the string
              moved to it.
          15.24.22.4.2. Alphanumeric Partial Move.
              15.24.22.4.2.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in an
              alphanumeric string is moved to a partialed ANUDDN or a partialed or
              unpartialed SDDN.
              15.24.22.4.2.2. The alphanumeric string resulting from evaluation of the
              expression is moved to the specific part of the UDDN or the specified part of the
              SDDN or the entire SDDN according to these rules:
                  15.24.22.4.2.2.1. The length of the receiving item (the partialed UDDN or the
                  partialed or unpartialed SDDN) is a fixed length.
                  15.24.22.4.2.2.2. If the specified part of the receiving item does not exist (that
                  is, the current length of the whole item is less that either the starting or ending
                  character of the partial) then an error results and the program is terminated.
                  This is because the length of a partialed item is not adjusted by moving data to
                  it.
                  15.24.22.4.2.2.3. If the lengths of the specified part of the receiving item is
                  greater than the length of the alphanumeric string, then the string will be
                  moved to the leftmost characters of the specified part of the receiving item
                  and the rightmost characters will be space filled.
                  15.24.22.4.2.2.4. If the lengths are equal, the string will be moved to and will
                  fill the specified part of the receiving item.
                  15.24.22.4.2.2.5. If the length of the specified part of the receiving item is
                  less than the length of the alphanumeric string, then the specified part of the
                  receiving item will be filled, beginning with its leftmost character, continuing
                  until the specified part of the receiving item is filled. An execution time
                  warning will be printed.
          15.24.22.4.3. Alphanumeric to Numeric.
              15.24.22.4.3.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in an
              alphanumeric string is moved to a numeric UDDN.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                               1545


           15.24.22.4.3.2. If the resulting alphanumeric string cannot be converted into a
           number, an error results and the program is terminated.
           15.24.22.4.3.3. In memory, the format of the numeric UDDN has a sign followed
           by exactly nine digits, a decimal point, and then seven decimal digits.
           15.24.22.4.3.4. If the alphanumeric string has more than seven digits to the right
           of the decimal point, the digits beyond the seventh will be dropped.
           15.24.22.4.3.5. If the alphanumeric string has no decimal point, then it is
           assumed to be to the right of the string's rightmost character.
           15.24.22.4.3.6. The sign of the NUDDN is set according to the sign in the
           alphanumeric string. If the string has no sign, it is assumed to be positive.
        15.24.22.4.4. Numeric Move. This type of move is done when an expression results
        in a numeric value and that value is moved to a NUDDN.
        15.24.22.4.5. Numeric Edited Move.
           15.24.22.4.5.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in a
           numeric value is moved to an ANUDDN.
           15.24.22.4.5.2. The numeric value of the expression is used to generate an
           alphanumeric string based on the edit string.
           15.24.22.4.5.3. The generated string is then moved to the UDDN whose length
           will be adjusted to the length of the generated string.
        15.24.22.4.6. Numeric to Alphanumeric Move.
           15.24.22.4.6.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in a
           numeric value is moved to an unpartialed ANUDDN without editing.
           15.24.22.4.6.2. The numeric value of the expression is used to generate an
           alphanumeric string. The string will have a minus sign as the first character (if
           negative) followed by 1 to 9 digits followed by a decimal point followed by 0 to 7
           decimal digits. Leading zeros on the right will be suppressed (except for a zero
           immediately to the left of the decimal point).
           15.24.22.4.6.3. The generated string is then moved to the UDDN whose length
           will be adjusted to the length of the generated string.
        15.24.22.4.7. Numeric Partial Move.
           15.24.22.4.7.1. This type of move is done when an expression resulting in a
           numeric value is moved to a partialed ANUDDN or a partialed or unpartialed
           SDDN.
           15.24.22.4.7.2. The numeric value is converted to a string. This string will not
           contain the sign of the value, the decimal point, or any digits that were to the right
           of the decimal point. Leading zeros will be dropped.
           15.24.22.4.7.3. The generated string will then be moved according to the
           following rules:
               15.24.22.4.7.3.1. The length of the receiving item (the partialed UDDN or the
1546                                                       AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


                  partialed or unpartialed SDDN).
                  15.24.22.4.7.3.2. If the specified part of the receiving item does not exist (that
                  is, the current length of the whole item is less than either the starting or ending
                  character of the partial) then an error results and the program is terminated.
                  15.24.22.4.7.3.3. If the length of the receiving item is less than the length of
                  the generated string an error results and the program is terminated.
                  15.24.22.4.7.3.4. If the lengths are equal, then the string will be moved to and
                  will fill the receiving item.
                  15.24.22.4.7.3.5. If the length of the receiving item is greater than the length
                  of the generated string, then the string will be moved to the rightmost
                  character of the receiving item and the leftmost characters will be zero filled.
                  15.24.22.4.7.3.6. This type of move allows the programmer to create positive,
                  whole numbers that can later be used for indexes, partials, or anything else
                  that calls for positive, whole values.
          15.24.22.4.8. General Rules Applying to all Moves.
              15.24.22.4.8.1. Numeric expressions, when evaluated, must yield a number
              between 999,999,999 and -999,999,999. Decimal digits beyond seven digits to
              the right of the decimal point will be dropped; therefore, calculations will only be
              accurate to six decimal places. The seventh place will be used to determine which
              way to round the sixth place.
              15.24.22.4.8.2. Alphanumeric expressions, when evaluated, must yield an
              alphanumeric string less than, or equal to 132 characters long.
  15.24.23. Edit Strings.
       15.24.23.1. Function. Edit strings can be used when moving a numeric value (resulting
       from the evaluation of an expression) to an alphanumeric user-defined data item. The
       edit string appears in the EDITING clause of a MOVE verb phrase. It is used to
       accomplish zero suppression and insertion of the characters 0, comma, period, +, -, *, and
       $.
       15.24.23.2. Syntax.
          15.24.23.2.1. Edit field can be up to a maximum of 36 positions in length.
          15.24.23.2.2. The edit string is coded as an alphanumeric literal (enclosed in quotes)
          containing only the characters 9, 0, comma, period, +, -, *, $, and Z.
          15.24.23.2.3. There can only be one period anywhere. If there is more than one plus
          or minus sign in the string, the Z's and asterisks may not be used. The optional dollar
          sign must be the leftmost character.
          15.24.23.2.4. If there is only one dollar sign ($) in the string it must be the leftmost
          character in the string except for the optional plus (+) or minus (-).
          15.24.23.2.5. If there is more than one dollar sign ($) in the string, the Z's and
          asterisks (*) may not be used. The dollar signs must be the leftmost characters except
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                 1547


        for the optional plus (+) or minus (-), but commas (,) may be embedded between the
        dollar signs.
        15.24.23.2.6. Z's and asterisks (*) may not be used in the same edit string.
        15.24.23.2.7. If Z's or asterisks (*) are used they must be the leftmost characters
        except for the optional plus (+) or minus (-) and a single optional dollar sign ($), but
        commas (,) may be embedded between the Z's or the asterisks.
        15.24.23.2.8. The only characters that may appear to the right of the decimal point in
        the edit string are 9 and 0.
     15.24.23.3. General Rules.
        15.24.23.3.1. The numeric value and the edit string are lined up on the decimal
        points. If there is no decimal point in the edit string it is assumed to be at the right of
        the string but does not cause decimal point insertion.
        15.24.23.3.2. An alphanumeric string equal in length to the edit string is then built
        according to the following rules:
            15.24.23.3.2.1. The decimal point in the edit string is put in the same place in the
            alphanumeric string as it is in the edit string.
            15.24.23.3.2.2. Working to the right from the decimal point, anywhere there is a
            “0” in the edit string a “0” is put in the same place in the alphanumeric string.
            Anywhere there is a “9” in the edit string, the next decimal digit to the right of the
            decimal point in the numeric value is put in the same place in the alphanumeric
            string as where the “9” is in the edit string. If there is no next decimal digit, it is
            assumed to be “0”.
            15.24.23.3.2.3. If there are no “Z's” or asterisks (*) and one or no dollar sign ($)
            to the left of the decimal point in the edit string, then creation of the alphanumeric
            string proceeds to the left from the decimal point as follows: Wherever there is a
            “0”, a comma (,), a plus (+), a minus (-), or a dollar sign ($) in the edit string that
            character is inserted in the same place in the alphanumeric string as it appears in
            the edit string. Wherever there is a “9” in the edit string the next digit to the left
            of the decimal point in the numeric value is put in the same place in the
            alphanumeric string as the “9” is in the edit string. If there is no next digit it is
            assumed to be “0”. A plus (+) in the edit string causes the sign of the numeric
            value (+ or -) to be put in the alphanumeric string in the same place as the plus (+)
            is in the edit string. A minus (-) acts the same as a plus (+) except that positive
            numeric values cause a space instead of a plus to be put in the alphanumeric
            string.
            15.24.23.3.2.4. If there are any "Z's" or asterisks (*), pluses(+), minuses (-) or
            multiple dollar signs in the edit string then editing proceeds, as outlined in the
            subparagraph above except "Z's", asterisks (*), and the second and subsequent
            dollar signs ($) are treated as 9's and then zero suppression and replacement take
            place according to these rules:
               15.24.23.3.2.4.1. The first character eligible for suppression is determined to
               be the character in the alphanumeric string being built in the same place as the
1548                                                          AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGUST 2013


                  first Z, asterisk (*), or comma (,) or the second plus, minus or dollar sign,
                  whichever comes first in the edit string.
                  15.24.23.3.2.4.2. The last character eligible for suppression is determined to
                  be the character in the alphanumeric string in the same place as the character
                  just before the first 0, 9, or period in the edit string.
                  15.24.23.3.2.4.3. If the edit string character used to indicate suppression is a
                  Z or an asterisk (*) then all 0's and commas, starting from the first character
                  eligible for suppression, will be changed to spaces (Z) or asterisks.
                  Suppression and replacement will stop after the last character eligible for
                  suppression is suppressed or before suppressing a character other than a 0 or a
                  comma.
       15.24.23.4. If the edit string character used to indicate suppression is a plus, minus or
       dollar sign, then suppression will be done as stated for suppression character “Z”. After
       suppression is complete, the single remaining plus, minus or dollar sign in the
       alphanumeric string will be moved to the position in the alphanumeric string of the last
       character suppressed (if any).
          15.24.23.4.1. EXAMPLES:
              15.24.23.4.1.1. To insert commas and a decimal point:

               15.24.23.4.1.9. .                 To NORMALIZE large numbers which can be
               explained by this example:
                   15.24.23.4.1.9.1. Gasoline is stored on the database in thousands of gallons.
               15.24.23.4.1.10. .                       To print gasoline in gallons, there are two
               solutions:
                   15.24.23.4.1.10.1. 1.    Multiply gallons by 1000 (results may not fit in a
                   NUDDN).
                   15.24.23.4.1.10.2. .                 2. Normalize.
                   15.24.23.4.1.10.3. MOVE        #GAL-IN-THOUS          TO    NGAL       EDITING

                   15.24.23.4.1.10.6. .                    The three zeros are inserted by the edit
                   string not the data.
               15.24.23.4.1.11. To NORMALIZE small numbers:
                   15.24.23.4.1.11.1. (i.e., print numbers smaller than can fit in the NUDDN)
                   15.24.23.4.1.11.2. .                 % #NUM is in 100 millionths
                   15.24.23.4.1.11.3. MOVE        #NUM-IN-100-MILL            TO   EF     EDITING

  15.24.27. QUIT Verb.
       15.24.27.1. Function. This verb is used to stop processing in the ASSUME leg of an
       assumption/admission construct and to process the ADMIT leg.
       15.24.27.2. Skeleton.
          15.24.27.2.1. QUIT construct-name;
       15.24.27.3. Syntax Rules.
          15.24.27.3.1. The construct-name must be the name of an assumption/admission
          construct, without the colon (:).
       15.24.27.4. General Rules.
          15.24.27.4.1. The QUIT must be within the ASSUME leg (or within a subroutine
          unique to the ASSUME leg) of the assumption/admission construct being QUIT.
          15.24.27.4.2. The QUIT would normally appear within a choice construct nested
          within the ASSUME leg of an assumption/admission construct. This allows for
          conditional termination of the ASSUME leg.
          15.24.27.4.3. Upon execution of the QUIT verb processing in the ASSUME leg of
          the assumption/admission construct will be stopped and the ADMIT leg will be
          processed. The program will continue to process as if the ASSUME leg had never
          been processed; that is, as if the ADMIT leg had been processed when the program
          reached the assumption/admission construct.
          15.24.27.4.4. The ADMIT leg of the assumption/admission construct should be
          programmed to undo the processing done by the ASSUME leg up to where the QUIT
          occurred.
              15.24.27.4.4.1. EXAMPLE:

  15.24.28. STOP Verb.
       15.24.28.1. Function. The STOP verb stops execution of the program and closes all
       open files.
       15.24.28.2. Skeleton.
          15.24.28.2.1. STOP;
       15.24.28.3. Syntax Rules. In order for the STOP verb to function as a program STOP
       image and not as an ECL STOP image, in the 801 runstream, the word "STOP" must not
       be placed in columns one through four of an image (reference runstream consideration).
       15.24.28.4. General Rules.
          15.24.28.4.1. Upon execution of this verb all open files are closed (reference CLOSE
          verb) and the program ends in an orderly fashion.
          15.24.28.4.2. The program will end in the same manner after completing the main
          program construct even if no STOP verb is coded.

       15.24.31.1. Function. The REM verb produces no executable coding. It exists only to
       allow comments to be inserted within a program construct in the source code. It is a
       programmer aid and is used for documentation.
       15.24.31.2. Skeleton.

       15.24.31.4. General Rules.
          15.24.31.4.1. The REM verb phrase is like any other phrase in that it begins with the
          verb “REM” and must end with a semicolon (;). Also, it may appear only where
          other verb phrases are allowed (within a CONSTRUCT) and may not appear in the
          middle of another verb phrase.
          15.24.31.4.2. The REM verb phrase differs from other verb phrases in that
          everything between REM and the semicolon (;) is ignored. Reserved words and the
          percent sign (%) may be used anywhere within the comment-entry but will not have
          their usual effect.

   15.24.32. SORT Verb.
      15.24.32.1. Function. The SORT verb is used to arrange a disk file in either ascending
      or descending order.
      15.24.32.2. Skeleton.

Figure 15.46. SORT Skeleton.




          15.24.32.2.1. Syntax Rules.
             15.24.32.2.1.1. The filename is one of the internal disk filenames.
             15.24.32.2.1.2. The key-expressions are pairs of positive integers, separated by
             commas, with no spaces in between.
             15.24.32.2.1.3. Up to 64 key-expressions can be specified, not to exceed a total
             of 64 characters in all keys added together.
      15.24.32.3. General Rules.
          15.24.32.3.1. The key-expressions point to the fields within each record to be used in
          determining the order of the file. The first number in the key is the starting character
          and the second is the ending character of the key. For example, the key-expression
          “32, 35” would specify the key field to be the 32nd, 33rd, 34th, and 35th character of
          each disk record.
          15.24.32.3.2. If ASCENDING or DESCENDING is not specified, then whichever
          was specified last will be assumed. If neither has been specified in the program,
          ASCENDING is assumed.
          15.24.32.3.3. Keys are specified in order of importance. Key-expression-1 is the
          major sort key, the last key is the minor sort key.
          15.24.32.3.4. The sort treats all fields as alphanumeric and uses the ASCII collating
          sequence.
          15.24.32.3.5. Errors in the sort will cause the program to terminate.
          15.24.32.3.6. Sort will abort if no records are on the file to be sorted. It is the
          programmer's responsibility to ensure there are records to be sorted.
          15.24.32.3.7. A DESCENDING order sort takes the “one’s compliment” of the data
          in the sort field, and then sorts that complimented data. Some special characters
          cannot be “one’s complimented” without causing error termination.

                                  PROGRAM RESUMES

Section 16A—-General Overview

16.1. Overview. This chapter contains a brief resume of all the programs used in the Standard
Base Supply System ADS. Sec. 16B lists programs in numerical sequence with a brief resume of
their purpose and function. Detailed operating procedures and instructions for Computer
Operations are outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt, Ch 5 and 6, and this part. Note: Information
regarding Fuels and Munitions is retained for reference purposes only.

Section 16B—-Program Resumes.

16.2. Program Number Assignment.
   16.2.1. USAF Programs. Standard system code/ADS identifier GV is assigned to the SBSS.
   The NGV prefix serves to control SBSS related documentation and software during
   distribution phases. Since implementation, follow-on enhancements have required some
   variation in the internal handling of unique application routines. SBSS programs applicable
   to the batch processing mode (twilight/reports) appear on the Program Bank Index (PBI) with
   a NGV prefix.
   16.2.2. A given program, such as 933, requires separately mapped ABSOLUTES to
   accommodate different processing mode demands. The standard SBLC (SBSS/NGV)
   program identification numbers assigned for SBSS applications consist of six alphanumeric
   characters and are assigned to the following categories/subcategories:

    16.2.4. Training Programs. Those programs designed and developed for formal AFMC
    SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY, Air Training and Education
    Command (AETC), or Major Command programmer training courses will be assigned six
    alpha character identification numbers.
16.3. Utility Programs (NGV000 THROUGH NGV099).
    16.3.1. Purpose. To provide direct support of USAF Materiel Management operations, to
    include database verification, scanning, rehoming, and maintaining base constants.
    16.3.2. Programs NGV003, NGV003A, and NGV003B. Programs (NGV003, NGV003A,
    NGV003B) are referred to as the Supply User Report Generator (SURGE). They allow users
    to access the database in a read-only mode to produce reports on selected data. SURGE can
    also be used as a stand-alone program to manipulate data files produced by QLP, other
    SURGE programs, or Materiel Management programs, and then produce reports and other
    disk files.
AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                                1567


     16.3.2.1. NGV003. This program reads the SURGE source code, written by the Materiel
     Management user, and converts it to a form that can be read by the SURGE compiler
     (NGV003A) which is written in COBOL. This program also reads the options on the
     SURGE select card and controls the appropriate response.
     16.3.2.2. NGV003A. This program compiles the SURGE source code provided by
     NGV003 above and compiles it down into an intermediate programming language
     referred to as “Tokens”. A compiler, by definition, converts a few simple English type
     words into many instructions. Each Token is a simple primitive instruction. The tokens
     are saved in a MSAM file for use by the executor (NGV003B). This program is written
     in COBOL.
     16.3.2.3. NGV003B. This program reads the Token file provided by NGV003A above
     and executes them as necessary, and in the order required, to accomplish the original
     intent of the SURGE user/programmer. Each Token directs this COBOL program to do a
     specific piece of code which performs math, read files, reads the database, branch for
     loops, repetition, and decisions, print reports, and all the other various things that SURGE
     can do.
  16.3.3. NGV020. This program computes the Inventory Balance and stores the results in
  022-FILLER-1. If different, move the computed Inventory Balance to 022-FILLER-1. The
  program should also output a discrepancy list in column format. The program will display
  ‘NO DISCREPANCIES DETECTED’ if there are no discrepancies.
  16.3.4. NGV024. Item Record and Repair Cycle Record Link Check provides the RPS with
  the capability to verify that a repair cycle record exists for each XD or XF type item record or
  that an XD or XF type item record exists for each repair cycle record. The program provides
  a listing of errors detected, by type, and reflects the data contents of the record.
  16.3.5. NGV027. Fail Safe provides the RPS operator with the ability to produce counts of
  basic records and detail records on the SBSS database. Selective edits are also performed on
  the item records and detail records. If an error occurs, the database key, contents, and error
  type are printed along with the counts.
  16.3.6. NGV028. Satellite Rehoming Download provides the capability to transfer selective
  satellite records to tape for rehoming actions. The records selected for processing based on
  the system designator(s) requested are: item, detail, authorized/in-use detail, repair cycle,
  fuels gains/loss, ARMS, inventory accuracy, routing identifier, and fuels management
  records. The option exists to convert data elements in the item, detail, repair cycle, and
  authorized/in-use records according to the option in the parameter image.
  16.3.7. NGV029. Support Record Downloader/Uploader downloads to tape 11 different
  types of basic support records, and it will upload these records to a newly created SBSS Host
  Account. The tape created by the download must be used for this upload.
  16.3.8. NGV030. Satellite Rehoming Upload provides the capability to load selective
  records to the SBSS database from the rehoming tape generated by program NGV028. When
  the same stock number, but different system designator, is previously loaded, the common
  data elements on the item record are transferred to the record being loaded. A printout will
  be produced indicating the number of records loaded and any reject notices that may be
  generated.

  16.3.9. NGV031. Change Stock Record Account Number scans the ITMDTL-AREA,
  REPCYC-AREA, PRTNBR-AREA, ATHINU-AREA, and ISG-AREA of the SBSS database
  for item records, repair cycle records, part number detail, authorized/in-use detail, and
  interchangeable and substitute group records when: there is a directed change to SBSS
  database records for a stock record account number SRAN and/or there is a directed change
  to SBSS database detail record (DIFM, special level, and WRM WCDO spares detail) major
  command codes within a specified system designator.
  16.3.10. NGV032. Download Bypass Record Area downloads all batch related items to the
  bypass record area of the secondary database at the end of each successful batch processing
  cycle.
  16.3.11. NGV033. Upload Bypass Record Area reloads all batch related items in the bypass
  record area downloaded by program NGV032 to the secondary database record area at the
  start of each batch processing cycle.
  16.3.12. NGV040. New Host Record Loader builds and initializes the necessary records
  required to establish an SBSS host/bare base account.
  16.3.13. NGV041.        CTH Record Download (UTL041) downloads and/or deletes
  consolidated transaction history (CTH) records and writes them to magnetic tape. Download
  may be for a single date or a range of dates (not to exceed 31 day span).
  16.3.14. NGV042. CTH Record Verification (UTL042) verifies (counts) the number of
  consolidated transaction history records on the database. Verification may be for a single
  date, a range of dates or all dates on the database.
  16.3.15. NGV043. CTH Record Upload (UTL043) reads magnetic tapes created by program
  UTL041 and loads the records from the magnetic tape to the consolidated transaction history
  (CTH) area on the database.
  16.3.16. NGV061. Document NBR Cleanup deletes Document NBR (103) records that are
  owners of an empty set.
  16.3.17. NGV068A. Base Constants Load provides each LRS function with the capability to
  determine each base requirement for input and output processing. The base constant
  elements are assigned at base level and loaded to Multi-Sequential Access Method (MSAM)
  files by this program. This data is passed to programs NGV269 and NGV068B for database

AFH23-123V2PT3 8 AUGSUT 2013                                                              1571


  16.4.13. NGV207B. RPS Operator/SBSS Communication Interface - Program NGV207B
  processes the END select image which terminates the inline mode and initiates the twilight
  mode. In this mode, no input transactions will be accepted from the inline terminals. To
  provide the RPS/main site operator the capacity to initialize or override the base constants-2
  record (terminal data), program NGV207B processes the COM REM input transaction. With
  this transaction, the operator can initialize one or all terminals UP, mark a terminal DOWN,
  place a terminal in RECEIVE mode only, place a terminal in OUTPUT mode only, with its
  output rerouted to the RPS/main printer and reroute a terminal's output to any desired output
  function number.

  the input transaction. NGV208A passes this information and the transaction to NGV209A
  for processing.
  16.4.15. NGV208B. SBSS Requirements Driver - NGV208B drives the releveling and
  follow-up process by creating the appropriate LVL or FUP inline transaction and passing it to
  NGV208A processing and submission to NGV208A. This continues until releveling and
  follow-up is complete.
  16.4.16. NGV209A. Inline Driver serves as the communication link between the programs
  required to process the SBSS transactions. They perform the program calls. They also strip
  and align data in an 80-position format from a filled- in screen.
  16.4.17. NGV209S. DPS Screen Handler serves as a DPS Screen Handler for any screen
  request.
  16.4.18. NGV210. SBSS Initialization Routine provides the RPS/main site operator the
  capability to initialize the SBSS system for either inline or off-line processing. Depending
  upon the settings of the control flags on the special control record and the codes in the INT
  transaction, program NGV210 accomplishes the following four types of initialization:
     16.4.18.1. Beginning of day (BOD).
     16.4.18.2. Restart inline.
     16.4.18.3. Restart off-line.
     16.4.18.4. Restart beginning-of-day.
     16.4.18.5. Initializing the SBSS system consists primarily of setting the appropriate flags
     ON/OFF in the special control record and initializing the base constants-2 record. When
     the base constants-2 record is initialized, all terminals are logically placed in an UP or
     DOWN status with all override function numbers removed. When the initialization is
     complete, program NGV210 will produce a 725 reject notice on the RPS/main site
     console.
  16.4.19. NGV211A/B. End-Of-Transaction Online/Batch is responsible for performing the
  following functions for all inline and batch programs.

  NGV211A to output documents and alternate print/output file to a specified NTR device.
  16.4.22. NGV215. Reject and Restore - Provides the SBSS application programs with a
  standard method for processing reject and error conditions. Each reject message consists of
  the input image, reject phrase, date, time, override flags, and up to four lines of supplemental
  data lines. A suspense record is written to the daily reject suspense record. A restore
  condition restores the database to its original condition. Each reject may be sent to additional
  terminals including the terminal originating the transaction. Each of the above conditions
  may be overridden and any combination may occur.
  16.4.23. NGV220. SBSS to MASS Interface - Accepts input from SBSS and passes
  transaction to MASS by calling DGW005.
  16.4.24. NGV221A. Pseudo Reader Loader - Processes the PSU transaction which provides
  the capability to start and restart the Pseudo Reader (NGV221B), delete pseudo transaction,
  obtain pseudo's status and set the desired processing frequency.
  16.4.25. NGV221B. Pseudo Reader - Loads and processes inline and twilight transactions
  submitted through the RPS. The transactions are placed in one of three queues and then
  passed to the inline or twilight driver for processing.
  16.4.26. NGV224. DMU Patch Report Processor - To provide a report of a FIX document
  that was created by NDA500. It is scheduled immediately following execution of the DMU
  patches provided by the user of program NDA500.

  HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT records before loading CTH records. Each
  primary gang supporting the system requires a CT-HISTORY-CONTROL record.
  16.4.28. NGV226. Interactive Communications Interface (ICI) Handler handles the SBSS
  interface with the ICI processor. When an ICI interface is required, the SBSS application
  programs (issues, shipment, etc.) set internal ICI flags and call program NGV205A, which in
  turn calls program NGV226. Program NGV226 then calls the ICI processor and internally
  passes the applicable interface records and the ICI flag settings data which tell the ICI
  processor where to send the interface records. If the ICI processor is down or the ICI
  mailbox is full or inaccessible, program NGV226 places the SBSS in Twilight Mode And

  on the contents of this record.
  16.4.55. NGV241O. SIFS OUTBOUND CONTROL UPDATE - To create and maintain the
  SIFS OUTPUT-CONTROL record in a DMS TIP environment. SIFS programs dispatch
  images output from SBSS application programs based on the contents of this record.
  16.4.56. NGV243. SIFS INBOUND SNUD PROCESSOR - The purpose of the SNUD
  processor is twofold; 1) to allow for modular processing and, 2) to provide restart points.
  NGV243 will examine the inbound SNUD data images and will perform the following
  functions:
     16.4.56.1. Pass those SNUD images with or without an effective date to pseudo for
     processing.
     16.4.56.2. Examine SNUD data images with an effective date. If the effective date is
     equal to or less than 002-ORDINAL-DATE, then these images will be passed to pseudo
     for processing. If the effective date is greater than the current 002-ORDINAL-DATE
     then these images will be written to the SIFS SNUD IMAGE record (729). This process
     will be repeated until all SNUD data have been processed.
  16.4.57. NGV244. SIFS CUD FILE MULTIPLE ENTRY PROCESSOR - Allows users to
  add, change, or delete SIFS routing information on all outbound batch programs. The CUD-

  16.7.20. NGV625. Receipts processes a receipt input. It updates the balances in the
  appropriate item records, and either updates or deletes a due-in detail record and the
  appropriate status detail records. On funded current and prior year receipts, a received but
  not billed detail record is created for the amount not yet billed after the funds availability
  check has been made. On prior-year receipts, No Received But Not Billed Detail Record is
  created, but a management notice is printed. It provides the applicable FMIC and FIA codes
  for transaction histories received but not billed detail, and updated item record. Transaction
  histories are also written for any delete or decrease of Received-But-Not-Billed detail or
  Status-Local-Purchase detail records.
  16.7.21. NGV626. Receipts Continued continues the receipt process from the initial receipt
  program NGV625. Program NGV626 writes previously created transaction histories to the
  transaction history area. This program builds the DIFM unserviceable detail record when
  appropriate and creates PTC, 1RA, TKO and/or 1SH images as necessary. The routing
  identifier, item record, due-out detail and due-in detail records are updated by this program.
  The program also prints action notices that direct further processing of property received.
  Note: The program has not been modified to stop producing the PTC; however, bases have
  been instructed (via RAPCOM) to cease creating the PTC, by removing the “Pipeline Time
  Card Flag” from the Routing Identifier Record.
  16.7.22. NGV627. Turn-In Supplies processes all expendable item turn-in(s) and equipment

  back order, or pass the requisition to the original source.
  16.7.28. NGV635. Shipment Analysis provides for directed shipments, non-directed
  shipments, and the processing of selected related inputs.                  Inputs consist of
  distribution/referral orders, lateral support, automatic returns, and receipt acknowledgment
  follow-ups. Edits are performed on the input data elements to determine if the transaction
  will process.
  16.7.29. NGV636. Shipment, Non-Directed completes processing on SHP inputs. The edits
  consist of document number and supplementary address. On inputs with a blank
  supplementary address, a check is made for shipment override record or a shipment
  destination code on the repair cycle record. It also produces appropriate documents and
  creates various images as output responses.
  16.7.30. NGV637. Shipment, Redistribution Order and Image Processing processes
  document identifier codes A2(x) A4(x). The input priority, document number, and condition
  code are used in determining the maximum quantity to be shipped. If the requested stock
  number is not available for redistribution of serviceable assets, interchangeable stock
  numbers are screened for availability. When MSK and/or supply point details exist, another
  asset notice is produced in preference to a denial (B7x) if input quantity cannot be shipped
  from serviceable balance. If the requested item or interchangeable item is not available on
  either the item record or supply point detail, denial images B7(x) are produced for
  transmission to the applicable inventory managers. Input of an RDO for unserviceable items
  only screens the input stock number, and if not available, prepares B7(x) denial action. If the
  item is available, a DD Form 1348-1A is produced on the appropriate warehouse terminal
  and a transaction history created for the item record decrease. The repair cycle record is
  updated, if applicable.
